<p><strong>Letter of support to: ADVISORY COUNCIL ON ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, CARE AND SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>I am the proud mother of Mr. DavidTringo. David is at your meeting today in person representing our family. It is hard to believe that 42 years ago I had David as a 20 year old young lady and was forced immediately to make a decision the Doctor posed; "we can have Willow Brook here in ten minutes-do you want to keep the baby?" I simply asked if he can cry when he is hungry and love me? The doctor said yes; and we went home.</p>
<p><em>February 3, 2014 Federal NAPA Advisory Committee Approves Recommendation 13</em></p>
<p><strong>I am writing to thank all of you for your courageous decision on February 3, 2014 approving Recommendation 13:</strong></p>
<p><em>HHS AND STATE LEAD ENTITIES SHOULD PARTNERTO ASSURE ACCESS TO THE EULL ARRAY OE LTSS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OE PEOPLE WITH AD INCLUDING YOUNGER PEOPLE.NON-TRADITIONAL FAMILIES.PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUALDISABILITIES. SUCH AS DOWN SYNDROME. AND RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK OE ACQUIRING AD.</em></p>
<p><em>MY LIEELONC BURDEN OE CARE</em></p>
<p>For the past 42 years, I have not taken a vacation feeling it is my responsibility to always be by David's side providing his lifelong care. The early onset of dementia is almost too much to endure after providing lifelong care with fierce advocacy and now the accelerated pace of AD with Down syndrome. Preparing for this late battle with this insidious disease in David's life is especially painful since I just buried my Mom and Dad with Alzheimer's disease. I noticed the similar symptoms with David similar to my Parents but Doctors could not confirm the symptoms.</p>
<p><em>Erin Long is simply the best</em></p>
<p>Our Lucan us Center executive director traveled to Washington D.C. on February 3, 2014 and provided public testimony with National Chair Dr. Janicki. Upon returningto Florida, we were all very excited about the promising news to prepare a high quality dementia capable system for our children that was centered on our family. Our Florida Dementia Capable Model gives the funding to dementia care coordinators that create the dementia care plan together with the family.</p>
<p>During our newly created caregiver support groups focused on the death of our child Dr. Buckley kept mentioning Ms. Erin Long and Kate Gordon guiding our specialized dementia capable system. Dr. Buckley would comment on their incredible knowledge, passion and always speaking and seeking our solutions and not simply restating the problem or their solutions within the aging world.</p>
<p>On April 30, 2015 Ms. Erin Long came to Florida and attended the NTG/Lucanus unveiling of the NTG formal curriculum. Ms. Erin Long is an incredible young lady with a heart of gold that spoke of her family member experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She listened to aging caregivers and one in particular sticks in my mind. A father told of scolding his daughter and being so frustrated after APO and her behavior specialist said she needs to control her behavior and the parents need to set stricter rules.</p>
<p>The Father then said that everything she is doing is consistent with her recent diagnosis Alzheimer's disease and now he feels so guilty listening to behavior specialist knowing his daughter had no control of the behavior symptoms. Ms. Erin Long has taken our hopes and dreams for families to create person/family specialized dementia plans and made this a reality that all families deserve. We all speak of Erin and Kate often and acknowledge with a smile they are simply the best and listened to our every wish.</p>
<p>Your support of the Lucan us Center has changed the lives for thousands. David is fully engaged in all Healthy Brain activities and both David and I just sang together as Sonny and Cher in a local talent search. I truly believe David going to Lucan us and adherence to Healthy Brain principles is the reason he is so sharp and active today.</p>
<p>Thank you for creating Alzheimer's respite and now my husband and I took our first vacation in over 42 years to Charleston, SC. David had only vacationed with my husband and I for the past 42 years. David chose to go with his other family, the Buckley's. Tom and Kathy took David to New York City for 5 days and then to Tallahassee advocatingfor families with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. David had a wonderful time with his other "Mom and Dad' and really enjoyed advocating for others in need.</p>
<p>As a Mom, I could never thank you for all you have done for David and our family facing thisinsidious disease. It is hard to believe that just a few months ago our <strong>hopes and dreams were crushed when the local Alzheimer's Disability Resource Center chose not to provide Alzheimer's supports to people with Down syndrome after repeated request. The Lucanus Center and family's partnered with Florida SenatorSobel to sponsor the Florida legislature creating the Alzheimer's pilot for Intellectual Disabilities and Down syndrome. The Florida legislature 2015 appropriated $100,000 to the Lucanus center to create the Florida Alzheimer's waiver for intellectual disabilities and specifically Down syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On behalf of all families in South Florida with a family member with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, we are grateful for your leadership and your incredible ambassador of hope Erin Long. We vow to continue working endless hours until all Americans with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's along with their aging care giver are provided with high quality person centered dementia services and supports.</strong></p>

<p>Good afternoon and thank you for your time today. My name is Grace Whiting and I am the Director of Strategic Partnerships at the National Alliance for Caregiving. The Alliance is a national non-profit organization dedicated to the mission of advancing family caregiving through research, innovation, and advocacy. By way of introduction to the new members of this body, we have over 40 national and multinational organizations in our membership, including four federal agencies and both not-for-profit and corporate organizations.</p>
<p>Together, we firmly believe that if our society is to rely on family caregivers to provide long-term care, then it is our duty to provide support for family caregivers -- at home, within models of healthcare delivery, in the workplace, and in the workplace. To that end, there are three comments I'd like to make today.</p>
<p>First, I would encourage you to consider international perspectives through your work on this council. As Secretariat of the International Alliance of CarerOrganizations, the Alliance often learns about new models of support for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias. These models offer insight into how we can better support families in the United States who are managing this terrible disease.</p>
<p>For example, Scotland's "Focus on Dementia" model provides a meaningful framework for integrating a diagnosis for dementia into care and support. The Focus on Dementia model creates a "hub" for the patient and family to navigate the challenges of the disease. The hub has eight domains, including: a Dementia Practice Coordinator; therapeutic interventions; general health care; mental health care; environmental adaptations; community connections and engagement; personalized support; and support for caregivers. Diagnosis operates as a touchpoint to refer the individual with dementia to the Dementia Practice Coordinator, and it allows both that individual and their caregiver to become eligible for services. As many of these services are government-provided, there is data captured on both the caregiver and the care recipient (or patient) that can address the effectiveness of the support provided and received.</p>
<p>The Scotland model reminds us that diagnosis can serve as launching point for referral to information, resources, and caregiver supports. While our long-term care system is not as robust, there are existing community, private, and government resources that could help the newly diagnosed. For example, diagnosis could activate referrals to: disease-specific advocacy organizations; information about the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Lifespan Respite program; or information about family and medical leave or other workplace supports.</p>
<p>To the larger point at hand, Scotland's Focus on Dementia is an example of what we could learn from other nations. Groups like the Global CEO Initiative, the Global Dementia Framework, and caregiving groups like the International Alliance of Carers Organizations can offer insight into the issues this council is currently wrestling with.</p>
<p>Second, I would encourage the council to prioritize a national Care and Support Summit. It has been acknowledged by academic experts and drug innovators alike that we are still many years from a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's and dementia. While we work towards research that will improve our future, there remains unmet needs now. Please remember the needs of families who are caring for individuals with dementia in our midst and the costs inherent in their contribution such as lost income, foregone retirement, and worsened health.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to join the Alliance and the Alzheimer's Foundation of America in an ongoing social media discussion during November on brain health and brain screenings. #TalkBrainHealth is an educational campaign to encourage family caregivers to talk with their families about brain screenings for older adults over the holiday season. We will be sharing a one pager that can be used as "talking points" for caregivers of older adults to discuss brain health and the role of screenings, which draws from key resources like the Institute of Medicine report on cognitive aging. More information is available at <a href="http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth">http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth</a> or you can find us on Twitter at #TalkBrainHealth.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time and for your continued commitment to the people and families living with dementia.</p>

<p>Thanks and have a good weekend!</p>

<p>There is much to praise and to be grateful for in the 2015 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to Secretary Burwell, Assistant Secretary Frank, Deputy Assistant Secretary Elam for their leadership on the plan and the impressive progress that has been made since 2011 in all areas.</p>
<p>Calls for additional investment in Alzheimer's disease research and care have been a consistent theme in the 3.5 years since the National Alzheimer's Project Act was implemented. The 25% increase in AD research funding at the NIH since 2011 is significant and appreciated.</p>
<p>A larger issue that we've been discussing around NIH funding prioritization is for NIH to consider costs to public healthcare programs (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid) as part of its prioritization for research investment in specific conditions. Economic burden on public healthcare programs is <strong>not</strong> currently considered as part of the existing strategic planning process at NIH. An April 2014 GAO [<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246">http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246</a>] study found that the five selected ICs--awarding the largest amount of research funding--that it reviewed did so considering similar factors and using various priority-setting approaches. In priority setting, IC officials reported taking into consideration scientific needs and opportunities, gaps in funded research, the burden of disease in a population, and public health need, such as an emerging public health threat like influenza that needs to be addressed. Those are all very valid and important considerations, but we would argue that costs to healthcare programs should also be a part of the research funding prioritization equation.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone here to take up this issue as part of the request for comment to the NIH-wide Strategic Plan by August 16, and I would ask that ASPE provide the RFI and instructions on how to submit comments at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I want to call everyone's attention to the report FDA released about a week ago called "Targeted Drug Development: Why are Many Diseases Lagging Behind?" that specifically points to the scientific challenges that are thwarting drug development in complex diseases. Alzheimer's is one disease they mentioned <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm">http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm</a>. The piece basically say FDA is doing all it can but they need more science: "Like many other diseases of the brain, Alzheimer's illustrates the obstacles to development of biomarkers and targeted drugs when scientific research has not yet uncovered the underlying causes or pathways of a disease." It is sobering report, but very much on point and we look forward to exploring these issues further with the Neurology Review division at our September 16 ACT-AD meeting.</p>
<p>I was excited to see the reference to "expansion and enhancement" of Lifespan Respite Care in the plan as well as the regulatory review of adult day services. Both respite and adult day services are incredibly important aspects of family caregiver support that may reduce or delay institutionalization among individuals with dementia. While the initial work has been promising, these programs need much wider support and coverage in order to meet the huge demand.</p>
<p>I want to say a more specific word about the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer Caregiver Health (REACH) program. Believe it or not, this program was first funded by the NIA and NINR in 1995--20 years ago. There has been a REACH I study and a sequel, REACH II. It has been a VA-wide program since 2011 and AoA has also funded REACH programs throughout the country. Findings from the REACH studies showed improvements across many areas. Caregivers reported less "burden" and depression, and improved emotional well-being overall. They also reported gains in the areas of self-care and healthy behaviors, social support, and management of problem behaviors on the part of their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. Plus, they gained an hour a day of time that was not consumed with caregiving duties.</p>
<p>While expanding REACH to Indian Country is another great step for this awesome program, I am wondering why HHS has not yet taken the step of making this a CMMI model program, or better yet, just going for it and implementing REACH CMS-wide. How many more years do folks have to wait?</p>
<p>Last, it is terrific that HHS is refreshing the Alzheimer.gov website. Two things I noticed: 1) it takes several clicks to get to specific info on research studies. It would be great if this could be more streamlined and if folks could access it more directly from the home page with a "find out about research studies in your area" subhead.</p>
<p>And 2) the tagline for the site- "alzheimers.gov- for the people helping people with Alzheimer's" seems to unintentionally overlook individuals with the disease, as well as others who may know someone dealing with it, or just want to learn about it. I'd love to see another tagline that invites everyone in. The community needs it, and it's getting bigger and bigger every day.</p>

<p>My mom fell yesterday and shattered/dislocated her shoulder, requiring surgery later today. I am working from home to be available to my mom and stepdad for updates and to help advocate as needed.</p>
<p>So, I won't be there in person to make a public comment. If possible, please read my comment, which is pasted below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comment by Sue Peschin, President and CEO, Alliance for Aging Research.</strong></p>
<p>I fully support the suggestion by Sheila Burke to move the time frame for National Plan recommendations back to October to give more time to the process. While HHS works hard to get the slides up, seeing them only two days before they are presented hardly provides enough time for thoughtful deliberation, let alone for council members to vote on recommendations that will potentially affect millions of Americans.</p>
<p><strong>On the Long-term services and supports subcommittee recommendations</strong>:<br />
					The LTSS recommendations are way too general and provide no benchmarks for which agency should specifically execute which task, what the timing of each task should be, or how much federal and/or private funding may be needed. For example, one of the recommendations states that HHS should support state initiatives for dementia-capable systems by "Providing coordinated Alzheimer's disease related activities across state agencies through an identified state lead entity with adequate funding from Congress." What activities should they coordinate? Though which agencies? What would "adequate funding from Congress" mean? The CMS recommendations in particular have tremendous potential but they are not properly mapped out. For example, what needs to happen for CMS to allow for care planning when the patients isn't there--do we need a new code for providers to have time to counsel/train family or is there an existing code that could be expanded?</p>
<p>Big kudos for #5 that calls on Congress to fund the recommendations and even mentions an amount for one of them.Please add the Lifespan Respite Program to calls for funding the ADSSP and NFCSP programs. Estimates for these can be found in the authorizing language and/or with caregiving groups.</p>
<p><strong>On the advanced dementia work</strong>:<br />
					This work is very impressive and so important. My only comment here is that this community, knowing what we know about Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, has something very important to say to policymakers about the value of giving people with serious illness the freedom to make more informed choices about their care, and the power to have those choices honored. So, whether we might support The Care Planning Act, introduced by Senators Isakson and Warner, and/or the Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act, introduced by Senators Collins and Rockefeller--we should include a bold step here that advanced care planning needs to start sooner, along with the patient's healthcare professionals, and it should be covered by Medicare and Medicaid. A lot of complications of care mentioned here could be avoided if more folks had a plan. So, please consider including a bigger picture policy recommendation to help support all of the other great recommendations you suggest.</p>
<p><strong>On clinical care</strong>:<br />
					A while back, Helen LaMont asked the question about whether HHS should consider creating a public education campaign about recognizing cognitive impairment and getting checked out. It would be great to see something in the 2015 Plan about engaging CMS and CDC in a campaign to encourage providers to look for it as part of the Wellness Visit, and for families to flag problems. The Wellness visit has been in existence for 4 years now and very little to nothing has been done to take advantage of it and get more folks identified. If we said 50 percent of people with CVD were missed by clinicians each year, heart groups would hit the roof.</p>
<p><strong>On research</strong>:<br />
					It's wonderful that you included a request. Policymakers want to know how much these dementia diseases cost for research, clinical care, and long-term care. The professional judgment budget happened because feds from NIH would not provide members of Congress with a straight answer about how much was needed.</p>
<p>ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED. BE BOLD AND BE SPECIFIC. LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING!</p>
<p>No worries if it cannot be read. I hope all goes well with the meeting and that you all stay warm and safe today.</p>

<p>I have attached my October 2013 fifteen page response to the Florida Purple Ribbon Task Force's recommendations. In so doing, I apologize in advance for the quality. Post ADRD estate resolution after 10 years of full time care of a level 6, I went through three bilateral reconstructive surgeries with post op complications resulting in over two years restricted mobility. I had hoped to assemble a more comprehensive document reflecting the needs of the hundreds of caretakers I have communicated with over the years and testify at federal and state hearings on the issues raised in this document but was not able to walk/drive until a few months ago.</p>
<p>We had a triple dose of ADRD in our extended family. As such, all of your efforts to find a cure are deeply appreciated.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Response to 2013 Florida Purple Ribbon Task Force Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I have reviewed the Purple Ribbon Task Force Report and the survey. I don't agree with the approach, recommendations or the data and underlying assumptions forming the basis of same. I was particularly concerned with the failure to address abusive practices, systemic industry reform, and secondary impact. After repeated review of this document, I arrived at the conclusion that proposals were no more than plugged holes in a dike with the damn about to burst.</p>
<p>ADRD is a global health crisis of frightening proportion. It is a vicious and insidious disease with debilitating economic, psychological and physical consequences extending far beyond the directly afflicted. This Task Force had the unprecedented privilege to not only place Florida in a national leadership role in addressing and responding to an international humanitarian medical crisis but to shine a light of hope in a very dark place for millions of elderly and their families. Your response was insular and short sighted. It will cripple this state.</p>
<p>First, it was my understanding that the impetus for Task Force creation was the 2011 Miami Herald investigative report series, "Neglected to Death", the focus of which was facility abuse of elderly, particularly ADRD, and state regulatory oversight. It is simply unforgivable and irresponsible that this emergent and heartbreaking crisis as to the elderly in general, and ADRD in particular, was not met with regulatory reform, expanded enforcement and financial/criminal sanctions for this conduct.</p>
<p>Not only was this not addressed but, amazingly, a statement was made that placement of small groups of ADRD elderly in homes was the best solution. I have serious concerns over the justification for this conclusory remark as to ADRD and the source's understanding of disease impact. These homes are not subject to regulatory oversight and are thus a prime target for incompetent coverage and abusive practices. (I thought it was illegal for professionals to recommend unlicensed facilities.) ADRD are not able to articulate their needs, complain, or ask for help under the best circumstances. Removing a layer of government protection, however remote, is ill advised and careless. Even in a facility, this concept of small groups, dating back to the early 90's, struggles because success was predicated on an interdisciplinary team approach which does not exist.</p>
<p>Second, public policy and elder service delivery has fallen prey to an out of control, self serving, self perpetuating and self aggrandizing provider controlled industry dedicated to achieving maximum profit with minimal overhead. Often owners and investors are outside the state or international. Profiteers want a piece of the elderly and layer by layer, they take it. Owners can run a 30% profit level on a facility or HHC business. The best way to evaluate this, outside SEC, IPO or tax filing, is to look at listings or private offering representations of gross revenues and owner benefit. After a few are open, whether or not an IPO is filed or ownership transfers, investors do expect continuation of the same return. Bare minimum revenues are directed toward elder services. The State does not benefit.</p>
<p>Truly outstanding health care professionals, including RN's, LPN's and CNA's suffer and eventually abandon direct service delivery because they cannot control the desired quality of their efforts. Caretakers suffer because they cannot insure that the safety, medical needs and quality of life of their loved one will be served and personally take on the burden. Elderly suffer because they are personally, physically and financially abused and victimized.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association Campaign for Quality Residential Care: Dementia Care Practices Recommendations for Assisted Living Residences and Nursing Homes is a valuable reference. It conditions successful implementation of recommendations on having a sufficient number of appropriately trained staff. This is not evident in practice, was not translated to statutory or regulatory obligation by the Task Force and should be immediately addressed before additional elderly are harmed.</p>
<p>Many families could have paid the $120,000 annual fee for SNF care and continued with their lives. Most don't make that election because the ADRD were repeatedly injured when attempts were made, that avenue was closed to ADRD by the provider, or only made available with doping and/or a 24/7 aide. ALF's are simply out of the question because, in most cases, they can't meet the base medical needs and life quality for non ADRD elderly. ADRD shares the same expected medical and ADL needs normally attendant to aging and many cognitive challenges are based on failure to responsibly meet these needs.</p>
<p>Florida AHCA and CMS deficiency reports and judicial filings, in the public domain and available for your review, reflect across the board abuses. Facilities are not safe and engage in abusive practices directly or by quality understaffing and neglect.</p>
<p>Third, the "aging in place" policy statement, particularly as to mid to upper level ADRD or sundowners is simply cruel and dysfunctional. It will economically destroy this State, families, and future generations because it not only fails to take into account the needs of the ADRD but fails to assess and quantify the secondary destructive personal and financial impact on families. As to the majority of elderly who live alone, it is life threatening. Norway parrots this approach in its 2015 report but, in the absence there of admission to SNF's without acute condition, has their own issues with death and injury by release of isolated non ADRD elderly to a home environment. I don't understand the policy advocate's underlying motivation. Is it an HHC profit oriented response, a mathematically challenged but otherwise well meaning individual, or someone who desperately needs a reality check as to disease manifestation at the mid to upper levels?</p>
<p>I don't know your proposal for single ADRD, particularly those homeless without financial resources, when SNF Medicaid beds are scarce and selectively reserved for non ADRD. I do know that elderly spouses can't handle ADRD. They have their own needs and are often continuously and irrationally verbally and physically abused. It is just too much. Most look to divorce to avoid ADRD caretaking, simply leave or predecease the ADRD. At some point, children, if there are any and if they care, have to gratuitously assume this full time obligation.</p>
<p>In December 2012, the New York Times, after a comparative international review of efforts in this area concluded</p>
<blockquote><p>"Is care at home for patients with Alzheimer's necessarily more humane? Only if caregivers have the resources -- financial, physical and emotional -- to handle this draining, exhausting, immeasurably difficult job. And only if the institutions that serve people with more advanced forms of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are so poorly financed, staffed and operated that we wouldn't feel comfortable leaving loved ones in their care….</p>
<p>Anyone who's followed reader response to <strong>Jane Brody's column</strong> this week on aging in place knows the burden that this can place on families, especially if government support for home-based services (companions or home health aides who help with bathing, dressing, toileting and other tasks), adult day care or respite care is scarce or nonexistent, as is the case for most middle-class families in the United States. …</p>
<p>Other countries with which the United States is closely aligned have embraced long-term care as an essential social responsibility while we have not. Unless and until we do so, caregivers here will be among the most harried, stressed and burdened among wealthy, developed countries in the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children caretakers are former attorneys, architects, doctors, engineers, technology and security consultants, teachers, industry executives, police, prosecutors, university professors, fire, health care professionals etc. No profession is excluded. The reason why we are "former" is because, in the absence of essential industry facility reform, regulation and enforcement, there is no responsible choice.</p>
<p>These caretakers are comprised of both sexes, cross party lines, and are frustrated, not simply because control over their own economic, professional and personal future has been taken out of their hands by small time industry profiteers, but with the fact that the quality of the lives of their ADRD loved ones could have been immeasurably improved if safe, quality facilities existed.</p>
<p><strong>Our economic loss and that of our families is Florida's current loss and future burden. Caretakers, professionally and financially, were critical contributors to Florida's economy. We bought and provided goods and services. We contributed to the community. We saved money for our children's education and our future through 401K's. We preserved our health. Now, as caretakers, we do not engage in any of these efforts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A new classification of poverty has been created which is "intergenerationally" contagious to join the current ADRD unserved homeless population. Put another way, at the end of the caretaking period, which can exceed a decade, our resources have been depleted, we might have MCI, ADRD or a physically debilitating condition, we don't qualify for SS disability or unemployment since we have not contributed, and there may not be family to provide care. 50% of the future generation will be ADRD caretaking. Grandchildren want to know whether to invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart. How do we respond based on your plan? </strong></p>
<p>ADC does not help the ADRD if continuous doping is used to protect other participants from sporadic bouts of agitation occasioned by infection or alienation of environment. ADC does not help if the home caretaker works and the disease manifests itself at night by sundowning, whether or not the ADRD is otherwise normal to easily manageable during the day and particularly considering the lives of children and their schooling. Segregating all ADRD to one ADC but intermingling levels is traumatic for the lower levels that retain some sense of self, daily facing their possible future particularly if operations are not individually medical and cognitive need responsive. ADC is one entity depending on staffing which might not realize the profit level of facilities, if any, depending on quality of service.</p>
<p>With HHC, demand exceeds quality supply for elderly in general. The usual bare minimum wage does not otherwise attract quality applicants particularly if a non ADRD position opens. Occasionally, through internal networking, as opposed to HHC agencies, a miracle occurs but it is usually short lived. Unqualified HHC pose a danger to the patient. Again, this is a complex disease. It varies in form and manifestation and can change without notice. It requires an interdisciplinary team effort focused on the ADRD.</p>
<p>Last survey, 25% of ADRD caretakers repeatedly engaged in suicide ideation. 10% engaged in it after the protracted caretaking period was over. Individuals personally advised of this diagnosis contemplate suicide because they don't want it for themselves or the burden they have already experienced for their children. Absent reform, this will continue.</p>
<p>We want the lives of our ADRD loved ones immeasurably improved in a properly staffed safe and secure environment conducive to their special needs and enriched with advanced cognitive or sensory stimulation like a Snoezalen room, interactive games and activities, supported by responsible, dedicated, trained and educated interdisciplinary professionals who care that ADRD and their medical needs are attended to without chemical or physical restraints and promote level appropriate company of friends. We want them to enjoy their life as it reaches its conclusion, to be protected from abuse in all its forms, and to have a choice in the manner in which quality care is provided.</p>
<p>Reports like this have repeatedly issued over the past 15 years. They are always well written, there is always a survey eliciting information which has been in the public domain for so long, judicial notice would be taken of the conclusions without need for evidentiary support. They define the disease, introduce impact and demographic review analysis and recommend research, education, awareness campaigns of whatever kind, some legislative public pronouncement of caring, and reinforce support for research to find a cure through another commission or office. Occasionally ADRD are thrown a bone through subsidy of providers whose conduct is the basis for complaint. Operational regulatory reform is never addressed because tasks forces are controlled by the entities which should be regulated. Scientists never receive sufficient direct funding. Elderly ADRD never receive the services they need because critical issues are never addressed. One frustrated attorney caretaker made a remark that such reports all be filed away under the category "don't ever do this again".</p>
<p>The following provides limited comment on your report, including your needs analysis, rejects historically structured commissions and task forces, introduces issues not covered but with the focus on necessary reform, and presents recommendations and comments assimilated over the years from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals including doctors, RN's, and CNA's with prior industry affiliation. The goal is to accomplish reform and proceed in a new direction without state financial stress.</p>
<p>There is a two part solution.</p>
<p><strong>First, clean up existing operations though regulatory reform outlined below more specifically, particularly focusing on increasing staffing and quality control, and take out the trash. Set up sufficiently harsh fines and sanctions individually and by facility to insure that abuses will not continue and to support enforcement in cases of repeat violations. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Second, set up a revolving account for seed monies and loan guarantees, including interest subsidies for infrastructure/development, consolidate IDG and other state and federal resources to support nonprofit operation of multilayer extensive campus developments, sufficiently attractive to entice those amply able to pay for residency, including high level medical care, cognitive services and activities to improve quality of life. Attach it to a university for memory disorder service (like John Hopkins Copper Ridge) independent medical oversight and student involvement. By eliminating owner benefit, the 30% differential may also be applied to cover those unable to pay but in need of services. The goal is a physically and financially self sustaining campus, where no one is turned away. </strong></p>
<p>In other word, change the conception of aging from a depressing environment to one where spouses without ADRD can live and regularly visit their loved ones happy in the knowledge that their needs are addressed in a positive way while they pursue their own interests. Change the attitude of staff towards their role, change the name to a university concept with individual neighborhoods/dormitories, and make it an interactive campus and a wonderful place to be. Instead of being the country that can't get it together in terms of aging and ADRD, let the United States be a leader.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD Population and Needs Assessment </strong></p>
<p>Data challenges based on elevation of presentation form over substance consist of the following:</p>
<p>First, in order to presumably substantiate policy recommendations, the Task Force had a survey. The survey structure was borrowed from, I believe, Oregon, despite the wealth of talent in this state and the issue intimacy of highly educated resident professionals. The survey was not publicized and was open for a period of about two weeks on a site not regularly visited. As to ADRD and family caregivers, the response was so insignificant that no responsible economist would have publicized the survey results much less used it as a basis for defining issues because it lacks statistical integrity. It otherwise substantively failed because the primary focus was asking questions which supported a provider private pay response, not otherwise responsive to ADRD needs.</p>
<p>Second, there is a concern that the base from which linear projections have been made as to the number of ADRD in Florida is not valid and existing and future service delivery needs estimation will suffer. The Rush CHAP's report has routinely been used nationally. The base for this report was an older population on the south side of Chicago and early onset, to the best of my recollection, was not taken into consideration. Over time, studies have repeatedly made extrapolations applied to census, disease incident reports and other variables using this baseline. I would suggest that this may not result in statistically significant results as to, at least, Florida and California.</p>
<p>Third, I also question whether projections should be linear. These numbers do not take into consideration the possible contagion factor by example but not limitation, prion scabie migration, infection and replication (if a causation) not prevented through traditional surgical sterilization methods, the impact of surgical inhalational analgesics as a contributing factor in neurotoxicity/dementia, and the rising incidence of vascular dementia, all of which would suggest an exponential as opposed to linear projection approach.</p>
<p>Fourth, ADRD is a primarily a hidden population. Death certificates rarely report ADRD as a cause of death because other health factors intervene before the afflicted reaches the terminal stages of the disease. Inferring from presentation of county cause of death statistics that ADRD may be quantified in this manner is improper.</p>
<p>Establishing a form of reporting of this disease to more closely define the scope of the problem, particularly in a state which bears a substantially disproportionate share of the ADRD population might be helpful. I don't understand why Florida has an issue with doing, on first impression, a more statistically significant analysis and quantification. Inquiry through residential property tax billing with pass through to non owner occupants was suggested as one way, without incurring significant cost and more closely reflective of county/local needs, to solicit this information. As a secondary benefit, it would also be a way to publicize the brain bank, obtain dedication and encourage, at the early ADRD stages, assembly of diagnostic and cognitive history to accompany donations in furtherance of research.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Disease Advisory Committee </strong></p>
<p>There is a critical and urgent need for provider industry reform, particularly staffing of facilities, as to the elderly in general and a complete reorientation and restructuring of approach as to ADRD. The Task Force declined to address reform. The responsibility for the future of ADRD was left to the industry dominated Alzheimer Disease Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The constituency, if you will, is the elderly, particularly the 30% or more ADRD elderly and growing proportion of early onset afflicted with ADRD. Yet repeatedly over time, attention is directed, not to the needs of this population, but to the interests of service providers.</p>
<p>When you have a regulatory structure controlled by the regulated through Committee participation or otherwise, evidenced by policy encouraging direct provider benefit through subsidy or oversight avoidance, you have a form of indirect and constitutionally prohibited entrenched special interests influence. It is a little like stepping in quicksand. Once you have lost your way, you are pulled deeper and deeper into the quagmire of minutia driven situational response from which it is impossible to extricate yourself no matter how well meaning your efforts. Your Baker Act justification and analysis is a good example. Proposed respite care funding is another. Underlying all of this is the complete destruction of all hope of responsible choice to caretakers and quality of care for the ADRD as a matter of Florida public policy.</p>
<p>The Committee contains representatives of the assisted living, home health care, hospital and pharmacy industries. They should be removed and replaced by individuals who do not have financial ties by investment, ownership or employment with a provider. Preferential composition, given the enormity of issues, should be given to a retired judge, Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, an economist, attorneys, prosecutors, nurses associations and legislative representatives who are all able to ask the essential questions and perform investigations without challenge to neutrality.</p>
<p>This is not a personal or professional criticism of any of the individuals involved. I don't know them. It is simply that, as a matter of public policy, no industry should be in a position to control, influence or otherwise make policy which regulates its conduct or in which it might directly or indirectly receive a financial benefit. It is a conflict of interest. Industry input is important but not in this way.</p>
<p>You should seek an opinion from the State Attorney General's office on this matter. At minimum, participation creates an appearance of impropriety which could directly or by inference undermine the integrity of efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Elder Affairs. </strong></p>
<p>I was legislative liaison for a State Department many years ago for Aging, Housing, Local Government, MFA, HFA etc.. Back them we had floor privileges in both houses so information exchange was ongoing. No bipartisan disputes attached to any elder issues. During that time, the legislature passed protective measures like the uniform construction code, planned real estate development full disclosure, nursing home patient's rights and a full range of elder services directly or through state matching funds for federal programs with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>When money did not exist for requests that were truly beyond any realistic appropriation expectation, we found a source. For example, when we wanted to fund pharmaceutical assistance for the elderly on the state level, we attached it to the gaming referendum for revenue dedication. When we needed a design/materials/best practices for affordable housing, we did not pay someone to do it, we went to a television network and announced a contest.</p>
<p>As to the Department of the Elderly, I noticed you contracted with an entity to provide design or whatever development plans for a LTC. I did not see the specifications you put out for bidding on this so I can't comment. Facility design and building specs information are easily internet available. I believe the University of Florida already built one of the original Smart Houses and green facility construction is a fact of life as are sustainable communities internationally. (Germany apparently has an entire town self sustaining.)</p>
<p>You might consider publicity, through contests, as a major motivating factor for free design concepts without financially obligating the State. You receive more truly exciting and innovative solutions en masse and if you integrate it with interdisciplinary considerations from technology, security, surveillance, assistive devices, to artificial intelligence and sensory input, entertainment, activities and acute care advanced equipment, with building considerations, you might get past an extended stay design with a pacing circle. Finally, design concepts which integrate isolated small groups are physically and personally dangerous to the welfare of residents unless and until adequate quality staffing with oversight is mandated and aggressively enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Industry Reform </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of these recommendations following is to make facility owners start taking issues concerning elderly seriously because the State of Florida finally does. If it takes sanctions, penalties and other costs as well as license disciplinary/revocation as to staff and owner/facility, so be it. The conduct is wrongful and someone should start caring before injurious results are out of control. Further if conduct would have been criminal outside the walls of a facility, including accessory before and after the fact in cover up, it is time to recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was Director of Licensing engaged in casino development at a time when State regulation over construction, all casino and hotel operations and employees was intense. When a facility or operations are heavily scrutinized and fined for misadventure, a higher level of conduct emerges.</p>
<p>The following, from professionals in the field, is exemplary but certainly not exclusive. It does not but should address hospital failure to have in house coverage of ADRD fall risks or wanderers. Caretakers, particularly the sandwich generation who work or have dual elderly/family responsibility and are without funds, cannot sit for 24/7 with a hospitalized ADRD. Some hospitals let an aide do coverage for a group of 2-4. This is extremely helpful and reduces hospital liability risk.</p>
<p>Ownership and Management<br />
					Prequalify, through a 4 way investigation and license owners, investors and management. Educational, experiential and training prerequisites are currently insufficient and should be strengthened. (in Florida you only need high school to operate an ALF) There is precedent for this in NJ's gaming industry and other sensitive fields. We need to start treating the needs of our elderly as critically.</p>
<p>Staffing<br />
					Identify the nature, function and specializations of interdisciplinary staff dealing with ADRD. Increase minimum per patient staffing ratio per shift with specification of their qualifications for dealing with cognitive challenged particularly at night. Background investigations, qualifications and training of staff need to be expanded and reassessed.</p>
<p>Economic Fines and Sanctions<br />
					Continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly.</p>
<p>Staff and Owner Liability for Violations<br />
					Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same.</p>
<p>Facility Compliance Repeat Violations<br />
					Federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity over extensive or repeat offenders should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>Criminal Liability<br />
					Assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse should be treated through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, in the same way it would be treated if outside the facility. Staff who participated in or were aware of the offensive conduct and failed to report same should be similarly charged. Inception of any such investigation and criminal proceeding or license sanction or revocation hearing, should be communicated to all concerned federal and state authorities.</p>
<p>ALF and ADRD Care<br />
					ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated as a vehicle for ADRD care. It does not even meet the basic needs of elderly without ADRD and this should be addressed.</p>
<p>Doping<br />
					There is a need for explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off-label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>. There should not be an automatic presumption of physician competence in this area. (One psychiatrist had no knowledge of Lewy body dementia.) When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD.<br />
					Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF, if attendant medical issues, should be automatic to preclude doping. Facilities should have structured interventions and activities for ADRD which respond to their unique needs.</p>
<p>Financial Abuse<br />
					Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees should be mandatory.</p>
<p>Surveillance<br />
					Provision of distance web cams to permit HCS and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD should be provided. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates. Similarly female patients in understaffed facilities need to be protected against sexually aggressively ADRD men. The use of minimum wage employees in egregiously understaffed facilities particularly at night is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Fall Risk and Wandering Prevention/Notice to HCS<br />
					Remote notice of bed vacation through sensor monitoring technologies to staff to prevent fall risks and ADRD wandering at night prior to injury is critical. Absence of such protection resulting in death or serious injury has been the basis for substantial litigation. There further needs to be mandatory immediate notification to HCS of injury to patient and accurate record preservation of same.</p>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment<br />
					Staff and patients have been injured by lifting challenges. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese with long term chronic consequences. Patients are injured if mishandling occurs. This needs to be remedied.</p>
<p>Record Management/Interaction<br />
					HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>Ombudsman<br />
					There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HCS, POA and family of their options, including referral to prosecutor, counsel and a NAELA contact number, or availability of court mediation services as recommended herein. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
<p>Facility License Manipulation<br />
					There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenerational Support and Information Access </strong></p>
<p>The "intergenerational" approach suggested would make a nice Hallmark card but you have to deal with reality. It is not going to happen and with ADRD there is an issue as to whether, as to children, it should. There is a reason the ADRD caretaker community has the saying "There is always one" (who takes on the responsibility). Another way of putting it is "There is only one".</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned by sundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>In order to understand this, you have to get past the marketed mental picture of a sweet grandmother, mildly confused, smiling at a helpful grandchild. This is a fabrication along with an intact family unit working together when ADRD reaches the upper stages.</p>
<p>The ADRD are agitated, offensive, argumentative and occasionally violent with errant behavior predicated on infection, pain, boredom, frustration and fear. They will pace incessantly, wake you in the middle of the night pulling hair because they want to "go home" or because they think you stole the (deceased) spouse or (deceased) mother. They will get up repeatedly in the middle of the night to get dressed for school, stand by a window or door to protect the family all night and punch anyone who comes close. Alternatively, they just wander out the door. They bite, scratch, hit, and accuse anyone of stealing whatever is on their mind at the time. Then they might stop for a few weeks and just when you think things are good and you attempt to drop them off at ADC so you can get to work, they refuse to move. If you take them out, they can refuse to get out of the car for hours on end when they return since they don't recognize where they are. If they are a fall risk, the problem is worse since you have to follow them to protect them. They might go through a fear of water period for weeks or months. They will take things and hide them or take off their clothes in public. Men, usually, may act in a sexually aggressive way toward children or grandchildren because he thinks they are his wife. The challenges are endless. Children might want to help but the ADRD might not like them. Elderly might be able to handle the ADRD during the day but experience unbearable night challenges. (Perhaps there should be Adult Night Care.)</p>
<p>Whoever they were that you loved, as a spouse or a parent, only exists in decreasingly rare glimpses and disease ramifications have made them unknowable. Maybe they occasionally know you and maybe they just know your name. This can continue for 10-15 years.</p>
<p>Children can't and should not be exposed to this unnecessarily because they are not sufficiently mature to handle it. No one really is. Even adults struggle with being accused of something they never did or being hit when violence was never a part of their life. Why should children have to deal with it when the ADRD might not like having them around? Each case is different but the presented characteristics are common.</p>
<p>Family problems range from lack of cooperation to money and estate issues. I will address this in the section on mediation. However, the recommended approach is through professional ongoing interdisciplinary interaction where intergenerational support is gratuitous or not necessarily family related.</p>
<p>Caretakers are daily exposed to the ravages of this disease and are highly motivated. If a USF professor discovers that when the stress related protein FKBP51 partners with protein Hsp90 it contributes to tau toxicity, we want to find out more. If a student grandchild sees the disease progress, preferably infrequently, research becomes more interesting and an interest in biogenetics, psychiatry or neuroscience might emerge. In those cases, you will start to see intergenerational support in ways you never contemplated.</p>
<p>Research grants issue to the scientific community. (Caretakers become very annoyed when scientific research monies are redirected for any reason particularly industry self training.) Subsidized research finds its way into professional journals inaccessible to the general public except though subscription, per article payment or university affiliation. Accumulated costs to review research for interested caretakers and students coupled with the cost of distance viewing of conference presentations is collectively exorbitant, effectively denying the intended beneficiaries access. I believe the cost of the 2013 pharmaceutical industry report on international advances on Alzheimer's drugs is $1600. Yet they want us to participate in their trials. Journals cost about $37 an article. The Alzheimer's Organization charged $500+ to caretakers for internet viewing of conference proceedings though they exist by virtue of our ADRD.</p>
<p>This somewhat circuitous and incestuous proprietary orientation creates an informational glass ceiling caretakers and students can't afford to break through. Information actually conveyed is usually abstract in content although there are exceptions. NIH did permit free web cam access to the 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit. Some universities, like University of Miami, permit distance access, without charge, to cognitive training at a level sufficiently advanced to be of interest.</p>
<p>The State Library System could be engaged in concert with state universities to assist access. Alzheimer's national and international interdisciplinary publications on all matters from the scientific (journals on molecular biology, neuroscience, and biogenetics) to new forms of cognitive interventions are of interest along with conferences and lectures. Caretakers and students can get to the local library or access through Kindle etc.</p>
<p>Many caretakers are certified in their profession and/or have one or more doctorates. As to students, I believe it was a 15 year old that discovered an inexpensive strip test for a type of cancer a few years ago. One scientist who was participating in the UW "foldit" program of protein structure modeling, (available online to anyone desirous of participation in research) said that his high school son was much more proficient than he was. If you want student interest in this field and you want to help caretakers help their ADRD, respect their level of intelligence and open the door.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>I proposed a similar structure for an international Alzheimer's Center, under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation and in affiliation with the WHO, providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges. This would be an interesting project if Florida wanted to take on the challenge (and it could also incorporate facility design elements).</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services, Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation </strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage pre filing court mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p>This is particularly critical since caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Often, caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of Social Security disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble. The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker. At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits and are denied unemployment benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Practices and Non Profits </strong></p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>There are too many low rent operators in Florida, operating out of post office drop boxes and, through internet and other solicitation practices, holding themselves out as ADRD research or educational ventures without qualifications or staff. The underlying motivation is to non profit salary themselves by redirecting funds which should have gone to dedicated university and brain institute research scientists. In furtherance of the public trust which motivated the donation, it is time to take a closer look at the ventures legally permissible in this state and weed out the scams.</p>

<p>Re: Recommendations for a National Uniform Law Regulating Elder Facilities, Court PrefilingMediation of ADRD Family Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation, Amendment to the SSA on Caretaker Disability Entitlement and the establishment of a World Alzheimer's Institute</p>
<p>I have reviewed the NAPA Plan, as updated, and thank the Alzheimer's Organization for its awareness efforts. Consolidated informal comments and recommendations from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals follows. I thank NIH for its continuing publications on clinical trials and health related issues and the FDA for its oversight function and providing assistance to caretakers filing notices of clinical trial mismanagement. Specific recommendations fully within NAPA authority are contained at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who has been in the Alzheimer's trenches for fifteen years. We had a triple dose of this insidious disease in my extended family. I handled a level 6 case 24/7 for ten years. During this period and continuing post DOD, I remain committed to interdisciplinary research from the progression of clinical efforts to find a cure to identifying ways to improve the quality of life of those afflicted with Alzheimer's in the absence thereof. I retain an ongoing interest in the welfare of the hundreds of caretakers I have met over the years and concern with the inevitable ruinous impact of this disease on the next generation.</p>
<p>The industry report on AD entitled "<strong>Alzheimer's Drugs Market, 2012 - 2017</strong> was issued in May 2013. It is a comprehensive document which the extensive outline, (including mention of NAPA) clearly demonstrates with key objective to establish the likely evolution of leading drugs, generics and launch of new drugs across the different regions in the world. I watched the NIH sponsored Alzheimer'sDisease Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention in real time, paid particular attention to counsel and came away with no hope of cooperation for obvious proprietary legal intellectual property and economic reasons which are without the control of the NIH. In fact, it appears that the scope of any cooperation is extremely sensitive since even the appearance of infringement could result in litigation which holds up distribution of a viable curative pharmaceutical indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is some disappointment with a few NAPA initiatives perceived as a disservice to victims of ADRD without a voice who are pleading for protection and to the caretakers who give up everything to provide support.</p>
<p>I don't see the DOJ, the FDA or the IRS and United States Patent Office on your federal agency list? I don't see the ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA charged with a NAPA mandate to address legal issues in this area. Perhaps you need a broader resource base. Everyone wants to help.</p>
<p>As to the alzheimers.gov, you have a list of drugs on your site for ADRD care. The FDA has stated that certain drugs are contraindicated with elderly with dementia and are in fact life threatening. Would you please coordinate your representations with the FDA before another elderly person is seriously hurt? Regardless of the $100 million False Claims Act charges and sanctions against J&amp;J relating to Omnicare bribery, either these drugs are approved for use by the elderly ADRD or they are not. Clarification would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD population</strong></p>
<p>There is a concern that first, the base from which linear extrapolations have been made as to the number of ADRD is not statistically significant and existing and future service delivery needs will therefore be underestimated. We are not supporting the caretaker population, estimated at 25-30 million, directly or by providing adequate support for prevention of facility neglect and abuse so alternatives to home caretaking will be available.</p>
<p>What will the future hold for high school and college students who justifiably want to know whether and why they should invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart with 50% of the future population ADRD caretaking? At minimum, ADRD educational/training materials should be made available through the state library systems so caretakers/children will have easy and immediate access to free resources.</p>
<p>Second, taken to the extreme, without resolution of the causation issue, does the potential for prion scabie migration/replication through surgical equipment and water supply raise the potential for contagion and exponential as opposed to linear expansion of this population? There are patents available which deal with prion destruction in surgical equipment sterilization not currently accomplished with traditional techniques. Is it possible to address these concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Disability and Caretakers</strong></p>
<p>The SSA discriminates against caretakers of ADRD as a class in denial of disability benefits. The theory of liability as to the SS is unjust enrichment No one wants to see this mushroom into a class action but if this injustice is not rectified, another forum for redress will be pursed.</p>
<p>Caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which often consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned bysundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>Spouse caretakers usually predecease the AD patient since the stress of caretaking destroys the immune system. If children take on the responsibility they are similarly affected. Although ADRD manifests itself differently in each individual, the one common thread is the impact on the caretakers. They deal with the protracted trauma of losing the essence of their loved one years before the actual physical death. At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble.</p>
<p>The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker.</p>
<p>At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified through (1) amendment to SSA disability prerequisites relating to entitlement based time restricted contribution period for ADRD and other caretakers, or (2) a class action against the SSA for unjust enrichment of the fund attributable to private caretakers efforts and in the denial of benefits to caretakers who would otherwise qualify for disability.</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services on Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation</strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage prefilingcourt mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>When care facilities are undesirable or financially impractical, the burden falls on the family particularly in the case of ADRD where 24/7 care is involved. In many cases, qualified at home care providers are not available or are unwilling to do AD because it is just too hard. The comment I received from an agency representative was "life is too short". Unqualified at home care providers pose a danger to the patient.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the AD community that "there is always one" (family member) who assumes primary and often sole responsibility for care. Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p><strong>The ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA should draft a uniform national law regulating facilities and employees. License should be conditioned on compliance or relinquish entitlement to federal and state benefits/subsidies.</strong></p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity for a national uniform statute/regulations for state enactment regulating ECC, ALF's and SNF's, otherwise conditioning the provision of federal subsidies and benefits on facility compliance and providing stringent sanctions for violations, not only as to the facility, but as to participating health care professionals.</p>
<p>The ABA has successfully taken on uniform national laws in the past and it is particularly critical here. The attorneys from the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA have the talent and the experience in the trenches of facility abuse to handle this issue. If NAPA fails to give a voice to elderly ADRD through strong advocacy and protection of their interests, they will have failed their mandate.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald issued a three part investigative report in 2011entitled, "Neglected to Death" <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com">http://www.miamiherald.com/neglectedtodeath/index.html#morer</a> This is essential reading for anyone in this field. The Nursing home abuse blog and other resources provides an overview of, for example Emeritus (California - wrongful death, Florida - bed sores, medication misadministration and falsification of medical records etc. etc.) Usually the response is simply to convert to a lower classification of care (independent living) to circumvent future state oversight. The Florida legislature has twice failed to enact legislation to remedy abuse. The industry is now attempting to enact legislation in Florida which will make it more difficult to sue for abuse.</p>
<p>With advance apology to truly outstanding health care professionals delivering quality care, caretakers do not place their loved ones in facilities because the (1) the health, safety and security of the ADRD cannot be assured in substandard, understaffed facilities (2) there is excessive doping (chemical restraints) to compensate for inadequate staffing, (3) the facilities do not take high level ADRD without a 24/7 private aide making it a cost prohibitive venture, (4) Medicaid beds are not made available to ADRD unless the condition developed post initial admission, and (4) the state is lax or nonresponsive in enforcement.</p>
<p>Please understand our collective, absolute fury with your "15%" reduction in doping and demand for clarification. This is a civil rights if not a criminal battery issue. It is not subject to arbitrary and callous treatment as an administrative efficiency issue. Visit an AL or SNF and speak with families and attorneys who specialize in this field. Look at your own deficiency reports on the 620 nursing facilities in Florida alone and the court abuse claims against assisted living facilities. There are a substantial number of attorneys in the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA who would be happy to provide education.</p>
<p>When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Which 8.5% of this group are you comfortable abandoning?</p>
<p>We had three experiences with respite in ten years in two high level SNF's and one hospice, each stay under two weeks. The first resulted in a hip fracture with the elderly woman in the next bed in the same condition. (The other woman was given haldoland cried for hours.) The second stay resulted in extensive bruising, a cut on the forehead and a hematoma on both arms. The hospice, situated in a hospital, was advised preadmission that the ADRD could not call for help and, as a fall risk, did not need diapering but needed a commode next to the bed which she could utilize. They put her as far away from the nursing station as possible in a room with a woman who was incapable of any communication, put her in diapers she would not use and put the side bed rails up. Within 8 hours of admission, she had fallen attempting to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and had ripped open her leg about 10 inches. When I arrived at 5 am, she was bleeding on the bed. (My father entered a hospital without a mark on his body and was discharged with a stage 3 decubitus with MRSA on his coccyx.) All of this has to stop now.</p>
<p>To the extent doping, neglect and abuse is not rectified, elderly will continue suffering and families will forfeit their livelihood, savings, children college funds and quality of life to keep their loved ones safe at home. Please do not make it the policy of NAPA to tolerate any form of institutionalized abuse.</p>
<p>Many facilities are not capable of or are unwilling to provide essential services to insure the safety and care of their elderly residents. There are too many profiteer operators opening what are essentially extended stays with food service, mandating understaffed facilities to achieve a substantial owner benefit/ROI without regard for the quality of life of their residents.</p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly. Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same. Similarly, federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>The foregoing does not overlook and in fact should aggressively pursue actions for assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse as appropriate through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, who, in turn, should immediately notify all concerned federal and state concerned authorities of the pendency of any investigation and subsequent charges. I have discussed this matter with major city police from San Francisco to Boston and they have horrifying tales.</p>
<p>This industry is unable to regulate itself. The recent ALA request for state plans was disappointing. Florida ALA declined to do its own report and adopted the Texas plan. None are particularly effective in addressing resident issues if reform would economically burden the owner.</p>
<p>The uniform national law act should set forth, with specificity, optimal minimum standards for facility operation including but not limited to</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Qualification and licensing of owners/operators (in Florida you need high school to operate an ALF),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum facility per patient staffing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background investigation, qualifications and training of staff,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated in its entirety,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program of cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD. Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF if attendant medical issues, (The advent of IPADS and touch screens opens new door in this area for ADRD who could not negotiate a mouse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of distance web cams to permit HSC and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat sensoredmonitoring of fall risks and ADRD so movement leading to bed vacation at night can be identified by staff prior to injury or wandering and without alarms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory immediate notification to HSC of injury to patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment to prevent staff injury have to be provided in each facility. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese without injuring themselves. (Robots exist to deliver medication in hospitals. Cornell has a robot to take a beer out of the refrigerator deliver and pour it. Why not a robot to help? It has to be less in cost than repeated hip fractures, rehab and OSHA damage awards.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software access between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who is aggressive in medication management and I quickly discovered that nurses resented any inquiry. This has to stop. We are HCS's and we need this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HSC, POA and family of their options, including referral to counsel and a NAELA contact number or availability of court mediation services. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNR forms and living wills have to be uniform nationally. (Florida requires the forms to be in a particular format on yellow paper?)</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>The WHO has declared ADRD as an international health crisis. International cooperation requires a different approach from the NAPA plan with consolidation and dedication of international resources solely to scientific research. </strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization calls on nations to recognize dementia as a global public health crisis. Nobel Laureate, Dr. Stanley Prusiner, immediate past Director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at UCSF, and recently appointed Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Cleveland Clinic Lou RuvoCenter for Brain Health, along with The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation which funds the work of Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Greengardand every other internationally prominent scientist considers Alzheimer's one of the most devastating and grossly underfunded illnesses affecting society and are staunch advocates of a significant increase in funding to make substantial breakthroughs.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>A World Alzheimer's Center under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation in affiliation with the WHO providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges should be created. (See eg. Norway's Snoezalen rooms <a href="http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp">http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp</a>, advances made by John Hopkin'sCopper Ridge, Melabev in Israel, the Fisher Institute at NYU, the University of Florida's Smart Room, games and brain training to name a few.)</p>
<p>While seed money could be provided through NAPA, this fund is insufficient to provide national support for ADRD research demands much less international efforts. Similarly, the Alzheimer's organization has its own challenges in infrastructure support particularly given the scope of their service delivery.</p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>In the absence of sufficient government appropriation and given the cost of fundraising/air time, a new vehicle to accomplish the $5-10 billion needed for ADRD research must be identified and pursued through the international community. It has been suggested (and inspired in part by Google's Razoo) that the search engines should be engaged as the only viable means of effectively coordinating, in every language, a coordinated time restricted massive campaign on the front page of the engines to elicit international financial support to expeditiously achieve essential support. Properly structured, the engines can slice through the overhead to accomplish direct benefit to scientific research in fulfillment of the intent of the donor and the international public trust through the Alzheimer's Federation of 78 nations in affiliation with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The current reaction to NAPA is that, despite the best intentions and through no fault, the current approach is underfinanced, piecemeal at best and holds no ascertainable hope of accomplishing an expeditious cure. You need a great deal of money and resources to save the next generation. If you want to accomplish significant goals, you have to put international firepower behind your efforts.</p>

<p>Thank you for your bold and thoughtful leadership of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. On behalf of the LEAD Coalition and our partners, I am attaching to this message a letter signed by 54 organizations in support of recommendations for your forthcoming 2013 Plan update.</p>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the dialogue and to collaborate on implementing all elements of the Plan.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul><li>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council</em></li>

</ul><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

					Subject: National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease Released</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Obama Administration Presents National Plan to Fight Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius today released an ambitious national plan to fight Alzheimer's disease. The plan was called for in the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/</a>], which President Obama signed into law in January 2011. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan.shtml</a>] sets forth five goals, including the development of effective prevention and treatment approaches for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias by 2025.</p>
<p>In February 2012, the administration announced that it would take immediate action to implement parts of the plan, including making additional funding available in fiscal year 2012 to support research, provider education and public awareness. Today, the Secretary announced additional specific actions, including the funding of two major clinical trials, jumpstarted by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) infusion of additional FY 2012 funds directed at Alzheimer's disease; the development of new high-quality, up-to-date training and information for our nation's clinicians; and a new public education campaign and website to help families and caregivers find the services and support they need.</p>
<p>To help accelerate this urgent work, the President's proposed FY 2013 budget provides a $100 million increase for efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. These funds will support additional research ($80 million), improve public awareness of the disease ($4.2 million), support provider education programs ($4.0 million), invest in caregiver support ($10.5 million), and improve data collection ($1.3 million).</p>
<p>"These actions are the cornerstones of an historic effort to fight Alzheimer's disease," Secretary Sebelius said. "This is a national plan--not a federal one, because reducing the burden of Alzheimer's will require the active engagement of both the public and private sectors."</p>
<p>The plan, presented today at the Alzheimer's Research Summit 2012: <em>Path to Treatment and Prevention</em>, was developed with input from experts in aging and Alzheimer's disease issues and calls for a comprehensive, collaborative approach across federal, state, private and non-profit organizations. More than 3,600 people or organizations submitted comments on the draft plan.</p>
<p>As many as 5.1 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease and that number is likely to double in the coming years. At the same time, millions of American families struggle with the physical, emotional and financial costs of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The initiatives announced today include:</p>
<ul><li>Research -- The funding of new research projects by the NIH will focus on key areas in which emerging technologies and new approaches in clinical testing now allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the disease. This research holds considerable promise for developing new and targeted approaches to prevention and treatment. Specifically, two major clinical trials are being funded. One is a $7.9 million effort to test an insulin nasal spray for treating Alzheimer's disease. A second study, toward which NIH is contributing $16 million, is the first prevention trial in people at the highest risk for the disease.</li>
<li>Tools for Clinicians -- The Health Resources and Services Administration has awarded $2 million in funding through its geriatric education centers to provide high-quality training for doctors, nurses, and other health care providers on recognizing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and how to manage the disease.</li>
<li>Easier access to information to support caregivers -- HHS' new website, <a href="http://www.alzheimers.gov">www.alzheimers.gov</a>, offers resources and support to those facing Alzheimer's disease and their friends and family. The site is a gateway to reliable, comprehensive information from federal, state, and private organizations on a range of topics. Visitors to the site will find plain language information and tools to identify local resources that can help with the challenges of daily living, emotional needs, and financial issues related to dementia. Video interviews with real family caregivers explain why information is key to successful caregiving, in their own words.</li>
<li>Awareness campaign -- The first new television advertisement encouraging caregivers to seek information at the new website was debuted. This media campaign will be launched this summer, reaching family members and patients in need of information on Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>Today's announcement demonstrates the Obama administration's continued commitment to taking action in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In 2013, the National Family Caregiver Support Program will continue to provide essential services to family caregivers, including those helping loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. This program will enable family caregivers to receive essential respite services, providing them a short break from caregiving duties, along with other essential services, such as counseling, education and support groups.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, we thank you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your work to forumulate the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Plan, as demonstrated in strategies 2.A and 2.C, which call for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items located under Strategy 2.A are significant, we remain concerned that the essential workforce goals identified by the Council cannot be realized without the investment of additional resources. Specifically, the action items calls for additional and enhanced activities within Geriatric Education Centers (GEC), the Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP), the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program (GACA), the Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral and mental Health Providers (GTPD) program, and the Direct-Care Workforce training program. These programs, which are administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under the Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act, are in constant danger of defunding and have experienced stagnant funding that has not kept up with the pace of inflation, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. To implement these additional and enhanced activities in order to realize the goal of enhancing care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions additional funding must be invested.</p>
<p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the committee continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you.</p>

					The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					April 17, 2012</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, thank you for your work to formulate recommendations for operationalizing the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Draft Plan, outlined in strategy 2.A, which calls for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items outlined in the Draft Plan and the recommendations you have voted on here today are significant, EWA strongly urges the Council to consider the following comments in order to achieve the essential workforce goals identified in the Draft Plan: -</p>
<ul><li>EWA strongly supports the Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation #8 to invest additional funding in multidisciplinary geriatrics education and training programs under Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Action items under Strategy 2.A of the Draft Plan call for additional and enhanced activities within these programs; however, they have experienced stagnant funding and constant threats of defunding, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. Some of the programs authorized in the Affordable Care Act have yet to receive appropriations. To implement the additional activities called for in the Draft Plan to enhance care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions, additional funding must be invested.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Clinical Care Subcommittee's recommendation to increase funding for loan repayments and other incentives for those who study geriatrics and gerontology. We recommend that geriatrics and gerontology be made permanently eligible via statute for federal loan forgiveness and other efforts to boost enrollment in these medical disciplines.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Council's recommendations with regard to promotion of geriatric education offerings and the dissemination of information about Alzheimer's disease, dementia care, and support systems. EWA believes that geriatric competencies and dementia training should be included in training for all primary care clinicians and staff to improve detection, treatment and care for people with Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee's recommendations for health care provider training and for adequate training and compensation for paraprofessional caregivers. More specifically, we recommend that certified nursing aides and home care aides and their supervisors be required to take at least 120 of training, including explicit geriatric care and gerontological content; and that minimum training standards/competencies for non-clinical direct-care workers should be created and that they should be adequately compensated.</li>
<li>EWA urges the Council to consider more specific recommendations on improving access to Medicare and Medicaid funded home- and community-based care services to allow individuals with Alzheimer's disease to stay in their homes as long as possible.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Council's recommendations to expand and increase funding for AoA programs such family planning and social services, research and development projects, and training in the field of aging; respite care; support services for family caregivers that can help reduce their burden.</li>
</ul><p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the Council continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you to achieve the goals of the National Plan.</p>

<p>Family Caregiver Alliance would like to submit the attached comments into the official record for today.</p>
</td>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>I am writing on behalf of family caregivers throughout the United States who are struggling to provide care for their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The National Center on Caregiving at Family Caregiver Alliance supports many of the recommendations contained in the presentation handout and would like this letter submitted for the formal record.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee Recommendations </strong></p>
<p><em>1) HHS should provide Federal Funds to support a state lead entity in every state and territory. This entity would coordinate available public and private LTSS, conduct service gap analysis, identify opportunities for efficiency, and enable ongoing stakeholder input to address needs across all sectors and systems. Bullet point #7: HHS should fully fund the costs of cognitive impairment and caregiver surveillance through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in every state. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: We support using the caregiver module in BRFSS in every state. However, in our communication with states that have included the caregiver module in their BRFSS, not all states had the funding or infrastructure to properly analyze the data after it was collected. Therefore, HHS should also include funding for the analysis of the data after it has been collected.</p>
<p><em>4) Fully fund Caregiver Supports under AoA. AoA currently has a Caregiver Support Program, a component of which can be expanded to better meet the needs of caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: An article in <em>American Family Physician</em>, released in 2011, ("Caregiver Care") focused on the importance of caregiver assessment. In it, the authors noted that the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) received $154 million in federal funding in FY 2009, "approximately one-twentieth of 1 percent of the value of caregiver contributions." Family Caregiver Alliance strongly supports fully funding this program that helps families navigate the many complexities of long-term care for a loved one.</p>
<p><em>5) Assure a robust, dementia capable system of Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is available in every state. Bullet Point #6: CMS should provide guidance to all states on adding adult day services as a state optional service under Medicaid. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: Caregivers in California were faced with the elimination of the Adult Day Health Care program (stopped only by a lawsuit) in 2011 because it is an "optional" benefit in Medi-Cal. Given the nature of caregiving for a person with dementia, especially in its advanced stages, services like adult day programs are not "optional" for caregivers. They are vital sources of respite for families who may also be balancing jobs and raising children. Therefore, we believe that the conversation should focus on how to ensure that every family has access to adult day services. When a service like Adult Day Health Care is considered "optional," it often lands on the chopping block during economic downturns, (as California caregivers experienced in 2011) and families are left to try and piece together alternatives.</p>
<p><em>12) HHS and State Lead Entities should assure that caregiver physical health/ behavioral health risk is assessed and addressed regularly. Caregiver illness and mortality contribute to the enormous personal and financial cost of Alzheimer's disease. The health and well-being of a caregiver has a direct impact on the health and quality of life of a person with Alzheimer's disease. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: While we support assessing caregivers and connecting them with services, we also advocate for a person <em>and</em> family-centered approach to care. While the health of the caregiver does have an impact on the health and quality of life of a person with Alzheimer's disease, the opposite is also true. People who become caregivers face increased risks of depression, stress, exhaustion, cognitive decline, and higher mortality rates. Instead of viewing the caregiver's needs merely in relation to how this will support their caregiving role, it is also important to recognize caregivers and their health (psychological, emotional, physical, and financial) as a separate priority in addition to the care receiver.</p>
<p>Family Caregiver Alliance is grateful for the opportunity to provide our input on ehalf of the over 15 million Americans currently caring for a loved one with lzheimer's and related dementias. b A Sincerely, Kathleen Kelly, MPA, Executive Director</p>

<p>The National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities (NASUAD) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, as published on February 22, 2012.</p>
<p>NASUAD represents the nation's 56 state and territorial agencies on aging and disabilities. As part of the National Aging Network, each of our members oversees the implementation of the Older Americans Act (OAA), through funds awarded by the Administration on Aging (AoA). Additionally, many member-states also serve as the operating agency for Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) waivers that serve older adults, and in some cases, individuals with disabilities. The Association's principal mission is to design, improve, and sustain state systems delivering home and community based services and supports for people who are older or have a disability, and their caregivers.</p>
<p>The enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) has created a long-overdue opportunity to focus the nation's attention on Alzheimer's disease, and the Association applauds the Administration's recognition of both the vital need to address the many challenges facing people with the disease, their families, and caregivers; and the urgency with which this must be done. Additionally, we find the draft plan's guiding principles, which seek to optimize existing resources and improve and coordinate ongoing activities, to support public-private partnerships, and to transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease, to be an appropriate reflection of the ambitious, yet attainable, goals embodied by the plan itself.</p>
<p>Guided by a vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease, the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease outlines goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network. Consequently, NASAUD respectfully submits for your consideration the following comments and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces.</strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds the Department's efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through AoA. While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies. </strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds states for recognizing the need to develop comprehensive plans to address Alzheimer's disease, but we are concerned that these plans are being conceptualized and developed without involvement from the Aging Network. State agencies on aging and disabilities play a critical role in the oversight and delivery of services that are designed to support older adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease, in their homes and communities. For these reasons, NASUAD recommends that state agencies on aging and disabilities, and other relevant stakeholders, should be involved at all stages of Alzheimer's state plan development.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with the Older Americans Act, state agencies must develop a State Plan on Aging, which is envisioned by AoA as a comprehensive plan document that articulates the direction in which state long-term care efforts are moving, key strategies to address the strong desires of the rapidly growing new generation of long-term care consumers to be served in their homes and communities, and how the state will address the challenges of America's budgetary constraints and competing priorities in today's society. Given these existing requirements, State Plans on Aging may be the most appropriate place for states to describe their short and long-term strategies for addressing Alzheimer's disease. The integration of Alzheimer's state plans into State Plans on Aging would align with the need for a holistic approach to combatting the disease itself, as well as AoA's intent that State Plans serve as valuable tools for planning and tracking all of the state's efforts on behalf of older adults.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services. </strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the Department's approach of expanding linkages between existing disease support and community information centers supported by AoA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In order to successfully connect members of the public with the necessary services and supports, NASUAD recommends that HHS also examine the capacity of these existing structures, particularly those within the Aging Network, such as ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, and SHIPs, to ensure that these resources are adequately funded to meet the needs of this growing population.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that any strategy to strengthen the Aging Network's capacity to provide families and people with AD access to appropriate services and specialized long-term care planning should be implemented in such a manner that does not overly burden these existing systems. Rather, any approach should provide the Aging Network with the necessary resources to meet these unique needs and to develop innovative practices for doing so. In addition, HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies, as well as patient advocacy organizations, and make these tools readily available within the next year for distribution through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD supports the Department's recognition of the potential for the ADRC Evidence Based Care Transitions program to implement evidence-based care transition models that meaningfully engage older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their informal caregivers. Throughout this evaluation process, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider the impact that additional resources could have on the ability of ADRCs to build their capacity and successfully support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.3: Develop an AD-specific toolkit on care transitions. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this toolkit be developed in consultation with state agencies on aging and disabilities, and be available for distribution throughout the Aging Network within the year.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H.2: Identify steps to ensure access to long-term services and supports for younger people with AD.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the proposed collaboration between the Administration on Aging (AoA), the Office on Disability, and Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) to address access to long-term services and supports across the lifespan, and believes these agencies should be consulted as stakeholders throughout the plan's development and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports HHS efforts to give caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner, and recommends that plans to do so include input from the Aging Network. To facilitate the identification and distribution of culturally-appropriate materials to caregivers, NASUAD recommends that within the year, HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally-sensitive materials and trainings that are currently available, and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS utilize its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials and make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS distribute the identified best practices in a manner that recognizes the variance in long-term services and supports systems across, and within, states. Since what may be a promising practice in one state may be ineffective in another, NASUAD encourages HHS to recognize the importance of state flexibility in meeting the unique needs of individuals within each state.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, so it is important that the evaluation of such programs not be limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.4: Develop and disseminate evidence-based interventions for people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement the strategies defined in Action 3.B.3, NASUAD recommends that HHS quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's disease, and their families, have access to successful evidence based intervention programs. There are existing programs that NASUAD recommends HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Older Americans Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging. Funding should also be increased for the programs funded by the Act.</li>
<li><strong>Lifespan Respite Care Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services. Additional funds should be allocated to the Act.</li>
<li><strong>National Family Caregivers Support Program</strong> -- At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems.</strong><br />
					As HHS works to connect caregivers with appropriate supportive services, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the existing capacity of ADRCs to serve as "No Wrong Doors" through which individuals, their families, and caregivers can access available services and programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recognizes and applauds the successes of the VA in providing home and community based care, and realizes the importance of sharing lessons learned from the implementation of these programs across agency and state lines. NASUAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible, so that important information is gathered and shared not only among federal programs, but also throughout the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs. </strong><br />
					Once HHS completes this barrier-identification process, NASUAD recommends that HHS work with federal stakeholders, including CMS and AoA, as well as state and local agencies on aging, to develop and implement solutions to the identified obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts.</strong><br />
					In looking to expand public outreach and awareness about Alzheimer's disease and the importance of long-term care planning, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the successes of the Aging Network in providing outreach and education, such those achieved by ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, SHIPs, and state and local agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement this strategy, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider implementing the Elder Justice Act (EJA), as established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The EJA fully realizes the need to protect our most vulnerable citizens from financial exploitation, as well as from physical and emotional abuse and neglect, and it creates structures and programs for doing so. Though the EJA was signed into law in 2010, it has yet to receive any federal dollars. Without a strong financial commitment to address the growing problem of abuse and neglect among older adults, it will be impossible to fully secure the dignity, safety, and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease. NASUAD recommends that HHS work with Congress to fully fund the Elder Justice Act.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD recommends that these efforts take into consideration the existing framework and resources for legal services that are available through the OAA. Additionally, training should be offered to legal professionals throughout the Aging Network, and the curriculum should address the importance of cultural competence. Training should also be extended to state Adult Protective Services workers as well as to other individuals as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes.</strong><br />
					To leverage existing successful systems, NASUAD recommends that federal and state representatives from AoA's National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program be involved in this collaborative effort.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping older adults and individuals with disabilities, including those with Alzheimer's and other dementias, remain in the community rather than in institutional settings. With a focus on programs and strategies undertaken by AoA, state agencies on aging and disabilities, and area agencies on aging, NASUAD recommends that HUD and HHS work with the Aging Network to identify innovative practices, barriers to success, and solutions to these barriers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em>. </strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community based care systems to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation<em>: Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em>.</strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of necessary health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias, their families, and their caregivers. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families, and caregivers in primary care, institutional, and home and community based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS use existing "No Wrong Door" systems, such as ADRCs, to link individuals to accurate information, resources, services, and supports, in a manner that recognizes the potential need to enhance the capacity of ADRCs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.B.1: Convene leaders from state and local governments.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS include state directors on aging and disabilities in this collaboration, as well as state long-term care directors.</p>
<p>On behalf of NASUAD, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. We look forward to continuing to work with HHS to develop a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that seeks to achieve the vision of a nation free of the disease, while maintaining the dignity and independence of those with Alzheimer's disease, their families and their caregivers. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or Lindsey Copeland, NASUAD's Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs to further discuss any of these issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Page 10: Action 1.B 6: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions- insert:</p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will continue to conduct evidence based clinical trials to test the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and risk factor reduction in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network serves as the foundation on which the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) is being built to serve as a primary source of information and assistance to persons in need of long term care supports and services. </strong></p>
<p>Action 2.A. 1: Educate Health Care Providers: insert:</p>
<p>"Health care providers will learn how to manage the disease in the context of other health care conditions, and about the role of the ADRC in linking people to support services in the community".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In general, persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers prefer to receive community-based long term services and supports as compared to nursing home placements</strong>. Community-based AD care should be routinely referred to in the plan.</p>
<p>Page 15: Action 2. A. 4: Strengthening the direct-care workforce -insert:</p>
<p>"HHS will strengthen the nursing home, aging services and long-term services and supports direct-care workforce through new training focused on high-quality, person-centered care for people with Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert:</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>AgeOptions, the Area Agency on Aging for the suburban Chicago region since 1974, supports the goals set forth in the National Alzheimer's Plan. The Aging Network plays a strong role in supporting older adults with Alzheimer's and their families and we appreciate our inclusion in many areas of the Plan, including strengthening the state aging workforce and providing education, training and support.</p>
<p>In order to make the National Plan inclusive and responsive to the needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, we recommend that the Advisory Council include the following in the Plan:</p>
<ul><li>Stronger emphasis on caregiver support services. It is crucial that caregivers are supported in order to ensure that they are able to provide high quality of care and that people with Alzheimer's disease are able to stay in their homes as long as possible. Local Area Agencies on Aging have been providing caregiver support services since 2001 through funding provided by the Older Americans Act. These services include support groups, caregiver counseling, caregiver training programs and respite care options. While these programs are utilized by all caregivers, many clients care for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, Area Agencies on Aging provide outreach and education to caregivers and information and referral services to connect caregivers with appropriate resources.</li>
<li>Collaboration at the local level. The National Alzheimer's Plan focuses primarily on national and state organizations. It is essential to include local Area Agencies on Aging, providers, the faith based community and stakeholders in the discussions and plans. Local organizations in our area provide programming and services for people with Alzheimer's and their families, including evidence based programs, case management, support groups, respite care and information and referral. These local organizations must be included in the Plan in order to ensure that individuals in need of Alzheimer's support services have full access to the benefits that will result from this national initiative.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, I am writing in support of the proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders (ADRD) that would promote an earlier diagnosis of the disease, improve strategies for long term services and supports, and accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging was created by the State Legislature in 1973 for the purpose of improving the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the single State agency authorized to receive and dispense Federal Older Americans Act funds and is mandated to provide a comprehensive coordinated service system for the State's 2.2 million older persons, giving high priority to those in greatest need. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network, caregivers and persons with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, an estimated 222,300 individuals in Illinois are living with Alzhiemer's disease with a direct and indirect financial toll of $5.2 billion. More than 70% of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease are living at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to assist care recipients with Activities of Dailiy Living (ADLs) than caregivers to other persons.<sup>(1)</sup> Caregivers often help to manage other serious medical conditions in addition to Alzheimer's, and because Alzheimer's and other dementia usually progress slowly, most caregivers spend many years in the caregiving role.<sup>(2)</sup> In 2006 the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Family Caregiver Association reported an estimated 1.2 million family caregivers in Illinois were providing 1.3 million hours of care to family members. As the baby boom generation enters the age of greatest risk for Alzheimer's, by 2025 their number in Illinois is expected to increase to over 239,000.</p>
<p>Thirteen Area Agencies on Aging and statewide service providers comprise the Aging Network in Illinois, which effectively links older persons with needed services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP), implemented through the Aging Nework, provides five basic service categories to family caregivers including: information about services; assistance in accessing services; counseling; support groups and trianing/education; respite care; and, supplemental services.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, 66,132 Illinoisans received assistance through services of the NFCSP. Additionally, 493,313 individuals received assistance through supportive and nutrition services of the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>The proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders contains thoughtful recommendations which address the immediate and long-term needs of caregivers, providers and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Aging Network in Illinois is committed to providing services to Alzheimer patients, their families and caregivers through a number of programs which support the five goals of the National Plan.</p>
<ul><li>Public Education and Outreach: Through Title III-B efforts under the Older Americans Act and Title III-E programs of the National Family Caregiver Support Program the Aging Network provided education and outreach on aging issues and available resources to 6,429 individuals in FY 2011. Additionally, the Department collaborates with many professional organizations to provide education and training opportunities. Examples include the Annual Elder Rights Conference; Senior Expos; Area Agencies on Aging sponsored Lunch and Learn/Brown Bag events; Caregiver Conferences; AIRS (Alliance of Information and Referral Systems) training; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Older Caregiver Training.</li>
<li>Outreach to healthcare providers: Home and community-based resources are critical to ensure that persons living with Alzheimer's disease are adequately and safely cared for in their homes as long as possible and contain the cost of health care. The Illinois Department on Aging sponsors many conferences and workshops for professionals including the Community Care Program/Case Coordination Unit Annual Supervisor Conference convening supervisors from case coordination units and home care agencies; the Annual Governor's Conference on Aging and Illinois TRAID comprised of state and local law enforcement agencies and other professional organizations. The Department also promotes the use of the Administration on Aging's National Alzheimer's Call Center by caregivers and encourages referrals by AAAs and providers.</li>
<li>Expanded support for people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers in the community: The Department has aggressively pursued funding to expand and enhance services for caregivers. In 2009 the Administration on Aging awarded the Department a three year Lifespan Respite grant which has enhanced access to and improved awareness of respite services. The Department has established a statewide Caregiver Advisory Committee which convenes regularly to discuss caregiver issues, share resources and best practices and review caregiver programs and is establishing protocol to implement and effective service delivery system through Aging and Disability Resource Centers/Coordinated Points of Entry.</li>
<li>Improved data collection and analysis: The Department works closely with the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging to collect data for NAPIS reporting as well as reviewing current caregiver assessment tools.</li>
</ul><p>In 2009, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Related Dementia State Plan - Senate Joint Resolution 43 - Report to the Governor and General Assembly." Recommendations in this report are reflected in the National Plan and include:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing adequate staffing levels and funding</li>
<li>Establishing basic and specialized education and training for persons when responsibilities make it likely they will come into contact with persons with AD and related dementias and their caregivers</li>
<li>Facilitate planning, treatment and research</li>
<li>Provide assistance to unpaid caregivers of persons with AD</li>
<li>Determine an effective system to collect data</li>
</ul><p>We must continue to examine our current capability to meet the Alzheimer's crisis and propose action to prepare for and respond to these challenges which include the development of a standardized caregiver assessment; establishment of the ADRC service delivery model; continue collaborative efforts of the Lifespan Respite Program; continue to incorporate consumer directed care service models through the National Family Caregiver Support Program; continue to collaborate with the Alzheimer's Association in Illinois; utilize Area Agencies on Aging and service providers to disseminate information and provide culturally sensitive training and materials to providers and caregivers; assist families and individuals in planning for future needs and provide updates to families, caregivers and providers regarding the latest clinical guidelines and information on how to work with people with AD; examine the capacity of public safety and law enforcement to respond to person's with Alzheimer's; examination of trends in the Alzheimer's population and needs, including assistance to persons with early stage and early on-set Alzheimer's and persons with Alzheimer's and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging and the Aging Network is committed to continue to respond in the most appropriate and effective way to this growing health problem and meet the challenge of providing service to Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers. The proposed National Plan is sensitive to local efforts to support caregivers and direct-care workers and offers viable proposals to support, educate and train the direct-care workforce and state aging workforces.

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>The Iowa Department on Aging is encouraged by the initiation of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. A diagnosis of, or in many cases just a discussion about Alzheimer's disease or related dementia can trigger a sense of fear, foreboding and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's plan has the potential to greatly improve and enhance the current system and help improve the quality of life and quality of care for both people diagnosed and their caregivers. But without adequate funding attached to the proposed goals, we are concerned that systems change is not possible.</p>
<ol><li>To effectively create a system to enhance quality care and efficiency we believe the Plan should dictate minimum standards including, but not limited to the following:
<ul><li>An increased number of hours of education and training required for health care professionals and other disciplines who come in contact with people diagnosed with dementia.</li>
<li>Physician training programs that stress the importance of early detection and diagnosis.</li>
<li>Create and implement dementia unit requirements that include specially trained activity personnel, increased daily programming and adequate social work staff to meet the needs of people living in long-term care facilities.</li>
<li>Dementia care offered in hospitals must include staff with dementia training and enough staff to properly care for patients with a dementia diagnosis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expand patient and family support by enhancing existing systems.
<ul><li>Strengthen the National Family Caregiver Program to ensure that specialists are dementia capable and can provide education, referral and resource information and support to family caregivers who are caring for a person with dementia.</li>
<li>Strengthen the Lifespan Respite Program by providing adequate funds for respite care for people with dementia. Statistics show that access to respite care has a definite impact on the length of time a person can be cared for at home.</li>
<li>Provide access to evidence based programs that demonstrate effective support to all caregivers of people experiencing dementia</li>
<li>Increase psychosocial interventions for the caregiver and care receiver that offer support and assistance for people in home and community based programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enhance public awareness and engagement through an organized, funded campaign to assist the general public in:
<ul><li>Understanding the importance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment.</li>
<li>Understanding the importance of future planning</li>
<li>Becoming knowledgeable about long term living and community support services that are available in local communities
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>The Iowa Department on Aging believes that a nationally funded and coordinated effort is needed to enhance care, expand caregiver support and increase awareness and we support the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>As younger populations become increasingly urban and concentrated, persons more likely to have Alzheimer's or related dementia, become stranded in rural communities without adequate resources or family to assist them as the disease progresses. As jobs become scarce in rural communities, children of the baby boomers have moved where there are better job prospects leaving their parents alone. The community supports simply are not adequate in rural communities to address the specific needs of persons with dementia who have no informal primary caregiver's. Many of these people will end up in nursing facilities, that are ill-equipped to handle the specific care needs of an Alzheimer's patient. Nursing homes are for skilled care; however, Alzheimer's patients frequently do not need skilled care (for much of the disease progression), they simply need supervision, social stimulation, and help with minimal ADL's and IADL's. Nursing facilities have problems handling the behavior of Alzheimer's patients, because they are frequently mobile and cause disturbances with other patients. As a result nursing facilities are reluctant to accept patients with Alzheimer's disease early in disease progression. <strong>The addition of Alzheimer's dementia specific units to nursing facilities, especially in rural communities, would alleviate some of this problem. The staffing would be smaller, and the cost per day to medicare/Medicaid could be reduced as a result.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, for informal caregivers that do live in rural communities, support groups, educational opportunities, and training are absent. In addition, broadband internet is also difficult to obtain do inadequate infrastructure, leaving the caregiver unable to obtain information. The stress of caregiving combined with isolation shortens the amount of time an informal caregiver can increase the chance the persons are placed in nursing facilities for lack of another option. <strong>Providing community training through religious institutions, civic organizations, and other groups would allow for wide dispersal of accurate information, as well as the infrastructure in rural communities, improving early diagnosis and extending the amount of time a person can stay at home with a caregiver by reducing their stress through knowledge and resources.</strong> One way of accomplishing this is to certify persons at the AAAs or County Health Departments to recruit and train volunteers to provide outreach and educational events in their communities.</p>
<p>Another component of stress reduction is respite support. Caregiver's of persons with Alzheimer's or related diseases care for their loved ones for long periods of time. The time spent away from work, church, and family can become taxing and frequent breaks are needed. As there is increased demand for respite, and in the absence of increased funding for flexible respite support one of two options is available: 1) reduce the amount of respite per caregiver or 2) maintain lengthy waiting lists. Both options fail. At some point, respite is ineffective if it is infrequent and for very brief periods of time. If the caregiver waits too long without a break on a waiting list for respite, the caregiver will give up before the programs can provide assistance. <strong>The solution is to increase funding for respite supports through the AAAs, V.A., as well as introduce a income needs based component to respite support programs eligibility requirements.</strong> People that are wealthy ought to pay for their respite, or prove they have paid x amount before they can gain access to subsidized respite support each year. The reach of the programs would extend to those least likely to take a break, because they are unable to afford it.</p>

<p>Please become more informed about the vital and large voting population who have a loved one with dementia or depression or anxiety. The Baby Boomers are one of the largest groups around and have the most voting power as well as the needs for supportive services to keep their loved ones at home. It seems when it comes to home care, respite services and other supportive case management services and counseling are the first ones to be cut. We once had an older adult program here in Illinois and that was cut (temporarily once and completely the 2nd time around). The message you are sending the public is that our government does not value the family as a place for care recipients to grow older (it is a proven statistic that family members experience less depression in the family home than in a nursing home facility). Older Adults deserve our respect and they deserve to continue to have quality care. Please do not let our government succumb to the prejudice of ageism. All people have value especially the old--who have much to still teach us.</p>

<p>I am a co-author and now facilitator for our state plan, <strong>Conquering the Specter of Alzheimer's Disease in South Carolina</strong>, which was presented to the State Legislature on March 1, 2009. Needless to say, I have a keen interest in a national strategy to fight this disease. One of the recommendations that came out of South Carolina's task force was the involvement of the work force in supporting and assisting caregivers. Following is one of the recommendations in our plan regarding employers enabling caregivers to remain in the work force. This seems to coincide with the priorities of the national plan and represents an area not specifically addressed through the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 20</strong>. Promote and support private and public sector businesses in addressing the needs of employees who are caregivers to persons with ADRD through the use of on-site respite, support groups, or other initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Seventy percent of people with ADRD are living at home, most of whom receive unpaid help from family members<sup>[i]</sup>. One study of family and other unpaid caregivers of people with ADRD found that 57% were employed full time or part time. Of those who were employed, two-thirds said they had to go in late, leave early or take time off because of caregiving; 18% had to take a leave of absence; 13% had reduced their hours; and 8% had turned down promotions<sup>[ii]</sup>. Eight percent of caregivers in the study had quit work entirely because of caregiving. Another study of family and other unpaid caregivers of more than 2,000 older people found that caregivers of people who had Alzheimer's or other dementias without behavioral symptoms were 31% more likely than caregivers of other older people to have reduced their hours or quit work<sup>[iii]</sup>. Caregivers of people who had Alzheimer's or other dementias with behavioral symptoms were 68% more likely than caregivers of other older people to have reduced their hours or quit work<sup>[iv]</sup>.</p>

<p>I am pleased more money and attention is proposed for the NAPA and that you are asking for comments.</p>
<p>I am a caregiver for my husband, Al Hayes (80 Yrs. old), who has had Dementia for five or more years. He has been diagnosed going int the advance stage; little language skills, completely dependent on me for his personal care and sleeps 15 hours a day. The only outside help (other than family) I get is two afternoons a week when the Santa Fe Senior Services provide Respite Care for three hours, which gives me a chance for free time. I felt very lonely until I took advantage of various Alzheimer's groups, caregivers, Alzheimer Cafe and discussion groups each meeting is only one day a month. There are no day care programs or affordable home care. I am 85 years old and have full 24+7 caretakers responsibility, I can not leave Al alone to go shopping. I have had to give up all my interest my involvement with my church and various activities.</p>
<p>I feel more attention should be directed towards caregivers and their needs and their family. My desire is to keep Al Home as long as possible but I need more help at home. I am 85 years old and I am concerned about how much longer I can keep up with all the demands of being a caregiver.</p>
<p>The caregiver is like the elephant in the room everyone knows it is there but they keep their blinders on. Caregivers need to be recognized and helped in every way possible.</p>

</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>ATTACHMENT:</strong></em></p>
<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Having just recently released the <em>Dementia State Plan: Virginia's Response to the Needs of Individuals with Dementia and their Caregivers</em>, the Virginia Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Commission (Commission) welcomes the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (Draft Plan)</em>. The emphasis on promoting research and developing new treatments that prevent and effectively treat the disease, expanding support for people with the disease and their families, and enhancing care quality and coordination are shared goals of both plans and we look forward to working together as state and federal partners in addressing the rapidly mounting Alzheimer's crisis.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 1</em>: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong>, the Commission promotes research, supports all strategies to facilitate dissemination of research findings into medical practice and public health programs, and would welcome federal funding for provider education and outreach. Under <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 2</em>: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, Virginia's own plan calls for coordinating quality dementia services, integrated systems of care, and development of dementia specific training. The Commission welcomes any federal support of this state plan strategy.</p>
<p>The action items in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 3</em>: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families</strong> mirror our own state plan recommendation, "In order to survive, families need dementia friendly solutions for their safety, services and behavioral concerns, including: assessment and diagnosis, counseling and support services, care management, respite care, assistive technologies and home modification, transportation, and payment options including long-term care insurance." Additionally, the Commission supports <em>Draft Plan</em> action items for legal services and stable housing for people with the disease. Because of Virginia's large military and veteran population, the Commission advocates for federal and state partnerships to meet the dementia care needs of this population.</p>
<p>As noted in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 4</em>: Educate the Public About Alzheimer's Disease</strong>, some states and localities "have published plans to address AD that coverage many of the same issues as the National Plan. Leveraging the available resources and programs across these levels of government will aid in the success of these efforts" to advance Alzheimer's Disease awareness and readiness across all levels of government. Finally, both Virginia's plan and the <em>Draft Plan</em> recognize the need to improve data collection to better understand the disease's impact on people with the disease, their families, and the healthcare system and, therefore, <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 5</em>: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong> is also imperative. Specifically, the Commission requests coordination of shared federal and state data and the removal of barriers to sharing of information and best practices.</p>
<p>The Commission looks forward to the final version of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> this spring as the Commonwealth is just beginning its state plan implementation. Concerted efforts in national and state strategic planning will provide the best chance to overcoming this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>Please accept the following comments on the draft National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders from the State Unit on Aging in Connecticut:</p>
<ol><li>While evidence based research can be a reliable tool, more flexibility should be granted to community providers and researchers to explore innovative and creative non-pharmacological approaches to living with and treating Alzheimer's disease. Our CONNECTIONS grant from AoA and our work in CT with NECC and cognitive training has afforded us with many examples of the positive impacts of this intervention on the quality of life for the caregiver as well as the individual with dementia. Excluding such projects from funding opportunities, further exploration or dismissing them as models because they do not have the full complement of expansive research behind them is short-sighted and limiting to families. Often the most innovative approaches are the ones that afford families a sense of empowerment in combating the disease process.</li>
<li>The strategy area of "maintaining the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's Disease" is critical. The perception of this disease and the assumed burden that families incur upon diagnosis often negatively impacts the delivery of care received by those with the diagnosis. Training medical and legal personnel as well as other individuals in the field is an excellent way to begin addressing the stigma associated with the disease and some of the misperceptions and assumptions that are prevalent. Monitoring and reporting the use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes is an excellent proposed action, as is providing awareness training and education for professional caregivers.</li>
<li>It would be beneficial to incorporate hospice options into any training module offered to families as well as facilities working with this population.</li>
<li>The design and implementation of a national education initiative is enthusiastically supported. We are still struggling with the same level of stigma 14 years after implementing our Statewide Respite Care Program (for individuals with Alzheimer's disease) in Connecticut, and many conversations with our local Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association underscore this sentiment.</li>
<li>I strongly encourage the Plan team to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment before new activities are initiated. Since many states and individual organizations may already be implementing aspects of the plan, best practices should be observed to obviate unnecessary and costly duplication or delays.</li>
</ol><p>Please contact me or Cynthia Grant our Alzheimer's contract specialist at the above email address should you need more information.</p>

<p>I would like to thank this committee for their efforts on this project. I am writing a very long letter and hope someone takes the time to read it and forward to all involved.</p>
<p>As this plan moves forward I can applaud the parts of the plan that involve research and drug development. I am sure it will make the researchers and drug companies very happy!! I have no problem researching earlyon set Alzhemers, but really the brain is an organ just like the heart and lungs. There is no cure for old, period! When a person shows signs of this disease at 75 years of age it is just that, the brain is getting old. The government can dump millions into drugs that they them selves will be paying for. Do you know how much Nemenda costs? Most people that take it could never afford it, so the government pays for a drug that has very little effect on the person that takes it. Financial aid and support to the families trying to care for a loved one at home is where this country will benefit.</p>
<p>I am a 52 year old daughter taking care of an 87 year old father with severe Alzheimers. We have a unique situation where I as well as 2 brothers live next door to my dad on land given to us by him. For the last 10 years I have taken care of him as well as worked and raised a family. I have 2 children who are in the health field, 1 a nurse and 1 in a Doctor Pharmacy program, that I struggle to keep in school since I have had to stop working. In the beginning my dad just required monitoring, meals delivered and laundry done, as the disease progressed we alarmed the house so he could not wander off at night. He tripped and broke his right hip in April 2010, surgery made the disease go crazy and I have been a full time caregiver since that day! My data never took a dime of government assistance, he lived and worked as a construction worker and farmed through some very difficult times. He had maybe $35,000 in an IRA when this began. My brothers help where they can and I private pay caregivers (35 hours per week) with the money he has remaining to the tune of $1400 a month. He collects $1267 social security. So after utilities, insurance, drugs and food the remainder comes from the IRA. You can see that when we pre-pay a funeral he will almost be broke. I stopped working, stay 5 nights a week with my dad. Moving someone to a skilled care only worsens this disease or any dementia. April 2011 dad broke his left hip, Hospital 5 days Nov 2011 for and infection. After every surgery or hospital stay he was sent to skilled care (I use that term very loosely) the very basics are not being met in these homes, my dad was left unattended wet and soiled on a daily basis. He developed pineal yeast infections that went unchecked until I discovered it. This is caused by neglect and poor hygiene The workers are miserable, patients are ignored, no one smiles or even pretends to hear them. Don't believe me, take off your suit and go undercover for a visit. I saw this care across the board in 3 different skilled care facilities. My dad is no longer verbal enough to get a point across, but after every trip to a skilled home I would insist on bringing him home when he looked like death. Home is where it is at!!! Love and proper care, I have him walking with a walker, I have him on a bathroom schedule (he is never wet). At night I taught myself how to use an external catheter (something I had to fight to have Medicare approve). This is an aid that is simple to use and eliminates wetness at night and helps to prevent bedsores.</p>
<p>My dad now receives some help from the area on aging, that provides 3 half days of daycare. This is income based and I am controlled if I want to remain in the program to keep his withdraws from his IRA to a minimum. I do this so he dosen't run out of money therefore forcing him onto Medicaid and forcing us to put him in a home. Where is the burden of care? on me!!! Now we are hearing budgets cut to the access public transportation he rides to and from day care. I will be forced to enroll my dad onto Medicaid this will cost the government more than $9,000 monthly.</p>
<p>We were not rich enough to hire an Elder Attorney to transfer my dads assets out of his name, nor do we feel it was our right. How many rich people are on Medicaid because they were taught to spend down their assets? Not one person in this country should be able to give their undeserving children an inheritance before they die, period! Not one person is more in need of skilled care than my dad 24/7 and I could qualify him in a heart beat if I pre-pay a funeral. However I know without a doubt that I am giving him better care than he would get in a home. He is happy in his home and everyday that he smiles and says thank you is a gift to me!</p>
<p>My recommendations give the families financial help to keep their loved ones at home. Give the care giver that quit her job a tax break, so they can continue to help send their own children to college. Allow people to hire quality private care givers, don't force an agency that charges double the hourly rate on us. Respite care that is now covered only under Medicaid, so that we can a least get a weeksbreak to refresh our minds would be nice! Stop taxing the elderly when they can prove every dime of there money is going to care for themselves. Adult Day care should be a medical expense.</p>
<p>I also see both sides of this story my in-laws were forced by 2 of their children to move to assisted living. They pay $4300 a month and my father-in-law takes care of his wife their and the home is very happy to have them. They should be, he does their job for them and they collect the pay check!!! They hate where they live!</p>
<p>There was a song written over 50 years ago the title is "The House of Shame" by Smiley Bates. My dad would call a local radio station almost every Saturday and request it, he then would call each of his children to tell them listen to it. I challenge you to listen to it, I did! Nothing has really changed in 50 years.</p>
<p>I am sorry this is so long, but unless you know the entire problem you can not fix it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTARY RE: "DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE"</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect to the contributors and authors of this draft plan, I submit that, if finalized as written, it will do more to destroy the Alzheimer's community and set back any hope of progress toward a solution than anything seen to date in my lifetime.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>As written this is a blatantly politicized piece of campaign rhetoric. I, perhaps surprisingly, am a life-long Democrat and strong supporter of liberal causes who has burned a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors on behalf of liberal candidates starting with Adlai Stevenson in 1952, but I am and have been also a dementia caregiver for over 20 years. This Alzheimer's Disease issue SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! THE PROBLEM IS APOLITICAL, AND SO SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION!</p>
<ol><li>Starting with the Vision Statement. There is NO better vision than that of The Alzheimer's Association - "A world without Alzheimer's Disease".</li>
<li>Certainly President Obama should be given credit for his support, and his supporting statement deserves recognition in the plan, but other people such as former House Speaker Gingrich deserve equal recognition for their contributions toward developing and supporting these efforts as well.</li>
<li>This entire issue of age related cognitive impairment (I've read that there are nearly 100 probable types/causes) deserves the support of EVERY citizen, whatever their political persuasion, and this draft plan mitigates any possibility of achieving that necessary broad level of support.</li>
<li>Further, in the 27 pages of text, I count at least 8 specific references to the "wonderful" AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Why? One should be more than enough, Zero would be better since a) The administration is wavering on implementation with refusal to implement some parts of the law, b) the administration is providing multi-state waivers to other parts, c) there seems to be little agreement or consensus on interpretation of key elements among those few who have struggled to review those nearly 3000 pages, and lastly d) this controversial law has yet to be reviewed for constitutionality by The Supreme Court (partiallly or completely).</li>
</ol><p>I suggest that the intent of those statements can be preserved in a much less controversial way by simply replacing "Affordable Care Act" language with something like "existing and proposed legislation". I think that the PLAN might also allow for the possibility for proposing new, additional legislation should it be considered useful.</p>
<p>With respect to Strategy 1C, I feel it would be most appropriate to add an additional action to address the legal and ethical aspects of early detection. What about those people that show no signs of dementia but are discovered to have major plaque accumulations? Should they be told?</p>
<p>I agree that measurement of the disease's progression is extremely valuable to the caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals, but I think that more than imaging and biomarkers is needed. Today, the "gold standard" of American neurologists and gerontologists is probably the MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), although many more assessment tools have been developed and found useful around the world. Of even more significance is the Allen Cognitive Scale measuring patients ability to contribute to their care in later stages. The PLAN should include recommendations for assessment tool standards to be applied nationwide in evaluating AD/Dementia progression for use in clinical trials, medical reporting, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another observation formed from my having read the proposed draft report numerous times is that the research portion, despite expressing some valid points, still appears to be another somewhat disorganized "hip-shoot" relying on far too much luck and too little deliberate, well thought out planning. Dr. Eric Kandel said it best when he applauded the successes so far and recognized that this whole issue was extremely complex and we had a lot more to learn. The complexity of the challenges clearly represents a "system of systems" which the late Russell Ackoff defined to be a "mess". This entire program cries out for a well-organized systems engineering approach if any progress is to be made in an affordable, rapid manner. Ackoff would have been our guy, but perhaps a colleague or student of his might be found to accomplish this task as soon as possible. A few calls to the systems thinking community in Academia or the International Federation for Systems Research might identify some key people.</p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, I think we can rely on the following:</p>
<ol><li>Age related dementias (other than major vascular events) are slow in development (Some have said that AD may begin in a persons twenties).</li>
<li>AD mechanisms change as the disease progresses and as damage occurs.</li>
<li>Each stage may require markedly different treatments to achieve delay or prevention.</li>
</ol><p>Is it possible that we are discarding treatments because we are applying trials to an inappropriate stage of the disease? (or even to those that may be incorrectly diagnosed?) Can we confidently rely on the FDA to make the appropriate treatment decisions for all stages of AD? I assure you that the "front-line" families become more desperate as the disease continues it's slow progression. I further suspect that most people in the AD community care very little if the treatment is "FDA Approved". The issues really boil down to:</p>
<ol><li>Is the treatment available (anywhere in the world)?</li>
<li>Is the treatment affordable?</li>
<li>Where, when, and how can I get it?</li>
</ol><p>An example of a layman's assessment of possible "treatments" as of today is shown as Attachment 1 to this commentary.</p>
<p>With regard to rapidity, I also have seen other criticisms of the 2025 goal suggesting that a 2020 goal might be better. Certainly, I would like to see a goal of 2010, but I believe that 2025 might be attainable only if we restrict ourselves to those things that are in the "pipeline" today, which in turn have no guarantee of success. I would urge you to consider scheduling several goals, with separate time objectives, recognizing that we are in a cancer or AIDS-like program that might take 50 years to find a "cure". By the way, I also noted that "finding a cure" is not in the list of research objectives. Have you given up?</p>
<p>I would suggest starting as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Identify and treat risks (2012) - Suggestions for good/bad environmental and diet approaches (subject to vary with time and knowledge -- remember discarding our aluminum cookware?) This is like "No Smoking" in the fight against cancer.</li>
<li>Slow and/or stop degradation (2015) This is partially available now for those who respond to Aricept/Namenda combo treatment. Solutions are needed for the large number of people who do NOT respond favorably.</li>
<li>Early Prevention (2020)</li>
<li>Minimize Symptoms (2022)</li>
<li>Delay Onset (2025)</li>
<li>Reversal of Afflictions (2050) - "THE CURE"!!!!</li>
</ol><p>Of course, the above dates are unsupported figments of my imagination, but I hope you see the concept here.</p>
<p>I also found some statements and titles in the described actions that gave me a "where did this come from" moment. Namely, Action 1.B.3 that discusses clinical trials and international outreach. Do you intend to request non-citizens, off-shore, to participate in our clinical trials? This needs some explanation. Another point that underwhelmed me was Action 1.B.4. Is this just pro-forma government speak or is there a real point? Frankly, I am of the very solid opinion that Alzheimer's Disease is about as racially and ethnically diverse and unbiased in selection as is possible in all of humanity. Are you implying that there is bias in the clinical trial community? Is there managed selectivity in who gets the "stuff" and who gets placebo? I highly doubt that! In fact, I doubt that your assumption of higher risk for AD being either racially or ethnically related has any validity at all. I submit that the REAL reason for those observations lie in differences in life-long histories of environment, diet, and health care practices. For example, we are fairly certain that Americans (of my generation) of Greek or Italian ethnic heritage are at lower AD risk levels, most likely due to preferences for a mostly Mediterranean Diet. This risk reduction may not apply to younger generations if they've switched to Drive-Thru Bacon Cheeseburgers. In any case, I suggest that tracking data on historical environment, diet, and health care practices will be much more meaningful, and tracking racial/ethnic populations as suggested will provide little or no contribution toward improved outcomes.</p>
<p>A small, but significant, item that I have some issues with is the stated expected cost of nursing home care at $78,000. A much more representative (and far more meaningful) number can be shown if it were expressed as a range of state cost averages ($70,000 to $150,000) and further adjusted to determine the level of pre-tax retirement income required to sustain the nursing home option (don't forget to include costs for incidentals like toothpaste, shaving cream, haircuts as well as Medicare parts B,C, and D with those costs adjusted for "means testing").</p>
<p>I suspect you will be looking at $150,000 to $250,000 per year. Thus it will be much easier to understand the future economic pressures on Medicaid and will go a long way toward determining the adequacy of an individual's long-term-care planning.</p>
<p>Also, I am very disappointed that this draft plan promulgates the social stigmas so dreaded by those in the Alzheimer's community. I understand the enticement to encourage high funding levels and popular support through fear, but I believe this is counterproductive to the tasks of living with and caring for those with AD. I am also a strong supporter of redefining those people as being "deeply forgetful" as opposed to "Alzheimer's victims", "Alzheimer's sufferers", "Senile individuals", "People with Dementia" or "Cognitively Impaired". Please realize that NOBODY wants to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It WILL rapidly result in loss of life-long friendships, loss of independence, loss of self, loss of peer respect, etc. This is clearly why early diagnoses seldom happen, and why public education is SO important. The stigma extends and becomes tragic when overzealous and uneducated agents of Adult Protective Services who believe the unsupported and unproven claims spread throughout the Elder Abuse channels of government that "most elder abuse comes from spousal and parental relatives/caregivers". I believe that too many malicious prosecutions are executed throughout the country due to proliferation of this myth. Occasionally, States have admitted to errors, documented those errors, and revised state policies (see "HANDCUFFED" by Wisconsin DHS). Other states rigidly support their mistaken beliefs, and I have seen personally the destruction of families, and early, wrongful patient deaths not to mention large legal costs to these families or to the states if public defense is necessary.</p>
<p>Many caregiving families are threatened daily by the health care/ adult protection bureaucracy. Has no one heard of self-inflicted injuries due to agitation? This is why nursing homes use Posey Mitts (soft handcuffs) and load their patients with unwanted drugs. Should patients be arrested and confined if a caregiver is injured? Should caregivers be arrested and confined if a patient exhibits self-inflicted injuries? Should a caregiver be arrested and confined if a patient is inadvertently injured or bruised during an effort to protect another innocent person? Or attempting to protect the general public? Should families be destroyed, Power of Attorney ignored, and spouses of 50 years be separated without visitation upon arrest, with NO conviction? The Plan's legal advisors would provide a great service to the community by prioritizing for both home and professional caregiver's a list of who should get protection/arrest first: a) the general public, b) close bystanders, c) professional caregivers, d) home caregivers, e) spouses and children/parents, or f) the "deeply forgetful" themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some comments on caregiving support needs. The PLAN needs to clearly state as part of Goal 2 that the priority is to provide for in-home care as long as possible in order to provide more favorable outcomes, extend life and quality of life at less cost to both families and government taxpayers. My own personal experiences indicate that respite care for family caregivers and supervised productive day care experiences for the "deeply forgetful" are absolutely mandatory to the achievement of this objective. The only successful application that I have seen was a 1991-1992 experimental program in the State of Georgia with several counties participating. While I understand this program has ended, I believe it was well documented, and I guarantee that as implemented it was indeed a lifesaving experience for participants and caregivers.</p>
<p>As to Nursing Homes, reducing the inappropriate use of anti-psychotics is a good start, but further improvements are necessary, and should begin with significant modification to the criteria by which state licensing authorities evaluate these facilities. Current criteria covers physical safety very well, but ignore many quality of life issues that affect the "deeply forgetful" residents. We often need to remind ourselves that the deeply forgetful are NOT "empty shells", but simply require unique communication techniques. The Plan should look specifically at the results achieved by advanced compassionate thinking in facilities modeled after Lakeview Ranch, those practicing The Eden Alternative, Montessori based care for the "deeply forgetful" and suggest significant modifications to existing licensing and evaluation criteria that could be addressed by all State Licensing Authorities. Also, I am told that many facilities consider it to be too costly to maintain and update resident's care plans, apparently in direct violation of federal laws. This may be lack of education, but certainly indicates lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>Hospitalization offers additional caregiver challenges. "Deeply forgetful" patients require special care, and have special needs above and beyond normal expectations. Electronic (although privacy protected) records are a great idea but should be expanded to include primary caregiver advice and concerns. Hospital personnel need to understand time, behavior, and observation problems as well as the patient's inability to express needs, particularly if in discomfort and pain. Similar observations might be made about any social situation that is not a part of daily routine and familiar people. Examples such as travel (particularly by air), home care visitations, family outings, and especially holidays come readily to mind. People that interact with the "deeply forgetful" need to know that respect and personal dignity are paramount.</p>

<p>Comment: I have had the opportunity to work with those struggling with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their caregivers for over 17 years. My main observation and suggestion is that these are very strong ,and willing individuals who have been presented with a huge challenge which last for many years and effects an entire family not just one individual. The best and most effective treatment out there is maintaining the historic emotional connection these individuals have with each other. This can be done through recognizing those caregivers and supporting them through strong educational and emotional support and respite care programs, such as Adult day programs.</p>
<p>Our physicians also need strong support in education and encouragement to assist those dealing with the many challenges of dementia. Recognize those who specialize in geriatric care.</p>
<p>Thank you for recognizing the challenge facing our nation with this disease and starting the process of dealing with it.</p>

<p>OVERALL I FIND THE DRAFT PLAN A REASONABLE AND READABLE DOCUMENT, EVEN THE HHS BOILERPLATE. I HAVE SOME COMMENTS WHICH ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE, WHICH I WILL STATE BRIEFLY: MY WIFE, MARTHA, WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A/D AND COPD IN THE FALL OF 2007. I CARED FOR HER AT HOME WITH SOME RESPITE ASSISTANCE UNTIL I COULD NO LONGER DO SO IN JULY OF 2009. I MOVED HER TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER WHICH TWO HOSPITALIZATIONS MADE IT NECESSARY TO PUT HER IN A HOSPICE FACILITY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. IN JUNE OF 2010 I BROUGHT HER TO THE HOUSE ON HOME HOSPICE. I WILL NEVER REGRET DOING THAT. AFTER 55 DAYS, ON AUGUST 4th, 2010, SHE DIED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>PAGE TWO OF THE PLAN LISTS FOUR GOALS. TWO OF THEM ARE: "... ENHANCE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS' KNOWLEDGE ...", AND "... SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CAREGIVERS ...". THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GOALS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PROMINENCE AND A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. WHY? BECAUSE DISCONTINUITIES IN AVAILABLE MEDICAL CARE ARE A SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM - RIGHT NOW - AND ALZHEIMER'S SUFFERERS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE - RIGHT NOW. WE ALL HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY A CURE WILL BE FOUND FOR ALZHEIMER'S. BUT AN IMMEDIATE AND MORE ACUTE PROBLEM IS COHERENT AND GRADUATED CARE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, AND RELIEF FOR THE BURDEN THIS PLACES ON CAREGIVERS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US:</p>
<ol><li>IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET A DIAGNOSIS. AFTER TWO $600 SESSIONS WITH A MEDICAL "EXPERT" IN THE SPRING AND FALL OF 2007, HE STILL WOULD NOT DIAGNOSE A/D. OUR FAMILY DOCTOR, AN INTERNIST, HAD TO MAKE THE CALL AND BEGIN TREATMENT.</li>
<li>IN JULY 2009, AFTER A HELLISH TWO WEEKS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC TO GET THE RIGHT DOSAGE OF A/D DRUGS, THE DOSAGES STILL WERE NOT RIGHT AND OUR INTERNIST HAD TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS LATER.</li>
<li>BY THE FALL OF 2009 15-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS WITH OUR INTERNIST WERE NO LONGER ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS NO AVAILABLE MEDICAL "NEXT STEP". I FOUND THAT AT LEAST IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI, ALL THE GERIATRICIANS HAVE BEEN COOPTED AND ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL-HOSPICE, NURSING HOME OR HOSPICE INDUSTRIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR AND DO NOT WANT ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS. THEY PREFER PATIENTS WHO NEED MONEY-MAKING REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES.</li>
<li>MONEY IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER. WE HAD NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE PAID UP TO $254 A DAY. NURSING HOMES COSTING $230 A DAY HAD NO OPENINGS, PREFERRING PATIENTS NEEDING THERAPIES. I OPTED FOR A $90 A DAY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, WHICH WAS FINE UNTIL SHE WAS BED-RIDDEN AND HER NEEDS BECAME TOO GREAT FOR ASSISTED LIVING. AS IT WAS, BECAUSE OF THE 90-DAY EXCLUSION ON OUR NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WE BARELY BROKE EVEN ON THAT POLICY.</li>
<li>THE NEXT TRANSITION, AND IT WAS ABRUPT, WAS TO A HOSPICE FACILITY. THE HOSPICE BILLED MEDICARE $1000 A DAY FOR HER CARE. HER CARE THERE WAS PERHAPS TWICE AS GOOD AS IN ASSISTED LIVING, BUT IT WAS NOT ELEVEN TIMES AS GOOD AS THE BILLING WOULD SUGGEST. THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT IS A WONDERFUL THING, BUT THE HOSPICE INDUSTRY IS GETTING FAT ON WHAT IT CHARGES, AND IT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S.</li>
<li>THE LAST TRANSITION WAS IN JUNE OF 2010 AND IT WAS ALSO ABRUPT. I WAS TOLD SHE HAD TIMED OUT OF IN-PATIENT HOSPICE. I FOUND THAT NURSING HOMES WERE STILL NOT INTERESTED IN HER AS A PATIENT SO I OPTED FOR HOME HOSPICE. I PERSONALLY PREFERRED THAT TO A NURSING HOME, BUT EVEN THOUGH I HIRED A CNA AND AN LPN TO SUPPLEMENT MY EFFORTS AND THE HOME HOSPICE EFFORT, WHICH WAS UNEVEN, HER CARE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THAT IN A NURSING HOME . BUT, HOME HOSPICE STILL BILLED MEDICARE $250 A DAY, WHICH WAS MORE THAN A NURSING HOME.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I SAY AGAIN THAT CONTINUITY OF COHERENT AND GRADUATED MEDICAL CARE FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT AND RELIEF FOR THE CAREGIVER IS AN ACUTE AND GROWING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS GREATER EMPHASIS IN YOUR PLAN. IT IS A - RIGHT NOW - PROBLEM, NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHIPPED AWAY AT OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF MY WIFE'S COPD COMPLICATION, WHICH REQUIRED 24/7 OXYGEN, OUR ORDEAL WAS MERCIFULLY SHORTER, LESS THAN THREE YEARS, THAN IS TYPICAL FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. OTHERS HAVE IT HARDER THAN WE DID.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I HAVE DETAILED RECORDS FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID ABOVE. I CAN PROVIDE ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU NEED FROM ME.</p>

<p>Adult day health services should be an important part of any plan to either slow the progress of Alzheimer's, improve quality of life, or to support caregivers.</p>
<p>Social interaction, rather than isolation at home, and physical and mental stimulation are keys to slowing memory loss, preventing agitation, and enhancing life.</p>
<p>Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's are more likely to suffer debilitating illnesses themselves so respite is important. Adult day health services can be all of the above.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the <strong>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias</strong>. I am glad to see some immediate increased funding for AD and the call for a research summit. I would hope to see increased emphasis on geriatric workforce development and caregiver support with more specific language (i.e. scholarship loan paybacks, exemption of geriatric training from residency caps, Medicare and State Medicaid caregiver support and respite programs).</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>David Holtzman (Washington University School of Medicine)</td>
<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td><strong><em>Charlie Glabe</em></strong> (University of California Davis)</td>
<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<td>Jeff Morby (Cure Alzheimer's Fund)</td>
<td>
<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities. Matching funds from the government for private initiatives, or the other way around, could generate considerably more private capital for focused, high level science than is the case today.</li>

<td>In regard to 1E below, there is nothing wrong with what is stated but this is not the problem! We need treatments! If there is nothing to disseminate, 1E is a waste of time. Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately. This may require new partnerships within the Federal Government and with the private sector, and outreach through new mechanisms.</td>

<td>Berislav Zlokovic (University of Southern California)</td>
<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>
</tr><tr><th colspan="2" scope="row">Beth Bishop (Volunteer -- Alzheimer's Association (via Alz Forum))</th>
<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p>Thank you for your time and commitment to the NAPA process. Your efforts are greatly appreciated. As you work diligently to prepare this landmark national plan which will help our country prepare for the coming onslaught of Alzheimer's disease, I want to urge you to address a current program that has helped thousands of families over the past twenty years but which is currently slated for dramatic cuts in 2012 and probable elimination in 2013. The Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP), also known as the Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States Program, was created by federal legislation in 1991 with the hope that it would increase access to quality services for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers nationwide. Since its inception, this program has created services for many under-served populations; Latinos, African Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, and rural families have all benefited from this investment. Many of the innovative programs created with this funding have been replicated in new cities and states such as the Guidelines for Management of Alzheimer's Disease, n evidence-based, a practice guideline for primary care physicians and the El Portal Dementia Care Network model for reaching under-served populations.</p>
<p>There have been criticisms of the program and like all programs, it could be improved. The major criticism has been that ADSSP serves relatively few families. There are two good reasons for this. First, the program was developed to serve hard-to-reach families. The initial evaluation of the program completed by Dr. Rhonda Montgomery demonstrated that you must reach thousands through culturally appropriate outreach and education in order to bring direct services to relatively small numbers of hard-to-reach families. More recently, the program refocused on bringing evidence-based programs to the broader community. While this is a good goal, it means that fewer families can be reached as these evidence-based programs deliver more intensive services to fewer people.</p>
<p>I want to urge the Council to include support for the ADSSP program in our national plan. The program needs to be institutionalized rather than remain a demonstration project. This is the only national program that is Alzheimer's-specific, delivering respite, support and education to hard-to-reach Alzheimer's families in their communities.

<p>My name is Dr. Steve Hume and I am a member of the Alzheimer's Association national Board. I was also diagnosed with AD at the age of 60.</p>
<p>Feedback: I feel the framework and recommendations to date are on target and broadly cover the important issues.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see a recommendation directed to Medicare that ensures it will develop and fund innovative in-home and in-community programs and services for persons with AD and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Many AD persons have Medicare but are inelligible for Medicaid. This precludes them from receiving in-home services, respite care and day treatment.</p>
<p>Many families cannot afford these services out-of-pocket. The result is either the caregiver reduces or eliminates their work hours or AD patients are forced into nursing home care prematurely.</p>
<p>When caregivers are unable to work the family suffers, more dollars are spent on welfare programs and the economy suffers as they leave the workforce.</p>

<p>Respite Care Funds for Care Givers:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>Respite Care funds must be made available for those people who lack private resources, funds, transportation and family support. Many caregivers provide 24 hour care in their home with no break, financial assistance or outside help. This leaves the care giver exhausted. Many of our nations care givers are elderly themselves. Caring for someone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia is a full time job. Care givers provide full time supervision, medication disbursements, ADL care (bathing, toileting and dressing), housekeeping services, meal preparation, transportation to and from appointments, etc. Many are unable to work due to the time required to care for a loved one. This depletes their funds.</p>
<p>The respite funds should be used to either place a loved one in adult day care program, hire a private duty aide/home health aide, have a senior companion volunteer come to the home, utilize nursing home and assisted living respite services or whatever community program that works for the Care Giver.</p>
<p>Currently, care givers are exhausted with no relief in sight. Many are depressed and lonely. They are cut off from their friends, church members and neighbors. They are unable to enjoy a quality of life many of us who are not full time care givers take for granted. They are unable to go to church, participate in a hobby or any other social event. Just going grocery shopping is challenging.</p>
<p>Isolation can also lead to abuse and neglect. Most care givers have the best intentions but abuse and neglect can happens when there is stress, isolation, lack of funding and lack of support.</p>
<p>Where there are respite services in a state the Care giver lacks funding and transportation. I saw first hand as a facilitator of a support group the desperate needs of the care givers. Some respite services are time consuming with lengthy paper work required. There may be waiting lists making respite services unattainable when they need it the most. Many community respite services require the care giver to transport their loved one and they are unable to provide this. Or there may be no respite community services with in their community.</p>
<p>There must be state and federal funds available for caregivers without funding to use for respite services. Each community should be looking at ways to keep the patient in the home and provide the care giver options such as home care respite services, assisted living and nursing home respite services and volunteer senior companion programs all of which provides options for the care giver.</p>

<p>I am a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner working with the Geriatric Population. I care for and diagnose Dementia on a very regular basis. After reviewing the document for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease I recommend the following amendments:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A </strong></p>
<p>Add Neuropsychologist to the list, they are invaluable in the accurate diagnosis of many of the other Dementia's and early identification of mild cognitive disorders, which will likely progress to Alzheimer's. There are not enough of these very specialized professionals to address the wave of dementia that will be occurring with this rapidly growing aging population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D </strong></p>
<p>There is a large portion of the population with Dementia, that would be best served by an Assisted Living Setting (not safe at home alone, no family support available, no skilled nursing needs). This large group often live in unsafe conditions because there is no funding source (other than private pay) for this intermediate level of care. Those that need help with meals, transportation, ADL's r/t safety (in and out tub), perhaps medication monitoring/reminders/set-up, daily checks, built in emergency call system in case of falls. This would not have to be manned by RN's like SNF in LTcare. But perhaps monitored by an LPN or Designated Geriatric Provider of some kind with training in the care of mild to moderate Dementia. Families often struggle with putting a loved one in a "nursing home", so those with Dementia are either provided too high or too low a level of care. This would very likely decrease the cost of expenditures for long-term care, as it would substantially delay the use of LTC.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.B </strong></p>
<p>Provisions for in-home respite care for those who choose to have loved ones live with them, is an invaluable service, which would allow for less caregiver burn-out and delay admission to a 24hr facility. Thus cutting down the expenditure of resources, before they are necessary</p>
<p>This Very complex issue will not be solved quickly or easily, I hope the above suggestions from a practitioners point of view are helpful in improving the quality of care and quality of life for those suffering with Dementia.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>I applaud the committee for beginning this effort to eliminate Alzheimer's Disease AND to support patients and their caregivers who are currently dealing with this devastating disease. I am a professional in the aging field with over 20 years experience in caregiver support and training as well as supervision of In-Home Aides. I also cared for my mother in my home for 4 years before she went to a nursing home for the last two months of her life, so I can speak from a professional AND a caregiver point of view.</p>
<p>By way of supporting the current caregivers and patients I see a big need for <strong>training</strong> for facility and home care staff, especially line staff in how to deal with Alzheimer's patients and the sometimes challenging behaviors they exhibit. I see a need for facilities (nursing homes or assisted living primarily, but also hospitals) to train staff in dealing with family caregivers as care partners rather than as peripheral entities. Much lack of adequate care could be avoided by clearer communication and understanding what is happening with the patient in terms of the disease.</p>
<p>There is also a HUGE need for <strong>funding for such training, for hiring more line staff in facilities, and for providing respite for family caregivers</strong> so that they can continue to do the wonderful job they do. Without adequate funding, all the "frameworks" in the world won't make a dent in the root issue. I've seen the Family Caregiver Support Program languish for 10 years now at nearly static funding levels (which is of course going backward since costs are NOT static). The Lifespan Respite program was widely applauded and has lofty goals, but has yet to see any real funding. Caregivers are tired of hearing Congress and federal/state agencies say to them, "oh, it's so wonderful what you do and we want to support you, but there's no money so here's a proclamation (or in this case a "framework") instead."</p>
<p>Again, what you have done thus far is admirable and a good first step. Now let's try to make a difference to real people on the front lines with funding to back it up.</p>

<p>I heard about this Federal, national initiative with great interest.

<p>I am attaching a proposal I have for such (nationwide) care. I would like it to be considered by the committee as part of the national plan.

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROPOSAL FOR A NEW STATE (NATION)-WIDE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM ALZHEIMER'S CARE DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The problem</strong></em>: We know that Alzheimer's Disease is putting an ever increasing burden on persons with the disease, their care-givers, the health care system, and society at large. It presents an urgent problem for our Nation, our State and our local communities.</p>
<p><strong>One key issue is finding affordable care for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. This presents significant challenges for spouses, children and friends of those with Alzheimer's. Adult children often have to leave the workplace to provide care for aging parents, resulting in economic hardships and increased emotional stress as well as physical illnesses for themselves and their family members. Spouses may also end up with financial struggles as well as social isolation and additional psychological and physical ailments at the end of their lives, taking care of their spouse with dementia. The toll on children, spouses, friends, businesses, the healthcare system, and governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, mark this challenge as a future crisis for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, there is a lack of affordable care options for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. The cost of care ranges from $4,000-$5,000/month for assisted living/memory unit care to $5,000-$7,000/month for nursing home care. Daycare is around $10/hour. Long term health insurance often pays for a limited number of years of care, requiring families to assume costs after this period ends. For many persons with Alzheimer's, Medicaid may eventually pay for their care.</p>
<p><strong>Most would agree that whenever possible, care should be given at home</strong>. The benefits of optimal home care are many, and include:</p>
<ol><li>the familiarity and security of a home-like setting</li>
<li>24/7 supervised care from familiar individuals</li>
<li>constant interaction/stimulation/socialization</li>
<li>adequate diet and nutrition</li>
<li>the possibility of regular outings outside the home, such as trips to the gym, salon or dinners out with familiar companions</li>
</ol><p><strong>In a word, such care ideally enables the person with Alzheimer's to age with dignity, respect, optimal health, and have excellent, continuous care for the rest of their lives. </strong></p>
<p>But what does this require? It often means the care-giver leads two lives, theirs and that of the person with Alzheimer's. Those who have done it know this is unsustainable and will take a significant and dramatic emotional, physical, and financial toll on them and their families.</p>
<p><strong><em>The solution</em>: What is needed for persons with Alzheimer's is <em>optimal, AFFORDABLE care in a home-like setting without requiring 24/7 care from their family members or friends</em></strong>. Imagine a world in which NO ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE! You and your family members/friends could rest assured that you would have an optimal, affordable long-term care option if you had or were to develop Alzheimer's. Although this sounds like a dream, <strong>it can become reality if several parties who are impacted by this problem (basically, all of us!) work together. THIS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT CARE DELIVERY PARADIGM, one that is NON-FOR PROFIT, IN WHICH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</strong>.</p>
<p>What would this look like? How could this be achieved? The following is a suggested model.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong><em>First, there would be a registry of individuals needing such care</em></strong>. This could be developed by the State for each county. Registries would include personal and financial information for each applicant. In addition, APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO BE LOCATED IN THE SAME AREA (COUNTY) AS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE ASSISTING IN THEIR CARE. So, for each county in Florida, a registry (waiting list) would be established showing individuals with Alzheimer's needing care as well as locations of nearby family members/friends who would need to commit to helping in their care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local homes for sale/in foreclosure would be purchased to create home settings in which the applicants would live</em></strong>. This would be the responsibility of the State, working with local governments, possibly with Federal/agency grant support. Initial costs for setting up the home might also be covered by Federal grants, possibly coupled with local government tax breaks as well as local business and charity support. Each home would have 3-4+ residents living there (depending on the size of the home) The residents for each home would be selected on the basis of their monthly incomes, with each home including a mix of upper, middle and lower income residents to insure a sufficient income stream to take care of home costs (mortgage, utilities, food). Each person in the home would be required to pay only their monthly income (be it Social Security or other pension or income source), allowing for spousal support, if that were an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staffing for each home would include a small number of full-time professional staff (again, supported by State funding/Federal grant support) as well as MANDATORY VOLUNTEERS comprised of family members/friends</em></strong>. A REQUIREMENT OF RESIDENCY IN THE HOME IS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS <em>MUST</em> WORK A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS/WEEK IN THE HOME. The less income a person living in the home has to provide to the home for his /her care, the more hours would be required of their family/friends as "sweat equity" to support the home. Volunteers would undergo criminal background checks and mandatory drug testing at their own expense. They would also undergo possible inservice/orientation training. THEIR ATTENDANCE FOR WORK SHIFTS AT THE HOME WOULD BE MANDATORY. Not showing up for their scheduled weekly times could result in their family member/friend being expelled from the home. (Family members could substitute time shifts for each other, provided they were in-serviced/screened to work at the home.) These volunteers would take care of all home needs such as meal preparation, home maintenance (cleaning, lawn work, home repair, etc.), driving residents to appointments, socializing with residents, etc. They would also complete select activities with their own family members, such as bathing and when working their shift, dressing their family member, as possible. Their general supervision and schedules would be established by the permanent staff. Given the presence of the volunteers, at any given time, there would be a minimum of a one-to-one or greater staff-to-resident ratio. That is, there would always be optimal supervision, socialization, and attention given to each resident and their individual needs. Also, given that family members would always be working at the home, <em>everyone would have a vested interest in the success of the home</em>. This arrangement would also insure that family members/friends would have exposure to Alzheimers/senior needs and care and the aging process, resulting in a more educated, informed population with respect to these issues. Finally, family members and staff would have an available, in-house network of support, to assist with any issues or emotions they might be experiencing as family members/caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Salaries of the permanent staff, although possibly a government expense, would be small in comparison to the increased burden to the State and Federal governments of escalating healthcare costs. For example, how much would Medicare and Medicaid save in not having persons with Alzheimer's over-medicated, incorrectly medicated and/or in and out of emergency rooms/hospitals/doctor's offices for preventable problems, not to mention the costs of taking care of the health issues of their family/friend care-givers? How much would Medicaid save in not having to provide indigent care to these individuals once they've exhausted all their resources?? These cost savings could be enormous.</p>
<p>A further benefit to the healthcare system might be in the training of professionals dealing with Alzheimer's care and care of the elderly given that resident physicians and other professionals in geriatric medicine might staff the homes or be on-call for the homes, increasing their direct exposure to aging individuals and those with Alzheimer's. Such an arrangement might significantly decrease the need for emergency room visits, doctor's visits, and hospital stays for persons with Alzheimer's. This would also increase professional education/experience and, as a result, might dramatically decrease healthcare costs for this population. An alternate model might include established physicians volunteering some of their time to examining residents of the homes or consulting with the permanent staff in the homes re: health issues of the residents, again eliminating unnecessary use of the medical system.</p>
<p>Residents would stay in the home, with hospice care as needed, until the end of their lives. Transfers to nursing homes might be needed in some cases. When a resident left the home permanently, another resident on the registry (waiting list) would take that individual's place, preferably matched on the basis of financial criteria to insure the continued viability of the home.</p>
<p>If less homes are needed at some time in the future (possibly due to effective Alzheimer's treatments or a cure), homes could either be sold with the purchasing agent (State or Federal government) recouping the costs + profit OR the registry model and homes could be used for those with different, chronic health issues, such as housing for adults with Autism. THIS MODEL OF CARE WOULD <em>NOT</em> AFFECT CURRENT DELIVERY MODELS in that there will always be a need for existing assisted living facilities for persons who do not want to relocate close to family members/friends, have sufficient funds to be cared for as part of different care models or in their own homes, who prefer current facilities, and/or have significant medical needs to require nursing home care. WHAT IMPLIMENTATION OF THIS MODEL PREVENTS IS THE PROFLIFERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND THE ESCALATING COSTS TO CONSUMERS, WHO, ALONG WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, WILL BE CRUSHED BY THEM.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>In conclusion, we all know that something MUST be done to care for persons with Alzheimer's. The current model of care delivery, whether done at home or in a facility, is UNSUSTAINABLE for the majority of citizens</strong>. It is crushing to care-givers, the government, the business community, and society at large. The care given to the person with Alzheimer's is often inadequate. The current model will destroy our healthcare system and economy if something isn't done soon to change it. And the human toll is most significant, for persons with Alzheimer's as well as their family members, friends, and community at large.</p>
<p><strong>What is needed is a dramatically different model of care deliver AT THE STATE LEVEL with Federal support. It must be not for profit to contain costs. It must be a model in which all levels of government (local, state, federal) work with patients, families and local businesses to provide compassionate, dignified, and quality care to persons with Alzheimer's until the end of their lives</strong>. Our country is well positioned to show the world how this can be done, and Florida, with its large elderly population, should be at the forefront of this effort. If we can put a man on the moon 40 years ago, we can solve this health care crisis and show the rest of the country and world how it can be done!</p>
