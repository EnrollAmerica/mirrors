<p><strong><em><a id="Baxter1" name="Baxter1">The Planning and</a> Implementation of Channeling: Early Experiences of the National Long-Term Care Demonstration</em></strong><strong>, Raymond J. Baxter, Robert Applebaum, James J. Callahan Jr., Jon B. Christianson and Stephen L. Day, April 15, 1983</strong>. This report describes the structure and intent of the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration, the characteristics of the ten Channeling projects, the client and system level activities of the projects, the environments in which they operated, and the factors that influenced the implementation and early operations of Channeling. It represents a status report on the first year of operation of the demonstration and provides background information for the full evaluation of the impact and cost-effectiveness of Channeling.

<p><strong><em><a id="Kemper2" name="Kemper2">Channeling Effects for</a> an Early Sample at 6-Month Follow-up</em>, Peter Kemper, Robert Applebaum, Randall S. Brown, George J. Carcagno, Jon B. Christianson, Thomas W. Grannemann, Margaret Harrigan, Nancy Holden, Barbara Phillips, Jennifer Schore, Craig Thornton and Judith Wooldridge, May 1985</strong>. A preliminary analysis of interview data at 6-month follow-up for a sample of approximately 3,000 early enrollees in Channeling indicated the following. (1) The population served was old and frail. (2) The intervention was implemented largely according to design. (3) Substantially more of the treatment group received case management and formal services than did the control group. (4) Treatment-control differences were not statistically significant with respect to hospital use, nursing home use and mortality. (5) There were indications that Channeling improved the self-perceived well-being of treatment group members compared to controls. Channeling did not significantly reduce the amount and type of informal care provided. These findings are subject to modification based on analysis of the full research sample and additional data collection.

<p><strong><em><a id="Grannemann1" name="Grannemann1">Differential Impacts Among</a> Subgroups of Channeling Enrollees Six Months After Randomization</em>, Thomas W. Grannemann, Randall S. Brown and Shari Miller Dunstan, July 1984</strong>. This report, which serves as a supplement to <em><strong>Channeling Effects for an Early Sample at 6-Month Follow-up</strong></em> (Peter Kemper, et al., 1985), addresses the issue of variation in Channeling impacts among subgroups of sample members. In general, where Channeling impacts exist, there is not strong evidence that those impacts differ markedly among various types of clients. For the most part, differences were not highly significant statistically and did not produce consistent patterns of differences across outcome measures and subgroups. The study did provide some insight into factors underlying Channeling impacts and suggested areas for further investigation.

<p><strong><em><a id="Mossel1" name="Mossel1">The Effects of</a> Sample Attrition on Estimates of Channeling's Impacts for an Early Sample</em>, Peter A. Mossel and Randall S. Brown, July 1984</strong>. In the evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration, some members of the research sample were lost to the analysis due to sample attrition. Sample attrition could distort the treatment group/control group comparison, depending on the type of attrition that occurred. This report investigates whether there was evidence of bias due to attrition in the preliminary estimates of Channeling's impacts. Essentially, the report describes the pattern of attrition, discusses how attrition bias might arise, outlines the statistical procedures used to correct for bias and contains the results obtained when this procedure is used to estimate the impacts of Channeling for key outcome measures drawn from the preliminary findings. The report concludes that no global patterns of attrition bias emerge from the analysis.

<p><strong><em><a id="Phillips3" name="Phillips3">Issues in Developing</a> the Client Assessment Instrument for the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration</em>, Barbara Phillips, et al., January 1981</strong>. This preliminary report addresses a number of issues pertaining to the development of a combined research and clinical instrument for assessing the functional status of clients in the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration. The report contains an extensive literature review, evaluation of existing instruments and appraisal of the experiences of others--both practitioners and researchers--who have used similar instruments. Recommendations are made with respect to the assessment of physical health, activities of daily living, mental functioning, social functioning, physical environment and living arrangements, service use, and financial resources.

<p><strong><em><a id="Kemper3" name="Kemper3">Initial Research Design</a> of the National Long-Term Care Demonstration</em>, Peter Kemper, Robert Applebaum, Raymond J. Baxter, James J. Callahan Jr., George J. Carcagno, Jon B. Christianson, Stephen L. Day, Thomas W. Grannemann, Jean Baldwin-Grossman and Judith Wooldridge, November 1982</strong>. The primary objective of the research in the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration was to determine the impacts of the demonstration on service utilization, public and private costs, clients and caregivers. The demonstration employed a randomized experimental design with random assignment of eligible participants to either treatment group or control group status. The sample was designed so that six percentage points was the minimum reduction in the nursing home institutionalization rate that could be detected (with 90 percent power). The statistical technique used for much of the impact estimation was multiple regression. Potential problems such as non-comparability of baseline data and sample attrition were examined separately.

<p><strong><em><a id="Brown1" name="Brown1">The Comparability of</a> Treatment and Control Groups at Randomization</em>, Randall S. Brown and Margaret Harrigan, October 27, 1983</strong>. This report analyzes the treatment and control groups in the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration and concludes that the randomization procedure resulted in groups that are very similar on observable characteristics. Even for site level comparisons, where larger differences were expected because of smaller sample sizes, the number of statistically significant differences was no larger than would be expected by chance. These findings imply that the Channeling control group provided a reliable measure of what would have happened to the treatment group in the absence of the Channeling intervention. Additionally they imply that other investigations which rely on screening data to assess other possible sources of non-comparability of data (e.g., non-comparability of baseline assessment data or differential sample attrition) would not be confounded by differences between groups at randomization.

<p><strong><em><a id="Christianson2" name="Christianson2">Informal Care to</a> the Impaired Elderly: Report of the National Long-Term Care Demonstration Survey of Informal Caregivers</em>, Jon B. Christianson and Susan A. Stephens, June 6, 1984</strong>. This report makes use of baseline data on informal caregivers to explore several issues central to informal caregiving, including the composition of the informal care network, the types and level of care provided by that network, financial assistance provided by informal caregivers, and their well-being. A total of 1,940 primary informal caregiver baseline interviews was conducted between November 1982 and May 1983 with an overall response rate of 87 percent. The caregivers were in most cases the wives, daughters or daughters-in-law of the elderly recipients of care. One-third were active in the labor market, mostly full time; almost 40 percent were 65 years or older. Primary caregivers averaged almost 6 hours per day on care-related activities. In general, the more that care was provided under stressful circumstances, the greater was the perceived burden and the lower the rating given by primary caregivers to their quality of life.

<p><strong><em><a id="Brown2" name="Brown2">Examination of the</a> Equivalence of Treatment and Control Groups and the Comparability of Baseline Data</em>, Randall S. Brown and Peter A. Mossel, October 1984</strong>. This report examines the baseline data for treatment group and control group members in the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration to determine whether they are comparable and, if not comparable on some variables, what should be done to ensure that regression estimates of Channeling's impact are not biased by such differences. Although there is strong evidence that there were no true treatment/control differences at randomization due to chance (based on analysis of screening data), a substantial number of large and statistically significant differences emerged between the two groups on baseline variables. It was concluded that differential measurement largely accounted for these differences. In the regression analysis, for non-comparable baseline variables with screen counterparts, the screen version was used as a control variable. Other non-comparable baseline variables (without a screen counterpart) were excluded from the set of control variables with the exception of hospital and nursing home days, which are replaced with information from the screen on whether the sample member was in a hospital or nursing home at screen or referred to Channeling by hospital or nursing home staff.

<p><strong><em><a id="Brown3" name="Brown3">Final Report on</a> the Effects of Sample Attrition on Estimates of Channeling's Impacts</em>, Randall S. Brown, Peter A. Mossel, Jennifer Schore, Nancy Holden and Judy Roberts, January 13, 1986</strong>. This report results from an investigation of the extent to which differential attrition from the research sample in the Channeling demonstration might have led to biased estimates of program impact. Two analytical approaches were adopted--a heuristic approach and a statistical modeling approach. The results from these approaches lead to the conclusion that, in spite of observed differences in attrition rates between treatment group and control group members, there is very little evidence that such attrition resulted in biased estimates of Channeling's impacts. The occasional bits of evidence to the contrary were scattered and inconsistent across time, Channeling model, and outcome variables.

<p><strong><em><a id="Brown4" name="Brown4">The Effects of</a> Case Management and Community Services on the Impaired Elderly</em>, Randall Brown and Barbara Phillips, February 1986</strong>. The evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration featured a randomized design in which applicants to the program were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which had the opportunity to receive Channeling services, and the control group, which was barred from participation. Both groups were interviewed at baseline, 6-months, 12-months and--for half the sample--18-months. Under this arrangement, some treatment group members could refuse Channeling case management and services, while some control group members might obtain similar services elsewhere in the community. This report bases its analysis not on treatment/control differences but on differences between those who received case management and those who did not (regardless of whether they were in the treatment or control group). Because of methodological problems, it is not possible to determine unambiguously whether case management and formal community services affect nursing home use or other outcomes. Reliable answers to these issues require data that is collected expressly to address them.

<p><strong><em><a id="Phillips4" name="Phillips4">Survey Data Collection</a> Design and Procedures</em>, Barbara R. Phillips, et al., March 7, 1986</strong>. This report documents the design and implementation of the surveys which collected data for the evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration. The report addresses the manner in which elderly sample member survey data were linked to other data sources, such as service use and cost data, death records, and the survey of informal caregivers. The organization and management of the survey process by the evaluation contractor are also described.

<p><strong><em><a id="Applebaum2" name="Applebaum2">Channeling Effects on</a> the Quality of Clients' Lives</em>, Robert A. Applebaum and Margaret Harrigan, April 1986</strong>. This report presents the impact of the Channeling demonstration on the quality of clients' lives. Channeling was expected to affect life quality through two mechanisms: (1) the provision of case management and expanded services to people who would have stayed in the community even without Channeling and (2) reduced institutionalization. Even though Channeling had no significant impact on institutionalization rates, the results generally bear out these expectations. For both the basic case management model and the financial control model at 6 and 12 months, treatment group members reported more satisfaction with service arrangements, more confidence about receiving needed services and fewer unmet needs than did the control group. There were no substantial differences between the two Channeling models on these dimensions. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-218690/AS) [<a href="/daltcp/reports/qualtyes.htm">Executive Summary</a> available here]</p>
<p><strong><em><a id="Wooldridge1" name="Wooldridge1">Channeling Effects on</a> Hospital, Nursing Home and Other Medical Services</em>, Judith Wooldridge and Jennifer Schore, May 1986</strong>. The impacts of the Channeling demonstration on hospital, nursing home and other medical service use as well as mortality can be summarized as follows. Channeling had no impact on mortality; death rates for the treatment and control groups were very high but not statistically significant. The population served was not at high risk of institutionalization. Private persons and Medicaid were the major payers for nursing home care. Nursing home use and expenditures were lower for the treatment group and the control group but the differences were not large and generally not statistically significant. Reductions in nursing home use in the Basic Model were concentrated in one site, viz., Southern Maine. Channeling reduced nursing home use for persons in a nursing home at the time of their screen for Channeling eligibility. Control group hospital use and expenditures were very high, although they fell over time. The control group exhibited a high use of and expenditures on other medical services. Channeling had no impact on the use of or expenditures on hospital, physician and other medical services. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-234341/AS) [<a href="/daltcp/reports/hospites.htm">Executive Summary</a> available here]</p>
<p><strong><em><a id="Corson1" name="Corson1">Channeling Effects on</a> Formal Community-Based Services and Housing</em>, Walter Corson, Thomas Grannemann, Nancy Holden and Craig Thornton, May 1986</strong>. Both the treatment group and control group members in the Channeling Demonstration used community services extensively. Channeling increased the use of services by the treatment group compared to the control group. The expectations at the outset of the demonstration were that such increases would be due to the fact that greater numbers of the elderly would remain in the community, as well as increased use of services by those already in the community. In reality, all the observed service-use increases were due to the latter effects, since no impact was observed on mortality or institutionalization. The largest increases in service use were observed for personal care and housekeeping services, which are the ones usually not covered by existing public programs or private insurance. There were increases in public and total costs. At the same time, there is evidence that in the Financial Control Model projects were able to use their purchasing power to reduce the per-unit costs of some services. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-236593/AS) [<a href="/daltcp/reports/commtyes.htm">Executive Summary</a> available here]</p>
<p><strong><em><a id="Christianson1" name="Christianson1">Channeling Effects on</a> Informal Care</em>, Jon B. Christianson, May 1986</strong>. Channeling was expected to increase the use of formal community-based care by the frail elderly. However, if this led to substitution of formal for informal care, the public sector would then be paying for services otherwise provided by family and friends. There was no evidence that such substitution occurred in the Basic Case Management Model. In the Financial Control Model, Channeling did lead to modest substitution of certain services, but there is no evidence of widespread substitution. Nor is there evidence of reductions in informal care by primary caregivers. The effect appears to be due to withdrawal by some friends and neighbors. Additionally, Channeling improved the well-being of primary caregivers by some measures, such as reducing caregiver worry about receiving sufficient help and increasing overall life satisfaction. This report also has an available Appendices. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-240033/AS) [<a href="/daltcp/reports/informes.htm">Executive Summary</a> available here]</p>
<p><strong><em><a id="Thornton2" name="Thornton2">Analysis of the</a> Benefits and Costs of Channeling</em>, Craig Thornton and Shari Miller Dunstan, May 1986</strong>. The principal finding of this report is that Channeling led to an increase in total costs for clients, including costs for medical and long-term care services and costs for shelter, food and other daily living expenses. The Basic Case Management Model appeared to increase these costs by about $1,300 during the 18 month period of the demonstration; this represents an increase of approximately 7 percent over the $18,500 per client costs expected in the absence of Channeling. For the Financial Control Model, costs per client increased by approximately $3,400 for the 18 month period or approximately 15 percent over the $23,000 expected in the absence of Channeling. In both models, these increased costs appeared to produce benefits in the form of reduced unmet client needs and increases in the reported levels of life satisfaction by clients. Primary caregivers also reported more satisfaction with their lives and with the care arrangements for clients. The underlying question is whether the largely intangible benefits of Channeling are worth the net costs of producing them. (NTIS Accession No. PB87-179016/AS) [<a href="/daltcp/reports/costes.htm">Executive Summary</a> available here]</p>
<p><strong><em><a id="Thornton1" name="Thornton1">Analysis of Channeling</a> Project Costs</em>, Craig Thornton, Joanna Will and Mark Davies, May 1986</strong>. This report examines a small but key aspect of Channeling--the costs of operating the demonstration itself. The ten sites incurred costs of $23 million as they prepared for and later provided case management and long-term care services to clients between September 1980 and June 1984. In addition to the project costs, the States spent $2.8 million and the technical assistance contractor spent $1.6 million between September 1980 and June 1984. During the period studied, the Basic Case Management sites enrolled 3,300 clients; the Financial Control sites enrolled 3,900 clients. Over 51,000 ongoing case-months of service were provided by the ten sites. These cost estimates correspond to the demonstration as fielded and therefore reflect the small scale extra administrative and research costs that are part of a demonstration. Based on the available literature, the estimated average costs for Channeling are comparable with those of other demonstrations.

<p><strong><em><a id="Applebaum1" name="Applebaum1">An Analysis of</a> Site-Specific Results</em>, Robert A. Applebaum, Randall Brown and Peter Kemper, May 1986</strong>. This report examines the site-specific impacts of the Channeling Demonstration in an effort to determine whether any one site or group of sites was more successful than others in achieving the objectives of the demonstration. Overall, the core case management functions were implemented consistently across the ten sites. Caseload sizes ranged from 36 per assessor/case manager in Baltimore to 54 in Houston. While there were site-specific differences in such areas as time elapsed from assessment to service initiation and overall service expenditures, no overall patterns are obvious. Similarly, the effects of environmental factors such as nursing home bed and hospital bed supply do not manifest patterns that appear to affect Channeling's impacts. There is little evidence that one site or group of sites was markedly more or less effective in achieving the objectives of the Channeling Demonstration.

<p><strong><em><a id="Grannemann2" name="Grannemann2">Differential Impacts Among</a> Subgroups of Channeling Enrollees</em>, Thomas W. Grannemann and Jean Baldwin Grossman, May 1986</strong>. This report examines the variation among subgroups in impacts of the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration. In general there was substantial uniformity of Channeling impacts within the research sample. Differential impacts, where they existed, occurred primarily for nursing home use and expenditure variables. Both the Basic Case Management Model and the Financial Control Model showed reduced nursing home use and/or cost for the small fraction of the sample residing in a nursing home when screened into the program. The Financial Control Model also reduced nursing home use for those on a nursing home waitlist at screen, though this effect appears to be confined to persons not eligible for Medicaid. The cost savings from reduced nursing home use appeared to accrue primarily to private payers rather than to the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

<p><strong><em><a id="Kemper4" name="Kemper4">The Evaluation of</a> the National Long-Term Care Demonstration: Final Report</em>, Peter Kemper, et al., May 1986</strong>. The National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration was designed as a rigorous test of comprehensive case management of community care as a way of containing long-term care costs while providing adequate care to those in need. A randomized experimental design was employed to evaluate the demonstration. Two models of Channeling were tested: (a) Basic Case Management Model (five sites), and (b) Financial Control Model (five sites). Channeling enrolled an extremely frail elderly group whose average age was 80 years. The intervention was implemented largely according to plan. Channeling increased formal community service use. It had no significant effect on nursing home use, hospitalization or mortality. Channeling led to reduced unmet needs, increased client confidence in receipt of care and increased life satisfaction. Neither model had a major effect on the proportion of informal caregivers giving care; however, Channeling increased informal caregivers' satisfaction with service arrangements and satisfaction with life. Overall, the evidence indicates that the expansion of case management and community services beyond what exists does not lead to cost savings. But it does yield benefits in the form of increased home care, reduced unmet need and greater life satisfaction for clients and their informal caregivers who bear most of the care burden.

<p><strong><em><a id="Applebaum3" name="Applebaum3">Tables Comparing Channeling</a> to Other Community Care Demonstrations</em>, Robert A. Applebaum, Margaret N. Harrigan and Peter Kemper, May 1986</strong>. Over the past decade and a half, a series of demonstrations prior to the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration have been fielded to test some form of case managed, community-based long-term care. Fourteen community care demonstrations funded through Federal Government waivers and similar to Channeling were identified. This report presents a series of tables to facilitate comparisons of the interventions, evaluation designs and estimated effects of these 14 demonstrations with one another and with the two models of community care tested under Channeling.

<p><strong><em><a id="Brown5" name="Brown5">Methodological Issues in</a> the Evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Demonstration</em>, Randall S. Brown, July 1986</strong>. This report describes the methodology used throughout the evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration and documents the major analytical issues that posed potential threats to the credibility of the analysis. It provides a more thorough explanation of the estimation procedures and test statistics employed and summarizes the investigations of specific methodological issues. These issues include sample composition, data collection procedures and estimation techniques. The one issue that might lead to distorted estimates of program impacts is the non-comparability of baseline data, based on differences in collecting data from the treatment and control groups. To avoid this distortion, baseline variables judged to non-comparably measured were excluded from use as control variables in the regression equations; where possible, they were replaced by counterparts from the initial screening instrument. All other potential problems were found to have little or no actual effect on impact estimates or their interpretation.

This report analyzes the process by which the Channeling demonstration was planned, implemented and conducted. The analysis, which is largely descriptive, is intended to: (a) establish whether the intervention was implemented as planned; (b) describe the characteristics of clients served and the costs of case management; (c) provide a basis for informed judgment about the establishment of future Channeling-like programs; and (d) give a sound contextual framework for interpreting the quantitative results presented elsewhere. The report is organized into six parts. First, it provides an overview of the demonstration. Second, it describes the management of the local projects, including cost information. Third, it addresses client recruitment, caseload characteristics, and the practice of case management. Fourth, it describes relationships between Channeling agencies and formal and informal service providers. Fifth, it depicts the long-term care environments of the Channeling sites. Finally, it addresses the implications of its findings for the impact evaluation and for the planning and management of future community care programs.
