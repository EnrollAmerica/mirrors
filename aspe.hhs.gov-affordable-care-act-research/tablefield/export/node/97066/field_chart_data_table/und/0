Individuals with saving at 23 are less likely to have 	marital breakdown in later life, rate themselves as more healthy, and reveal 	greater commitment to work. The possession of investment at 23 is positively 	related to individuals political interest. The study finds a really 	low threshold value of assets (between 300-600 Â£) above which no obvious 	additional asset effects are observed.","This study shows that assets have strong effects on various outcome 	variables. The presence of the asset at a low level matters, rather than 	its monetary value. Research should further explore why assets have these 	effects."
