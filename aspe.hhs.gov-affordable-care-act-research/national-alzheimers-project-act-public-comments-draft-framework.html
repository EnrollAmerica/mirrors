<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Arts and Aging Research</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As a pioneer in Art and Aging programming and recipient of the 2012 MetLife Foundation Creativity and Aging in America Leadership award in the category of Community, the Alzheimer's Poetry Project welcomes the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan is well formulated and seeks to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a role for arts and aging research.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize those living with the disease today and tomorrow will require the best possible care we can offer. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>Among the areas in NAPA that arts programming could be especially effective include educating family and the public about the disease and under lessening the stigma of the disease. A number of arts groups including the Alzheimer's Poetry Project have this effect when we hold workshops for family members and students. Our public arts events such as "Alzheimer's Poetry Day" held at among other locations, the National Hispanic Cultural Center held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 5th 2011 in English and Spanish is one such example.</p>
<p>A few arts programs serving people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and their families, that have extensive experience in helping to educate caregivers and in demonstrating the role that creativity can play in the health of people navigating memory loss, that have show promise in research studies include:</p>
<ul><li>"Meet Me at MoMA," The Museum of Modern Arts dementia program.</li>
<li>"Time Slips," a Storytelling project with people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</li>
<li>SONGWRITING WORKS., which engages elders, older adults and families in hands- on songwriting and performance using an internationally recognized method proven to restore health and community.</li>
<li>"The Dancing Heart," Kairos Dance, which vitally engages those with mid-to-late stage Alzheimer's, in a weekly dance and storytelling playshop that has shown to positively improve the health of participants.</li>
</ul><p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating the white paper "The Arts and Human Development: Learning across the Lifespan," which frames a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being. We recommend that the NEA have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating NAPA.</p>
<p>In the NEA, "Creativity and Aging Study The Impact of Professionally Conducted Cultural Programs on Older Adults," 2006 they write, "...In conclusion, these results point to powerful positive intervention effects of these community-based art programs run by professional artists. They point to true health promotion and disease prevention effects."</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to bring to your attention to two among many studies that show the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in improving the health and quality of life for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia including: "Singing while caring for persons with dementia<sup>1</sup>," and "Using poetry to improve the quality of life and care for people with dementia.<sup>2</sup>"</p>
<p>We must ask our selves what immediate help can we provide to people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and how can we help them to continue to actively participate in the life of a community. Arts based dementia programming offers a chance to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia and their caregivers today. Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Page 10: Action 1.B 6: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions- insert:</p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will continue to conduct evidence based clinical trials to test the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and risk factor reduction in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network serves as the foundation on which the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) is being built to serve as a primary source of information and assistance to persons in need of long term care supports and services. </strong></p>
<p>Action 2.A. 1: Educate Health Care Providers: insert:</p>
<p>"Health care providers will learn how to manage the disease in the context of other health care conditions, and about the role of the ADRC in linking people to support services in the community".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In general, persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers prefer to receive community-based long term services and supports as compared to nursing home placements</strong>. Community-based AD care should be routinely referred to in the plan.</p>
<p>Page 15: Action 2. A. 4: Strengthening the direct-care workforce -insert:</p>
<p>"HHS will strengthen the nursing home, aging services and long-term services and supports direct-care workforce through new training focused on high-quality, person-centered care for people with Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert:</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<p>From a global perspective, the NAPA law, Council and subsequent plan development have given a shot in the arm to the Alzheimer's community which has been pursuing many of the same aims of the act in countries on all five continents. Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI) would like to offer some brief comments to the NAPA planners about the broader context of your work. Though there are major differences in resources and the cost of care between developed and less developed nations, the similarities of challenges around diagnosis, family support, health system development and quality care are universal, as are the aspirations for improved treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's a disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>We offer our comments based primarily in response to draft strategies 1D and 1E, which recommend more international collaboration in the research and public health education sectors, a concept we heartily endorse.</p>
<p>ADI is the international federation of Alzheimer associations around the world, in official relations with the World Health Organization. Each member is the Alzheimer association in their country who support people with dementia and their families. ADI's vision is an improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's as a Global Public Health Issue </strong></p>
<p>The global health community is waking up to the size and scope of the problem of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. These comments review 3 global developments: information reports by our private organisation, Alzheimer's Disease International (of which the Alzheimer's Association is a member), United Nations and World Health Organization reports and actions, which have recently increased and in which the US has played and could continue to play a helpful role.</p>
<p>Since 2009, <strong>ADI</strong> has issued major data reports about Alzheimer disease and related dementias worldwide. Each report is the product of scientific collaboration, led by an epidemiologist and full research team. I would highlight the most recent report, which provides the latest evidence of the medical and social benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis as a tool on which to base further work to fight the gap between prevalence estimates of 36 million worldwide and actually numbers of people diagnosed. It is estimated that probably no more than 1 in 4 people with dementia have received a formal diagnosis, which has been identified as a significant issue in the US draft plan framework and <em>Healthy People 2020</em> objectives.</p>
<p>In September 2011 the <strong>United Nations</strong> held only its second high-level meeting on a health issue in its history. This consultation on non-communicable diseases was held to debate a policy document and the final political declaration urges that member countries: "18. Recognize that mental and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the global non-communicable disease burden, for which there is a need to provide equitable access to effective programmes and health-care interventions."</p>
<p>This UN session directed the WHO to develop a series of targets, measures and indicators for reducing non-communicable diseases to be adopted by the World Health Assembly in its May 2012 meeting.</p>
<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong>'s involvement in Alzheimer's disease dates back to at least 1982, when it held an expert meeting on senile dementia. For many years most of the focus of the WHO has been through its mental health Programme (mhGap). The programme has produced a steady body of work for international professional and public health audiences about Alzheimer's and dementia. Our summary chart of all WHO publications is appended to these comments.</p>
<p>With WHO now deeply involved in follow-on planning from the NCD summit, efforts are underway to get Alzheimer's disease recognised as the fifth major non-communicable disease. <strong><em>However we need support from the US Government to make that happen and include Alzheimer's disease in the next NCD Strategy 2013-2020!</em></strong> Alzheimer's disease was used as an example of how ageing is a factor in the growing noncommunicable disease challenge in a recent resolution passed at the Assembly's executive meeting in January, and it is certain to be debated at the assembly meeting in May.</p>
<p><strong>WHO Global Report </strong></p>
<p>On April 11 2012 the World Health Organization will release a major global report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This is the result of collaboration with over 100 experts around the world to produce a volume similar in size and style to the world report on disabilities. Basic themes of the report will include the need for improved and coordinated research, more professional development of medical and non-medical staff, family caregiver support, and better linkages between health and social services in order to support people with Alzheimer's. The report will also focus on population risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, identifying what might be done in the public health sector to better define and reduce population risk of dementia. The prevalence/diagnosis gap is also a theme of the report and it has a section on small subpopulations of people with Alzheimer's disease, such as rural, minority language speaking, or people with Alzheimer's referred to as early or younger onset.</p>
<p>The WHO will signal that we are on the brink of a global health catastrophe. Across the world, 36 million people are living with dementia today. But unlike people with other serious conditions, their plight is very often not recognised. They will argue that their condition attracts only minimal research investment and a lack of awareness about adequate care and treatment mean their condition is often made needlessly worse than it needs to be. As the global population ages the problem will only get bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Collaborations </strong></p>
<p>Though there are many cross-national, scientific collaborations we suggest the following three that go beyond the bio-medical focus and highlight some of that work as suggestions for additional directions that international collaboration in research could foster.</p>
<p><strong>JPND</strong><br />
					The EU supports the European Union <strong>Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND)</strong> to facilitate trans-European research. The idea was launched in 2008 during the French presidency of the European Union. It is a major effort to improve EU alignment of scientific strategy on Alzheimer's disease and make best use of available resources. It now numbers 24 countries.</p>
<p>JPND major effort to date has been to collaboratively create a strategic research agenda to guide activity and investments. Just released, this strategy is based on the most complete compendium of current country-by-country efforts ever created. It lays out five scientific priorities and a robust set of cross-cutting enabling activities to move the strategy forward, of which two are unique when compared to the draft NAPA framework.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>healthcare and social care research goal</strong> identifies the major disconnect between health and social care systems and proposes research activities that may address the gap. Priority activities planned include coordinated studies to validate social care interventions, evaluation of pathways to treatment and support and their effectiveness, the effects of co-morbidity in dementia care and the study of assistive technologies.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>treatments and prevention goal</strong> includes a set of activities to examine psychosocial interventions and some population health activities, with a significant public health element of the strategic research agenda is using the planned European Health Examination Study to provide new Europe-wide data on the prevalence of people with early cognitive difficulties. This could be cross-walked with the CDC work on surveillance and compared to the ongoing effort adding cognitive questions to other population health studies such as NHANES, which could to lead to better understanding of population risk factors and the challenges of co-morbid chronic conditions existing with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Prevention and Risk Reduction Studies </strong></p>
<p>We would encourage the NAPA planners to begin to think about Alzheimer's disease as the fifth non-communicable disease, and to take advantage of growing evidence that demonstrates that some of the risk of Alzheimer's and dementia is modifiable, with many of the same risk factors as the other major NCDs.</p>
<p>We support additional careful study and our members are careful not to say "prevention of Alzheimer's" but there is sound science on risk reduction and several more large European dementia prevention studies are targeting cardio-vascular and lifestyle related risk factors which will report in 2012 and 2013. These are:</p>
<ul><li>The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER)</li>
<li>The Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (PreDIVA)</li>
<li>The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT)</li>
<li>The European Dementia Prevention Initiative is a new (2011) convening body of many of these collaborators. (<a href="http://www.edpi.org">http://www.edpi.org</a>)</li>
</ul><p>10/66 Dementia Research Group</p>
<p>The <strong>10/66 Dementia Research Group</strong> is a collective of researchers carrying out population-based research on dementia, non-communicable diseases and ageing in low and middle income countries 10/66 is a part of Alzheimer's Disease International, and is coordinated by the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. All protocols, survey instruments, and de-personalised 10/66 study datasets are available for secondary data analyses, subject to scientific and ethical review. The group has run carer intervention trials as well as validated measures for dementia identification in low resource countries, both of which might find application in the US with cultural or ethnic minorities.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. AstraZeneca is a global innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines that treat the world's most serious illnesses. For decades our scientists have been researching methods to support early diagnosis, stop or slow disease progression, and to alleviate the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Dementia research is challenging, and subsequently many pharmaceutical companies have discontinued investment in this area. AstraZeneca remains committed to neuroscience research and has adopted a more flexible R&amp;D model to fully optimize external research partnerships and expertise. In 2012 we announced that our global Neuroscience Innovative Medicines Unit will be headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We applaud the government's commitment to strengthen public funding for Alzheimer's disease research thereby accelerating scientific advancement leading to new effective treatments. We support the broader initiative to engage public and private stakeholders around common goals and objectives to optimize existing activity and facilitate public-private sector collaboration. We have a global approach to medicines development and welcome the National Plan's proposal of international collaboration with other countries actively engaging in dementia research.</p>
<p>Disease modifying treatments will remain elusive unless we continue to research the underpinnings of the disease. New genetic, molecular, and cellular targets, beyond recent advances in beta-amyloid, are needed for future pharmaceutical interventions. Ongoing identification, validation, and endorsement of biomarkers enable clinical studies and help demonstrate disease modification. All at-risk patients will benefit from early detection and prevention if diagnostic capabilities are improved and a clear framework to bring effective treatments for this debilitating disease is established. The success of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the C-Path Institute Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) clearly demonstrate the positive impact public and private sector coordination can have in the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's. AstraZeneca encourages DHHS to continue this spirit of collaboration by including all appropriate stakeholders, including industry, in the overall planning process aimed at minimizing Alzheimer's Disease as a health burden by 2025.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with HHS to pave the way for innovation in Alzheimer's disease treatment and management. Please do not hesitate to contact Alice Pomponio if we can be of further assistance.</p>

<li>Promote partnerships of government, academe, industry, and advocacy groups, to foster patient recruitment and AD treatment development programs</li>
<li>Examine routes to both accelerate development of acute treatments, learning from the HIV model, and to support long-term prevention studies.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<ol><li>Establish the optimum age and tests for cognitive screening for all primary care patients.</li>
<li>Evaluate the deployment of specialized memory clinics for early diagnosis, treatment, and clinical trial enrollment, as deployed in other countries</li>
<li>Ensure incentives are in place to secure a sufficient supply of qualified professional and paraprofessional care staff</li>
<li>Ensure access to innovative therapies for AD
<ol><li>Provide comprehensive coding, coverage, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease at the predementia and dementia stages</li>
<li>Ensure new clinical evidence is adopted into coverage and payment policies in a timely manner so that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools</li>
<li>Encourage adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<ol><li>Develop and promote care infrastructure, financial planning, and behavior management strategies to support patients in their homes and in residential care.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong></p>
<ol><li>Foster AD understanding in a campaign educating payers, patients, families, and health care professionals to recognize and overcome stigma related to AD.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong></p>
<ol><li>Announce metrics, measureable annual goals and report on them.</li>
</ol><p>We would be happy to expand on these suggestions for improving the Draft Framework to better address the social and medical needs of Americans who have Alzheimer's disease and their families. Please contact me if you would us to provide any additional information.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Alliance for Aging Research, we thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Alliance for Aging Research, <a href="http://www.agingresearch.org">http://www.agingresearch.org</a>, is a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace of medical discoveries to improve the universal experience of aging and health. Our work in Alzheimer's disease includes chairing the Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition that brings together stakeholders to accelerate development of new treatments; and as an active member of the Leaders Engaged in Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) coalition, serving as co-chair of its research and drug development workgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You and Introduction </strong></p>
<p>We would like to first thank and praise the Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its swift implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In only 14 months since President Obama signed the legislation into law, HHS has appointed the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, convened the council three times, and developed both a draft framework and draft national plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, we would like to thank you for the Obama Administration's commitment of a $50 million boost in immediate funding for Alzheimer's disease research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 and for the $80 million increase in the President's fiscal 2013 budget. The announcement about the availability of these funds marks a historic moment for the country. No previous administration has proposed a research increase specific to this dreaded disease. In addition, the initiative also includes a much-needed increase of $26 million for FY 2013 to enhance support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers as well as education for providers and the general public.</p>
<p>We praise HHS for recognizing the importance of the larger demographic shift in the U.S. aging population as a motivator for success of the National Plan, which states:</p>
<p><em>NAPA offers a historic opportunity to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given the great demographic shifts that will occur over the next 30 years, including the doubling of the population of older adults, the success of this effort is of great importance to people with AD and their family members, public policy makers, and health and social service providers. </em></p>
<p>The Alliance believes that increased investment in preventing, treating or curing chronic diseases of the aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, is perhaps the single most effective strategy in reducing national spending on healthcare. As you are aware, eighty percent of seniors have at least one major chronic condition and half have two or more. Chronic diseases associated with aging account for more than 75 percent of Medicare and other federal health expenditures. Unprecedented increases in age-related diseases as the population ages are one reason the Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on healthcare will rise to 25 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025 from 17 percent today. Simply put, our nation does not have the luxury of time to address the health research needs of this population.</p>
<p>The Alliance recognizes that fiscal restraints are required in the current economic climate, and that the Administration has already extended itself to support Alzheimer's disease funding in the National Plan. However, one of our overall comments is that <strong>funding lines must be developed and additional resources provided to adequately meet the goals of an otherwise ambitious plan</strong>. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) specifically, and NIH in general, will need a funding commitment in the billion dollar range to meet the defined 2025 goal to "prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease"; FDA will need an increase of hundreds of millions to accelerate the regulatory process and promote innovation in the development of Alzheimer's disease treatments; and other agencies from AoA to CMS and HRSA will need additional resources to meet Alzheimer's-specific objectives identified in the plan that are expected to occur in conjunction with implementation of Affordable Care Act programs. The Alliance suggests that HHS create a detailed chart of current (within the next fiscal year) expected federal/private investment in each area and costs associated with meeting each goal and strategy within the plan. Otherwise, a majority of these activities look to be unfunded mandates for federal programs with already limited resources.</p>
<p>Second, the Alliance is pleased that HHS has recognized the data gaps that exist for Alzheimer's disease and has additionally committed $1.3 million for FY 2013 to address them. HHS' use of NIA-generated, peer-reviewed, figures for Alzheimer's disease prevalence is monumental. While seemingly academic, the identification and development of reliable data is the necessary starting point for accurate needs assessment and programmatic response. <strong>Data development is a cornerstone of the plan that the Alliance believes should be integrated throughout each goal as well as remain its own goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Last, the Alliance was disappointed that this draft plan did not include the inventory conducted by the federal interagency working group. It is challenging to comment on the goals and strategies of the draft plan when the rationale behind them is not included as a resource. We understand that this was the first inventory conducted and that certain federal regulations must be met before presenting it in a clear format for the public. However, we wanted to note the issue and <strong>strongly recommend that future draft plans include the inventory to allow for more informed public comment</strong>.</p>
<p>The comments below are organized by the goals and strategies identified in the plan in specific areas where we felt the Alliance had expertise and that were not already being addressed in comments submitted by the research and drug development workgroup that the Alliance co-chairs through LEAD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The Alliance praises HHS for setting a goal of 2025 to "develop effective prevention and treatment modalities." We believe that setting this goal makes sense for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NAPA legislation expires in 2025. Goal setting is valuable for mobilizing policymakers and the advocacy community, motivating researchers and industry, and galvanizing public attention and awareness of the issue. The Alliance feels strongly that HHS and NIH should be clear with the public in particular about the state of Alzheimer's disease research to manage expectations. We hope that the upcoming May Alzheimer's Research Summit will include an explanation of this goal that will be captured by the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></em></p>
<p>The Alliance is very supportive of this particular action to "examine ways to speed up the processes for bringing pharmacological treatments to market, including: identifying and validating therapeutic targets; developing new interventions: testing efficacy and safety; and regulatory approval." In fact, the Alliance spearheaded a coalition effort, Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition, <a href="http://www.act-ad.org">http://www.act-ad.org</a>, in 2006 to accomplish similar goals. <strong>HHS should consult with ACT-AD as it moves ahead with this action</strong>.</p>
<p>ACT-AD is a coalition of nearly 50 national non-profit health professional, patient, health provider and consumer organizations seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. ACT-AD's mission is to support accelerating research for transformational therapies to potentially slow, halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Until the formation of the ACT-AD Coalition, there was no point of advocacy combining the perspectives and commitment of respected advocates for women's health, consumer interests, caregiver support groups and aging interested organizations. ACT-AD is strengthened by the diversity and credibility of those voices and is bringing that strength to bear on critical issues concerning the development, review and approval of a new generation of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Under the current regulatory environment, research being performed today cannot reach patients in time to avert this disaster. CNS drugs take, on average, 13 years from initial animal studies of a drug candidate to approval. A delay of one year negatively impacts the lives of nearly 333,000 patients and their families. While these figures underscore the urgency of seeking more effective therapeutic interventions for patients with Alzheimer's disease, there are promising treatments being tested that may slow, halt or reverse Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The ACT-AD Coalition works with urgency to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The methods the Coalition uses to conduct its important work include:</p>
<ul><li>Educating healthcare professionals, providers and other key constituencies about ways to focus the attention of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials and other decision makers about the need to expedite Alzheimer's disease treatments in the crowded landscape of those vying for consideration and action.</li>
<li>Advancing ACT-AD's profile with the Food and Drug Administration officials and other key influencers and audiences as an organization that has critical mass and strategic focus to sustain a long-term commitment to improving the regulatory review of Alzheimer's disease drugs.</li>
<li>Initiating efforts to build support for FDA reform among key Congressional leaders who influence appropriations necessary for Agency reform.</li>
<li>Developing needed research and link Alzheimer's disease expertise to the Food and Drug Administration in order to support their efforts to prioritize drug review with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary base of facts.</li>
<li>Mobilizing support and pressure upon the Food and Drug Administration from outside the agency, especially through ACT-AD member organizations and collaborations with other third-party organizations.</li>
<li>Engaging the caregiver population that continues to be overburdened and unfocused on the need for political and regulatory reform.</li>
</ul><p>The ACT-AD Coalition holds periodic meetings with its members and representatives of the Food and Drug Administration. Scientific workshop topics have included clinical meaningfulness and Phase II trial issues--and the focus is always on areas relating to an open dialogue between the Food and Drug Administration and Alzheimer's disease community to advance efforts to combat the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>Our nation faces an impending healthcare crisis as the number of older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other complex health needs increasingly outpaces the number of healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to adequately care for them. If current workforce trends do not change, we will continue to fail to ensure that every older American is able to receive high-quality care. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) April 2008 report, "Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce," calls for immediate investments in enhancing the geriatric competencies of the entire workforce, increasing the recruitment and retention of geriatric specialists and caregivers, and improving the way that care for older adults is delivered.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>First, direct-care workers provide critical support to older adults in need of long-term care, providing eight out of every ten hours of paid service delivered.<sup>2</sup> This field, which is increasing at three times the rate of other jobs within the United States economy, provides the best opportunity for caring individuals to obtain vital employment positions.<sup>3</sup> There is also a significant shortage of health professionals and direct-care workers with specialized training in geriatrics and an even greater shortage of the geriatrics faculty needed to train the entire workforce. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions programs are the <strong>only</strong> federal programs that increase the number of faculty with geriatrics expertise in a variety of disciplines and offer critically important geriatrics training to the entire healthcare workforce. Title VIII Geriatrics Nursing Workforce Development Programs are the primary source of federal funding for advanced education nursing, workforce diversity, nursing faculty loan programs, nurse education, practice and retention, comprehensive geriatric education, loan repayment, and scholarship.</p>
<p>The $6 million investment by the Administration for "provider education and outreach" will barely scratch the surface in addressing shortages in geriatric workforce and training outlined in actions under Strategy 2.A. <strong>Much more substantial investment is needed to fund the recommendations by IOM and we suggest that HHS revisit that report and the three others that came before it</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if more students enter geriatrics training, incentivizing them to stay will require loan forgiveness options. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S. 1095, the "Caring for an Aging America Act" that <strong>would amend the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) requirements to add geriatrics and gerontology to the permanent eligibility</strong>. This small change in the language governing eligibility for NHSC loans would mean that geriatrics and gerontology specialists would always be eligible for NHSC loans as opposed to the current situation which is that these geriatrics and gerontology specialists can only participate in the program if the HHS Secretary so designates it. An additional advantage is that <strong>the loan forgiveness would be fully funded through the NHSC</strong>.</p>
<p>By 2030, our nation will require 3.5 million additional healthcare professionals and direct-care workers to fulfill the growing demand for care. <strong>The National Health Care Workforce Commission, established by the Affordable Care Act, will play a central role in formulating a national strategy for bolstering the healthcare workforce in order to meet the needs of the escalating number of older Americans</strong>. There is no mention of the commission in Strategy 2A.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services </strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the use of warning signs to promote early detection by providers and patients may create confusion in the public. Warning signs for Alzheimer's disease have not been validated and are not promoted as screening instruments; however, concern has been raised that individuals experiencing cognitive deficits and their families may treat warning sign lists as a screening tool.<sup>4</sup><strong>Although warning signs are publicized by several national organizations for educational purposes, they are not a substitute for a structured screening or consultation with a primary care provider</strong>. Further, the utility of these warning signs is questionable since the individuals in whom these problems are first noticed are frequently well into a dementia course. In addition:</p>
<ul><li>Most of the warning signs may be indicative of a number of other health issues, including everything from depression (changes in mood/personality) to transient ischemic attack (problems with language/disorientation). There is often no mention that these warning signs may indicate other conditions.</li>
<li>By the time any one or more of the warning signs presents the individual may be in the early moderate/moderate stage at best so "early detection" is a misnomer.</li>
<li>Warning signs may be useful in raising public awareness about Alzheimer's disease. However, elevating warning signs to an early detection tool and then placing the onus of recognition on those with the illness and their loved ones is not sound policy--especially given that anosognosia (unawareness of a problem of cognition in oneself, usually to the point of vigorously denying the problem) is a common symptom for individuals with the disease.</li>
<li>Moreover, promoting the use of warning signs among individuals and family caregivers may serve as a disincentive to providers to learn more about proper, proactive detection methods.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes </strong></p>
<p>Behavioral issues are a main reason that psychoactive medications are administered in long-term care settings, which may result in increased falls, increased mortality and increased confusion. There has been increased focus on the use of "atypical" antipsychotic medications in particular, after FDA introduced its black box warning in 2005 and for "conventional" antipsychotics in 2008 for patients with dementia.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In May 2011 the HHS Office of the Inspector General released a report Medicare Atypical Antipsychotic Drug Claims for Elderly Nursing Home Residents," which found that over a six month period from January-June 2007, 51 percent of Medicare claims for atypical antipsychotic drugs were erroneous, amounting to $116 million.<sup>6</sup> The report found that over 726,000 of the 1.4 million atypical antipsychotic drug claims for elderly nursing home residents did not comply with Medicare reimbursement criteria. The claimed drugs were either not used for medically accepted indications as supported by the compendia or not documented as having been administered to the elderly nursing home residents. The OIG report concludes "We suggest that CMS either use its existing authority or seek new statutory authority to <em>prevent payment</em> [emphasis added] and hold nursing homes responsible for submitting claims for drugs that are not administered according to CMS's standards regarding unnecessary drug use in nursing homes."</p>
<p>The two main reasons for overuse of antipsychotics in nursing home residents with dementia are 1) understaffing and 2) lack of training. Required staff ratios have been suggested for years by nursing home advocates but Congress is reluctant to touch the issue. Training was somewhat addressed in the Affordable Care Act as part of the Nursing Home Transparency provisions, but the training section only applies to nursing assistants--not supervisors. <strong>Dementia training for nursing home staff should apply to nursing supervisors as well as assistants</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes the issue even more complicated is that there is valid use for antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. A September 2011 report, a comparative effectiveness review prepared for AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program by the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center, based at the RAND Corporation, found statistically significant evidence for risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, for the off-label indications of dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>There are provisions in the Nursing Home Reform Law, enacted in 1987, that clearly define appropriate use of psychoactive drugs, circumstances when antipsychotic drugs should be limited and provides for review of a patients drug regimen. CMS guidance to surveyors in the State Operations Manual8also encourages facilities to use non-pharmacological alternatives, identifies situations where antipsychotic medications are not indicated,9 and provides an investigative protocol for unnecessary drugs, including antipsychotic drugs. Despite these strong provisions antipsychotic drug use remains a serious concern, in part because the law, regulations, and surveyor guidance are inadequately and ineffectively enforced. <strong>Stronger enforcement of these standards would make an enormous difference</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>As HHS considers ways to strengthen its National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, the Alliance looks forward to working with you. Thank you for considering our views, and please do not hesitate to contact Alliance for Aging Research Director of Public Policy Cynthia Bens if you have any questions or would like additional information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Professor, Researcher and Author comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over three decades I have worked as an educator at the University level, and therapist with individuals who have either been just diagnosed with early on-set of Alzheimer's Disease, mild- to moderate stages of the disease as well as late stage Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I have taught at Colleges and Universities across the United States as well as in many countries internationally. Being a two time Fulbright Scholar in Global Health Studies, I have dedicated my academic career to both teaching, researching and authoring creative and innovative approaches on how to best provide programming to those afflicted with this disease. I welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>In recent years, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as creative arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement programming; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, and cognitive training are recognized in small scale studies and are the basis of research information taught and practiced at the University level in career areas such as Therapeutic Recreation, Creative Arts Therapies, Movement and Dance Therapy and Art Therapy. These non-pharmacological approaches have emerged as a grassroots movement responding to an evolution of evidence, put into research and implemented in Social Adult Day Programs, Assisted living Facilities, and Long Term Nursing Facilities.</p>
<p>However small these studies, research is continuing to suggest that some individuals will slow the progression of dementia and have the potential to improve or revert back to normal memory with early interventions due to structured cognitive stimulation (Pressley, J., Trott, C. &amp; Tang, M., 2003; Chertkow, H., et al., 2001). Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that activities in the mental, physical and social domains have protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia (Flatiglioni, et al. 2004; Gilley, W., Wilson, L., Bienias, L., Bennett, A. &amp; Evans, A., 2004; Claire, L., Wilson, B., Carter, G., Roth, I. &amp; Hodges, J.,2004; Davie, J., et al., 2004). More specifically, continued active participation in life through social involvements and activities that are individualized and person centered to each individuals needs and skills have been documented to enhance feelings of self esteem, self worth and directly impact overall quality of life (Pruessner, J., Lord, C., Meaney, M. &amp; Lupien, S., 2004; Manly, J., et al., 2005; Kumara, R., et al., 2005). A National study of all research related to early stage dementia indicated that the need for psychosocial support for persons newly diagnosed should take place soon after receiving the diagnosis to prevent dropping social support networks, cognitive decline and leading to increased institutionalization rates (Brodaty, H., Gresham, M., &amp; Luscombe, G., 1997; Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2003). In a review of the literature regarding early stage AD it has been documented that multi-modal approaches have the most significant outcomes (Burgener, S., et al., 2007). The TTAP Method, a multi-modal approach has been documented in a pilot study (Alders, A. &amp; Levine Madori, L., 2010) to improve cognition in Hispanic elderly in a Social Adult Community Day Center in Buffalo, New York and in a research study with Rehabilitation Patients at Helen Hayes Hospital the method proved to increase overall feelings of self control and pain management (Levine-Madori, L., 2009).</p>
<p>Research in the area of non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care is still being ignored, and yet it continues to remain the most economically sound approach. In a data collection in 2010 on a Gero- psychiatric unit at Lyndon Oaks at Edward Hospital located in Naperville, Illinois, staff was trained in The TTAP Method. Pre- training data collection documented the unit had an average of 90 hours of aggressive interventions a month. These interventions were carried out by a Nursing Supervisor. Six months into staff implementing of thematic person-centered creative arts programming the aggressive behaviors went down to an average of 4.6 Nursing Interventions. Falls went from an average of 5 per month to 3, this statistics validate a direct healthcare savings of over $80,000.00 in just a six moth period. <a href="http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php">http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php</a> .</p>
<p>A world without Alzheimer's, might very well be a real possibility in the future. However, the current 5.4 million people who currently have the disease and the estimated 10,000 people daily diagnosed each and every day will still need daily non-pharmaceutical innovative programming, treatment and care. As an Art Therapist, Recreation Therapist and Ph.D. it is my belief that the current research agenda is narrow in scope and leaves research in the non-pharmaceutical -creative arts completely out of the discussion. For decades we as a society have poured millions of dollars into pharmaceutical research, which to date has yet to make an impact. It is my belief that it is crucial at this point in time, just as the baby boomers are starting dramatically impact the "graying of America". As you probably are aware, it is estimated by the National Association on Alzheimer 's disease, in 2011, that one of every 8 baby-boomers are predicted to have some form of cognitive impairment in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The time for researching the non-pharmaceutical approaches and putting research into practice is now! Those who have dedicated their lives to people afflicted by this disease process understand that these individuals LIVE with the disease for many years. The average person diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease now lives 15 years and must be given meaningful and person-centered daily therapeutic interventions. Without research we cannot move forward in the healthcare areas such as Art Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Music Therapy, etc. to provide research based, best practice approaches. Please know that these healthcare fields in the Creative Art Therapies, Therapeutic Recreation, and Music Therapy are in fact where daily treatment and ongoing cognitive, social, emotional and physical stimulation comes from. Research money is needed to be earmarked for these healthcare professionals and the research that they do in non- pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share thoughts and suggestions with you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>AAN Comments on Draft <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the American Academy of Neurology, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the highly comprehensive and needed <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> (Plan).</p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is the largest scientific and professional organization for neurology in the United States. Representing more than 25,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals, the AAN strives to promote the highest quality patient centered neurologic care. The AAN is proud to support the overall Plan and fully supports the vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease. The AAN is further pleased that a neurologist, Dr. Ron Petersen, was named as chairman of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>The AAN is committed to playing an active role in supporting the objectives of the Plan. Our feedback in the following areas is provided for your consideration as you refine the Plan framework:</p>
<ul><li>Neurologists' Role in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</li>
<li>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</li>
<li>Quality Measurement Considerations</li>
<li>Current AAN Dementia-related Resources</li>
<li>Submission to the CMI on Alzheimer's Care Delivery</li>
<li>Concluding Remarks</li>
</ul><p><strong>Neurologists' Role in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br />
					The science and practice of neurology are integral to efforts to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD), diagnose it, treat it, and slow its progression, as well as, provide support for patients suffering from the disease and their caregivers. Neurologists are specifically trained to manage AD and other chronic disorders of the brain and central nervous system.</p>
<p>Neurologists:</p>
<ul><li>Conduct basic and translational AD research</li>
<li>Provide a comprehensive assessment including clinical diagnostic evaluation and evaluation of cognitive deterioration over time</li>
<li>Make decisions regarding treatment for patients with AD " Engage in follow-up visits every three to six months for patients with AD</li>
<li>Provide patients and caregivers with decision aids, such as comprehensive end-of-life counseling and advance care planning</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of multidisciplinary teams, neurologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD. The role of the neurologist in the care continuum of AD is critical.</p>
<p>Many factors contribute to the current variations in care that patients with AD receive in the US. The AAN believes that improving care coordination among health care providers, strengthening education and support for AD caregivers, and increasing rates of early diagnosis would have a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.A.: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</strong><br />
					The AAN strongly supports increased investment in AD research. Current funding levels are vastly disproportionate to impact of the disease now, and will be greatly exacerbated as prevalence increases in the future as the US population ages if funding trends remain unaltered. In addition, there is a tremendous gap between the research budgets for AD and dementia (approximately $450 million) and the research budgets for other diseases like HIV/AIDs (approximately $3 billion). The AAN believes in the need to raise the profile of AD research to bring it in line with its present and expected impact to the country.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</strong><br />
					Expanded educational efforts are important in reducing care variations and preparing the health care work force for an aging population. However, the AAN would note further support for expanding the supply of well-trained specialists is critical as more complex diagnostic tests and AD therapies become available.</p>
<p>The AAN agrees that a sufficient workforce is necessary to have high quality health care. Though reimbursement issues are not directly addressed in the Plan, they undoubtedly shape care delivery. Spending needed time face-to-face with patients diagnosing and coordinating care for complex neurologic diseases such as AD is undervalued in the current fee-for-service payment model. A lack of proper payment threatens the future supply of individuals trained specifically in neurology, which is of particular concern since neurologists are key to a timely diagnosis.</p>
<p>There is a large role for case managers to handle some of the social aspects of AD care, including the provision of support or information about next steps to caregivers, so that physician can focus on medical issues.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Measurement Considerations</strong><br />
					Since there is still limited evidence and effective treatments for AD, it is intrinsically difficult to develop high standard quality measures. However, the AAN agrees that care quality should be measured to the extent possible, and has developed a quality measure set for dementia that was recently approved by the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI).</p>

<p><strong>Submission to the CMI on Alzheimer's Care Delivery</strong><br />
					The AAN met with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in early 2012 to discuss a suggested concept for modernizing the way care is delivered to patients with AD through a cooperative care team including neurologists, geriatricians/primary care physicians, geriatric psychologists, neuropsychologists, case managers, social workers, nurses, dietitians, and pharmacists. The concept goes on to address a major problem in the current delivery system for AD care: the misalignment of financial incentives that are causing monetary constraints to providing coordinated care.</p>

<p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><br />
					Broad collaborations with private and non-profit entities should be encouraged and incentivized at the grassroots level to accomplish many of the goals outlined in the Plan, especially those involving caregiver support and quality of life interventions for patients. The AAN stands ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, and specialists), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and dissemination of its work. The AAN remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We appreciate your consideration of our comments. Please direct any questions, requests for clarification, or dialogue regarding our comments to Katie Shepard.</p>

<p>There are numerous improvements in the draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease from the initial framework plan. Additional areas of the plan still need strengthening and improvement. CCAL appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to help strengthen the draft plan. The comments follow.</p>
<p><strong>General </strong></p>
<ul><li>CCAL suggests that the plan include the words "other dementias" and be known as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias. The terms "Alzheimer's" and "dementia" are often used interchangeably. Many internists and family practice physicians (among others in the health care field), for example, are still not well educated about assessing and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and use the general term "dementia" to explain cognitive decline to patients and their families. The addition of the terminology "other dementia" is more inclusionary and desirable.</li>
<li>Person-centered care is the widely recognized gold standard of services and supports for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PWD) (Alzheimer's Association, 2006; Edvardsson, et al, 2010). It is a foundational aspect of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The draft plan is silent about person-centered care. CCAL suggests that the plan integrate the philosophy and orientation to person-centered care throughout the plan.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Challenges Section</strong> (page 4)</p>
<ul><li>Notably missing as a national challenge is the over prescription and utilization of antipsychotic medications as a first line of management for behavioral challenges experienced by PWDs. The medical community as well as the formal and informal caregiver communities need to be educated about non-pharmacologic approaches to such behavioral challenges as agitation. Medications should be used only if and when non-pharmacologic approaches have not been effective. There is currently a dearth of readily accessible information about recommended non-pharmacologic approaches and practices.</li>
<li>Also missing as a national challenge is recognition that the quality of programs and services for PWDs who reside in residential long-term care (assisted living, nursing homes) across the nation continues to be uneven and often less than optimal. There is no national focus on or effort to address quality for these long-term care programs and services despite the fact that the number of people living with dementia will increase over fifty percent by 2030.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Plan's Three Guiding Principles</strong> (page 5)</p>
<ul><li>CCAL applauds the second Guiding Principle that supports public-private partnerships. We recommend that the detail for this principle be expanded to specifically include dementia experts who represent the practice, policy, and research sectors. All too often senior executives are included on advisory panels solely because of their positions. Unfortunately they often lack actual dementia expertise and experience. It is vitally important that the national plan be developed, planned, and implemented by a diverse group of dementia experts who can provide "face validity" both to the plan and the process of its development and implementation.</li>

<p>I would like to thank Mr. Ellenbogen for his supportive remarks regarding my comments on the National Plan to fight Alzheimer's disease. I hope that HHS and the Secretary will consider these comments as they revise the Plan. We are truly at a unique stage in our fight against Alzheimer's that will have implications for years to come. Developing an Office that is singly focused on coordinating and organizing efforts to fight Alzheimer's disease as well as to provide feedback to HHS and the Advisory Council as well as Congress is essential as we move forward. While there is certainly the possibility that this may step on toes within HHS and/or the NIH, it is something we literally cannot afford to do if we are serious in our efforts to fight Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, developing this infrastructure at the beginning of the Plan rather than years later will likely save money and lives into the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>I would like to commend and thank Bruce Lamb, who is an Alzheimer's researcher and Staff Scientist at Department of Neuroscience, in the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. He shared his view points on January 13, 2012, under the SUBJECT: Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, in the public forum.</p>
<p>I found his view point's very interesting and highly recommend reading if you have not already done so. He also had an attachment that was titled, Right sizing funding for Alzheimer's disease, which was written by Todd E Golde, Bruce T Lamb, and Douglas Galasko and published May 6, 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/Comments/cmtach27.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/Comments/cmtach27.pdf</a></p>
<p>I really like these paragraphs, which I extracted for your reading.</p>
<p>If one assumes that funding for HIV/AIDS was right sized to enable translation of basic discoveries to successful therapies, then given the lack of effective AD therapies, one possible implication is that funding for AD has been insufficient. A quick comparison of funding levels for HIV/AIDs relative to AD in the United States suggests this may be at least one factor that has hindered the translation of AD discovery to effective therapies. Based on publicly available data, National Institute of Health funding for HIV/AIDS in the United States is currently approximately $3 billion [5]. With approximately 1 million HIV-positive subjects in the United States, this equates to $3,000 of NIH funding per person with HIV/AIDs. In contrast, current NIH funding for AD is at a level of approximately $450 million [5], with perhaps another approximately $100 million to $200 million in NIH funding that might have some relevance to the study of AD (cognitive decline in aging, related neuro degenerative conditions). With a current prevalence of approximately 5 million individuals affected with AD in the United States, this equates to a maximum of $130 of NIH funding per person affected with the disease. So, on a per affected individual basis, NIH funding for HIV/AIDs is 23 times the level of that for AD.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different ways to evaluate proportional or relative funding. Another one that is quite germane is economic impact. For AD in the United States this is estimated at more than $170 billion per year (and worldwide at $600 billion per year) [6]. Again focusing only on the United States, the yearly funding for research by the NIH represents 0.4% of the yearly costs of the disease in the United States. In other words, for every $2 the disease costs the United States, we spend less than 1 cent on research.</p>
<p>There are many people who believe in reinventing the wheel when undertaking a new project or endeavor. I have always been a firm believer that the people before us have laid the framework need to get started so we are not wasting a lot of time on the basics. The only approach I always followed along with that is, to delete, enhance and critique to make the plan even better. I always did that by asking the previous plan makers what they realized they did wrong and what would they do different. Ninety percent of that frame work would usually come from the best of many minds. I really believe the input and suggestion made by Bruce Lamb, be discussed when building this framework.</p>
<p>One thing that keeps coming to mind is the disparity issue related to AD. Am I the only one that sees this, or do we all just not want to talk about it. For example AD was first identified and named in 1906, while AIDS was identified in 1981. I see us now in the same stages as HIV was in 1988, when a focused effort was begun towards treatment or cure, with the creation of The Office of AIDS Research. It took an additional 5 years to strengthen this OAR (The NIH Revitalization Act), which really made a huge difference. Within three years of that day and by 1996 we started to finally have an impact on AIDS.</p>
<p>Let's not make a similar mistake as we did with HIV. Let's create a diseased focused agency for AD, with all the necessary strength, as of day one. Just think you can make up for the disparity that has been created and just maybe we could have a cure in less than 5 years.</p>
<p>Let me leave you with one last thought that I have not heard or seen anywhere. I think the government should offer a large sum of money to anyone who can come up with the cure for this disease first. While I am not sure what that amount should be it can be in cash and partial tax credits. I think that will drive many more into this arena and more efforts if the pie is big enough. Just think of all the savings insurance companies can benefit, not to mention the government. They may all be willing to help in that funding. Just a though. Sometimes you have to be creative and think outside the box.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS OF CONSTANT CARE FAMILY MANAGEMENT SUBMITTED<br />
					TO HSS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					MARCH 5, 2012</strong></p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunity to offer our comments and recommendations regarding the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p>As memory care experts, our Autumn Leaves assisted living communities provide families and residents with compassionate care and innovative solutions that help our residents create a sense of well-being in a comfortable, home-like environment. While reviewing the Draft Framework, we agree with our industry partner, The Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA) that the framework is a good start but there are more components that need to be added to the story.</p>
<p>The recommendations below offer ideas, interpretations and new measures in the draft where we think the strategy can be better fortified to help industry professionals, and residents and their families make more informed decisions while promoting the need to educate, train, detect and respond faster to this deadly disease. Thank you for the opportunity to hear our voice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					Training and specialized programs need mandating for general practitioners, and the healthcare industry overall to recognize early signs and symptoms. Requirements need to be established for individuals 70 years of age and older. Parameters, tools, programs and interview questions that allow physicians to screen for Alzheimer's and dementia need to be implemented much like the way breast cancer checks and prostate exams are set up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					While guidelines for delivery of high-quality care and measures are needed, even more important is the focus on specialized cognitive care activities such as the way to evaluate an individual's ability to complete day to day activities. The goal should be to improve an individual's life by identifying their remaining abilities and offering recommendations and strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					More training and programs need to be implemented on the potential impacts of cognitively impaired individuals, and how transitions disorient and stress the individual.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Better controls and programs need to be established to understand family systems which can oftentimes present a barrier to diagnosis and treatment. Identify the cultural dynamic of communication in order to offer support, education, awareness and help. Likewise, provide support and assistance for younger families so they can have access to the latest information: where to get help, programs designed to provide that help and community outreach services to offer support.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					More awareness programs and information about the importance of planning for healthcare decisions and disease progress need to be available. The primary physician and social worker roles need to be better quantified so they can better help families navigate through this process. Recognition of specific dementia care and related long-term care settings must be identified by policy makers and the insurance industry. More help is needed to assist families with guardianship and how to plan ahead, understand how to deal with crisis moments and realize they need professional legal help for healthcare issues and financial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Programs, training and information need to be available to help educate families and individuals on recognizing abuse and exploitation. Consequently, safety programs, education and training need to be implemented to address issues like wandering and safe return/finding.</p>
<p>A series of safety programs need to be implemented to help:</p>
<ul><li>Caregivers prepare their homes for a loved one living with Alzheimer's.</li>
<li>First responders such as police, fire department, EMS and emergency room personnel understand the necessary steps to take when aiding individuals who are living with Alzheimer's or dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As the disproportionately high rate of African-Americans versus whites living with Alzheimer's continues to rise, more educational services need to be available in the African-American communities to help increase a greater awareness and knowledge-base of the warning signs of Alzheimer's and dementia. The Alzheimer's Association statistics illustrate that the age-specific prevalence of dementia has been found to be 14% to 100% higher in African-American.* The number of African-American age 65 and over will more than double by 2030, from 2.7 million in 1995 to 6.9 million.</p>
<p><strong>The Wandering Emergency</strong><br />
					Wandering is considered an Emergency. Although common, wandering can be dangerous -- even life threatening: speed is of the essence. The statistics show very poor outcomes for elderly wanderers missing beyond 24 hours, and many people cannot remember their name or address. They may become disoriented and lost even in their own neighborhood, and they may become fearful and hide. Many states do not track or report wandering and locating current, up to date statistics are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Wandering is an emergency situation and part of the disease process:</p>
<ul><li>6 in 10 people with Alzheimer's disease will wander.</li>
<li>18% of those with mild dementia wander.</li>
<li>50% of those with severe dementia wander.</li>
<li>Wandering has proven such a common behavior that experts predict 60% to 70% of all people with Alzheimer's will wander away from safety at least once during the course of their illness.</li>
<li>Many will wander 6 to 8 times before they are placed into a residential facility or an outside, qualified caretaker is brought into the home to help.</li>
</ul><p>At Autumn Leaves, we're exploring ways to adapt our communities into designated <em>Safe Havens</em>. We know as individuals lose more and more of their memory, they will often go in search of a particular person, place or thing.</p>
<p>We are working to provide a service where anyone in the public sector that finds an individual wandering, confused of their whereabouts or are lost, can bring that individual to an Autumn Leaves <em>Safe Haven</em> until authorities or family members are contacted. We want to be able to help the emergency responders, and give them the aid and support they need to return individuals back to their loved ones.</p>
<p>Our solution to this very serious issue is multi-faceted:</p>
<ul><li>Expansion of the Silver Alert Program needs activation standards set by federal legislation to ensure there is seamless integration nationally instead of state by state much like the Amber Alert system introduced in 1996. Approximately 29 states have a Silver Alert or similar programs -- all states need to implement and participate.</li>
<li>Education on wandering prevention needs implementation along with understanding GPS technology or emerging technologies.</li>
<li>The Safe Haven concept for 'found' wanderers needs regional awareness to inform the public where and how to find Safe Havens. Likewise, they will need to be informed of the steps in bringing Alzheimer's or dementia wanderers to safe communities.</li>

<p>CARIE previously submitted comments about the importance of including unbefriended elderly with Alzheimer's disease in the National Plan. Even though they do not have a voice and are often hidden in communities throughout the country, the needs of these individuals should not be overlooked. Please consider adding this population to Strategy 2.G: <em>Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The unbefriended elderly are clearly disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease and should not be overlooked as this epidemic grows. Should you need any additional information, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your consideration to this recommendation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, submitted to the HHS Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong></p>
<p>The Pioneer Network is pleased to have this opportunity to submit comments relating to the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The creation of this plan represents an important opportunity to outline and launch a national approach to curbing a disease that negatively impacts millions of elders as well their families and communities. We agree that this national effort is a critical step for securing a brighter and higher-quality future for those affected by the disease today, as well as those that will be affected in years to come. Pioneer Network commends the Department of Health and Human Services and the Advisory Council on their action to move this agenda forward.</p>
<p>Pioneer Network is a national non-profit that serves as the leading national voice for culture change in long-term care and the promotion of person-centered care, dignity and choice for all elders. Pioneer Network achieves this mission by convening researchers, policy makers, regulators, providers, and consumers with a nationwide network of state Culture Change Coalitions to design and deliver the highest quality, evidence-based, person-centered approaches to enhancing the lives of elders, wherever they may reside. In the context of this approach, we submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for consideration:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Appropriate Domains</strong>: Pioneer Network is fully supportive of the goals of the plan as well as its comprehensive approach. Any responsible strategy to address Alzheimer's disease in the 21st century must include the elements already represented in this draft framework, with approaches targeting: research to improve prevention and treatment, care and support for people living with the disease and their families, public awareness, and measureable milestones. We are excited to see an emphasis on each of these areas, as they are the key to addressing the disease.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing the Person with Alzheimer's</strong>: There is no question that the need for increased investment in research to better prevent, diagnose and treat Alzheimer's is essential. In coming decades the impact of these efforts will be the ultimate discovery of a cure, with disease-modifying treatments in the interim. However, while strongly desired, such developments do not appear to be on the immediate horizon. Well in front of the horizon, presently straining our communities and healthcare system, are the more than five million people living with Alzheimer's today. These individuals and families need to know that while research moves us toward the future, their needs today remain a top priority; that they are not placed in second position to a potential greater good. Therefore, we recommend re-arranging the plan so that care for people with the disease is the #1 goal. By doing so, the plan sends a clear message that it is a top priority to serve people with the disease, by embracing, promoting and disseminating the many effective approaches to Alzheimer's care that are known today to improve quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Person-Centered Care</strong>: In the section entitled <em>Enhancing Care Quality and Efficiency</em>, the concept of "person-centered approaches to care" is noticeably absent. Person-centered (or person-directed) care approaches are the cornerstone of high quality care for people with Alzheimer's, as these approaches allow the individual continued autonomy to live their life in a manner consistent with their own values, preferences and desires. Alzheimer's disease is a condition that robs individuals of many aspects of independence, yet does not have to remove their ability to receive care in their manner of choice. We view the concept of person-centered care as embedded so deeply in any approach to achieving quality care, that we recommend replacing section <em>2.D. Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em>, in the current document, with "<em>Promote Effective Person-Centered Approaches to Care Across Settings</em>." First, we would note that evidence-based, consensus-approved guidelines for the care of people with dementia in many of the settings of interest already exist, including nursing homes, assisted living, and home care, with well established standards of care present in other settings as well. Thus, it is not the identification of guidelines that is the key success driver to quality care, but rather the use of the person-centered approaches that are included in the existing guidelines. Second, there are many resources and programs, developed by leading organizations in the field, currently available to guide organizations on how to provide person-centered approaches to care. Thus, stepping back to focus on guidelines is more of a regression than a progression in the field; the person-centered care paradigm already exists and is ready for dissemination. Thus, we recommend the change stated above to focus on bringing visibility to existing person-centered approaches and promoting their use as widely as possible in every care setting. Even if the Council considers this proposed change to the language of 2.D as being a step too far, in order to ensure that the document is relevant in the current care field it is important to include an emphasis on person-centered care, which should be highlighted as paramount in any approach to care outlined in this national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Care Settings</strong>: Also in the section entitled <em>Enhancing Care Quality and Efficiency</em>, there is an important recognition that people with Alzheimer's live and receive care in many different types of settings. However, it is particularly noticeable in the introduction to this section, as well as in other areas, that several key settings are omitted. "People's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, and nursing homes" does not nearly cover the range of care settings available to meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's. Certainly the inclusion of "nursing homes" is not intended by the authors to include all forms of residential care, given that it has a particular meaning in terms of licensure that does not include: assisted living, board and care homes, independent living, continuing care communities, or even memory care homes, all of which are settings in which people with Alzheimer's live. Further, there is no recognition of the role of Alzheimer's-specific (or general) adult day care settings. We recognize it could be cumbersome to list all possible care-related settings in a document such as this proposed plan, but would minimally suggest including assisted living, memory care and adult day care, or secondarily, replacing "nursing homes" with "long-term care residences," "long-term services and supports," or "adult day programs and various shared residential settings." Any of these options would be preferable to simply neglecting these other important places where people with Alzheimer's spend their time.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Language</strong>: Anyone who has been involved in the field of Alzheimer's knows the importance of language; essentially the "PC of Alzheimer's." Language can be used to either empower people with the disease to maintain their personhood and dignity, or it can increase stigma and marginalize people with the disease. Overall, this document does a nice job with language and is respectful of those affected by the disease. However, there are a couple points we have noticed where Pioneer Network suggests simple revisions to help make the plan more empowering for those it is intended to serve.
<ul><li>Replace "Patient" with "Person with Alzheimer's" or a similar derivation, in every case. While directly receiving care in an acute care setting, people with Alzheimer's may in fact be "patients" of the healthcare providers; yet in the scope of their everyday life, this is a fairly infrequent occurrence. However, at all times, they remain the individuals they have always been, though now they are living with a disease. Referring to someone as a patient is depersonalizing and implies identification as a medical record number, rather than as an individual. On the other hand referring to someone with the disease as a person helps maintain their identity and promotes involvement in decisions about their own care and experience.</li>
<li>Replace "facility" with "home" or "care community," in every case. The word "facility" implies institutionalization, which promotes stigma in the sense of needing to remove people with Alzheimer's from the general community. Despite the fact that assisted living residences or nursing homes offer support and care, they serve primarily as the person's home. The person needs to live in this new supportive home for their own well being, not in order to remove them from interacting with the larger community.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on this Draft Plan. Pioneer Network appreciates the chance to share our widely held perspective that caring for elders in the most effective and appropriate ways will not only enhance quality of life for individuals but make us stronger as a society. Our Network and its friends believe that people deserve the opportunity to continue to thrive and live up to their full potential until the end of life, despite their limitations, including those presented by Alzheimer's disease. This plan represents an important chance to move the field and society forward in thinking about Alzheimer's both in terms of the future impact of high-quality research and in terms of the present impact of high-quality care. Please feel free to contact the Pioneer Network with any questions, or to access the many resources available to promote quality of life for all elders.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <strong>DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong>.</p>
<p>The Virginia Assisted Living Association (VALA), representing assisted living providers from throughout Virginia, as well as thousands of residents and employees served by these providers, supported the passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. We strongly support the goals outlined in the Draft Framework, but we are disappointed in the lack of acknowledgement of the importance of and the extensive use of assisted living services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Assisted living is long-term care service provider, that offers a more affordable home and community based alternative to skilled nursing care. Assisted living providers focus on the resident and offer services that are unique to the individual needs of the residents to allow for individual choice and help residents maintain dignity and respect. Assisted living is a professionally managed, community-based option for seniors and disabled individuals to use when needing assistance with activities of daily living, including specialized care for individuals with memory loss.</p>
<p>Statistics will show that consumers prefer assisted living care over institutionalized care settings, which is directly contributing to the drastic increase in the population numbers of assisted living communities. As reported in the 2009 Overview of Assisted Living (research conducted and analyzed by Acclaro Growth Partners), more than 1/3 of all residents living in assisted living communities have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or a related dementia. The US Government has evidence of this in its release of the 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities as conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, which stated that 42% of the residents living in residential care have Alzheimer's disease. This number is expected to continue or even increase as the levels of care and the options of care continue to expand within assisted living communities for memory impaired residents.</p>
<p>We respectfully request HHS to acknowledge and to include assisted living as a viable option when educating and caring for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. We also request that the word "patient" be replaced with the word "individual". Below is listing of some of our recommendations of changes to the Draft Framework...</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2. Add licensed assisted living communities to the list of settings in the opening paragraph after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.B Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.C Change patients in the title to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Add assisted living and a transition options from the home to assisted living and from hospitals to assisted living</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Change patients to individuals and add assisted living to the list of transition settings after "home"</li>
<li>Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families, and add assisted living to the list of care settings after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize, respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for your time and consideration of these comments, and please contact me should I be able to offer you assistance in this ongoing Plan.</p>

<p>Please find attached feedback from the Lewy Body Dementia Association on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The letter is from the President of LBDA's Board of Directors, Angela Herron, in consultation with our <strong>Scientific Advisory Council</strong>.</p>
<p>I have also copied the text itself below for your convenience in including it on the NAPA website.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>An Open Letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<br />
					Feedback on the Draft Framework for the<br />
					National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) supports and applauds the development of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.</p>
<p>With appreciation for the magnitude of the task at hand and the complexity of the issues, LBDA is providing limited feedback that is a) relevant for dementia in general and b) an important consideration specific to the spectrum of Lewy body dementias (LBD): dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).</p>
<p>An estimated 1.3 million Americans have LBD, which features progressive dementia plus varying combinations of symptoms (especially at onset), ranging from parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations, to REM sleep behavior disorder, a severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications, mood disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Both clinical diagnoses within the LBD spectrum feature Lewy body pathology, but the timing and severity of symptom onset differs.</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies represents approximately 20 percent of all dementias and is the most frequent dementia type misdiagnosed clinically, most often as Alzheimer's. Features that differentiate LBD from Alzheimer's at the early stage include visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder and results of neuropsychological assessment.</p>
<p>Most older adults with Parkinson's disease have some degree of cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 80% of people with Parkinson's will ultimately develop dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease has not yet become common knowledge among clinicians. There is no general public awareness about dementia in Parkinson's disease. Caregivers of people with PDD report to LBDA that the progression to dementia ultimately proves to be their most difficult caregiving challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It's not always Alzheimer's. </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the importance of communicating the plan in a manner that is both straightforward and understandable by the general public. While Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, there are millions of Americans whose lives are deeply affected by related disorders like stroke, LBD and frontotemporal degeneration; while they receive nominal mention in the background material as being included in this plan, there is no mention of them in the draft agenda.</p>
<p>Public awareness and education is one of the core goals of the draft agenda. LBDA urges the names of related disorders be included in the opening statement of the draft agenda, so that educating the public about the most common forms of dementia begins now and continues throughout the advancement of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, through public relations efforts of federal agencies, disease advocacy organizations and academia.</p>
<p>As the plan receives coverage in the media, deliberate inclusion of related disorders will also minimize disenfranchisement of Americans affected by lesser-known, non-Alzheimer's dementias like LBD, many of whom might easily infer the omission indicates the federal government does not appreciate that their plight is as fraught with burden as those dealing with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<p>While improving the timeliness of diagnosis is important, the Lewy Body Dementia Association strongly recommends the inclusion of the word 'differential' when referring to diagnosis.</p>
<p>A general dementia diagnosis or an inaccurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease leaves people with LBD at risk for exposure to potentially severe or irreversible medication side effects. (Approximately 50% of people with DLB who are exposed to neuroleptics will experience a severe reaction.) Inaccurate diagnosis also prevents the opportunity to prepare families for the complexity of LBD symptoms, treatment and high toll of LBD caregiving. Accurate differential diagnosis not only leads to more appropriate therapeutic interventions but also improves the selection for study candidates in research trials.</p>
<p>Primary care physicians must become more familiar with the top four causes of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's, LBD, stroke and frontotemporal degeneration. Delayed or inaccurate diagnoses are further compounded by the low percentage of referrals from primary care physicians to specialists. Simple screening tools to highlight when a referral is warranted for differential diagnosis are urgently needed, especially for people with LBD.</p>
<p><strong>Care Quality </strong></p>
<p>When assessing the care needs of persons with dementia, it is essential to look beyond the cognitive deficits and their impact on employment, incidental activities of daily living and activities of daily living. In the case of Lewy body dementias, care quality must also address motor symptoms (such as the risk of falls), behavioral problems, sleep and autonomic issues. Other professionals who regularly provide care for people with dementia include specialists treating sleep and autonomic symptoms as well as physical, occupational and speech therapists.</p>
<p><strong>Care Guidelines across Care Settings </strong></p>
<p>Given the increased rate of hospitalization of people with dementia, hospitals should be included in the list of care settings for which dementia care guidelines and measures are to be developed. Many hospitals are not equipped to provide adequate care to people with dementia, especially those with behavioral problems, leading to excessive or avoidable treatment with antipsychotic medications. (This is especially dangerous to the person with LBD, who may experience modest to significant decline without a return to their baseline from as little as a single dose of haloperidol.) Additionally, consideration should be given to non-cognitive symptoms, such as motor problems, which affect activities of daily living and increase fall risk.</p>
<p>As LBD is a multi-system disorder, routine care coordination between multiple physicians is particularly challenging with LBD. By changing medications without consulting the treating neurologist, another physician may unknowingly exacerbate any one of several LBD symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>In addressing the long term care needs of people with dementia, caregivers need more accessible resources to provide quality care for the person with dementia in their own home as long as possible, while also maintaining balance of the equally important quality of life for the family caregiver.</p>
<p>Patient advocacy groups should be included in the draft framework as an important source of counseling, support and information to patients and families upon a differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness </strong></p>
<p>The general public needs to be educated about the difference between dementia and the disease processes that cause it, much like the education the public received about HIV and AIDS. Few people understand that dementia is sometimes treatable. Educating the public that dementia is a symptom requiring medical attention, not a disease in itself, will help de-stigmatize both dementia and the many related clinical diagnoses.</p>
<p>In order to improve the reporting to physicians of all dementia-related symptoms beyond memory problems alone, such as those seen in stroke and LBD, it is imperative that the general public learn that the most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, stroke and LBD, and what symptoms should be reported to their physicians.</p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association is encouraged at the expansive nature of this draft agenda, especially as it pertains to the impact of dementia disorders not just on the patient but on the family caregiver as well. We look forward to following the progression of your work with great anticipation.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>David Holtzman (Washington University School of Medicine)</td>
<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<td>
<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities. Matching funds from the government for private initiatives, or the other way around, could generate considerably more private capital for focused, high level science than is the case today.</li>

<td>In regard to 1E below, there is nothing wrong with what is stated but this is not the problem! We need treatments! If there is nothing to disseminate, 1E is a waste of time. Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately.

<td>Berislav Zlokovic (University of Southern California)</td>
<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>
</tr><tr><th colspan="2" scope="row">Beth Bishop (Volunteer -- Alzheimer's Association (via Alz Forum))</th>
<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is writing to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in regards to the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. SWHR has key scientific recommendations that it believes the Advisory Council should consider as it is finalizing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>SWHR, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research. SWHR appreciates the work the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) is and will be doing to focus our nation's resources on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain, and the brains of men and women are inherently different. While it is common knowledge that men and women think differently, recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated that the difference goes far beyond thought processes. Sex differences have been observed in the anatomy of the brain, behavioral traits, and in the physiological responses of the nervous system. Differences are also noted in the aging process and for generative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Significant differences have been found in men and women who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine, explained in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that "Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women: up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology, whereas it is found in only 8-10 percent of age-matched women." Abnormalities caused by Alzheimer's disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms for men and women with the disease, which may lead to the need for different treatment decisions.</p>
<p>In October 2011, SWHR hosted a one-day scientific roundtable of experts to discuss what is known about sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. The meeting focused on basic and clinical science perspectives, as well as those of the caregiver, and included input from industry scientists. Participants were asked what research questions needed to be answered for progress to be made in the disease. Key research recommendations from the roundtable are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Research on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease, specifically examining sex differences in the transition from normality to early stages of disease to dementia, and from dementia to outcomes.</li>
<li>Research on the influence of sex steroids, bioenergetic vulnerabilities, synaptic function, and cognition in the brain as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Re-examination of existing data for potential sex differences to help define the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and publishing sex-specific results.</li>
<li>Research on the differential impact of the caregiving role on men and women and design interventions to provide more effective services</li>
</ul><p>From the meeting it was clear that research on Alzheimer's disease must account for sex as a basic biological variable and include sex-specific analyses. This type of analysis would be an extremely useful component of a national strategic plan to combat Alzheimer's disease. Approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women, which is why it is extremely important to ensure that the clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent, manage and treat Alzheimer's disease include an adequate number of women within their study population to perform a sex-specific analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR strongly encourages that these recommendations be incorporated in the Framework goals and strategies and be a part of the continued discussions and work of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>In addition, SWHR would like to provide comment on several of the specific goals and strategies. Strategy 1.B states that, "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions." SWHR agrees and advocates for appropriate representation in clinical research based on the disease prevalence in the population, with the specific goal of enrolling sufficient numbers of men and women to achieve statistical significance in the resulting sex-specific data analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR believes that under Strategy 1.C, identifying early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease requires knowing whether there are any particular differences evident based on sex, race, age, or ethnicity. The reporting and analysis of such data should be a part of the strategy even if the results show no difference, as that is important to determine.</p>
<p>In Strategy 1.E, SWHR recommends amending the draft to require the reporting and analysis of sex, race, age and ethnicity in the research findings, as these factors directly impact the quality of the findings disseminated into medical practice. The reporting of these differences, or lack thereof, influences the knowledge and identification of disease by the public health system, including patients and caregivers.</p>
<p>The quality and efficiency of care under Goal 2 would be increased by the measurement of sex and gender differences as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. SWHR further recommends that gender be a part of the timely and accurate diagnosis strategy of 2.B as well as education and support to patients in Strategy 2.C. The more accurate and informative the information that is provided to patients, family members and care givers, the more likely it will be that they understand and are able to be engaged in medical decision making.</p>
<p>As women age, many experience comorbid illnesses and diseases, making the coordination of care even more critical. Strategy 2.F is critically important as, "coordinating care...can help reduce duplication and errors and improve outcomes," especially for those patients, particularly women with multiple chronic diseases. Coordinated care will also help to lessen the difficulty of decisions made by many women who are responsible for making the majority of healthcare decisions for their household.</p>
<p>While SWHR believes that the groups mentioned in Strategy 2.G are unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease, we feel that it is important to include women who are disproportionately affected in general as well as within these subgroups. We recommend that women be added as a subgroups being disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer's disease. It is known that approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women. Moreover, there is a need to examine the data by sex within each population identified in Strategy 2.G, including within racial and ethnic minorities</p>
<p>While SWHR agrees that information and training should be given to caregiver in a culturally sensitive manner, as stated in Strategy 3.A, it is important to note that this information should include information on sex and gender differences, as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. Providing caregivers with any information available on these differences would allow them to better support and care for persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In Goal 4, SWHR believes that the public would benefit from being provided with Alzheimer's disease facts and information specified by sex, race, and ethnicity. This will help ensure that they have all available knowledge, including information to address the widespread confusion and misconceptions surrounding Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the disease will allow for the development of more effective preventions, diagnostic tools and treatments through support of the general public.</p>
<p>Data are an essential element of all research and a critical component to the advancement of our knowledge of sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. SWHR is delighted to see that in Goal 5 there will be, "efforts to expand and enhance data infrastructure and (to) make data easily accessible to federal agencies and other researcher." SWHR would like to see that data include information on differences that may exist between sex, age, race, ethnicity and culture and that it is made accessible to the public in order to advance research, treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease . from patients to caregivers to families.</p>
<p>SWHR believes the recommendations and comments it has provided to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services will help to advance more targeted therapies in Alzheimer's disease for both men and women. This will lead to a greater understanding of risk factors for both men and women and more sex-specific treatment of cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of Division 40 (Clinical Neuropsychology) of the American Psychological Association with formal written comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Our purpose in contacting you is to inform you that many of our nearly 5,000 members are licensed healthcare professionals qualified to evaluate and treat persons with Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. Clinical neuropsychologists, through receipt of specialized training in cognitive psychology, psychometric &amp; measurement theory, and brain behavior relations, have long been leaders in developing and investigating valid and reliable measures of cognitive functioning used for assessing and tracking symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Members of our profession have also developed and investigated many of the behavioral interventions currently used for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given our field's interest and experience with Alzheimer's disease we offer the following comments:</p>
<ul><li>We strongly urge you to include in Strategy 1.C the use of neuropsychological measures of cognitive functioning, which thus far remain more sensitive to diagnosis and tracking of Alzheimer's disease symptoms than any of the biomarkers that have been studied.</li>
<li>Neuropsychologists, by virtue of their training in brain-behavior relationships, are uniquely qualified for providing valuable services to patients with Alzheimer's disease and should be recognized among those other professions listed in Strategy 2.A recommended for receipt of expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act.</li>
<li>Practitioners in the field of neuropsychology are often among the first to identify symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's patients and are often involved in planning and advance care counseling. This should be recognized through inclusion of neuropsychologists along with physicians in the activities described in Strategies 2.C and 2.D.</li>
</ul><p>We appreciate this opportunity to clarify the role of clinical neuropsychologists in evaluation and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and would welcome any questions or requests for additional information for this or any other similar national initiatives.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) is pleased to submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (the "Draft Framework"), released by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on January 9, 2012.<sup>1</sup> BIO represents more than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.</p>
<p>As the representative of an industry that is devoted to improving health care through the discovery of new therapies, BIO believes that any framework for improving diagnosis and care for serious, complex illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, must include measures to provide access to innovative treatment options, including new drugs and biologicals. We are pleased that the Draft Framework specifically includes strategies for enhancing scientific research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, coordinating research with international public and private entities, and facilitating the translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs. <sup>2</sup> We offer the following comments to make these strategies more effective.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Draft Framework Should Include a Strategy to Protect Patient Access to Innovative Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>The draft framework correctly recognizes that after research findings are published in the clinical literature, "additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately."<sup>3</sup> In addition to being shared with patients, caregivers, and practitioners, new clinical evidence also must be adopted into health plans' coverage and payment policies in a timely manner to ensure that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools that address the eight cognitive domains that may be impaired in Alzheimer's, as recognized in the NINCDS-ADRA Alzheimer's Criteria: memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving, and functional abilities.<sup>4</sup> This is particularly important now because there are exciting new diagnostic tools and treatments for Alzheimer's disease on the horizon, at the same time our health care delivery system is undergoing dramatic change, from the creation of Accountable Care Organizations to increased packaging.</p>
<p>There are several ways the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can protect patient access to care. CMS should assign Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes in a timely manner for new drugs and biologicals to facilitate claims processing and payment by all health plans. CMS also should expeditiously add new cognitive tests to Medicare's Annual Wellness visit so that beneficiaries will have access to this service on a regular schedule and without out-of-pocket costs. In addition, CMS should work with stakeholders to identify new preventive services and issue national coverage determinations that add those services to Medicare's preventive benefits. Other payers, including Medicaid and private insurance plans, as well as the state agencies that regulate health plans, will need to act promptly on similar matters to protect access to innovative diagnosis and care for patients within their programs as well. CMS and other payers also may need to reconsider their current rules on coverage and payment to support adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers, and to ensure that bundled payment systems do not discourage the use of novel therapies. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework be revised to explicitly acknowledge the need for prompt action by Medicare and other payers to provide comprehensive coverage, coding, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease to help meet the needs of this vulnerable patient population.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Draft Framework's Strategies Should Support the Development of Treatment by Facilitating Participation of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease in Clinical Trials </strong></p>
<p>BIO recognizes that no progress can be made without clinical research, yet we also realize that it is difficult for many older patients to participate in trials due to comorbidities and limited access to sites of care that offer trials. These obstacles are particularly significant for patients with Alzheimer's disease, who may have more difficulty deciding to participate in a trial or remaining in a trial unless they have strong support from their family members and caregivers and health care practitioners. The Draft Framework notes that "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions."<sup>5</sup> BIO believes these efforts are needed. Enhanced outreach is essential to increasing participation in clinical trials through educating patients' families and caregivers, facilitating their access to the patient's health information, and supporting their role in helping patients make treatment decisions. These efforts also need to be applied across all research efforts -- in the U.S. or other countries, public or privately funded -- to encourage optimal participation in these essential trials. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework specifically recognize the need for enhanced efforts to address the factors that frequently inhibit patients with Alzheimer's disease from participating in clinical research. To facilitate this, we recommend that the Secretary involve, consult and engage with industry to address those factors through "new partnerships and outreach efforts."</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>BIO appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Draft Framework. We look forward to continuing to work with ASPE to refine and implement this plan to improve diagnoses and care for Alzheimer's disease. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding our comments. Thank you for your attention to this very important matter.</p>

<p>I was informed by our national affiliate, the Assisted Living Federation of America, that the recently released "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease" omitted Assisted Living from all strategies and recommendations, with the exception of the strategy on elder abuse. We fully agree with their comments submitted on January 20, 2012.</p>
<p>In addition, I am writing on behalf of LeadingAge Colorado. We are the state affiliate of ALFA and LeadingAge. We represent the full spectrum of aging services and senior housing providers, including assisted living residences and nursing homes. In Colorado we have worked with providers, regulators, legislators, consumers, and other advocates to ensure that their are care options for seniors as their needs change over time. We have particularly looked at initiatives to allow more individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders to have home- and community-based options through our Medicaid Waiver program.</p>
<p>In coalition with the Colorado Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association we have spent a great deal of time in recent years educating policy makers about the important role that Assisted Living Residences play in providing an alternative to expensive nursing home care. The state chapter has been particularly helpful in our efforts to increase Medicaid waiver funding for assisted living residences in Colorado. We know that Medicaid recipients have been inappropriately placed in nursing homes when their diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders did not require twenty-four hour nursing care. We also know that demographic projections for our state include a higher than average projection for individuals who will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders. Not only does it not make fiscal sense to omit this residential option from a national plan, consumers and their family members prefer the home-like environment and resident centered philosophy of care provided in Assisted Living residences.</p>
<p>I urge you to include Assisted Living Residences in this draft framework for the national plan. Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS OF THE RI ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION (RIALA)<br />
					SUBMITTED TO HHS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					JANUARY 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>.</p>
<p>The Rhode Island Assisted Living Association and the forty eight of providers who are our members supported passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act one year ago. We are pleased to see the Administration is currently pursuing a plan for a coordinated national strategy to address Alzheimer's disease. While the Draft Framework is a good start, we were dismayed to see the lack of acknowledgement of the role assisted living has in caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. In Rhode Island alone our members care for 3,500 residents most of whom experience some cognitive loss.</p>
<p>As you are aware, assisted living is a home and community based alternative to skilled nursing care. The philosophy is resident centered and the care is provided to support individual choice and help our residents maintain dignity and respect. In the past decade consumers have shown a preference for assisted living over more institutionalized care settings. The population of assisted living residents with Alzheimer's and related diseases is rapidly increasing. According to the 2009 Overview of Assisted Living (research conducted and analyzed by Acclaro Growth Partners), more than 1/3 of all residents living in assisted living communities have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or a related dementia. A survey of the top 80 senior living providers by Senior Living Executive in 2011 confirmed that 17% of the total residents served by these top providers are residents living in special memory care accommodations. The 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics released data that 42% of the residents living in residential care have Alzheimer's disease. We expect this trend to continue as many consumers prefer the state of the art programming that has been developed for memory impaired residents in assisted living. Indeed there are some assisted living companies that are dedicated exclusively to caring for residents with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>How can assisted living communities not be part of a national plan to address caring for people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia? The fact is assisted living is becoming the most popular form of residential care and services among consumers. Assisted living is a professionally managed, community-based option seniors and their families can turn to when needing assistance with activities of daily living, including specialized care and service for seniors with memory loss.</p>
<p>The senior living business is growing to meet the demands of seniors with memory loss. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing &amp; Care Industry estimates there are 105,000 memory care apartments available in custom built, appropriately licensed senior living communities. Most of these apartments are part of a special neighborhood within more than 36,000 assisted living communities. About 600 memory care-only communities operate in the U.S. However, due to growing demand from families needing full time assistance with the care of a loved one with memory loss, more capacity is being added each year, but growth rates will need to increase in order to serve greater consumer demand expected in the next five to ten years.</p>
<p>Regardless of the increasing popularity of professionally-managed senior living communities as a care option for seniors with memory loss, both government and private sector reports continue to confirm that assisted living communities are more affordable than nursing homes, and potentially even more affordable than home care depending on the level of need and situation of the family and senior. Additionally, options like offering home care to every senior are not practical given the shortage of healthcare professionals interested in serving seniors.</p>
<p>Social and safety benefits of assisted living communities should also be considered for seniors with memory loss. Studies continue to demonstrate that seniors with mid to late stage Alzheimer's disease thrive with a meaningful and purposeful life. Assisted living communities help create this life for their residents with memory loss. Professionally trained caregivers focus on the seniors' interests -- it could be as simple as singing songs, playing music, painting pictures or holding their hand. What's more, other residents and people are around as a supportive social network for the senior. Additionally, due to the professional and social nature of an assisted living community, more people are around to observe the resident to help both promote and protect his or her quality of life.</p>
<p>I am sure you can understand my concern that assisted living was not included in any of the goals or strategies that referenced care setting for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Assisted living has been and will continue to be an option that can provide not only the most appropriate setting for individuals with this disease but a cost effective option as well.</p>
<p>Assisted Living providers in RI have been huge supporters of our local Alzheimer's Association Chapter, through frequent sponsorships of fund raising events; such as the walk and the golf tournament. Our industry helped create the Culinary Challenge Event that has raised a significant amount of money for the RI chapter. I was shocked to read that, to date Assisted Living has been left out of the frame work for a national plan.</p>
<p>The recommendations below cite some specific places in the report where we would appreciate the inclusion of assisted living.</p>
<p>We also respectfully request that the word "patient" used through out the document be changed to "individual" or "resident". While we understand that someone under a physician's orders is called a patient, individuals residing in assisted living and other home and community based options are referred to as individuals or residents. Thank you for your time.</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2. Add licensed assisted living communities to the list of settings in the opening paragraph after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.B Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.C Change patients in the title to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.D Add assisted living as a care setting after "physicians office"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Change patients to individuals and add assisted living to the list of transition settings after "home"</li>
<li>Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families, and add assisted living to the list of care settings after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize, respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) is a non-profit collaborative of eleven national organizations that represent a unique blend of key stakeholders in assisted living. CEAL promotes high-quality assisted living, serves as a convener to bring together diverse stakeholders to discuss and examine issues related to assisted living, helps bridge research, practice and policies that foster quality and affordability, and maintains an objective national clearinghouse of information and resources about assisted living.</p>
<p>The CEAL commends the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy for developing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to address the growing need for treatment and services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their loved ones.</p>
<p>Assisted living plays an increasingly important role in providing services for persons living with Alzheimer's disease in a safe, structured community based setting. Over 31,000 assisted living communities across the United States provide care and services to nearly 750,000 residents; with more than 40 percent of those individuals living with some form of dementia.</p>
<p>Services offered in assisted living that can benefit individuals living with cognitive impairment include health monitoring, medication management, assistance with activities of daily living, social activity programs, nutrition services, and others. Offering these services in a structured and secure environment creates a unique solution to meet the immediate care and supervision needs of persons living with Alzheimer's disease now and in the future. Indeed many states have special disclosure and staff training requirements for assisted living communities that provide dementia care.</p>
<p><strong>CEAL Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Because assisted living is clearly a setting of choice for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, we recommend the following technical edits to Goals 2 and 3 outlined in the National Plan:</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency<br />
						"High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis through the end-of-life and in settings including people's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
<li>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support<br />
						"People with Alzheimer's disease and their families need supports that go beyond the care provided in formal settings such as doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and/or assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
</ul><p>On behalf of the CEAL board of directors I thank you for this opportunity to comment on the draft framework, and I offer our support for the ongoing work of the advisory council and the Department in implementing the important goals outlined in the National Plan.</p>

Merck is an innovative, global health care leader that is committed to preserving and improving human life. We continue to focus our research on conditions that affect millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>We welcome government's leadership in developing a National Plan to help focus public and private resources on common goals and strategy. The Framework provides the right priorities, balance, and general focus for the effort.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's research and drug development stands on the threshold of a major advance in treatment, with the potential for significant disease modification in the near future. It is a critical time when greater collaboration and resources can have a substantial impact. We look forward to working with HHS to develop a clear pathway in the National Plan for achieving a therapeutic breakthrough in Alzheimer's Disease. This type of breakthrough will not only improve the lives of patients, but will also help ease the cost pressures currently being experienced by government health care programs.</p>
<p>A real advance in therapy will require regulatory alignment with emerging science, including prompt government action to establish biomarkers, provide guidance on clinical trial design, and review and approve new drug applications. We look forward to working with the Secretary to ensure a favorable environment that facilitates efficient clinical trials and expenditious review of new treatments.</p>

As the nation focuses efforts to address the growing challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease, I encourage you to recognize Assisted Living as a partner in providing solutions.</p>
<p>For hundreds of thousands of individuals living with Alzheimer's, Assisted Living provides needed 24-hour care in a supportive, residential setting. Assisted Living programs and activities promote independence while they environment itself is designed to minimize agitation, promote socialization, and fully engage residents. Assisted Living providers in California and throughout the country work closely with research institutions, health care providers, state and federal government agencies, and family caregivers to design and deliver high-quality care options.</p>
<p>The Framework and future drafts of the plan itself should recognize that individuals with dementia also choose to live in Assisted Living and not just the settings currently listed as examples. When Assisted Living was called out, it was in a strategy related to preventing abuse. Abuse in any setting is unacceptable. However, given the expertise Assisted Living providers have with consumer focused care in a residential setting and given continued growth in consumer demand, we believe Assisted Living should be acknowledged not just as a housing and care setting of choice, but as a partner in bettering the lives of individuals with Alzheimer's and ultimately seeking strategies to eradicate this disease.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Draft Framework and look forward to the continued collaborative efforts to finalize a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Submitted on the<br />
					Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					February 3, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>. CCAL is a national advocacy organization working to ensure that person-centered practices are always the foundation of all aging services and supports. Ensuring that person-centeredness is integrated into healthcare practices elevates the experience from a clinical one to a humanistic one. The human emotional experience is important to achieving well-being as are clinical outcomes. The bond between the person receiving services and the individual (as well as the organizations' culture) that provides a healthcare service must be based on the following four principles all working in harmony:</p>
<ul><li>Relationships - valuing the uniqueness of each person</li>
<li>Compassion -caring to build a connection and bond with the person</li>
<li>Empowerment - providing information and options to the person and their caregiver(s)</li>
<li>Autonomy/Choice - respecting the right of the person and their caregiver(s) to make their own choices</li>
</ul><p><strong>Global Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Person-Centeredness </strong></em></p>
<p>Nowhere can principles and practices of honoring the personhood of each individual be more significant than in a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, yet the draft framework is silent on person-centeredness. We respectfully submit that this National Plan should include person-centeredness in its philosophical foundation, core principles , strategies and goals as does the Department of Health and Human Services' National Health Care Quality Strategy and Plan (NHCQS): "Person-centeredness and family engagement will guide all strategies, goals, and improvement efforts". This is "one of the core principles intended to serve as the underpinning of NHCQS and should be reflected not only in the framework, but in how goals, targets, and plans are developed across health care and long-term care settings."</p>
<p>Person-centered language should be used throughout the National Plan. To honor the personhood of each individual and recognize that patient only refers to clinical services and not the broader holistic context, the term "patient" should be changed to "person" throughout the Plan; i.e., "Educate and Support the <em>Person</em> and their Family Members Upon Diagnosis". Indeed, person-centeredness should be a fundamental component of all prevention and treatment plans; i.e. Strategy 2.D - "Guidelines for delivery of high-quality <em>person-centered</em> care and measures of quality are needed…"</p>
<p><em><strong>Enhancing Quality of Life as well as Quality of Care </strong></em></p>
<p>This framework does not reflect our national commitment to providing meaningful lives for all older Americans. Enhancing quality of life and meaningful engagement for individuals with Alzheimers and related dementias must be a fundamental principle and a goal, implemented through training, education, and outreach strategies in tandem with, and comparable to, those for Goal 2 Enhancing High Quality of Care.</p>
<p>Meaningful relationships, purposeful engagement, social interactions and impromptu conversations all serve to enhance the individual's psychological, social and emotional well-being. All should incorporate the person's interests, preferences, strengths, and skills to best maintain their sense of self and to slow down the deleterious effects of the disease. The National Plan should include training for family, caregivers, and staff to heighten their sensitivity to and understanding of positive pathways for communication, interactions, relationships, and meaningful engagement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Family Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p>For those of us who care for loved ones with Alzheimers' and related dementias, we know this National Plan must move beyond encouraging "family engagement" to encouraging caregiver/family/ provider partnerships to best guide and enhance person-centered quality of care and quality of life.</p>
<p>Individuals and families should be empowered through interactions and resources so that they are prepared to make informed choices and be active participants and decision-makers regarding their loved one's care. We recommend the following goals and approach from "Partnering with Patients and Families to Design a Patient and Family-centered Health Care System: A Roadmap for the Future, A Work in Progress" (<em>2006, Institute for Family-centered Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement</em>)</p>
<p>"…Develop a shared vision and action plan for improving health care by advancing the practice of patient-and family-centered care and creating partnerships with patients and families in all health care settings and within the organizations and agencies having an impact on health care"</p>
<p><em><strong>Utilize Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Methodological Approach </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adopting the CBPR methodological approach to AD applied research efforts to best inform the work through multiple perspectives and expertise of community-based partners (representing key stakeholders, including family members, direct care staff, practitioners, social workers, long-term service providers, etc.) to inform the research, ensure its relevancy, and enhance understanding and dissemination across research, policy and practice sectors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Public Education Campaign </strong></em></p>
<p>We firmly believe that any public education campaign should highlight non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment options for enhanced quality of life and care.</p>
<p>We would encourage sustained community-based outreach to the general public through the creation of a "Real People; Real Life with AD" component of this campaign to enable the general public to meet, greet and hear from regular individuals and families who are going through this journey of AD-related life experiences and challenges. We are not suggesting celebrities or authors who have written about family caregiving. We do suggest including the voices, perspectives, and insights of individuals who are living with AD or whose loved one has AD.</p>
<p><em><strong>Improve Coordinated Dissemination of Information </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adding this goal as there is no national coordinated network of information about Alzheimer's and related Dementias for professionals or non-professionals. DHHS funds numerous AD research centers, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and initiatives throughout the country, i.e., Administration on Aging's AD Demonstration Grants; but information and findings are not networked and easily made available.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Psychosocial treatment modalities (non-pharmacologic) for AD should also be included in the framework for the national plan</p>
<p><strong>1.A</strong> Ensure that invited expert participants to NIH's May 2012 summit include an appropriate number of non-research, non-clinical dementia experts as well as family caregivers in order to best inform and shape the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>1.C</strong> Consider : a) ethical issues related to such efforts; and b) the potential psychological, social-emotional, medical and economic impact (and unintended consequences) on individuals and their families receiving a diagnosis 10 years prior to emergence of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>1.E</strong> Consider educational campaign on appropriate and safe use of psychoactive drugs and sedatives and non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment modalities as related to individual's quality of life</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A</strong> The plan should address solutions for recruiting and retaining high-quality direct care and paraprofessional workers. Best-practice models for AD training should be noted.</p>
<p><strong>2.C &amp; 2.D</strong> The plan should address how individuals and families can be actively engaged in decision making and act as partners on the care team if they so choose. Some individuals and families may just wish to receive counseling, support and information. Both should be addressed.</p>
<p>Palliative care and end-of-life care should be addressed. What interventions are available; what decisions need to be made to have personal wishes carried out by healthcare and long-term support system(s); i.e., individuals with Alzheimer's may want to leave a living will; families should understand the decisions that they may need to make.</p>
<p><strong>2. D CCAL</strong> suggests using a community-based participatory process in which individuals, families, and direct care staff can be partners with experts in developing the guidelines. We suggest examining the national Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) "Person-centered Care Domains of Practice" for HCBS which identifies domains of: personhood, relationships and community, governance/ownership, leadership, workforce practices, meaningful life and engagement, services, environment, and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>2.E</strong> Even "safe and effective" transitions can be traumatic for people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly for people with advanced Alzheimer's who are sent to emergency rooms for relatively minor conditions. Emphasis should be on: 1) limiting transitions; and 2) when transitions are necessary--how to make them safe and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3. Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend including families and direct care staff as active partners in the process of Expanding Person &amp; Family Support, from creating and disseminating culturally sensitive education and support materials to serving as Person &amp; Family Support Guides.</p>
<p>CCAL commends all who were involved in creating the framework for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias; and appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the process by providing person-centered feedback on its contents.</p>

<p>Recently The Department released The Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We thank you for developing a plan and a strategy for addressing Alzheimer's Disease. We are writing to The Department regarding the Draft and the issue that assisted living was omitted from all but one of its strategies and recommendations in the Draft.</p>
<p>Since assisted living communities accommodate a rapidly growing number of seniors with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia, assisted living communities have and will play a role in the future of Alzheimer's care and treatment. In fact, more than one third of current residents living in assisted living have Alzheimer's disease or dementia.</p>
<p>We recommend that assisted living be included in more of the strategies and recommendations in the Draft.</p>
<p>Below are highlighted areas for your consideration:</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2. Add licensed/certified assisted living communities to the list of settings in the opening paragraph after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.D Add assisted living as a care setting after "physicians office"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Add assisted living to the list of transition settings after "home"</li>
<li>Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families, and add assisted living to the list of care settings after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities".</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for your consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<p>As a cognitive aging researcher, it's appalling that the new draft framework on AD does not mention the influence of lifestyle and the environment in <strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Assuming that AD is entirely a biological disease and it not influenced by the environment and the stimulation that a person receives goes against basic psychological, cognitive, and neuroscience research (e.g., even rats placed in stimulating environments show more neuronal growth). In addition to this complete oversight, such a framework for prevention assumes that there is nothing a person can do (i.e., "we'll give you a drug, and hope for the best"). Providing older adults with ways they can take control of their own future, and possibly influence their own likelihood of preventing AD (e.g., not smoking, not being overweight, stressed, and staying cognitively and socially engaged) is a far more universal and economical approach and avenue to take, in addition to research on pharmacological interventions. Psychological research has been occurring on AD and MCI for years, and failing to acknowledge this contribution is ignorant and hurts the overall goal of addressing AD.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that relying entirely on general practitioners, not trained in detecting dementia symptoms is a poor focus as well. Personally, my aunt was recently having some memory problems, and after having a MRI that was clear, was sent to her GP for follow-up. Without even conducting a MMSE, the GP told her she had dementia, and he would prescribe Aricept. He didn't conduct a MMSE until 2 weeks later, at which point she received a score of 27/30, and the GP said, "oh, I guess she's fine". There is no way dementia can be diagnosed with such little knowledge, and not even simply relying on the MMSE is sufficient. There is a rich literature on neuropsychological testing in diagnosing AD, other dementia types, and using those tests to detect MCI and other conditions. If we can't subject every person with small memory problems to a spinal tap, neuropsychological testing that has been developed to be sensitive to small changes in cognition is a front-runner in where to focus our efforts. Relying on GPs for this type of diagnosis is not appropriate.</p>

<p>My name is Dr. Steve Hume and I am a member of the Alzheimer's Association national Board. I was also diagnosed with AD at the age of 60.</p>
<p>Feedback: I feel the framework and recommendations to date are on target and broadly cover the important issues.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see a recommendation directed to Medicare that ensures it will develop and fund innovative in-home and in-community programs and services for persons with AD and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Many AD persons have Medicare but are inelligible for Medicaid. This precludes them from receiving in-home services, respite care and day treatment.</p>
<p>Many families cannot afford these services out-of-pocket. The result is either the caregiver reduces or eliminates their work hours or AD patients are forced into nursing home care prematurely.</p>
<p>When caregivers are unable to work the family suffers, more dollars are spent on welfare programs and the economy suffers as they leave the workforce.</p>

<p>I have red the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. I am very concerned that assisted living facilities (RCFEs, board and care communities, etc.) have been left out of this National Plan. I am respectfully requesting that at least two changes be made. To wit:</p>
<ol><li>Under Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency, add assisted living facilities to the list of settings where high quality of care should be provided. As it is now, the draft only lists people's homes, doctors' offices, hospitals and nursing homes.</li>
<li>Under Strategy 3.B The existing statement: <em>Round the clock care needs of the person with Alzheimer's disease often necessitates nursing home placement</em> should be changed to: <em>Round the clock care needs of the person with Alzheimer's disease often necessitates placement in a nursing home or assisted living facility</em>.</li>
</ol><p>Assisted living facilities (ALFs) play an important role in providing quality care to residents afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. In the past few year, ALFs have been accepting increased numbers of residents with high acuity care, including those with Alzheimer's and dementia and providing quality care at considerably lower cost than nursing homes. Leaving ALFs out of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a disservice not only to these institutions, but also to the thousands of Alzheimer's residents they serve or could potentially serve.</p>

<p>Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to comment on the current draft of the HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. I urge you to consider the thorough comments offered by the American Psychological Association (submitted to Dr. Lamont on 1/26/12) in your further review of the Plan.

<p>I am currently a caregiver to my wife who is a patient of a care facility at Timbercrest Senior Living Community in North Manchester, IN. I do not question the care she is receiving as it is excellent. She has been in healthcare facilities for over two years and in home care for over two years preceding the institutional care. The one thing I have not seen in the draft framework is a way to offset the financial burden for the care of the patient. The cost of the care for my wife is costing me personally with no financial assistance is between $60,000 and $70,000 per year. Most long term care policies for this disease would not be reasonable to afford for most individuals. I think some provision needs to be made to include support for the patients with dementia or Alzheimer's disease through Medicare and this has not been addressed in the draft. This is one disease that after it reaches a certain stage cannot be handled in the home environment and must be taken care of in an institution.</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Comment: Often Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias relate to a long continuum of treatment, home care and hospitalization. Upon review of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, I find a lack of related concern for the spiritual needs of both patients and family members/caregivers. On the multiple pages of the document I find no reference to spiritual care or an assessment of the spiritual need of the patient/caregiver.</p>
<p>Frequently a patient and his/her related caregiver(s) have a relationship to a church, mosque, synagogue, or other spiritual connection. When they do not, they may move into a long period when high-quality professionals with appropriate skill do not assess nor address their spiritual needs. Referral to a professional chaplain trained in spiritual care with patients and caregivers is a necessity for high-quality care.</p>
<p>Professional practitioners are encouraged in medical literature to take a spiritual history. Christina M. Pulchalski, MD., George Washington Institute of Spirituality and Health suggests that medical caregivers address a patient's faith, belief and meaning in life, the importance and influence of spirituality, the spiritual or religious community with which the patient connects, and how the health care provider might address spiritual issues in the course of the patient's health care.</p>
<p>I suggest specifically in Goal 2 and Strategy 3.A., references for referral to professional spiritual care providers and the creation of suitable spiritual suggestions that may be included after taking a spiritual history of the patient/caregiver especially at key points of treatment -- at diagnosis, upon true onset of symptoms, at hospitalization, institutionalization and especially anticipating end of life.</p>
<p>I suggest in <strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, paragraph 1.</p>
<p>"Providing all people with Alzheimer's disease with the high-quality care in the most efficient manner requires a multi-tiered approach. High quality care requires an adequate supply of professionals with appropriate skills, ranging from direct-care worker to community health and social workers/spiritual care providers to primary care providers and specialists. . ."</p>
<p>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</p>
<p>"Caregivers report that they feel unprepared for some of the challenges of caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease -- for example, caring for a loved one with sleep disturbances, behavioral changes, or in need of physical assistance can be an enormous challenge. Giving caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner helps them better prepare for these and other challenges. Examples of potential actions under this strategy include identifying the areas of training and educational needs, identifying and creating emotionally supportive, spiritually suitable, and culturally-appropriate materials. The assessment of spiritual needs, the distribution of appropriate materials to caregivers, and the use of information technology is needed to support persons with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is now available. The draft framework is structured around five ambitious goals:</p>
<ul><li>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025.</li>
<li>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency.</li>
<li>Expand Patient and Family Support.</li>
<li>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement.Track Progress and Drive Improvement.</li>
</ul><p>HHS is seeking input on the draft framework including Goals and Strategies and additional ideas that would inform the development of an action plan.</p>
<p>Please note that throughout the draft framework, the term "Alzheimer's disease," or AD, refers to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, consistent with the approach Congress used in the National Alzheimer's Project Act. Unless otherwise noted, in this draft framework AD refers to these conditions collectively.</p>
<p>HHS will be collecting input through <strong>February 8, 2012</strong>. Please send your comments to NAPA@hhs.gov. All comments will be shared with the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>I have read the Draft Framework document and I am encouraged that it include Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long Term Care Needs.</p>
<p>May I suggest this be expanded into a national comprehensive and coordinated public awareness campaign? The need for families to get together and talk about how and where they wish to be cared for if they ever need care is one essential element. Another is to put in place the legal documents such as Powers of Attorney and Advanced Medical Directives. And, most important, to consider purchasing long term care insurance BEFORE it is too late as correctly stated in this section.</p>
<p>Please utilize the services of insurance agents who specialize in long term care insurance. I am sure that the following organizations would be glad to assist:<br />
					The American Association of Long Term Care Insurance (<a href="http://www.aaltci.org">http://www.aaltci.org</a>)<br />
					The Center for Long Term Care Reform (<a href="http://www.centerltc.com">http://www.centerltc.com</a>)<br />
					The National Association of Health Underwriters (<a href="http://www.nahu.org">http://www.nahu.org</a>)</p>
<p>Also estate attorneys, accountants and financial planners should have valuable input into such a public awareness effort.</p>
<p>Finally, within the membership of the Alzheimer's Association there are a number of authors (including myself) who have written books about their experiences. I wrote My Million Dollar Mom. <a href="http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/product.aspx?ISBN=0-7414-6713-5">http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/product.aspx?ISBN=0-7414-6713-5</a> It chronicles my time caring for Mom with the help of a wonderful care giver named Nora. I was able to keep my Mom at home until her death two years ago because she and I planned for this years in advance and that planning, the documents we had in place for her and the insurance that I bought for her made the burden that much less.</p>
<p>I would suggest a national tour of speaking engagements (or regional conference) where we authors can talk about Alzheimer's and how real the problem is.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I can do to help.</p>

<p>I applaud the committee for beginning this effort to eliminate Alzheimer's Disease AND to support patients and their caregivers who are currently dealing with this devastating disease. I am a professional in the aging field with over 20 years experience in caregiver support and training as well as supervision of In-Home Aides. I also cared for my mother in my home for 4 years before she went to a nursing home for the last two months of her life, so I can speak from a professional AND a caregiver point of view.</p>
<p>By way of supporting the current caregivers and patients I see a big need for <strong>training</strong> for facility and home care staff, especially line staff in how to deal with Alzheimer's patients and the sometimes challenging behaviors they exhibit. I see a need for facilities (nursing homes or assisted living primarily, but also hospitals) to train staff in dealing with family caregivers as care partners rather than as peripheral entities. Much lack of adequate care could be avoided by clearer communication and understanding what is happening with the patient in terms of the disease.</p>
<p>There is also a HUGE need for <strong>funding for such training, for hiring more line staff in facilities, and for providing respite for family caregivers</strong> so that they can continue to do the wonderful job they do. Without adequate funding, all the "frameworks" in the world won't make a dent in the root issue. I've seen the Family Caregiver Support Program languish for 10 years now at nearly static funding levels (which is of course going backward since costs are NOT static). The Lifespan Respite program was widely applauded and has lofty goals, but has yet to see any real funding. Caregivers are tired of hearing Congress and federal/state agencies say to them, "oh, it's so wonderful what you do and we want to support you, but there's no money so here's a proclamation (or in this case a "framework") instead."</p>
<p>Again, what you have done thus far is admirable and a good first step. Now let's try to make a difference to real people on the front lines with funding to back it up.</p>

<p>I'm adding my families voices to those who want to see Alzheimer's disease eradicated ASAP. The NAPA framework is a great start -- a late start, but a great start none the less.</p>
<p>Please accelerate the 2025 goal &amp; support the investment in Alzheimer's research &amp; figure out ways to accelerate the drug treatment. I realize this is probably one of the worst times in history to be asking for more government funding -- but we didn't make significant progress on any of the other major illnesses until we focused on them by utilizing our national resources &amp; making the eradication a priority!</p>
<p>This illness kills people, depletes their savings &amp; takes a significant toll on families &amp; caregivers. I know first-hand -- my mom has Alzheimer's, my aunt has Alzheimer's, looking back -- my grandma had some form of dementia too. Illness is never easy, but when the course of the disease is so long &amp; it takes away the essence of who you are, it becomes devastating.

<p>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Minnesota Board on Aging believes the work of the N.A.P.A. Council presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to build a comprehensive national plan to address Alzheimer's disease which has such a devastating impact on individuals with the disease and their families as well as on health and community care systems throughout the country.</p>
<p>Minnesota has an extensive history of work in Alzheimer's disease ranging from the work of such notable researchers as Dr. Ronald Peterson, Director of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center to the Minnesota legislatively mandated Alzheimer's Disease Working Group, which recently developed a statewide plan to address Alzheimer's disease. The Minnesota legislature has provided extensive funding to explore innovative models to provide community supports and services to people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers through Community Service/Service Development funding in conjunction with Alzheimer's Disease Support Services Program (A.D.S.S.P.) funding through the U.S. Administration on Aging.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Board on Aging recommends that the N.A.P.A. Council look at the accomplishments of A.D.S.S.P. for guidance in the development of the national plan. A.D.S.S.P. has provided grants to states to build core expertise in the area of Alzheimer's disease at the state and local level and within both community and health care systems. Over the last twelve years, Minnesota has gratefully used this resource to embed Alzheimer's capability within public resources such as the statewide Senior Linkage Line® and the Minnesota Long Term Care Assessment process. The development of an early identification initiative with partnering clinics and hospitals and engage in one of the first translations of the evidence-based New York University Caregiver Intervention that has a documented impact on the delay in nursing home placement by persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>We urge you to call for restoration of A.D.S.S.P. funding that was reduced by 65% for 2012. It does not make sense to so severely reduce a program that exemplifies so many of the objectives of N.A.P.A. until a program that can more effectively achieve these objectives is ready to go. We encourage you to call for an analysis of the lessons learned from A.D.S.S.P. to inform the design of a new program that builds upon its achievements. Finally, we urge you to call for adequate federal funding to meet the new program objectives. N.A.P.A. provides a unique opportunity to take the best of what we've learned and embed it within community and health care systems to provide the support and education needed anywhere people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers live while it also works towards the cure we all hope for.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Board on Aging (MBA) is the gateway to services for Minnesota seniors and their families. MBA administers funds from the Older Americans Act that provides a spectrum of services to seniors, including Senior LinkAge Line®, Insurance Counseling and more. Established in 1956, the MBA is one of the pioneers in the field of aging policy, information and assistance. It works closely with its Area Agencies on Aging, which are located throughout the state, to provide services that seniors need. The Minnesota Board on Aging's 25 members are appointed by the governor.</p>

<p>We are writing for the 53,000 Kansans who have Alzheimer's disease and the families that love them.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is unmatched in the scale of its devastating human and economic impact, combined with the fact that, today, absolutely nothing is available to stop, modify or prevent this disease. No other major chronic disease or leading cause of death fits this description.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the leadership this Administration has shown in addressing the Alzheimer's crisis. Thanks to the 2010 White House briefing on Alzheimer's disease, your comments following the passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), enactment of the law by the President, and the commendable work of your staff on the implementation of NAPA thus far, this Administration has earned the respect and elevated the expectations of the Alzheimer's community.</p>
<p>For us, who benefited from your tenure as Governor of our state, the leadership shown in this area is not surporising. You and President Obama have created an opportunity right now -- a critical moment -- to change the trajectory of this disease.</p>
<p>To seize this opportunity, the pending draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan <em>must</em> be equal to the crisis. If it does not clearly and specifically commit to the priorities, resources and policies required by the goals and strategies of the draft framework, the disappointment and frustration of seniors and boomers facing this disease will be palpable.</p>
<p>We urge you to maintain the course you have set toward a bold, urgent and accountable Natinoal Alzheimer's Plan. Continue to show the American public the leadership that has, for too long, been missing for Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Prepare Minnesota for Alzheimer's Disease 2020 (PMA 2020) collaboration congratulates NAPA on this first important step in the development of a national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease. The Draft Framework presents a comprehensive set of strategies to address this devastating disease that places an enormous emotional and financial burden on individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families and also on the health and community care systems committed to supporting them. These strategies will spur research needed to cure the disease, early detection to permit individuals and families to delay premature decline and engage in planning that can have a tremendous impact on quality of life and provide the support needed for informal caregivers to maintain their own health while providing care.</p>
<p>As NAPA moves forward in the development of the plan, we recommend that it look to the accomplishments of the Alzheimer's Disease Support Services Program (ADSSP) for inspiration and guidance. The ADSSP program is funded by the Federal Government and administered by the U.S. Administration on Aging. Nationally ADSSP has provided grants to states to build dementia capacity within public and private agencies, building a core of expertise that has led to the development of services and systems that have changed the way in which community and health care services identify and support people with dementia and their families. Over the last twelve years, Minnesota has gratefully used this resource to embed dementia capability within county long term care assessment systems, to engage with local clinics and hospitals to identify people with dementia early and connect them to education and support services and to translate evidence based interventions into practice such as the New York University Caregiver Intervention that has been demonstrated to delay nursing home placement by up to 18 months compared to the control group.</p>
<p>We encourage you to build on this strong base by calling for restored funding for ADSSP which was reduced by 65% for 2012. It makes no sense to so severely reduce a program that embodies so many of the objectives of NAPA and the Council at least until a better program that can more effectively achieve these objectives is ready to go. We encourage you to call for an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses and lessons learned from ADSSP to inform the design of a new program that builds upon its achievements. And then call for adequate federal funding to meet the new program objectives. NAPA provides an incredible opportunity to take the best of what we've learned and grow it into community and health care systems that provide the support and education needed anywhere people with dementia and their informal caregivers reside while it is also working towards the cure we all hope for.</p>
<p>PMA 2020 is a voluntary, state-wide collaboration of medical, academic, community, government, business and nonprofit stakeholders across Minnesota seeking to implement needed system change, using the Minnesota legislatively mandated Alzheimer's Disease Working Group recommendations as a springboard for action.</p>

<p>My name is Bruce Lamb and I am an Alzheimer's researcher and Staff Scientist in the Department of Neuroscience in the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. I would like to provide comments and suggestions regarding the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that was released on January 9, 2012.</p>
<p>I think this is a very welcome and important first step in devising a National Plan for combating Alzheimer's, and the goal laid out for developing a treatment/prevention for Alzheimer's disease by the year 2025 is admirable and likely achievable, provided the plan is sufficiently bold and transformative. While I appreciate that the current document is only a Framework for the National Plan, there are several significant issues that I hope you will consider as the details of the plan are developed, in particular as it relates to research investments, strategies, goals and infrastructure (Goal 1).</p>
<p><strong>1) Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
					The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</p>
<p><strong>2) Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
					The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</p>
<p><strong>3) Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
					To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</p>

<p>I would like to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD). I appreciate the efforts to develop a national plan for most effectively addressing AD. The overall goals of the Plan are important, but they seem to focus more on medical aspects of dementia and focus little on psychological, behavioral, and functional aspects of dementia. In particular, a greater focus on promoting each of the following is critical for more fully addressing AD and its impact: (1) research and practice related to psychological interventions for managing behavioral sequelae of dementia; (2) research on approaches designed to maximize independence of individuals with dementia, including residing at home (which I think is increasingly going to be the trend in the future); (3) research on and demonstration of innovative care settings for individuals with dementia and severe behavioral or mental health issues. In addition, psychologists are conspicuously absent in the section on building a workforce to provide high quality care to individuals with dementia, though psychiatrists, social workers, neurologists, and others are specified. Psychologists are essential to the assessment and management of AD and many co-occurring conditions and work as core members of interdisciplinary teams in a wide variety of clinical settings that provide care to individuals with AD. Furthermore, in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), psychologists work as integral, full-time members of each (130+) Home Based Primary Care team that provides care to Veterans in their homes, some of which have AD or other forms of dementia. Accordingly, the specification of psychologists in the Plan as an important part of the workforce for effectively treating AD and for focused recruitment efforts is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of these comments.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to commend HHS for proactively working towards a comprehensive plan to address the personal and public impact of Alzheimer's disease. This plan is needed to ensure that there is proper allocation of resources to address dementias both empirically and clinically.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that the plan did not mention the field of Psychology. Psychological researchers have played an integral role in the knowledge base on dementias and have developed diagnostic tools which are highly specific, yet cost effective. Furthermore, Psychologists and Neuropsychologists are often called upon to make formal diagnosis of dementia, relay this diagnostic information to patients and families, provide psychoeducation and support, assist with advanced care planning, assist teams/families in identifying and using non-pharmacological strategies for managing difficult behaviors, and provide services at the end-of-life.</p>
<p>As a Psychologist within the VA healthcare system, I provide such services within our Community Living Centers (i.e., nursing homes). Psychologists are specially trained to understand the psychosocial factors impacting older adults, as well as cultural/diversity impacts. As such, Psychologists are poised to deliver high quality assessment and intervention services to persons with dementia and their families. Furthermore, Psychologists have unique skills in assessment and program evaluation which allows us to monitor and measure our work in a way that can be directly linked to cost savings. I have seen how Psychology's presence on the CLCs has led to more positive outcomes, such as the significant reduction of use of antipsychotic medications, reduced caregiver burden, improved mood functioning for patients, and reduced strain on staff.</p>
<p>The exclusion of Psychologists in this framework could have detrimental financial impacts on our ability to provide these services in the future. I strongly believe that the elimination of Psychology from the interdisciplinary teams serving dementia patients would have dire effects on the provision of quality care.</p>
<p>I appreciate your strong consideration of including Psychologists in this framework.</p>

<p>Thank-you for the opportunity to suggest several minor enhancements to the "National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>The third sentence of Goal 2 to "Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency" should be edited as follows, to be inclusive of the 114,000 secured Assisted Living settings in the US that provide specialized programming and care for those with various forms of Dementia and Alzheirmer's (data source, National Investment Center, <a href="http://www.nic.org/research/faqs1.aspx">http://www.nic.org/research/faqs1.aspx</a>):</p>
<p><em><strong>High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis through the end-of-life and in settings including people's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, licensed assisted living communities and nursing homes. </strong></em></p>
<p>Including this reference will balance the fact that the only other current reference in this document to the Assisted Living industry is within the context of abuse in Strategy 3.D.</p>
<p>The wording in Strategy 3.D provides information, but is not proposing any changes or enhancements to minimize the abusers or to properly recognize that the vast majority of those providing care for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias do "maintain the dignity, safety, and rights of peoples with Alzheimer's Disease." I propose the following wording enhancements:</p>
<p><em><strong>People with Alzheimer's disease are particularly vulnerable to financial exploitation, physical or emotional abuse, and neglect both at home and in institutional care settings <s>residential care facilities</s>.<sup>18</sup> Reports of elder abuse are handled by state Adult Protective Services, which is charged with responding to and resolving alleged abuse. State survey and certification agencies investigate abuse in licensed facilities, which may include nursing homes, assisted living facilities and board and care homes. AoA's National Long-Term Care Ombudsmen are advocates for residents of nursing homes, board and care homes, assisted living facilities, and similar adult care facilities and can help address issues related to potential abuse or neglect. National trend reporting of substantiated cases of abuse or neglect for those with Alzheimer's by care setting type, as a percentage of total residents cared for, should be enhanced to better inform the public of those settings most likely to provide the type of care and support expected and the low incidence of this type of abuse.</strong></em></p>
<p>Please let me know if you have questions that I may be of assistance with or need a clarification related to my suggestions for improving your plan documents.</p>

<p>Hello, I received the draft framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and when I read through the draft, I was surprised to find that the words "psychologist" or "psychology" don't appear even once in the Draft. Even though many of the services psychologists provide are noted as vitally important to focus on in the coming years, psychologists are not listed as one of the essential disciplines under "Goal 2." My work in Home Based Primary Care is but one healthcare setting in which psychologists play an important role in the care of these patients. I see this as a serious error because it simply doesn't reflect the reality of healthcare today for persons with Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
