<div class="report-abstracttitle">Abstract</div>
<div class="report-abstract">      This report describes how state health agencies(SHAs) and local health department(LHDs) use information technology systems to capture, manage,      analyze, and report information. It assesses trends in use of information technology(IT) among SHAs and LHDs following the Health Information       Technology for Economic and Clinical Health(HITECH) Act of 2009, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act(ACA) of 2010, recent work in public      health informatics, and other factors. The study found public health departments making important advances in use of IT, but did not find a single      "best practice" approach. Public health officials face common challenges, including variation and ongoing evolution of public health activities,       lack of training on informatics and process re-design, shrinking funding and constraints that limit strategic investment and encourage data silos.      Most respondents agreed that, in the future, public health practice will require and integrated approach to managing information and collaboration       with health-care providers and other partners. The report describes essential qualities of an effective strategic framework to guide investments.    </div>

<p class="MsoBodyText">This project conducted for the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the United States Department of Health and  Human Services assesses trends in the use of information technology (IT) by  state and local governmental public health departments. Although public health  departments routinely capture and manage data electronically and use the  Internet and system-to-system interfaces to transfer information, they struggle  to establish integrated approaches to capturing, managing, analyzing and  sharing information across programs and jurisdictions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found public health departments making important  advances in use of IT, but we did not find a single “best practice” approach.  Public health officials face common challenges, including variation and ongoing  evolution of public health activities, lack of training on informatics and  process re-design, shrinking funding and constraints that limit strategic  investment and encourage data silos.  Most agree that, in the future, public  health practice will require an integrated approach to managing information and  collaboration with health-care providers and other partners. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the  Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act,  and the field of public health informatics bring opportunities while revealing  important gaps and posing new challenges. HITECH motivates electronic reporting  but does not emphasize the IT needs of public health practice. The ACA  emphasizes population health goals but does not define a role for public health  departments. Informatics projects break new ground, but have not yet benefited  most public health departments. Many stakeholders await more direction before  acting on opportunities from ACA and HITECH.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Discussions with dozens of public health leaders suggest  that public health departments need access to predictable, sustained and  flexible resources supporting capital investments, workforce training, business  process analysis and, importantly, use of standards and interoperable systems.  Public health departments can benefit from planning IT investments around  underlying work processes and their current and future information needs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By articulating a strategic framework for using IT, some  public health departments are pursuing a path that reduces unnecessary  redundancy and improves the quality and scope of information available for  public health practitioners. For example, by capturing demographic data one  time to support multiple services; aligning data from multiple administrative  and programmatic sources to help address service needs or using health-care  provider generated data, public health departments can increase efficiency and  innovation. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Developing an effective strategic framework requires  knowledgeable leadership to identify relevant data sources, document public  health practice, understand legacy systems, work with vendors and visualize how  to improve functions through better information flow. A framework helps  agencies address known priorities as funds become available rather than simply react  to funding opportunities. Stakeholders uniformly believe that the federal  government, national organizations and funders of all kinds can facilitate  progress towards improved use of public health IT by endorsing and fostering  integration, interoperability, common standards and business processes and  increased collaboration between health-care providers and agencies with public  health responsibility at all levels.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">NORC  at the University of Chicago is pleased to submit this final report for  Assessing the Status and Prospects of State and Local Health Department  Information Technology Infrastructure, a project of the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the United States Department of Health and  Human Services. NORC and ASPE worked in close partnership with the National  Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) and the Association of  State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This report describes how state health agencies (SHAs) and  local health departments (LHDs) use information technology systems to capture,  manage, analyze, and report information. We assess trends in use of information  technology (IT) among SHAs and LHDs following the Health Information Technology  for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, recent work in public health  informatics, and other factors. This project assumes that IT tools and  resources should play a role in governmental public health practice. However,  we also assume that rigorous assessments of public health goals should motivate  IT projects and that stakeholders should design and implement IT in direct  service of those goals.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This report reflects synthesis information gathered from  public health stakeholders as well as existing literature and reports. We  describe key elements of our approach below.</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>         </span></span><b>Technical expert panel (TEP)</b>. Appendix 1 to this report  lists the TEP members selected for their experience and expertise in public health  practice, public health information science or public health program  management. We conducted one TEP meeting in February of 2012. This meeting  helped inform case study locations selected as well as the topics. We met with  the TEP again in October of 2012 to discuss findings from case studies and  receive comments on an interim version of this report. In many cases, we also  conducted one-on-one discussions with TEP members and TEP members offered  detailed edits and contributions to this report.</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>         </span></span><b>Telephone discussions with key stakeholders</b>. In Appendix  2, we list a number of leaders from public health informatics and state, local  and federal public health. We met with these stakeholders by telephone to  discuss specific public health applications or topics. In some cases, we  present key elements of these conversations as “mini-case studies” referenced  as examples throughout this report. </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>         </span></span><b>Review of existing literature and reports.</b> We conducted a  thorough review of existing peer reviewed literature, gray literature and  online information related to use of IT by public health practitioners. </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>         </span></span><b>In-depth case studies in three locations.</b> Finally, we  conducted in-person site visits in three different locations: Northern Florida,  Central Michigan and Western Oregon. As part of these site visits we held  discussions with leadership, epidemiologists and clinical staff from SHAs and  LHDs. We chose locations, in part, based on their innovation in specific areas.  However, we also sought a comprehensive understanding of each agency’s mission,  activities and the role of IT in their work. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc347232266" id="_Toc347232266">Public Health Practice and Health IT</a> </h2>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health officials need timely access to valid and  reliable data necessary to monitor health status and health-related factors.  They rely on data to develop and implement programs that protect health and  ensure safety. Like their counterparts in other domains, public health  professionals increasingly turn to advances in IT to support their need to  capture, exchange, manage and analyze data. This project does not cover all  public health activities, but we look at several public health functions and  common uses of IT to support these functions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While public health officials rely on surveys and other  population-wide data collection strategies for some purposes, much of the  information relevant to public health originates with the health-care delivery  system or other social service sectors. These data include diagnosis and  treatment information for infectious and chronic diseases, patterns in patient  complaints or symptoms that may suggest an outbreak, vaccination records, birth  and death records, results from screening of newborns for life-threatening  conditions, and data related to other priority areas. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health departments have adopted different information  systems to help capture data from health-care providers and other sources. For  example, SHAs manage disease surveillance systems, designed to capture data on  the diagnosis and treatment of a series of “notifiable” diseases specified in  state law. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs and SHAs also manage registries for specific  purposes, such as vaccine registries, where pediatricians and other providers  supply data on vaccinations, or cancer registries, where providers submit  information on cancer diagnoses. SHAs and LHDs capture records of the births  and deaths taking place in their jurisdiction and results from beginning of  life screening for life-threatening conditions, early hearing detection and  birth defects. Finally, SHAs and LHDs often collect, manage and report data related  to federal programs such as maternal and child health authorized under Title V  of the Social Security Act, and the Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental  Feeding Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs may provide clinical services or other personal  health services. Direct services include full primary medical care services for  uninsured and low-income individuals through Federally Qualified Health Centers  (FQHCs), oral health, behavioral health, clinics for HIV/AIDS funded under the  Ryan White Care Act, sexually transmitted disease (STDs) clinics, WIC services,  vaccine clinics and maternal and child health programs funded under Title V.  Like their private and non-profit sector clinical counterparts, LHDs use  applications such as practice management systems and electronic health records  (EHRs) to capture demographics, assess eligibility for public programs, record  encounters and report to state systems.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like other providers of clinical services, LHDs provide  data to SHA systems such as immunization registries. As agents of the state or  federal government implementing programs under Title V and the Ryan White  Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, LHDs also submit data to  state and federal agencies for program reporting. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHD epidemiologists and case investigators use data from  local and state disease surveillance systems to assess local trends and  follow-up with affected clients, their providers and contacts. In this way,  LHDs both report data to state systems and use data from state systems to do  their work. LHDs also maintain environmental health databases used to manage  information on inspection and licensing of businesses and facilities that pose  environmental health risks (e.g., restaurants, septic tanks, water treatment facilities).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The data necessary to support public health action comes  from sources far beyond those captured and managed by public health  applications. Exhibit ES-1 below shows different types of relevant data  including those generated by the health-care delivery system and other  governmental agencies that can inform population health assessments and case  management. Many public health stakeholders seek efficient ways to routinely  integrate data across these sources to support public health action.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Funding for Public Health IT</span></b></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Funding opportunities and the general availability of  funds can drive IT adoption among local and state governmental public health  stakeholders as they have done for individual and organizational providers. The  majority of funding for LHDs comes from local revenues, state revenue and  federal program funding passed through the states. Remaining funds come from  direct federal grants, third party reimbursement and fees. SHAs receive the  plurality (45 percent) of their funding from federal sources, slightly less  from state revenue (39 percent) and the remainder from smaller sources  including fees.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1"><sup><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></sup></a>  At both the state and local level, these percentages vary considerably as do  overall public health expenditures. For example, per capita spending among LHDs  varies between over $50 and less than $20 dollars per resident depending on the  jurisdiction.<sup></sup><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="" id="_ednref2"><span>[2]</span></a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Regardless of the source of funding, stakeholders note  serious challenges with maintaining steady funding to SHAs and LHDs. Public  health currently accounts for less than 0.1 percent of GDP and less than three  percent of federal health-related expenditures.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="" id="_ednref3"><sup><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></sup></a>  <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="" id="_ednref4"><sup><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></sup></a>  In  2011, 58 percent of LHDs reported core funding cuts, and 55 percent reduced  funding to at least one program. Furthermore, LHDs faced budget reductions of  52 percent in the next year.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="" id="_ednref5"><sup><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></sup></a>  Because of budget shortfalls at the federal, state, and local levels SHAs and  LHDs have lost 15 percent of the state and local workforce from 2008 to 2011.  Forty-four percent of SHAs and LHDs reported that they lost staff in 2011.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="" id="_ednref6"><sup><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Unfortunately, relatively little systematic information is  available on LHD and SHA spending for IT and related expenditures. In some jurisdictions,  processes used to fund IT across all departments also govern public health  systems investments. LHDs sit within a larger governmental structure such as a  city or county. Department practitioners do not always direct or control how  the larger local or state governmental IT staff makes decisions regarding new  investments in IT systems and capacity.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>Overcoming     Silos in New York State</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">In New York State, the Department of Health’s     Division of Family Services (DFS) has used funding from the HRSA-administered     Maternal and Child Health Services Title V Block Grants and the State     Systems Development Initiative to undertake a program called Child Health     Information Integration (CHI2), which aims to integrate newborn screening,     newborn hearing screening, immunization, lead, early intervention, WIC,     Medicaid, vital statistics and other data sources into one interface and     create bi-directional sharing of DFS’s maternal and child health data with     its external partners.</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found that public health practitioners base IT  decisions on pragmatic factors including cost and ease of compliance with  reporting requirements. For example, an agency that begins receiving funding  under a different federal or foundation grants may use these requirements to  justify the acquisition or development of a new system to capture, manage and  report data in the format required by that funder. This results in a series of  data silos set up for individual programs where data are not easily integrated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found some examples of specific initiatives designed to  overcome the silos created by programs funded under categorical grants (see  example in text box at left). Many stakeholders have urged funders to allow  greater flexibility in allowing use of some funds to support an underlying  infrastructure that serves multiple programs. </p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Recently, a series of initiatives have led to changes in  the way stakeholder use IT to capture data relevant to public health. While  many initiatives focus primarily on health care providers, they do affect LHDs  and SHAs as well. We explore key initiatives below. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc343841679" id="_Toc343841679"></a><a name="_Toc343823713" id="_Toc343823713"></a><a name="_Toc343823579" id="_Toc343823579"></a><a name="_Toc343760601" id="_Toc343760601"></a><a name="_Toc343760534" id="_Toc343760534"></a><a name="_Toc343760434" id="_Toc343760434"></a><a name="_Toc343697819" id="_Toc343697819">HITECH Programs and Public  Health Information Systems</a></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The HITECH Act encourages health-care provider adoption  and use of EHRs to electronically exchange data. HITECH affects whether local  and state governmental health departments can connect with health-care provider  and organization information systems and participate in health information  exchange (HIE) in a number of ways. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">First, HITECH created the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  Incentive Program which provides financial incentives for individual  health-care providers and hospitals. Providers are eligible for incentives if  they have a significant share of Medicare or Medicaid patients, adopt EHRs  certified through a process established under the law, and can demonstrate  “Meaningful Use” of their EHRs. Some of the criteria associated with Meaningful  Use require use of EHRs to submit data electronically to SHA systems such as  notifiable disease reporting systems, syndromic surveillance systems and  immunization registries. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This, in turn, requires that the state or local  governmental public health department systems are able to accept and use  provider data submitted electronically using messaging and content standards  specified under Meaningful Use. Some states plan to use federal 90 percent  matching funds under Medicaid to support investments in their public health  systems to help providers meet the public health reporting criteria associated  with Meaningful Use.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These opportunities are available under State Medicaid  Director Letters 10-016 (Federal funding for Medicaid HIT activities)<sup></sup><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="" id="_ednref7"><span>[7]</span></a> and 11-004 (Federal  funding for HIE development).<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="" id="_ednref8"><sup><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></sup></a>    Eight states have been approved for funding to support different types of HIE  under this letter. For example, Massachusetts is developing a single public  health gateway to obtain data on reportable laboratory results, immunizations  and syndromic surveillance from eligible providers and eligible hospitals.<sup></sup><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="" id="_ednref9"><span>[9]</span></a> </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>Partnership     for Diabetes and Asthma in SE Minnesota</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">The Southeast Minnesota Beacon Community, public     health-care managers are helping to facilitate transitions between     ambulatory care and hospital settings through electronic exchange of EHR     data using a CCD format. One participating county notes a reduction in     hospital re-admissions for diabetes and childhood asthma through this     initiative.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="" id="_ednref10"><sup><sup><span>[10]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, stakeholders note than in many cases public  health departments cannot fund the 10 percent required to take advantage of  these funds or do not have close ties to their Medicaid agency to facilitate  this use of matching funds.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In some cases clinical staff at LHDs may also be eligible  for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments. However,  bachelor’s level public health nurses that administer much of the care in  public health clinics are not eligible for Meaningful Use payments.  Furthermore, many public health clinics predominantly care for uninsured  individuals rather than those covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Finally, because  of an increased emphasis on case management and care for individuals with  specific infectious conditions, many public health clinicians are not able to  find certified EHRs that meet their needs and do not have the resources to  develop customized applications that meet certification criteria. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Other HITECH programs also relate, in part, to public  health. The State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program supports state-based  efforts to ensure that providers have options for effective standards-based  electronic exchange of clinical information with other providers and local and  state governmental public health departments. In a recent review of 27 state  programs, 74 percent indicated that their SHA is heavily involved in state HIE  activities. Still, it appears that public health reporting was not an initial  priority for many state HIE programs as slightly less than half of 27 programs  indicated that they support public health use cases for HIE such as exchange  with immunization registries or notifiable disease reporting.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="" id="_ednref11"><sup><sup><span>[11]</span></sup></sup></a> Some states, including  Florida have moved forward with public health use cases including working  towards “public health nodes” to allow local public health clinics a mechanism  to access information on care received in other settings and to facilitate reporting  from health-care providers to SHAs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">HITECH’s Beacon Community Cooperative Agreement Program  provides another link to population health objectives. Under Beacon, ONC  provided selected communities resources to build and strengthen their health IT  and quality reporting infrastructure and support improvements in quality of  care and efficiency. Public health involvement in some of the funded Beacon  communities highlights the intersection between health reform objectives,  population health objectives and health IT. For example, the Louisiana Public  Health Institute and the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals  contribute to the Crescent City Beacon Community based in New Orleans. This  program uses EHR data to help clinicians track and manage health outcomes for  diabetics in New Orleans. Similarly, in Southeast Minnesota, a Beacon Community  collaborates with the LHD to facilitate effective communication and care  coordination following hospital discharge to reduce re-admissions for  ambulatory care sensitive conditions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Also related to HITECH, ONC’s Office of Interoperability  and Standards manages the Standards and Interoperability Framework (S&amp;I  framework). This is a process where public and private sector stakeholders  collaborate to identify priorities for HIE standards, create and harmonize  standards and test standards through pilots. The S&amp;I framework includes a  Public Health Reporting Initiative supported in-part by the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) focusing on standards for electronic reporting for  health-care providers to public health departments. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Public Health Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC)  working through the S&amp;I framework and related initiatives has helped  establish and test standards for public health functions. They have helped  develop standards to support programs for early hearing detection and  intervention (EHDI) services, public health laboratory reporting and standards  for reporting to state-level cancer registries. </p>

<h3>The Affordable Care Act and Public Health</h3>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>Collaboration     on Chronic Disease in Denver</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">Denver Health (a local public health agency),     collaborates with local ambulatory care providers to establish a     cardiovascular disease (CVD) registry, maintained by public health     officials, populated by EHRs from providers in the community that receive     data and analysis from the registry to support their quality reporting. </p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Stakeholders note that programs to track population health  and target public health resources and interventions can work effectively to  promote improvement in health care delivery and lead to improved health  outcomes. While the ACA does focus on achieving population health objectives,  it does not map out a specific mechanism for public health departments to  engage with health care providers to achieve these goals. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The ACA creates demonstration and pilot programs  emphasizing care transitions, referral management and care coordination. Some  ACA initiatives focus on use of “community pathway hubs” where community health  workers coordinate services including social support, behavioral health and  housing assistance for high-need individuals. The ACA also specifically  promotes population health by requiring insurance coverage for preventive  services, supporting Title V maternal and child health home visiting programs  and requiring hospitals to conduct community-based health needs assessments.  While stakeholders are not required to work with public health departments to  achieve these objectives, they do represent potential opportunities for  collaboration. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We identified pockets of innovation, including in Oregon  and Vermont, where state and LHDs provide data, analytic resources and public  health interventions supporting goals outlined in the ACA. Stakeholders suggest  that demand for community-level data on health-care quality and outcomes will  increase because of ACA and cost-containment efforts. With the improved access  to data and new models for analyzing and tracking trends, public health may be  in a good position to be a neutral arbiter in this area providing objective  information on health status and outcomes using provider-generated data. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some officials noted optimism that public health could  contribute to ACA by helping manage the health of populations in tandem with  health-care providers and payers, but acknowledged uncertainty regarding the  best path for bringing this idea to fruition. In addition, some stakeholders  note that new ACA rules requiring health insurers to offer more comprehensive  coverage of preventive services recommended by entities such as the United  States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) may benefit public health  departments that are able to effectively bill for these services. However, they  also note that these provisions may have the unintended consequence of reducing  the need for categorical funding to public health for preventive services.  These funds represent important financial support for public health  departments.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In this section we highlight findings from our three case  studies. We visited Northern Florida, Central Michigan and Western Oregon and,  in each location, spoke in-depth with public health practitioners from two LHDs  and leadership within each state’s health department. The case studies offered  an opportunity to observe dynamics across programs and state and local  boundaries and assess the role of IT in states with different models governing  state and local public health. In this Executive Summary, we briefly summarize  the context and main findings from each of these case studies.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc343841682" id="_Toc343841682"></a><a name="_Toc343823716" id="_Toc343823716"></a><a name="_Toc343823582" id="_Toc343823582"></a><a name="_Toc343760604" id="_Toc343760604"></a><a name="_Toc343760537" id="_Toc343760537"></a><a name="_Toc343760437" id="_Toc343760437"></a><a name="_Toc343697822" id="_Toc343697822">Northern Florida</a></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Florida, we visited the Duval County Health Department  in Jacksonville, the Alachua County Health Department based in Gainesville, and  the State Department of Health in Tallahassee. Florida has a state-operated or  consolidated model where LHDs adapt to the needs of their communities but rely  on the state to support staffing, oversight, information systems and technical  support. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We investigated the state’s development of a practice  management and clinical solution called the Health Management System (HMS). The  state developed HMS using a database platform provided by the InterSystems  Corporation. The state’s informatics lead works very closely with software  developers and staff at LHDs to create and customize specific clinical modules  within HMS that meet the personal care delivery and reporting needs of local  public health practitioners in Florida. As of November 2012, the public health  department has gained accreditation for the HMS system as a certified EHR,  which will allow some public health practitioners to qualify for Meaningful Use  incentive payments. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">States typically manage multiple public health systems. In  Florida, these systems include a newborn screening records system, an  immunization registry (FL SHOTS), a notifiable disease surveillance system  (Merlin), a syndromic surveillance system (ESSENCE), an STD surveillance and  contact management system (PRISM) and systems for reporting to the federal  government under Title V and Ryan White (CAREWare). These are typical of the  silos referenced above.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many of public health clinical service providers use a  hybrid approach, capturing some data in HMS, some on paper and some using  disease specific systems such as PRISM and CAREWare. Furthermore, although most  of the state systems for reporting (e.g., newborn screening, immunizations,  surveillance) have effectively adopted electronic laboratory reporting (ELR)  practitioners in hospitals and LHDs continue to enter data twice, once for  their own use and a second time for reporting to the state. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even with a state-run consolidated model, Florida  illustrates how multiple systems and data silos emerge given the diverse  clinical, case management and reporting requirements facing public health  departments. This case study shows the challenges to consolidating data from  different systems and building interfaces to support local and state  governmental public health department action. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Findings from Florida also highlight characteristics of  sound leadership in public health information systems planning. Leadership  within the state had a good understanding of the history and constraints that  led to current practice and were able to put the state on a strategic path. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Michigan has a decentralized system of local governmental  public health departments. In Michigan, we investigated public health use of IT  at the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), a superagency that  covers Medicaid, mental and behavioral health and public health (but not many  environmental health and licensing functions); the Ingham County Health  Department (ICHD), and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MMDHD).  Michigan illustrates some important models for data integration and exchange of  data between public health and providers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The state’s immunization registry, the Michigan Care  Improvement Registry (MCIR) pulls data from the newborn screening database as  well as the state’s Medicaid data warehouse. This gives providers easy access  to information on newborn screening testing results, early hearing detection  and intervention (EHDI) assessments, blood lead screening results and  information on early and periodic diagnosis and treatment (EPSDT) requirements  for children on Medicaid.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Medicaid data warehouse itself serves as an example of  strategic planning to integrate data relevant to public health from different  systems. MCDH’s Office of Medicaid Health Information Technology plans to build  on an existing warehouse of Medicaid encounter data by allowing users to  combine these data with the state’s notifiable disease surveillance system,  vital records, syndromic surveillance, state public health laboratories, a  cancer registry, and a future chronic disease registry. The data warehouse uses  a master patient index (MPI) to match data to clients across disparate systems.  Michigan envisions including provider-generated data from EHRs into the  warehouse through links with a state-wide HIE hub.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like Florida, stakeholders at the state-level in Michigan  have a solid vision for organizing and managing data related to public health.  However, they may be less able to leverage this vision to break down silos at  the local level. Because LHDs in Michigan are independent and governed by  county leaders, there is not a single state-wide clinic management application  to support patient-facing services at public health clinics in Michigan. Nor  does the vision include integration with other local and state non-clinical  operations and data which can provide useful information about the patient,  resident and their environment.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mid-Michigan Health Department uses Netsmart’s Insight  application as a public health practice management and EHR application.  Meanwhile in Ingham County, the local health department has just adopted the  NextGen EHR for their FQHC sites and is working on customizing NextGen to work  in their other clinical programs such as communicable disease clinics, maternal  and child health clinics and home visiting programs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found some stand-alone systems that were outside of the  strategic plan led by the Office of Medicaid Health IT. Specifically, the  state’s Maternal and Infant Health Program that manages all the Title V funding  in the state still uses some paper-based reporting systems. The systems used to  manage data related to these programs do not easily share data with any other  state or local health department systems. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Despite the sophisticated Medicaid systems and innovative  registry projects like MCIR, the Michigan case illustrates the challenge of  bringing data together across disparate and uncoordinated systems for public  health action. As in other states, LHDs in Michigan procure their own IT  systems. Like many state governmental public health departments, these LHDs  sometimes lack the expertise, time and resources to adequately plan for  implementation. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">In Oregon, we met with Washington County Department of  Public Health, Multnomah County Department of Public Health and the Oregon  Health Authority (OHA). As in Michigan, Oregon’s LHDs are legally independent  of the state’s public health agency. LHDs receive very little state funding,  technical assistance, and oversight. As a result, LHDs have developed homegrown  and stand-alone data systems. Additionally, Oregon has a number of small rural  and frontier counties with extremely limited resources- these jurisdictions may  not have any full-time IT staff and make very limited use of computers and  information technology to support their mission. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We visited Oregon, in part, because of innovative efforts  to include public health in health-care reform. In August of 2012, the state  began implementing Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). CCOs are local health  umbrella organizations that will deliver health-care coverage for people who  are eligible for Medicaid managed care in Oregon and will have performance based  payment incentives that will reward quality improvement and cost control. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Staff from OHA and LHDs take part in CCO planning and  implementation. The initial focus for these efforts is around reducing “high  cost” hospital care. In some parts of Oregon, such as Washington County, public  health departments have developed collaborative efforts with local providers to  support community-wide quality of care measurement. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Currently, Oregon has multiple state systems with limited  interoperability or capacity to share data to support core public health  functions including epidemiology, surveillance, monitoring and assurance.  ORPHEUS, the state’s main communicable disease surveillance system, does not  interface with providers’ EHRs, but does receive data automatically from  clinical laboratories through electronic lab reporting (ELR). Oregon’s  immunization registry program, called ALERT IIS currently interfaces with  multiple EHR products including the Insight public health EHR used in  Washington County. The immunization registry also accepts batched data in  formats such as flat-files, Excel and HL7 from different provider  organizations. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As in other places, Oregon’s LHDs adopt and customize  information systems on their own. Although the FQHC in Multnomah County has  long used the Epic EHR, the public health clinics have not been able to find  resources to use Epic for their work. One barrier cited is the lack of case  management functionality built into Epic, a core public health activity. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a result, Multnomah County has developed dozens of  individual systems to support different programs and services. Multnomah County  recently established an informatics committee to document these homegrown  applications. This committee also educates staff about the process used within  their county government for proposing IT capital improvement projects. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We began by noting that public health department IT  investments should be driven by an objective assessment of public health goals  and activities and the information needs necessary to support those efforts.  Findings from this project illustrate support for this concept among public  health stakeholders, but highlight a series of organizational and  funding-related challenges as well as challenges stemming from shifting emphasis  in public health activities. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>LHDs need resources to plan, design, and implement  coordinated IT systems for their own use and to integrate with the rapidly  developing clinical sector.</b> While clinical services are a small and  diminishing part of public health department activities, public health  departments conducting case investigation, care coordination or case management  will continue to capture data from individuals. This project illustrates the  importance of establishing tools for the capture, management and use of data  needed to support personal services in public health clinics and those  delivered by public health visiting nurses and case managers. Ideally these  tools would allow easy exchange or integration of these data with data on the  same populations from other sources. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Health departments need a better understanding and  documentation of the business rules and processes underlying public health  function.</b> A clear theme in our work is that effective investments in the  design and implementation of public health information resources must begin  with a detailed and well documented understanding of public health practice,  both broadly and as practiced in specific jurisdictions. Many public health  departments understand this imperative, but lack the necessary staff expertise,  time and resources to prioritize this activity. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Currently, public health relies on non-integrated IT  systems. </b>Overcoming data silos will be a clear objective for future public  health systems initiatives. Stakeholders identify two paths for moving past  silos. The first involves adoption of a common meta-data model or scheme for  how data elements used in public health relate to one another. This scheme  would be common to all applications used by an agency or would govern a data repository  underlying each of these applications. This would enable multiple applications  within an agency to draw on commonly structured data and avoid duplication. The  second involves assuring interoperability across systems used by different  public health departments and health-care providers through use of common  messaging standards, content standards and interfaces. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Vendors can play an important role as landscape  evolves.</b> While a relatively new and immature market, IT vendors targeting  public health departments are increasingly aware of the importance of  integration and the benefits of standardized business processes and information  standards for public health. Currently, limited resources and a lack of a  common venue for engaging with public health department customers may preclude  beneficial engagement between potential public health department customers and  vendors. While there are a limited number of vendors committed to the public  health market, we spoke with some vendors familiar with public health processes  and eager to engage with knowledgeable and sophisticated partners at LHDs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Having a vision and model for capturing, maintaining  and using data may be more realistic and useful than adoption of a  comprehensive infrastructure for public health information systems in the near  future.</b> Given variations in the priorities and capacities of public health  departments, the path for achieving single common data architecture for public  health remains unclear. Use of a standard architecture to support public health  programs across departments will require significant time and resources. As a  first step, programs, policy and funding opportunities may encourage consistent  use of data content and messaging standards and establish a common  understanding of the relationship between different data elements relevant to  public health programs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>HITECH raises awareness, but also highlights gaps in IT  capacity at public health departments.</b> HITECH has raised awareness of the  exchange of data between public health and health care and highlights gaps in  defining best practices for public health IT. Examples of public health  participation in initiatives to improve care through the Beacon Cooperative  Agreement program show the potential benefits of public health engagement on  quality improvement initiatives leveraging data from health IT systems. While  these efforts are limited to a few locations in the country, they will offer  some useful case examples for consideration in other jurisdictions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Public health’s ability to assess and improve quality  of care and chronic disease management post-ACA remains unclear. </b>Many  stakeholders agree that public health departments can play an important role in  advancing the objectives of the ACA by providing objective community-level  health assessments bringing together multiple sources of data and supporting  care coordination across providers. SHAs in OR, MI and likely elsewhere are  involved in state-wide Medicaid health-care delivery reform efforts and federal  demonstration projects. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, even in these cases, stakeholders have not  comprehensively defined how public health departments will participate and the  capacity-building necessary for public health departments to take on this role.  Clarifying a role for public health will require a better understanding of the  business processes and data flow necessary to support public health  surveillance and programs related to chronic diseases as well as a commitment  from public health departments, the care delivery community and public and  private payers to work together on these issues. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Models for incorporating provider-generated data to  support population health management need additional attention.</b> Most public  health departments have not yet developed models to access and use  provider-generated data, to monitor processes of care or outcomes or assess the  status of vulnerable populations. This will require development of new models  to capture, transmit and analyze data and, importantly, cooperation on the part  of the medical care community. New York City, Vermont and Denver offer early  examples of public health working collaboratively with health-care providers in  this area. A 2010 NACCHO report shows that local health department staff  prioritized “using clinical data to improve quality of care” as a subject for  workforce training over other informatics topics.<sup></sup><a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="" id="_ednref12"><span>[12]</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Public health operational, governance and financing  models vary. </b>Several factors drive variation across public health  departments including the extent to which federal funds administered at the  state-level make use of LHDs as care providers; the extent to which SHAs  control or manage LHDs; the priority state and local government leaders place  on public health and the historic role of public health in a given  jurisdiction. This is one reason why a single architecture or model for public  health infrastructure may not be feasible. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Strategic investments may require a different approach  to financing IT. </b>Our findings suggest that public health departments fund  innovation largely by making creative use of operational funds from  programmatic grants or special projects. This approach can limit the strategic  impact of these innovations, limit the extent to which they facilitate useful  integration of data across programs and affect their sustainability. Using  time-limited operational funds may constrain the timing of investments and not  allow for strategic planning or the use of best practices from informatics. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Importance of leadership.</b> Leadership is a critical  element to the success of an endeavor to improve the use of data and  information systems to achieve public health objectives. Public officials  making strides in public health informatics come with a very detailed  understanding of workflows and data flows associated with public health and the  extent to which public health officials struggle with manipulating data in  different ways to answer key questions. They bring a willingness to engage in a  detailed way with vendors and IT professionals on mapping out requirements,  re-thinking workflows and processes and then building enthusiasm among public  health staff for continuous quality improvement and informatics. They also  bring knowledge of national initiatives and how they relate to the specific  objectives and challenges facing their state or local jurisdiction. And they  place importance on these activities, ensuring they occur.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Implications for technical assistance programs.</b> We  found limited take-up of resources from past and current technical assistance  programs, but an appetite for more technical assistance related to data,  informatics and IT challenges. Specifically, stakeholders adopting new systems  would benefit from support with workflow optimization and data standards.  Agencies could use assistance selecting vendors, describing requirements and configuring  new applications. In some cases, stakeholders noted the potential benefit of  sharing learning and best practices among a community of agencies that are  using a common vendor platform to achieve similar public health objectives.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found public health departments making important  advances in use of IT, but we did not find a single “best practice” approach.  Public health officials face common challenges, including variation and ongoing  evolution of specific public health activities, lack of training on informatics  and process re-design, shrinking funding for public health programs and  constraints that limit strategic investment and encourage data silos. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most agree that, in the future, effective public health  practice will require a more integrated approach to managing information and  increased collaboration with health-care providers and other social service  departments. Public health departments themselves may benefit from openness to  engaging with non-traditional partners, including health-care payers and  providers. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health departments can benefit from planning IT  investments around underlying work processes and their current and future  information needs. Importantly, investments should promote use of standards and  interoperability and avoid creating incentives for additional silos. Some  findings suggest that state-level planning on public health IT investments may  yield the most benefits. We found that by articulating a strategic framework  for using IT, some public health departments have taken their IT infrastructure  down a path that reduces unnecessary redundancy and improves the quality and  scope of information available for public health practitioners. For example, by  capturing demographic data one time to support multiple services, aligning data  from multiple administrative and programmatic sources to help address service  needs, or integrating data generated by health care providers, public health  departments can more efficiently tackle current activities and take on innovation.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Developing an effective strategic framework requires  agency leadership with the knowledge to identify a wide-range of relevant data,  document current public health practice, understand legacy systems, work  closely with IT vendors and visualize how to improve public health functions  through better information flow. This gives agencies the opportunity to  identify and address IT priorities as funds become available rather than  letting funding opportunities alone drive investment decisions. The federal government,  organizations representing public health, medical associations and funders of  all types can contribute to progress in the use of IT by public health  departments by endorsing the ideas of integration and improved use of systems  as priorities and fostering increased collaboration among agencies with public  health responsibility at all levels.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">NORC at the University of Chicago is pleased to submit  this final report for Assessing the Status and Prospects of State and Local Health  Department Information Technology Infrastructure, a project funded by the  Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the United States  Department of Health and Human Services. NORC and ASPE worked in close  partnership with the National Association of County and City Health Officials  (NACCHO) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO).  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This report describes how state and local governmental  public health agencies (hereinafter referred to as local health departments  “LHDs” and state health agencies “SHAs”) use health IT to capture, manage,  analyze, share and disseminate data and information in service of their  mission. We focus particularly on how new programs and other contextual factors  affect the use of information systems to support public health functions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We assess progress in the use of information technology  (IT) in the public health arena in the context of the Health IT for Economic  and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (ACA) of 2010, ongoing public health informatics initiatives and  recent limits on funding available to public health agencies. This project  begins with the premise that stakeholders must use objective and rigorous  assessments of public health goals to motivate IT projects and implement  systems in direct service of those goals.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This report addresses an important gap. Given the variety  and complexity of public health activities, literature on public health  information systems can be either too general or too technical to inform public  policy. Public health informatics is limited to a small group of specialists,  and a broader understanding of technical problems and potential solutions may  help set program priorities.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We ground our findings in the experience of public health  professionals who use IT on a daily basis, document local innovation and relate  this information to national initiatives. We uncover innovative thinking about  difficult issues such as public sector IT governance, integration of different  public health data sources, development and customization of software for use  delivering services in public health settings and strategies for pursuing and  using grant funding. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This report reflects our synthesis of information gathered  from public health practitioners, policy leaders and academic experts as well  as existing literature, reports and documentation on relevant topics. Below, we  describe the four components of our approach.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Technical expert panel (TEP).</b> Appendix 1 to this  report lists the TEP members selected for their experience and expertise in  public health practice, public health information science, public health  program management and other relevant disciplines. We conducted one TEP meeting  in February of 2012 to identify key themes and topics for our discussions with  public health practitioners. This meeting helped inform the cases selected as  well as the topics covered during the detailed case study phase of the project.  We met with the TEP again in October of 2012 to discuss findings from the case  study and review comments on an interim version of this report. In many cases,  we also conducted one-on-one discussions with TEP members.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Telephone discussions with key stakeholders.</b> In  Appendix 2, we list a number of public health informatics leaders and state,  local and federal public health officials we met with by telephone. These  discussions focused mainly around specific topics in the discussants’ area of  expertise. In some cases, we present key elements of these conversations as  “mini-case studies” referenced as examples throughout this report. In order to  cast a wide net, we spoke SHAs and LHDs at various levels of advancement.  Exhibit 1 below provides examples of the topics covered as part of the  mini-case studies. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Review of existing literature and reports.</b> Early in  the project, and at various subsequent stages, we conducted a thorough review  of existing peer reviewed literature, gray literature and online information  related to use of health IT by public health practitioners. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">In the section that follows, we provide some background on  the core public health functions and how public health practitioners use IT.</p>
<div>
<h1><a name="_Toc347232274" id="_Toc347232274"></a><a name="_Toc343841691" id="_Toc343841691">Chapter 3: Public Health Practice and Health IT</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In this chapter we describe some aspects of public health  mission and operations focusing on the ways in which public health officials  use information systems. Importantly, we distinguish between the concepts of  “informatics” and “IT” throughout the report. A premise of our report is that  informatics or the science of how to organize the capture, management and  exchange of information to support specific functions should drive decisions  related to the use of IT in public health.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health officials monitor health status and factors  influencing health and improve access to resources supporting population  health. Public health officials also develop and carry out policies that  protect health and ensure safety.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="" id="_ednref13"><sup><sup><span>[13]</span></sup></sup></a>  To achieve this mission, public health officials need timely access to accurate  data from a variety of sources. Increasingly, technology allows us to capture,  exchange, manage and analyze these data electronically.<sup><span> </span><a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="" id="_ednref14"><sup><span>[14]</span></sup></a></sup><sup><span>  </span></sup>However, best use of  this technology requires financial and human resources. Most core public health  systems work with population-wide data obtained from clinicians and hospitals,  clinical laboratories, social service providers, and clinicians and inspectors.  However, LHDs also work with data on the specific population they serve as  direct providers of care (often uninsured and vulnerable groups). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In monitoring the factors affecting population health,  LHDs and SHAs address areas prioritized by policy makers. These include areas  where categorical funding by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other federal  agencies support specific activities as well as priority areas for state and  local officials. </p>
<div>
<h2><a name="_Toc347232275" id="_Toc347232275"></a><a name="_Toc343841692" id="_Toc343841692">Tracking, Monitoring  and Taking Public Health Action</a> </h2>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs and SHAs track and monitor data on health and  health-related factors in a number of ways. Public health officials capture  these data both to meet government reporting requirements and to target  specific services to individuals and communities. Data on conditions designated  as notifiable diseases under the laws of a given state are captured from  health-care providers as are data to support population-based public health  records for immunizations, newborn screenings, vital records (birth and death  records) and other diagnoses (e.g., cancer, birth defects) as required by the  state.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The usefulness of these systems depend to some degree on  whether data can be brought together to produce a comprehensive picture of the  health of individuals in a community. In the paragraphs below, we discuss how  information systems generally support different core public health activities  such as disease reporting, registries, surveillance, and case management. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Reportable disease surveillance and case investigation.  </b>Under the United States Constitution, states retain the police powers  associated with public health assurance. Therefore, state laws govern  requirements regarding reporting of diseases of public health significance.  SHAs collect information on approximately 60 defined notifiable diseases (exact  numbers vary by state). Providers are legally required to report information on  new diagnoses (cases) to the state. Although requirements for case reporting  vary modestly from state to state, public health officials are moving towards  increased harmonization of these requirements through working with the Council  of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and the CDC. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>National     Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDS)</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">The NNDS is the system used by the CDC to monitor     the occurrence and spread of nationally notifiable diseases reported     voluntarily by states to the CDC. The National Electronic Disease     Surveillance System (NEDSS) provides standards and support to states in     establishing systems to capture notifiable diseases. This includes support     for electronic lab reporting (ELR) into state surveillance systems when     hospital or free-standing laboratories find positive test results for     notifiable conditions. As of October 2011, approximately 15 states used the     NEDSS Base System (NBS) for notifiable disease surveillance. NBS is a tool     developed by CDC that states can use to capture information on the     occurrence of notifiable conditions in their state, provide aggregate     reports to the CDC and support the case investigation efforts of local     public health agencies. </p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although all health-care providers are required to report  notifiable diseases, the vast majority of reports come from clinical  laboratories and infection control professionals in the hospital setting. For  most notifiable diseases, data provided to state and local authorities includes  names, but state officials de-identify these data for voluntary reporting to  the CDC (see text box below on the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance  System). Public health officials manage data about affected individuals using  disease surveillance systems and epidemiologic case management systems so LHDs  and SHAs can engage with affected individuals, health-care providers, their  associates and others. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These case reports required by state law serve two  purposes. First, they allow follow-up with individuals to prevent the spread of  communicable disease and limit adverse effects. Second, they allow public  health officials to study the relationships and trends in the incidence of  diseases that affect population health, identify potential unmet needs and plan  interventions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In many ways, SHAs and LHDs have been moving towards  electronic reporting of notifiable conditions. Many states have worked with  national clinical laboratories and hospital based laboratories to establish  electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) from a laboratory information system  (LIS) to the state’s disease surveillance system, automating laboratory results  for notifiable diagnoses. Many states also now have online portals where  providers such as hospital-based preventionists or public health clinicians can  enter data on notifiable diseases. In some cases, notifiable diseases are  diagnosed and treated presumptively without diagnostic testing, and these cases  are underreported due to limited clinician (i.e., not laboratory) reporting. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For capturing, maintaining and analyzing surveillance  data, some states take advantage of the National Electronic Disease  Surveillance System (NEDSS) Base System,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="" id="_ednref15"><sup><sup><span>[15]</span></sup></sup></a>  developed by the CDC, while others rely on similar systems developed by  in-house developers or by vendors. Automated and seamless exchange of  structured data represent an important challenge for public health reporting.  Notably, states have largely automated the process of reporting de-identified  data on notifiable conditions to the CDC. In this regard, the 2011 ASTHO  Profile of State Public Health indicates that 90 percent of states report  communicable disease electronically to the federal government.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="" id="_ednref16"><sup><sup><span>[16]</span></sup></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In many states, regardless of whether reports are filed by  hospitals and physicians, data on notifiable conditions diagnosed using  clinical laboratory tests are reported to public health agencies automatically  through ELR applications that identify notifiable conditions within a set of  results active in a laboratory system and transmit standardized messages with  relevant information to populate a case directly to the SHA system. Hospitals  can use ELR reporting to address Meaningful Use criteria under HITECH’s EHR  incentive program.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="" id="_ednref17"><sup><sup><span>[17]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Maintaining population-based public health record  systems. </b>SHAs also collect, maintain, and report population-based clinical  information associated with preventive services, screenings, or diagnoses of  specific public health relevant conditions. Registries or stand-alone record  systems often track information services of importance to younger populations  such as immunizations, newborn screenings, and hearing exams. These systems can  also provide a means for tracking chronic conditions such as diabetes, as well  as for identifying trends in the diagnosis of diseases susceptible to  environmental factors, such as cancer. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In all of these cases, federal, state and local  stakeholders have developed specifications to use common messaging standards to  obtain these data from health-care providers electronically. Stakeholders have  recently developed specifications for electronic exchange of data between  hospitals and SHAs for newborn screening.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="" id="_ednref18"><sup><sup><span>[18]</span></sup></sup></a>  In most states, immunization registries give providers access to information on  the immunizations their patients may have received with other providers and  facilitate required reporting from the providers to the state electronically  through interfaces with provider systems or portals where provider staff enter  data online. Electronic reporting to cancer and immunization registries are criteria  for Meaningful Use of EHRs under HITECH.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Syndromic surveillance. </b>In addition to reportable  disease surveillance, state and local public health agencies are responsible  for monitoring the trends of significant medical symptoms. Syndromic  surveillance provides rapid awareness of surging illness rates even before  definitive diagnosis. It tracks emerging health conditions for which case-based  reporting has not been established or may be impractical due to volume (e.g.,  influenza). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In recent years, the CDC has adopted syndromic  surveillance as a key strategy for early detection of conditions and infections  including those caused by bioterrorism and pandemic influenza. Typically,  syndromic surveillance uses trends in the occurrence of patient complaints to detect  statistical anomalies in syndromes (rash, acute respiratory illness) that may  signal outbreaks. Syndromic surveillance also helps officials assess trends  over time, in different geographic areas and among specific populations. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The CDC’s BioSense 2.0 project supports standardized  capture, storage and analysis of syndromic surveillance data and collaboration  for public health at the local, state, and federal levels.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="" id="_ednref19"><sup><sup><span>[19]</span></sup></sup></a> Some states have adopted  BioSense as a mechanism to facilitate syndromic surveillance at all levels of  government. CDC plans to examine stakeholder requirements and needs assessments  to determine how to best meet the needs of SHAs and LHDs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They aim to have 80 percent of the population covered by  BioSense by 2015. The CDC has also indicated that they may find a need to  expand the BioSense platform to incorporate other applications commonly used by  states for syndromic surveillance. For example, many states have adopted the  ESSENCE application originally developed by the Department of Defense to  support their own syndromic surveillance work. Electronic reporting of  syndromic surveillance data is among the criteria that health-care providers  may use to establish Meaningful Use of EHRs under HITECH Medicare and Medicaid  incentive programs. The International Society of Disease Surveillance (ISDS)  developed guidelines for electronic exchange of syndromic surveillance data.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="" id="_ednref20"><sup><sup><span>[20]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Environmental health. </b>LHDs also license and inspect  restaurants, water treatment facilities, swimming pools, septic tanks and other  facilities and equipment. They maintain information on these facilities to  assess and track environmental health risks. LHDs often maintain separate  systems to capture this information to support public safety. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Characterizing and supporting community health. </b>SHAs  and LHDs also aggregate data from surveys, public health reporting systems and  other data sources to help service providers and leaders in a community assess  health status and needs. In particular, many SHAs and LHDs develop state and  community profiles that capture information on health risks, incidence of  significant disease, demographic trends and other factors affecting health.  These profiles then help support effective allocation of public health and  health-care resources. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As in the case of the Beacon Community Cooperative  Agreement program described below, new programs may leverage this public health  function to improve outreach to at-risk populations and support better care and  outcomes. Community profiles developed using data from EHRs can help providers  and public health professionals target health education and locate resources in  areas of greatest need. </p>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc343841693" id="_Toc343841693"><b><span>Personal Health Services</span></b></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a part of the assurance function, public health  departments often provide services directly to individuals. The nature of these  services varies considerably across different states and local jurisdictions.  Clinical services provided by public health include primary care, family  planning, some maternal and child health services, oral health, HIV screening and  treatment, and tuberculosis (TB) and sexually transmitted disease (STD) care.  In many cases, public health nurses with bachelor’s degrees provide these  services under protocol orders set by a physician or advanced practice nurse.  This is significant, in part, because these individuals (Bachelor’s degree  level public health nurses) do not qualify for Meaningful Use payments under  HITECH (discussed below). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to clinical services, personal health services  provided by public health agencies include case management, care delivered as  part of home visitation and care coordination for selected populations. In  providing these services, public health staff capture and maintain data used in  the course of delivering care. The personal health services offered by LHDs  vary by jurisdiction. This is due to differences in state priorities and a  given state’s approach to implementing federal programs under Title V and other  federal programs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In a limited number of jurisdictions, LHDs house Federally  Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) or other primary medical care services for  groups who otherwise lack access to care. In this capacity, public health  clinicians often work to detect and address risk factors associated with the  onset of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. They also  provide immunizations, screenings, routine physical examinations and health  education services designed to maintain and improve health among vulnerable  groups. Finally, primary care providers in a public health context work with  patients to manage and control chronic conditions after diagnosis to help  patients avoid costly complications and maintain a viable quality of life. In  the area of communicable diseases, public health providers are often the only  source (or only free source) of treatment, preventive services and counseling  for STDs, HIV/AIDS and TB. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health-based clinicians both use and contribute to  data housed in public health information systems, such as statewide record  systems for immunizations and newborn screenings, vital statistics, syndromic  surveillance, epidemiology, environmental health, and other relevant data  streams. Also, as medical providers, public health providers can use and  contribute to data exchanged electronically with clinical laboratories,  pharmacies, inpatient providers, long term care facilities, medical  specialists, and others. This may occur through one-to-one exchange or via  centralized health information organizations (HIOs) including those supported  by HITECH’s State HIE cooperative agreement program.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="" id="_ednref21"><sup><sup><span>[21]</span></sup></sup></a><sup>,<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="" id="_ednref22"><sup><span>[22]</span></sup></a></sup>      </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like other health-care providers, some public health  clinicians use practice management systems (PMS) to store admission, discharge  and transfer (ADT) data such as demographics. In some cases, they also use EHRs  configured or customized to meet their needs. A limited number of public health  clinicians can qualify for HITECH sponsored Medicare or (more likely) Medicaid  Meaningful Use payments as eligible providers. The 2010 Profile of Local Health  Departments published by NACCHO shows that approximately 15 percent of LHDs use  some form of PMS and another 19 percent use some form of EHR.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="" id="_ednref23"><sup><sup><span>[23]</span></sup></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Notably, some public health clinical settings face a  disadvantage with respect to achieving Meaningful Use, both because  stakeholders note the dearth of certified EHR products geared to meet the needs  of public health and because public health nurses with bachelor’s degrees do  not qualify as “eligible providers” under HITECH. </p>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc343841694" id="_Toc343841694"><b><span>Data Sources Relevant to Public  Health</span></b></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health officials have broad responsibilities to  monitor and assure population health and track factors related to health in  their states and communities. Data relevant to this mission comes from multiple  governmental and non-governmental sources. As noted above, LHDs capture and  maintain data on a small portion of the population in the context of delivering  personal services including clinical and case management services. LHDs also  maintain data related to other services such as their environmental health  protection responsibilities. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Local public health officials are required to submit some  of these data to SHAs to meet reporting requirements of federal programs  administered at the state level (e.g., Title V, Maternal and Child Health  grants) and standard public health reporting (e.g., communicable disease and  immunizations) required of all health-care providers in the state. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>Addressing     the Needs of Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">The Registry and Surveillance System for     Hemoglobinopathies (RuSH) pilot program sponsored by CDC and NIH     demonstrates the value of bringing different existing sources of data     together to support public health action.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="" id="_ednref24"><sup><sup><span>[24]</span></sup></sup></a>     In this example, public health leaders seek a resource to answer basic     questions related to the incidence of SCD in their state, trends in how the     condition is treated, develop an understanding of the needs of these     patients and ultimately improve the quality of care provided to reduce the     burden of illness. To do this, states participating in the pilot worked to     pull together relevant data from a number of the data sources identified in     Exhibit 3, including vital records and newborn screening for incidence and     creation of cases (this works for recent cases and for cases where the     patient was born in the United States), and then immunization records and     claims data from public payers to assess the progression of the illness and     methods of treatment. Pilot states found the linking of records to create     these registries was possible, but required extensive work to identify the     legal basis for accessing different data sets for this purpose and the     technical task associated with linking data across disparate sources to a     common patient. Importantly, in many states there is no established way to     create new repositories of this kind populated from multiple data sources on     an ongoing basis.</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As we have seen, private health-care providers and  clinical laboratories report data on specific communicable diseases,  immunizations, results of newborn screenings and vital records to the state.  Health-care stakeholders maintain other data relevant to public health (but not  currently reported to SHAs), including patient data in EHRs and health-care  administrative data from public and private payers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, some data relevant to public health fall outside  of traditional health-care and public health sphere entirely. These include  data relevant to the social determinants of health and services designed to  help address broader social priorities such as housing, nutrition, criminal  justice, education and heating assistance.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In current practice, most stakeholders managing these data  use the information in limited ways and share data only under legal reporting  requirements. Many stakeholders envision a future where data across disparate  systems can be brought together efficiently to provide richer information to  support a range of decisions affecting personal and population health. Improved  ability to query and analyze these data could help public health  administrators, managers, clinicians and case managers provide appropriate  services to individuals, support improvement in health-care quality and  outcomes on a population level, facilitate emergency response and preparedness  and help plan needs-based allocation resources. Exhibit 3 below outlines some  of the major sources of data of public health relevance.</p>

It is an oval with several boxes representing different sources of data arranged around the oval. These boxes include (1) information from private providers such as emergency departments, hospital infection specialists, commercial laboratories, primary care providers and behavioral health providers; (2) information related to environmental health such as information on licenses and inspections maintained by local health departments; (3) records from sister agencies to public health such as criminal justice, schools, housing assistance, nutrition support and heating assistance; (4) data from health care payers such as Medicaid enrollment, eligibility and encounter data and all payers claims databases; (5) data collected for the purpose of program management including data related to the Ryan White Program, Title V, mental health and substance abuse programs and women’s, infants and children’s (WIC) programs; (6) Surveillance data including data related to communicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, syndromic surveillance data and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey; (7) public health records such as newborn screening data, vital statistics data, early hearing data, immunization data and cancer data; (8) data captured during the delivery of public health services including tuberculosis clinics, HIV/AIDs clinics, case management and women, infant and children (WIC) services.

<p>    <span></span></p>
<div class="WordSection4">
<p class="MsoBodyText">As noted in Exhibit 3, agencies outside of public health  often manage data relevant to the social determinants of health. A significant  challenge to linking public health to other sources of health data is privacy.  Public health is dependent on the health-care sector for clinic and patient  level data.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="" id="_ednref25"><sup><sup><span>[25]</span></sup></sup></a>  Federal policies such as the expansion of the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule under the Recovery Act (disclosure of  personal health information needed for patient care and other important  purposes) to business associates and more stringent disclosure requirements may  create new processes for data access. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>Linking     Data in South Carolina</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">In South Carolina, the state’s Budget Control Board     Office of Research and Statistics has developed a linking algorithm that     allows public health officials and other authorized state employees to query     dozens of state agency databases for data on client services and     demographics. Datasets included in this initiative encompass claims from     Medicaid, public health records, environmental health, social service data     and other state data sources. This query capacity combined with mapping     technologies allows South Carolina officials identify high-need areas and     target resources and support a number of population-health use cases. In     addition to technical challenges associated with matching cases across different     datasets, officials in South Carolina spent decades working on technical     architecture and data-sharing policies to facilitate this effort. They have     developed a framework and culture of cooperation that they were able to     leverage resulting in quick progress on new funding initiatives. When the     State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement program was     initiated, the state was able to use this source of funds to address well     understood gaps in the ability to capture and exchange clinical data in the     state. </p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Furthermore, federal privacy laws in other sectors similar  to and including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)  complicate data exchange among community partners.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="" id="_ednref26"><sup><sup><span>[26]</span></sup></sup></a> State policies can also  complicate efforts to share data. Taken together federal laws and state policy  form a patchwork of privacy laws that extend beyond HIPAA. This poses a  challenge to inter-jurisdictional and cross-program information exchange. Additionally,  when behavioral and mental health service data are exchanged, compliance with  federal rules under Title 42 Part 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  entitled “Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records” applies. Finally,  organization-level privacy and data-sharing policies complicate matters even  further. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Still, states that are adopting models to overcome data  sharing barriers can achieve important benefits from consolidating data from  public health, health-care delivery and social service programs. The state of  South Carolina (highlighted in the text box) and Montgomery County Maryland  offer examples of jurisdictions that have made progress in breaking down  barriers to accessing data from multiple government sources that are relevant  to public health. In Montgomery County, the Department of Health and Human  Services provides services to over 120,000 residents. Most of these residents  receive services from more than one clinic or program so the county developed a  global data sharing and confidentiality policy with clearly understood rules on  sharing data. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like other jurisdictions, Montgomery County is working on  developing a technical infrastructure that would support access to these data  for public health purposes. In some cases, they see opportunities to leverage  state-supported technical solutions to support health information exchange  (HIE). Potential benefits include a “front door” or “no wrong door” approach to  determining eligibility and enrolling individuals and families in benefits  programs. Cross-sector data integration also can provide increased access to  data on social service needs and benefits for public health and health-care  case managers and care coordinators.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health stakeholders cite funding limitations as a  barrier to more effective use of information systems. Recent analysis,  including some recently concluded by the Institutes of Medicine (IOM) suggests  that public health is underfunded generally and that the funds that are  available do not offer public health stakeholders the flexibility required to  make strategic investments in infrastructure.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="" id="_ednref27"><sup><sup><span>[27]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Variation in the functions and priorities of public health  agencies in different jurisdictions relate to differences in available funds  and spending. For example, some smaller county health departments spend less  than a few hundred thousand dollars per year, while major city health  departments can spend upwards of several hundred million dollars. Per capita  spending among LHDs varies as well between over $50 and less than $20 dollars  per resident depending on the jurisdiction.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="" id="_ednref28"><sup><sup><span>[28]</span></sup></sup></a>  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Key sources of funding. </b>The majority of financial  support for most LHDs comes from a handful of categorical sources of funding.  In 2010, NACCHO reported that 26 percent of funding for LHDs came from general  revenues from local governments, 21 percent from state funds, 14 percent from  federal funding passed through the state such as Title V and Ryan White program  initiatives and another 6 percent came directly from the federal government.  LHDs receive smaller amounts from third party reimbursement for clinical  services (13 percent from Medicaid) and fees for delivering services (7  percent). Importantly, these averages do not illustrate the wide variation in  the level of funding from different sources for public health across  jurisdictions and between states.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="" id="_ednref29"><sup><sup><span>[29]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">2011 data from ASTHO shows that the plurality (45 percent)  of funding for state public health agencies comes from federal sources, 39  percent from state funds and the remainder from a variety of smaller sources  including fees and fines. The same report shows that the plurality of  expenditures by SHAs in 2009 went towards infectious disease programs (13  percent) while 1 percent each went to health data and vital statistics and 5  percent went to administration.<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="" id="_ednref30"><sup><sup><span>[30]</span></sup></sup></a>  Stakeholders note that there is limited integration and strategic planning  among funders and within and across federal, state and local government. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Trends in public health funding. </b>Regardless of the  source of funding, stakeholders note serious challenges with maintaining steady  funding to SHAs and LHDs. Public health currently accounts for less than 0.1  percent of GDP and only 3 percent of federal health-related expenditures.<sup><a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="" id="_ednref31"><sup><span>[31]</span></sup></a></sup> In recent  years, stakeholders note reductions in funding for public health with negative  consequences for making strategic investments in information systems. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In 2011, 58 percent of LHDs reported core funding cuts,  and 55 percent reduced funding to at least one program. Furthermore, LHDs faced  budget reductions of 52 percent in the next year.<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="" id="_ednref32"><sup><sup><span>[32]</span></sup></sup></a> Because of budget  shortfalls at the federal, state, and local levels, public health has lost 15  percent of the state and local workforce from 2008 to 2011. Forty four percent  of LHDs and SHAs reported that they lost staff in 2011.<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="" id="_ednref33"><sup><sup><span>[33]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">An Institute of Medicine report released in April of 2012  looks at public health investments and how federal initiatives can assure  allocation of appropriate resources to population health. The report advocates  for the development of a common “minimum set” of public health activities and  ongoing federal investments to enable public health officials to uniformly  conduct these activities.<sup><a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="" id="_ednref34"><sup><span>[34]</span></sup></a></sup></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Factors driving IT and systems investments in health  departments. </b>Relatively little systematic information is available on  funding for public health informatics or information systems. However, many  stakeholders report the need for more investment and more effective use of  existing investments in public health systems infrastructure. We found that  bureaucratic and program related factors affect systems investments. For  example, because LHDs and SHAs typically sit within a larger governmental  structure, department practitioners do not always direct or control how  governmental IT staff makes decisions regarding new investments in IT systems and  capacity.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Stakeholders note that current methods for funding public  health systems establish incentives to create data silos. An agency that begins  receiving funding under a specific grant may use these requirements to justify  the acquisition or development of a new system to capture, manage and report  information for that specific grant. Sometimes assets procured under a grant  are restricted from use for other purposes. Over time, this results in a series  of program-specific data silos, not allowing officials to easily integrate data  across systems. Most state and local officials we spoke with acknowledged that  relatively few programs actually require the development of a new system.  However, in the absence of clear incentives to build upon existing systems to  meet new requirements, those responsible for administering a grant often find  it easiest to establish a new mechanism meeting an immediate need.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We did however find some examples of specific initiatives  designed to overcome the potential silos created by programs funded under  categorical grants. In New York State, the Department of Health’s Division of  Family Services (DFS) has used funding from the HRSA-administered Maternal and  Child Health Services Title V Block Grants and the State Systems Development  Initiative to undertake a program called Child Health Information Integration  (CHI2), which aims to integrate newborn screening, newborn hearing screening,  immunization, lead, early intervention, WIC, Medicaid, vital statistics and  other data sources into one interface and create bi-directional sharing of  DFS’s maternal and child health data with its external partners. To address  this issue broadly, many stakeholders call for the federal programs to provide  a clear signal to encourage integration and allow agencies the flexibility to  use program funding to support a common data infrastructure.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="" id="_ednref35"><sup><sup><span>[35]</span></sup></sup></a></p>

<h1><a name="_Toc347232277" id="_Toc347232277">Chapter 4: HITECH, ACA and  Public Health Systems</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In this chapter we focus on the specific opportunities to  advance the use of health IT to support public health objectives occasioned  through HITECH and the ACA. In the paragraphs below we highlight specific  initiatives and how they affect public health based on discussions with  stakeholders as part of our case studies. </p>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc343841697" id="_Toc343841697"><b><span>Meaningful Use and other HITECH  Programs</span></b></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record  Incentive program creates financial incentives for eligible health care  providers (individual clinicians and hospitals) to adopt EHRs and to meet  criteria defining “Meaningful Use.” Meaningful Use criteria are being developed  and rolled out in stages. Under Stage 1 Meaningful Use, CMS identified three  “menu set” criteria related to public health reporting. Two of these criteria,  sending data electronically from EHRs to immunization registries and sending information  relevant to syndromic surveillance electronically from EHRs to state public  health agencies, apply both to eligible hospitals and eligible providers. The  third Stage 1 public health “menu set” criterion, sending electronic laboratory  results to the state’s public health system, applies only to eligible hospitals  with in-house laboratories.<sup><a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="" id="_ednref36"><sup><span>[36]</span></sup></a></sup></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As part of Stage 2 Meaningful Use for eligible providers,  transmission of continuous immunization data to the state registry is a “core”  or required criterion. Eligible providers under Stage 2 are also required to  meet three of six “menu set” criteria which include three public health  criteria: successful ongoing transmission of syndromic surveillance data;  successful ongoing transmission of cancer case information; and successful  ongoing transmission of data to a specialized registry. For eligible hospitals,  Stage 2 Medicaid Meaningful Use includes three “core” (or required) objectives  related to public health including ongoing transmission of syndromic surveillance  data, immunization data and electronic laboratory results.<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="" id="_ednref37"><sup><sup><span>[37]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Implications for local public health agencies. </b>As  noted above, providers practicing at LHDs may also be eligible providers under  the program definition for Medicaid Meaningful Use. Providers meet eligibility  criteria if they have appropriate credentials (physicians or nurse  practitioners); provide services that are reimbursable under Medicaid; and  maintain at least a 30 percent Medicaid case load. To receive Medicaid  Meaningful Use incentive payments (up to more than $63,750 over six years),  eligible providers at LHDs, like any traditional health-care provider, have to  demonstrate they have adopted a certified EHR in the first stage and in  subsequent stages demonstrate that they are using the EHR to support functions  included in the criteria for Meaningful Use. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We spoke with some LHDs with extensive safety net primary  care programs including FQHCs that have already adopted certified EHR systems  and are moving rapidly towards demonstrating Meaningful Use and receiving  Medicaid Meaningful Use payments. Public health agencies whose direct patient  care services focus on specialized areas such as HIV/AIDS, STDs, TB and family  planning are less likely to have already adopted a certified EHR. They also  express interest in achieving Meaningful Use over time, but face challenges in  terms of finding and adopting certified EHR products that meet their need for  extensive case management. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As noted above, public health nurses with BSN degrees  provide much of the care in LHDs. These individuals are not eligible providers  under Meaningful Use. Additionally, because public health clinics (not FQHCs)  offer a constrained set of services, they may not meet Medicare or Medicaid  thresholds. Finally, Meaningful Use criteria specify certain standards for  electronic messaging, (e.g., use of vocabulary standards such as HL7) which are  not commonly used among many public health agencies accustomed to more  rudimentary methods for electronic transfer (e.g., flat file imports).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>State public health agencies and Meaningful Use. </b>In  the case of each public health Meaningful Use criterion, state public health  agencies are recipients of data and must be able to cooperate with providers to  allow for electronic reporting and confirm effective exchange of data for  testing. Despite noting limited funding, SHAs we met with had moved relatively  quickly to allow providers to take advantage of the criteria for reporting of  electronic reporting of immunizations and ELR for notifiable diseases.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">HITECH invested resources to support eligible  professionals and eligible hospitals in meeting these requirements through the  Health IT Research Center (HITRC), an initiative providing a community of  practice and online resources to support Meaningful Use. Recently, the HITRC  developed guidance supporting exchange with immunization registries and a tool  to develop an inventory of EHR vendor capacity in this area. In addition, the  CDC has sponsored a new initiative supporting ELR for disease surveillance as  part of the Laboratory Interoperability Cooperative.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="" id="_ednref38"><sup><sup><span>[38]</span></sup></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Opportunities to enhance public health systems to  support Meaningful Use. </b>Some states are using federal 90 percent matching  funds to support investments in public health systems for Meaningful Use. These  opportunities are available under State Medicaid Director Letters 10-016  (Federal funding for Medicaid HIT activities)<sup><a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="" id="_ednref39"><sup><span>[39]</span></sup></a></sup>  and 11-004 (Federal funding for HIE development).<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="" id="_ednref40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">[40]</span></span></span></span></a>  Eight states have received funding to support different initiatives. For  example, Massachusetts is developing a single public health gateway to obtain  data on reportable laboratory results, immunizations and syndromic surveillance  from eligible providers and eligible hospitals. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Other states that have received authorization for systems  improvements to facilitate public health reporting under Meaningful Use include  North Carolina, Iowa and Arizona.<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="" id="_ednref41"><sup><sup><span>[41]</span></sup></sup></a>  However, stakeholders note that in many cases public health departments cannot  fund the 10 percent required to take advantage of these funds or do not have  close ties to their Medicaid agency to facilitate this use of matching funds.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program. </b>HITECH  also created a cooperative agreement program providing resources to states to  facilitate and enable HIE among providers. State officials can address the  issue of supporting HIE in different ways under this program. In some cases,  states have focused on creating state-wide resources to enable exchange that  would allow providers to query or search for and retrieve data on individual  patients from other providers. In other cases, states count on the ability to  support and link across regional HIE initiatives within their state. Elsewhere,  states provide opportunities for providers treating the same patients to send  and receive clinical information to each other.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In conducting activities under the program, many states  report that they are actively engaging public health. In a recent review of 27  states’ activities under the program, 74 percent indicated that their SHA is heavily  involved in state HIE activities and slightly less than half of these states  indicated that they support public health use cases for HIE such as exchange  with immunization registries or notifiable disease reporting.<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="" id="_ednref42"><sup><sup><span>[42]</span></sup></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the case of state health officials participating in our  telephone and in-person discussions, some noted the presence of a “public  health node” being developed as part of their cooperative agreement work. In  some cases, such as Illinois, this refers to a single reporting interface that  would accept different types of public health messages (e.g., immunizations,  cancer case reports, syndromic surveillance information, and lab results) from  provider systems. In other cases, such as Florida, the “public health node”  allows health departments to query data on their patients from other providers.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Beacon Cooperative Agreement Program. </b>Under the  Beacon Cooperative Agreement Program, managed by the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health IT, 17 Communities (represented by providers, public  health agencies and other organizations) across the country receive resources  to build and strengthen their health IT and HIE infrastructure and to implement  improvements in health-care delivery that take advantage of health IT. Each  community developed interventions tailored to their needs and chose specific  and measurable improvement goals relating to quality, efficiency, and  population health. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These interventions include the use of care managers, more  deliberate and structured care transitions and use of clinical decision support  tools to meet specific objectives. Some Beacon interventions represent  variations on emerging practices such as the use of patient-centered medical  homes (PCMH), physician profiling through regular quality reporting, use of health  IT (including text messages) to improve patient education and outreach,  telemedicine and structured referral management. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some Beacon projects actively involve SHAs and LHDs. For  example, in the Southeast Minnesota Beacon Community, public health-care  managers are helping to ease transitions between public health and hospital  settings by helping to eliminate duplication of effort through more timely,  electronic exchange of information at discharge from hospitals. One county that  is taking part in the Southeast Minnesota Beacon, Olmsted County, notes early  success in reducing hospital re-admissions for diabetes and childhood asthma by  facilitating communication across providers using data captured from their EHRs  in a CCD format.<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="" id="_ednref43"><sup><sup><span>[43]</span></sup></sup></a>   The cost savings associated with this outcome has the potential to generate new  revenue for the LHD and providers who support care coordination. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Additionally, in Utah, the Beacon Community is working to  build on the state’s pre-existing HIE plan by connecting hospitals, practice  sites, laboratories and other support providers and public health agencies to  the UHIN’s statewide clinical health information exchange. The Southern  Piedmont Beacon Community in North Carolina is developing a public health  portal, which is an interactive web-based, geo-mapping tool that allows  stakeholders, including representatives from LHDs, to combine, analyze and  display health information. Finally, the Crescent City Beacon Community in New  Orleans is using EHR data to monitor and improve care for diabetic patients.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">In many ways, the ACA promotes principles that align with  the population health objectives and operational strengths of public health  agencies. The law creates a series of demonstration and pilot programs under  Medicare and Medicaid that emphasize the importance of managing referrals, care  transitions and providing other care coordination services. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs provide care coordination, case management and  referral management as part of their everyday practice. Many staff at LHDs  communicate and coordinate across different service providers (e.g., behavioral  health, primary care, substance abuse services, human service providers and  others) and may serve as useful contributors to these demonstration programs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some ACA programs leverage the “pathways community hub”  model where community health workers coordinate across social services,  behavioral medical care, public health, housing and other sectors.<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="" id="_ednref48"><sup><sup><span>[48]</span></sup></sup></a> These hubs  serve to track service delivery and assure the accountability and quality of  the services provided to a population of high risk individuals. Many public  health agencies can provide this service if they have the appropriate  relationships and contracting mechanisms in place. However, the ACA does not  create a specific role in these demonstration projects or other initiatives for  LHDs and SHAs. Some stakeholders expressed concern that absent investments in  public health infrastructure to support these new coordination efforts, other  entities will provide them making LHDs less relevant and, perhaps, limiting the  benefits associated with the programs. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc343841700" id="_Toc343841700"></a><a name="_Toc343760622" id="_Toc343760622"></a><a name="_Toc343760555" id="_Toc343760555">Promising Models for Public Health Engagement with  Health-care Providers</a></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many of the opportunities facing public health agencies  under ACA require active engagement with health-care delivery and financing  organizations. SHAs and LHDs conducting data-based health needs assessments  might drive improvement in the health-care delivery and patient engagement. For  example, LHDs may be in the best position to complete the ACA-mandated  community health needs assessments (CHNAs) and implementation planning efforts  on the part of non-profit hospitals. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We identified pockets of innovation where LHDs and SHAs  help address goals of the ACA by providing analytic resources. For example,  Denver Health collaborates with local ambulatory care providers to establish a  cardiovascular disease (CVD) registry, populated by EHRs from providers in the  community. Denver Health provides reports and analysis from the registry to  guide quality improvement. This effort was supported through Community  Transformation Grants (CTG) supported through CDC. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In New York City, the Department of Health and Mental  Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated and operates the Primary Care Improvement Project  (PCIP). This project helped support EHR adoption among safety-net clinics and  small provider offices in New York City. Currently, PCIP uses EHR data to track  key primary care metrics related to the city’s public health priorities. DOHMH  aggregates EHR data and produces city-wide reports on public health priorities.  They use practice level reports to help clinicians with quality improvement,  PCMH accreditation or other quality and prevention goals. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In another example, the Blueprint for Health program-based  in Vermont is a state public health initiative that encourages patient centered  medical home and coordinated care for populations covered by multiple payers in  the state. The program includes active engagement between community health  teams consisting of care coordinators embedded in primary care practices and  group of community based organizations and public health clinics that serve as  “extenders” to assure access to services such as behavioral health, counseling,  prevention and other services. Exchange of information on patients facilitated  through use of EHRs, robust HIE and the use of registries to track needs of  specific populations.<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="" id="_ednref49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">[49]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Stakeholders believe demand for analysis on  community-level health-care quality will increase because of ACA and  cost-containment efforts. As EHRs increase available data for tracking cost and  quality of care, public health officials need models for using these data. A  recent article in the New Yorker by Atul Gwande illustrates how  provider-generated data identifying frequent users of health-care services can  facilitate targeted interventions.<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="" id="_ednref50"><sup><sup><span>[50]</span></sup></sup></a>  The article describes how robust data can improve provider performance  assessment through geographic surveillance of trends. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health may be in a good position to play a neutral  arbiter role by using provider-generated data to profile care in a community.  These data may help target preventive services to areas of greatest need and  guide provider-initiated quality improvement work. However, it is likely that  improvements in infrastructure, new analytic models and additional workforce  training will be necessary. A 2010 NACCHO report shows that local health  department staff prioritized “using clinical data to improve quality of care”  as a subject for training over other informatics topics.<sup><a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title="" id="_ednref51"><sup><span>[51]</span></sup></a></sup></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Taking advantage of the opportunities described above  requires some public health agencies to re-position within their environment.  Engagement with health-care providers and payers means setting up new  relationships and administrative mechanisms to support contracting. More  coverage for preventive services may lead to increased emphasis on billing and  collecting from third-party payers. However, these provisions may have the  unintended consequence of reducing the need for categorical funding to public  health for preventive services. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">New ACA rules requiring health insurers to offer more  comprehensive coverage of preventive services may have the unintended  consequence of reducing the need for categorical funding to public health for  preventive services. Some stakeholders note that public health agencies will  need to position themselves as “preferred providers” of screening and  prevention services newly covered by private insurers for specific populations,  or focus more specifically on outreach to populations who will remain uncovered  even following full implementation of the ACA. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A March 2012 IOM report emphasizes the need to move  towards integrating the activities of population health monitoring and primary  care through engaged leadership, collaboration between health-care providers  and public health. To come to fruition, public health officials’ interest in  use of clinical data requires cooperation and interest on the part of the  medical community. The report notes that integration and coordination between  public health and health care requires greater collaboration within and across  federal agencies such as the CDC and HRSA.<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title="" id="_ednref52"><sup><sup><span>[52]</span></sup></sup></a>   </p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As noted earlier, this report approaches systems and IT as  the “means to the end” of better public health practice. Information systems  can help public health officials to capture, analyze and share information more  efficiently. Ultimately, these systems must support case investigation and  follow-up, response to outbreaks, resource planning and other public health  action. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The field of informatics helps design work processes and  systems that prioritize information needs for parties working towards a common  goal. Informatics experts define standard practices for capturing, managing and  exchanging data. The goal is to provide stakeholders access to timely, relevant  and valid information while avoiding unnecessary steps and redundancy.  Informatics projects often focus on achieving interoperability by specifying  methods for coding and sharing data that allow seamless transfer of data from  one organization to another while meeting each organization’s practice needs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Informatics projects begin with the assumption that  information systems design, adoption and use should serve a well-understood  mission. These projects require documenting the business processes and  requirements, interactions and data hand-offs for each of the specific  activities related to that mission. Before leading to specifications for  systems, these efforts lead stakeholders to assess and streamline their  day-to-day work. </p>

Notably, the  Public Health Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC) is a national non-profit  membership-based consortium that creates standards that serve the specific  functions and mission of SHAs and LHDs. The PHDSC identifies priorities,  designs and tests standards, represents public health within standards  development organizations and educates public health practitioners. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To support the goal of interoperability, PHDSC specifies  an approach for using the clinical document architecture (CDA) for transferring  health-care information for public health. The CDA defines a comprehensive  format for organizing and sharing all public health relevant content for a  single patient. Some use cases may require exchange of a limited data set for  specific purposes (e.g., immunizations or screenings) rather than the full CDA.  Regardless of the scope of content being exchanged, messaging standards such as  HL7 2.5.1 define data elements for exchange and specify the coding schemes used  to represent those elements in a message.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Recently, PHDSC working with the Public Health Reporting  Initiative of the S&amp;I framework has developed a constrained specification of  the CDA for communicable disease reporting. The specifications would govern how  to organize information exchanged for communicable diseases into discrete  elements and the taxonomy or codes used to represent each element. PHDSC  working with the CDC and the North American Association of Central Cancer  Registries also recently piloted electronic reporting standards from ambulatory  care EHRs to central (e.g., state) cancer registries using the CDA as the  content messaging standard. Reporting to cancer registries is among the “menu”  set of Meaningful Use criteria for Stage 2 Meaningful Use. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most stakeholders agree that the work to develop and test  CDA-specifications to support the exchange of data necessary for public health  action will ultimately improve access to data among public health officials.  However, at this time, experts also agree that establishing and popularizing  public health specific CDA-specifications or more systematic use of HL7 2.5.1  for messaging, will not, on their own, address all issues with access to data  and interoperability. Public health specifications of the CDA will support  interoperability if a large portion of public health agencies prioritize  standards and are in a position to require systems developers and vendors to  adopt these specifications.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The PHDSC is currently working to establish a more  comprehensive public health functional profile (PHFP). This will be a modular  framework with a core set of broad interoperability specifications and more  specific requirements for different public health functions. Functions would  include disease reporting, case investigation, treatment for infectious  diseases and delivering family planning services and others.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Once the PHFP is developed, PHDSC will work with EHR  standards experts to incorporate these requirements into HL7’s overall  functional model for EHR systems. If incorporation of these public health  focused requirements becomes part of EHR certification standards, public health  officials could benefit. However, realizing this benefit will require  improvements in systems used by LHDs and SHAs to receive and use these  messages. </p>

<p class="CalloutBoxText"><b>Joint     Public Health Informatics Taskforce (JPHIT), A consortium focusing on     standards and interoperability</b></p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">JPHIT harmonizes the work of the associations to     help public health speak clearly and effectively about public health data     and information policy. Organizations collaborating include:</p>
<p class="CalloutBoxText">ISDS. International Society for Disease     Surveillance. Collaborative agreement with CDC to develop standards for     transmission of syndromic surveillance data from EHRs. </p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Several additional organizations and groups have also been  working to help promote informatics as a central construct for driving  decisions related to public health informatics. For example, the Public Health  Informatics Institute (PHII) works with public health professionals and their  stakeholders on projects centered around requirements development, workflow  assessment and informatics training. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the recent past, PHII has served as the key  implementation organization for projects providing grants to public health  agencies sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to support public  health involvement in HIE through the InformationLinks initiative and helping  public health agencies develop new systems requirements beginning with a  rigorous analysis of business practices as part of the Common Ground project. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Currently, PHII is engaged with the de Beaumont Foundation  to apply their “requirements lab” approach to defining all of the major  functions and sub-functions of public health and documenting detailed business  processes for public health work. This documentation, though it is likely to  apply differently to specific agencies, is intended to lead to consistent and  detailed understanding of information needs that will in turn drive the work of  standards developers and inform systems and technology decision making at SHDs  and LHAs. PHII also runs training and educational programs designed to help  public health practitioners apply concepts from informatics and business  process re-design to their work. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Associations representing public health practitioners have  adopted public health informatics as a priority. Many of these associations  work with each other under the Joint Public Health Informatics Task Force  (JPHIT). JPHIT members, listed in the text box above, recently developed a  consensus framework with a commitment to working towards advancing the  application of informatics principles to public health work and assuring public  health involvement in HIE efforts.<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title="" id="_ednref53"><sup><sup><span>[53]</span></sup></sup></a>  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, the relatively newly established Public Health  Accreditation Board (PHAB) is a nonprofit organization focused on developing  and implementing accreditation programs that will advance the quality and  performance of Tribal, state, local and territorial public health departments.  PHAB’s current accreditation standards require that public health agencies  develop and maintain an operational infrastructure to support the performance  of public health functions. As part of required documentation for this  standard, health departments need to demonstrate the use of technology to  support public health functions, produce a complete inventory of hardware and  describe their capacity for data analysis, word processing and Internet  connectivity.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many of the initiatives described above help create data  management and exchange protocols associated with isolated public health  activities. Some have suggested a broader approach to defining a comprehensive  systems architecture for public health modeled after service-oriented  architectures (SOAs) developed for other sectors such as the Medicaid  Information Technology Architecture (MITA). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Architectures such as these provide principles or a  framework for documenting “practice” needs (or needs related to fulfilling a  mission); the information architecture needed to support that mission and the  necessary technology components. Implementation in the context of an SOA allows  for the development of common services and applications used at different times  and as part of different functions. Examples of services that are common to  multiple activities within the Medicaid enterprise might include capturing  patient demographics and processes for making eligibility determinations and  managing provider payments for different covered benefits. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Establishing a single standard data architecture for  public health practice offers the benefits of providing detailed guidance and  support for public health professionals struggling with the question of how to  optimize their use of information systems resources. In some of our case  studies, we noted public health leaders’ work on data modeling activities or  conceptual diagrams that mimicked some of the characteristics of an  architecture. For example, informatics leaders at the Oregon Health Authority  developed a public health shared services model with 36 defined public health  services organized by 10 IOM-defined functions and domains defined by PHAB.<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title="" id="_ednref54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">[54]</span></span></span></span></a> This model has  helped underpin the work of other organizations such as PHII.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some of the vendors we spoke with including Consilience,  which offers a product called Maven, are moving towards a modular, SOA-based  approach incorporating patient-facing applications such as those used by LHDs  as well as reporting and surveillance applications used by SHAs to collect  information.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A formal architecture might provide a common basis for  SHAs and LHDs to frame their information needs and then make cogent decisions  that allow them to meet local needs and maintain a basic level of consistency  and interoperability with peer systems. Sometimes the same experts considering  development of a public health data architecture note the challenges associated  with applying this type of structure to public health systems.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These challenges stem from the idiosyncratic nature of  public health functions, governance and operational models at the state and  local level and the evolving and dynamic nature of the work of LHDs in  particular. Given the importance of state government as the main recipient of  public health data, some have argued for state-specific data models or  architectures that give guidance to providers and LHDs within a given state. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Another alternative is the use of a platform as a service  (PaaS) approach where multiple public health agencies could leverage  externally-hosted core services such as database services, MPI services and  query tools as well as software products developed in collaboration with CDC,  vendors and across public health agencies.<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="" id="_ednref55"><sup><sup><span>[55]</span></sup></sup></a>  While this “cloud-based” model offers a potential low cost way to distribute IT  capacity across agencies, mechanisms for implementing the platform, cultivating  users and developing a comprehensive set of software applications remains  unclear.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like other public health stakeholders, public health  informatics experts work in a dynamic environment with evolving priorities and  boundaries. Given the trends described in this report, informatics work may  help facilitate the relationship between public health and health-care  delivery. For example, public health practitioners may need data specifications  and analytic models necessary for validating data from health-care providers  (e.g., EHR data), combining them with traditional sources of data (surveys,  surveillance systems) and using them for public health action.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A range of public health activities might benefit from use  of provider-generated data. Relevant functions might include identifying  “high-risk” individuals for targeted case management or seamless and  comprehensive syndromic surveillance. Although informatics is distinct from IT,  to be effective, recent and ongoing work in the area of informatics will need  to guide the design, implementation and use of IT hardware and applications. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For a number of reasons, decision-makers at most LHDs and  SHAs do not currently have the benefit of applying the latest thinking on  public health informatics to their decisions. First, public health informatics  is still growing as a field and many commercial off-the-shelf applications do  not incorporate the latest work in public health informatics. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many public health agencies lack the expertise and  resources to take on the challenging project of finding a path that marries the  latest advances in public health informatics with what is available from  vendors and their own needs. Additionally, some state and local jurisdictions  are undergoing fiscal challenges and use poorly understood and out-of-date  methods for governing capital investments in IT. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some note that incorporating informatics principles into  the day to day work of LHDs may require more leadership from state and federal  officials. Many states currently have public health informatics experts working  at the SHAs. Stakeholders are pursuing efforts to formalize these job  descriptions and make a case for a broader role for state public health  informatics experts. Discussions with vendors focusing on the public health  agency market, including Netsmart and Consilience, reveal their interest in  working with savvy customers in position to adopt specifications coming from  the informatics community. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In this section we highlight key findings from our in-depth  case study work in three regions. As noted earlier, each case study involved  in-person visits with two LHDs and an SHA. As part of these visits and a series  of phone conversations before and after the visit, we asked public health  leaders and staff about the functions their agency performs, the information  and data needs necessary to perform those functions and the applications used  to capture, manage, exchange, and analyze these data. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In each discussion we touched on one or more of the key  challenges identified early in the project, including defining workflow and  business processes, capacity and skills within the public health workforce, and  governance and financing issues affecting public health systems.

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Florida, we visited the Duval County Health Department  in Jacksonville, the Alachua County Health Department based in Gainesville, and  the State Department of Health in Tallahassee. Florida has a state operated  model where LHDs adapt to the needs of their communities but rely on the state  for staffing, information systems and technical support. Under this model, the  state provides centralized oversight of LHD operations and leadership. LHDs in  Florida focus largely on specialized clinical and case management functions,  while providing some local epidemiological and monitoring functions. Meanwhile  the SHA enforces reporting requirements and maintains population-health records  systems. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The backdrop of our visit was a decision on the part of  state’s public health leadership to pursue the in-house customization of their  Health Management System (HMS), a clinical application developed by Florida using  a relational database platform offered by Intersystems Corporation. The state’s  informatics lead works very closely with software developers and staff at LHDs  to create and customize specific clinical modules that meet the personal care  delivery and reporting needs of public health practitioners in Florida. As of  November 2012, the SHA obtained accreditation for the HMS system as a certified  EHR, which will allow some public health practitioners in Florida to qualify  for Meaningful Use incentive payments. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Despite the consolidated  model and the efforts to move to a single clinical application, we found that  silos persist. The state manages multiple systems, and LHDs and health-care  providers submit data into each of these systems. There are no straightforward  and automated mechanisms for sharing data across systems. Exhibit 4 below  outlines some of the public health systems that we discussed in Florida. In  addition to HMS, state HIV/AIDS providers use several systems used to document  and report care provided under the Ryan White Care Act, and in STD clinics,  staff use a system called PRISM to report and track and document contacts to  STD cases. Providers and LHDs report incidence of notifiable conditions to the  state’s communicable disease surveillance system, Merlin, and to several  separate state registry and population-based health records systems including  those tracking birth and death records, newborn screening results and  immunizations. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Like many states, during  the time of our visit Florida was going through substantial budget cuts  requiring LHDs to manage and expand functions with fewer staff. The SHA was  also experiencing a re-organization to achieve efficiencies through integration  of offices with related functions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Implementing a vision  and data model. </b>Leadership in Florida has a vision for how to organize  public health data resources to address functional requirements and mission.  They have a strategy around using HMS as the main platform for capturing  patient-level information in LHDs. Implementation of this vision is ongoing.  For example, many of public health clinical service providers use a hybrid  approach, capturing some data in HMS, some on paper and some using disease  specific systems such as PRISM and CAREWare. Furthermore, although most of the  state systems for reporting have effectively adopted ELR, practitioners in  hospitals and LHDs continue to enter data manually at least twice, once for  their own use and a second time for reporting to the state. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Over time, public health leaders in Florida plan to expand  the use of interfaces with HMS and use HMS to report directly to state  databases. To address the challenge associated with bringing together data on a  single client who may have records in multiple systems, stakeholders point to  the potential for using master patient indices (MPIs) and record locator  services (RLSs) that would be developed and managed by HIE organizations. These  services would allow LHDs to query different state public health systems and  bring together data relevant to a single case facilitating case investigation  and follow-up.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the future, the state hopes to improve interoperability  across systems. For example, they plan to create protocols where receipt of a  positive lab result from ELR into a state surveillance system automatically  triggers a query of the relevant clinical data from an HIE organization.  Furthermore, they are looking to develop interfaces between their syndromic  surveillance system and emergency management systems (EMS), e-Prescribing and  STD surveillance. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Connecting to state HIE efforts. </b>Stakeholders in  Florida noted strong collaboration between public health leadership and  officials responsible for the state’s HIE efforts. Florida is supporting a federated  model for state-wide HIE with regional health information organizations, larger  provider groups and other “nodes” providing data to the statewide exchange.  Under this model, participating providers would be able to send “queries” to  their local or state HIE infrastructure seeking records on particular patients  they are treating. The same providers would offer up their own patient-level  data for other providers to query.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The main function of the  statewide HIE will be to support a statewide MPI that will help providers  access data from other providers across nodes. LHD clinics will represent their  own node, and the state planned to make these clinics among the first groups to  participate in the state-wide exchange. Public health officials noted that their  participation in the exchange would allow them to query clinical data for  limited case investigation purposes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Key takeaways from Florida. </b>It is likely that the  systems landscape in Florida is less complicated than in other states where  LHDs have more autonomy. However, even with a centralized model, Florida  illustrates the diversity of systems and data silos that emerge in public  health. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Despite these challenges, Florida’s progress on developing  a strategy and path forward rests on some characteristics of effective  leadership. Leaders within the state understand the history and constraints  that led to current information systems and practices and articulated a more  strategic path for the future. This required an understanding of informatics  principles used in other industries to drive IT decision-making as well as the  history and operations of public health agencies in the state. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Michigan, we investigated use of systems at the  Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), a superagency that covers both  Medicaid and public health; the Ingham County Health Department (ICHD); and the  Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MMDHD). The state does not directly  oversee the LHDs in Michigan. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs in Michigan are primarily responsible for direct  patient services in the context of communicable disease clinics, maternal and  child health programs, including home visiting and HIV/AIDS care. In the case  of Ingham County, the LHD also manages an FQHC with several local sites. LHDs  also license and inspect homes and businesses that pose potential public health  concerns (e.g., restaurants, swimming pools, septic systems) and conduct  epidemiologic and case investigation to follow-up on potential outbreaks or  incidence of reportable conditions. State public health officials work on the  assurance, monitoring and surveillance functions and maintain related data  systems, manage federal programs and conduct epidemiologic studies. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The relationship between  the SHA and LHDs bears important implications for the approach to public health  systems in Michigan. The state operates a robust immunization registry and  strong statewide communicable disease reporting systems used locally for both  information gathering and reporting purposes. However, a lack of centralized  systems for other public health program areas contributes to use of stand-alone  systems at the state and local level.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Michigan, Medicaid and public health are part of the  same agency (MDCH). While the state spreads responsibility for Medicaid and  public health programs across different divisions within MDCH, we did see some  evidence that the “superagency” structure may contribute to better integration  of public health and Medicaid data. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although the state runs all of the required population-level  public health records systems including vital statistics, syndromic  surveillance, a cancer registry and newborn screening, stakeholders emphasized  the importance of two state-based systems in particular: the Michigan Disease  Surveillance System (MDSS) and the Michigan Care Improvement Registry (MCIR).  We describe these systems and others we encountered in the case study in  Exhibit 5 below.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>The Michigan Disease Surveillance System. </b>MDSS is a  web-based communicable disease reporting system to support the core public  health functions of epidemiology, surveillance, and monitoring. Providers are  required to submit notifiable disease reports to the MDSS. Reports come into  MDSS through a combination of ELR, manual entry by providers and LHDs, and manual  entry of faxed reports from laboratories. The system geocodes incoming  communicable disease data based on the patient’s address and assigns new cases  to the work queue of the appropriate local jurisdiction for case investigation  and follow-up. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Unlike Florida, the state does not maintain separate  systems for surveillance for specific types of diseases such as STDs outside of  MDSS. MDSS serves as a central resource for the LHDs. Local public health  officials report both successes and challenges in using the system for their  analytic purposes. MDSS has a variety of built-in reports to facilitate  analysis but they do not always provide the flexibility desired by local  epidemiologists. Additionally, LHDs only have access to their county’s data on  MDSS. To view patient data from another jurisdiction, local agencies must call  or fax one another, wasting valuable time in the event of an outbreak. Finally,  there is no ability for electronic transfer of cases of notifiable diseases  from LHD clinical systems to MDSS. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Expanding the features of an immunization registry. </b>The  state built MCIR as an electronic statewide immunization registry and it still  serves this purpose for all providers in the state. Immunization data comes  into MCIR through data entry by providers (both public health and private  providers) into a web-portal or with paper scans from health providers and  schools that are then manually-entered. Recently, the state also instituted a  program that allows providers to upload data on multiple immunizations  simultaneously from a provider EHR to MCIR (batch-uploads). Use of MCIR in the  context of immunizations fulfills local departments’ reporting requirements,  facilitates case management and supports preparedness for pandemic flu and  other public health emergencies.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">MCIR now also provides additional data on care for  children covered by Medicaid. For example, MCIR includes information on whether  or not children on Medicaid are due for tests or screenings included in the  Early Period Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program (EPSDT). These data  come from the states’ Medicaid data warehouse. MCIR also provides results of  blood lead, newborn screening and hearing screenings from other state-managed  systems. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The state is continuing to build upon MCIR with additional  tabs for other types of health data (e.g., BMI entered directly by providers).  By adding in data from payer records and encouraging providers to enter their  own data, the state hopes to use MCIR as broad-based children’s health  registry. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Relationship between public health and Medicaid. </b>At  the MDCH “superagency,” the Office of Medicaid Health Information Technology  leads data integration efforts through their development of a data warehouse.  They are building infrastructure to pull together a variety of state data  sources (representing both public health and social services) which would  ultimately connect with the statewide HIE. Data sources include MCIR, MDSS,  Vital Records Registry, Michigan Syndromic Surveillance System (MSSS),  Community Health Automated Medicaid Processing System (CHAMPS), state public  health laboratories, a cancer registry, and a chronic disease registry (under  development). The data warehouse uses an MPI to match data to clients across  disparate systems, avoiding duplication of records and providing for a fuller  picture of health and health care for individuals, groups and populations. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The use of a data warehouse that integrates Medicaid  administrative data and public health data represents an innovation only  possible when there is solid collaboration between Medicaid and public health  in a state. In the future, Michigan’s Office of Medicaid Health Information  Technology plans to connect this warehouse project with the larger state-wide  HIE infrastructure in the state (described below) which would allow a single  query on a patient to identify clinical records as well as any record from the  Medicaid administrative data or public health surveillance data. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Presence of stand-alone systems. </b>Although, like  Florida, stakeholders at the state-level in Michigan have a solid vision for  organizing and managing data related to public health, they may be less able to  leverage this vision to break down silos at the local level. Because LHDs in  Michigan are independent and governed by municipal leaders, there is not a  single state-wide clinic management application to support patient-facing  services at public health clinics in Michigan. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Mid-Michigan Health Department uses Netsmart’s Insight  application as a public health practice management or EHR application.  Meanwhile in Ingham County, the local health department has just adopted  NextGen for their FQHC sites and is working on customizing NextGen to their  other clinical programs such as communicable disease clinics, maternal and  child health clinics and home visiting. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We also found evidence of stand-alone systems that were  outside of the strategic plan led by the Office of Medicaid Health IT. The  state’s Maternal and Infant Health Program that manages all the Title V funding  in the state still uses some paper-based reporting and the systems used to  manage data related to these programs do not interface or easily share data  with other SHA or LHD systems. In describing the challenges associated with  managing their own systems and getting them to report appropriately to the  state, some local public health officials noted that they would welcome more  leadership and guidance from the state on software applications and approaches  to reporting. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>History of collaboration between public health and HIE.  </b>Overall, Michigan has a long history of health IT investments and  stakeholder support and engagement around HIE. The Michigan Health Information  Network (MiHIN) is the central exchange for connecting sub-state HIEs to each  other and the State of Michigan internal HIE. LHDs have been heavily involved  in establishing sub-state HIEs. For example, Ingham County’s health department  was critical to getting the Great Lakes Health Information Exchange (GLHIE) off  the ground. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Workflow and staffing. </b>The two LHDs we visited  engage in ongoing efforts to document and analyze their workflow with the goal  of promoting the efficiency and utility of using EHRs. Through these efforts,  LHDs hope they will be better able to systematically allocate resources to  support systems across program areas. While local public health leaders  acknowledged the importance of these activities, they also noted the difficulty  with finding staff with the right informatics and business process training,  knowledge of public health systems and time to devote to the task. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>ACA and provider engagement strategies. </b>The state  of Michigan has actively and successfully pursued CMS innovation awards to  improve care to Medicaid and dually-eligible populations in the state. State  public health leaders in the chronic disease epidemiology division have  partnered with Medicaid to lead these applications and manage the grants. While  acknowledging that it is largely uncharted territory, public health officials  and epidemiologists in Michigan are optimistic that ACA-based efforts to  establish an all-payer claims database will help support an array of public  health assessment and planning activities.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">CMS recently awarded the state and the Michigan Public  Health Institute a “Pathways Community Hub” award. This project uses community  health workers to help vulnerable groups access non-health-care services such  as housing, nutrition and heating assistance that are relevant to health status  and outcomes. State public health officials are involved in the oversight of  these efforts, but at the time of our visit they had not developed plans for  how or whether to involve LHDs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Challenges and opportunities. </b>Even in a  sophisticated environment like Michigan, we find some disparate and  uncoordinated silos for capturing and managing data.<b> </b>For example, the  data warehousing work to date, does not include systems that support Title V  reporting. Also, LHDs in Michigan work on their own to procure and customize systems  to support their needs and report to the state. Local public health leaders  have limited resources and expertise to apply an informatics-based approach to  using systems. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Challenges aside, Michigan demonstrates how sophisticated  use of Medicaid data can serve important public health purposes. They show  innovation in the use of an immunization registry to deliver information  derived from encounter data to support EPSDT. Their emerging model for data  integration uses a robust Medicaid data warehouse to link encounter data,  clinical data and public health reporting data, and this may be a path for  other states to consider. </p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Oregon, we met with Washington County Department of  Public Health, Multnomah County Department of Public Health and the Oregon  Health Authority (OHA). In each location we asked about major systems  supporting public health functionality and how they see their use of systems  and data changing in light of HITECH, ACA and other recent developments.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs in Oregon are legally independent of the SHA. They  receive very little state funding, technical assistance or oversight. As a  result, some LHDs have developed multiple homegrown and stand-alone data  systems. Oregon has a number of small rural and frontier counties with  extremely limited resources. These jurisdictions may not have any full-time IT  staff and may make limited use of information technology. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like many states, Oregon is going through budget cuts. At  the local level, LHDs depend almost exclusively on categorical federal grant  and cooperative agreement funding to support their efforts. Stakeholders in  Oregon noted that categorical funding opportunities create incentives for  states and LHDs to manage their data in silos to meet specific reporting requirements.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">With some exceptions, LHDs in Oregon focus largely on  targeted clinical areas such as infectious disease, immunization and home  visiting. They also assist the state in surveillance and monitoring activities  specific to their jurisdiction and provide environmental health services  involving licensing and inspections of potential public health hazards.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b> </b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Health-care reform in  Oregon. </b>Health-care reform plays a large role in defining Oregon’s evolving  health IT strategy and the role of public health. In August of 2012, the state  began implementing Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). CCOs are local health  umbrella organizations that will deliver health care and coverage for  individuals eligible for Medicaid managed care in Oregon and will have  performance based payment incentives to reward quality improvement and cost  control. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">CCOs are designed to encourage coordination and exchange  of information across providers. Because of new reporting requirements, CCOs  will provide data that were previously unavailable, such as data on emergency  department utilization. Staff from the SHA and LHDs take part in CCO planning  and implementation. However, the initial focus for these efforts is around  reducing “high cost” hospital care rather than traditional public health  concerns. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even though typical public health concerns are not among  the early objectives of the CCO initiative, in some parts of Oregon, such as  Washington County, LHDs have developed new collaboration with local providers.  As part of this effort, Washington County will use data from providers to  profile health outcomes in their community and generate reports for use in  assessing the success of the CCO program in their area. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Streamlining data from programs affecting high-risk  infants and children. </b>The governor of Oregon has implemented an Early  Learning Council to integrate and streamline existing state programs for  at-risk youth, including health-related programs. Public health officials in  the state hope to leverage this focus on early childhood to develop a coherent,  informatics-driven strategy for capturing relevant data from public health  programs. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the time of our visit, OHA staff was developing and  application for a one-year planning project to the federal Administration for  Children and Families (ACF) for the OMB-funded State Systems Interoperability  and Integration Projects. Oregon was not awarded the grant, but stakeholder  relationships established in the course of pulling together the grant will be  valuable for future collaborations around data sharing. The proposal focused  initially on maternal and child health home visiting programs and the  requirements of a system to effectively deliver care, manage referrals and  track outcomes as part of this program. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Distributed public health systems. </b>Oregon has  multiple state systems with limited interoperability or capacity to share data  to support core public health functions including epidemiology, surveillance,  monitoring and assurance. ORPHEUS, the state’s main communicable disease  surveillance system, does not interface with providers’ EHRs, but does receive  data automatically from clinical laboratories through ELR. ALERT IIS system,  Oregon’s immunization registry program has worked closely with a variety of  providers and EHRs vendors and currently accepts messages via interfaces from  multiple EHRs products including the Insight public health EHR used in  Washington County. The immunization registry also accepts data in flat-files,  Excel and HL7 batch format from different provider organizations.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As in other places, LHDs largely “go it alone” in terms of  developing, adopting and customizing systems to capture and manage data to  support their functions and produce necessary reports. Although the FQHC in  Multnomah County has long used the Epic EHR, the core public health clinics  have not been able to find resources to use Epic for their work. One barrier  cited is the lack of case management functionality built into Epic, but the  larger barrier might be the cost of additional Epic licenses and the cost of  customizing the Epic interface to meet the needs of clinics focused on  infectious disease, immunizations or other targeted public health clinical  services. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Therefore, Multnomah County developed and maintained  dozens of stand-alone systems and data resources including Excel spreadsheets  and MS Access to support the needs of managing different programs and reporting  to funders. The health department recently hired staff and took on the effort  of trying to gather documentation and develop workflows associated with the use  of these applications.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Recent efforts of the informatics committee. </b>At the  time of our visit to Multnomah County, they had recently established an  informatics committee tasked with developing a strategic approach to aligning  information system investments with the mission, public health functions and  information needs of key stakeholders. As a part of this process the county is  developing an informatics roadmap and assembling data dictionaries and workflow  descriptions from each of their programs. When the roadmap is completed, they  will use these materials to identify problem areas and opportunities to improve  workflow and make systems improvements. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to the documentation and inventory projects  described above, the informatics committee saw a critical need to educate staff  at the public health department about the process used within their county  government for proposing and evaluating IT capital improvement projects including  software and hardware acquisition. They found that many staff felt that  operational grants were the only option for addressing new software needs and  that staff did not clearly understand the county’s own financing mechanisms. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>A vision for increased consolidation and integration of  systems.</b> OHA is planning leveraging early childhood home visiting and “Race  to the Top” funding, to design a modular information architecture to support  multiple functions across the SHA and LHDs and to integrate data from education  and social service agencies. Staff expressed interest developing a  state-maintained modularized application to support work among LHDs and  facilitate reporting. State employees are working on an initial design for this  application for a home visiting program that requires some extensive referral  management functionality, but have a vision that an integrated application may  support a range of point of care and surveillance needs. The modularized  approach would provide a single resource for entering data common to all  programs (such as demographic information) and then add modules linked to this  common resource to support the needs of different programs.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Health departments need a better understanding and  documentation of the business rules and processes underlying public health  function. Effective investments in the design and implementation of IT  resources must begin with a detailed and well-documented understanding of public  health practice, both broadly and as practiced in specific jurisdictions.  Efforts such as RWJ’s Common Ground implemented by PHII, ongoing work by PHII  funded by de Beaumont foundation and work by the PHDSC provide useful resources  to support workflow documentation and process improvements. But, future work  will need to address the evolving roles of public health in the new health-care  delivery environment.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Resource constraints and workforce training needs. </b>LHDs  struggle to find the time and resources to adequately assess vendors, develop  requirements, lay out an approach to using standards, customize applications to  meet their needs, optimize between their own practice needs and state and  federal reporting requirements and conduct other basic activities that may be  essential to effective use of IT. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">An ongoing barrier is the lack of expertise in business  process analysis among the staff at LHDs and limited IT resources to help  understand and define business processes and then translate those processes into  systems requirements. In addition to tools, resources and technical assistance,  direct training of staff under programs such as those led by PHII are needed.  Also, resources for LHDs to hire informatics professionals with knowledge of  public health functions may be necessary. Often, LHD leadership will re-assign  an experienced member of the care delivery team to lead the organization’s  efforts to document existing processes and work on systems implementation. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Managing data for public health services. </b>This  project illustrates the importance of establishing tools for capturing,  managing and using data to support services delivered by public health  clinicians and case managers. These tools, sometimes referred to as public  health EHRs, help capture patient-level data for reporting, third party  billing, care management and delivery of direct services. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even as LHDs deliver less clinical care, their role in  case management and care coordination suggests the need for a patient-level  health record for public health use will persist. Also, LHDs will continue to  face challenges with using EHRs designed for the medical environment because  these applications typically lack robust case management functionality.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>An evolving applications landscape. </b>Currently, most  LHDs work independently to secure resources to support their practice  management and billing systems and many do not have the benefit of EHRs. Some  that we spoke with in Michigan and Oregon are using commercially available EHR  software such as Netsmart geared specifically towards public health. Others,  such as Ingham County, MI are adopting primary care EHR systems to support  public health services and, yet others, such as the State of Florida are  pursuing efforts to build and configure their own version of a public health  EHR. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Agency (HAHSTA) in  Washington, DC is working with a vendor, Consilience, to establish a modular  approach to public health data management using their Maven software product.  Systems like Maven provide an interesting model for integrating data captured  in public health clinics with population-wide public health reporting  databases. This system is consistent with the use of a common data model for  supporting various public health interventions including direct services,  programmatic reporting and surveillance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Vendors can play an important role as landscape  evolves.</b> While a relatively new and immature market, IT vendors targeting  public health departments are increasingly aware of the importance of integration  and the benefits of standardized business processes and information standards  for public health. Currently, limited resources and a lack of a common venue  for engaging with public health department customers may preclude beneficial  engagement between potential public health department customers and vendors.  While there are a limited number of vendors committed to the public health  market, we spoke with some vendors familiar with public health processes and  eager to engage with knowledgeable and sophisticated partners at LHDs. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc343841712" id="_Toc343841712"><b><span>Understanding and Overcoming  Silos</span></b></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health agencies and stakeholders commonly cite data  silos as a barrier to effective targeting of services and integration of data  to understand trends within a population. We found that data silos emerge for  different reasons. Some data resources such as vital records registries and  immunization registries operate under legislatively mandated parameters and  administrators of these resources are not free in all states to broadly share  these resources.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many programs implemented by LHDs are subject to specific  eligibility, service delivery and reporting requirements based on state and  federal rules. While programs funded categorically do not often require use of  a specific information system, many stakeholders note that developing a new  system is often the least complicated way to get a program running in the  short-term. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Stakeholders identify two paths for moving past silos. The  first involves use of single module-based systems with an integrated data  architecture to support multiple public health functions and required  reporting. The second involves assuring interoperability based on standards  systems used by different public health agencies and health care providers.  Many stakeholders agree that both can and should play an important role.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Potential for integrating public health systems. </b>In  some states, SHA officials are interested in establishing a single-modularized  public health information system that would be available to LHDs to capture patient-level  information, coordinate referrals to care in other public service providers and  health-care providers and report relevant information to the state. The  emphasis would be on populating and updating information relevant to multiple  programs (e.g., demographic data) once and then linking this “core” system to  modules with workflow and requirements specific to particular programs or  services.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even if public health officials do not achieve the  opportunity to substantially integrate public health data applications using a  common modular infrastructure, more assiduous use of messaging and document  standards may offer greater interoperability across systems. This type of  interoperability would allow stakeholders who are primary users of one  application to benefit from use of data that are originally captured outside  their home application. Furthermore, public health officials in some states  note that they look forward to leveraging MPIs and RLSs set up by state or  regional HIE organizations that could allow public health officials to query  outside systems that may have captured information relevant to a particular  case or patient. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Some basic conditions must be present to facilitate  adoption of common messaging and document standards to improve interoperability</b>.  With respect to interoperability, many stakeholders agree that the use of a  CDA-based standard would represent an opportunity to have a flexible and  extensible document based standard that allows the sharing of multiple types of  health-care data for public health purposes. In some cases, stakeholders note  that use of the HL7 2.5.1 messaging standard may be a very effective tool even  if content is limited to less than a full CDA.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, public health providers and agencies have not yet  broadly adopted standards for exchanging data. Many LHDs may not be asking  vendors about their ability to comply with these emerging public health data  exchange standards. Direction from state or federal authorities that lays out  basic requirements for systems used to capture, exchange and manage  person-level data by LHDs and SHAs may support greater adoption of standards in  systems used by public health staff.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health informaticists have worked extensively on  standards for messaging, content and transport to support interoperability and  information exchange. At the ground-level, public health practitioners need  additional instruction on how these standards should influence the types of  systems they elect to adopt and how they use those systems.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Vision and model for capturing, maintaining and using  data versus detailed architecture.</b> Some stakeholders argue that a service  oriented architecture (SOA) model that allows public health agencies in a  particular jurisdiction to use common software solutions to address the needs  associated with common functions is necessary. However, given variations in the  priorities and capacities of SHAs and LHDs, the path for achieving such an  architecture remains unclear. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Building a common platform that supports full  interoperability and allows for both population health assessment and direct  service delivery to individuals is a complex and expensive undertaking. SHAs  and LHDs face both technical and financial challenges in achieving this goal. A  starting point for many jurisdictions may be to articulate a more general “data  model” and strategic vision that drives all data captured, maintained, and used  by LHDs and SHAs, along with some requirements around the ideal format and  nature of these data even if the requirements are not realized immediately.  Data models would ideally include features that would allow for consistent use  of standards over time and establish consensus about how to organize and link  public health data that would drive interoperability. </p>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_Toc343841713" id="_Toc343841713"><b><span>Potential Impact of Recent Policy  Initiatives</span></b></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found important potential lessons from public health  agencies’ role in HITECH programs where public health is not the focus of the  program, but remains an important player. Public health’s role with respect to  health-care reform and broader change in health-care delivery and financing  remains unclear. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>HITECH raises awareness, but also highlights gaps in IT  capacity at public health departments. </b>HITECH has raised awareness of the  exchange of data between public health and health care and highlights gaps in  defining best practices for public health IT. Examples of public health  participation in initiatives to improve care through the Beacon Cooperative  Agreement program show the potential benefits of public health engagement on  quality improvement initiatives leveraging data from IT systems. While these  efforts are limited to a few locations in the country, they will offer some  useful case examples for consideration in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some experts note that many public health agencies face  the challenge of having to receive more electronic messages as a result of  HITECH without additional resources. The small number of states taking  advantage of 90-10 matching for enhancements to public health systems to  support Meaningful Use may be attributable to lack of state funds even to fund  the 10 percent match.<a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title="" id="_ednref56"><sup><sup><span>[56]</span></sup></sup></a><sup></sup>Finally, Meaningful Use does not address appropriate use of IT by LHDs.  Some experts indicate that public health service providers (e.g., STD  clinicians, visiting nurses, public health case managers) would benefit from  their own set of Meaningful Use criteria and accreditation standards. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Potential role for public health in health reform. </b>Many  stakeholders agree that LHDs and SHAs can play an important role in advancing  the objectives of the ACA. For example, public health can provide objective  community-level health assessments bringing together multiple sources of data  and supporting care coordination across providers. SHAs in OR, MI and likely  elsewhere are involved in state-wide Medicaid health-care delivery reform  efforts and federal demonstration projects. However, even in these cases, the  new role of LHDs in light of the changing landscape is still unclear.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although efforts are proceeding slowly, many do see a role  for public health monitoring data to support decision-making, particularly with  respect to the Medicaid population.<span> </span>In  states like North Carolina and Indiana, LHDs collect health-care quality data  and share these data with Medicaid. In this context, Medicaid may look to LHDs  as the source for objective analysis on the performance of the health-care  delivery system.<sup></sup>Overall, stakeholders seem to suggest that public  health can play an important role in health-care reform efforts. However, most  LHDs and SHAs have yet to engage actively with health-care providers on  delivery reform. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Incorporating provider-generated data and data from  other service providers to support population health management.</b> Beyond the  limited examples described in this report, most LHDs and SHAs have not adopted  analytic or operational models to routinely access and use data generated by  health-care providers or other service providers. This will require development  of new models to capture, transmit and analyze data and, importantly,  cooperation on the part of the medical care community. Effective use of these  data could help monitor the quality of care or outcomes for chronic conditions  or systematically assess the status of vulnerable populations. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health officials with early experience conducting this  work emphasize the importance of extensive engagement between public health and  health-care providers on data entry, reporting and quality improvement. LHDs  and SHAs also have not widely adopted effective models for incorporating data  relevant to social determinants of health from other sectors (education, social  services) into their case management systems, a key step for meeting population  health objectives.</p>
<div>
<h2><a name="_Toc347232288" id="_Toc347232288"></a><a name="_Toc343841714" id="_Toc343841714">Structural Factors and  Public Health Informatics</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">LHDs and SHAs vary across jurisdictions in terms of their  priorities and organizational governance<b>.</b> Several factors drive this  variation including the extent to which federal funds administered at the  state-level such as Title V maternal and child health clinics or home visiting  programs make use of LHDs as care providers, the extent to which SHAs control  or manage LHDs, the priority state and local government leaders place on public  health, the historic role of public health in a given jurisdiction and other  factors. This is one reason why a single architecture or model for public  health infrastructure may not be feasible at this time. It also illustrates the  importance of the participation of state and local public health leadership and  staff in national public health informatics standards development initiatives. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Potential role of accreditation.</b> Accreditation  through PHAB supported through funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation  and the CDC serves as a potential incentive for encouraging more strategic  planning and purposeful investments in IT and processes among LHDs. In the  future, PHAB may align accreditation with the use of standards to facilitate  interoperability or require public health departments demonstrate how business  functions drive workflow and use of systems in their agency.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Potential role for technical assistance.</b> We found  an appetite among LHDs and SHAs for technical assistance related to data,  informatics and IT challenges. Specifically, agencies adopting new systems  seemed poised to benefit from tools for workflow optimization and data  standards. They seek assistance with vendor decisions, defining requirements  and configuring new applications. In some cases, stakeholders noted the  potential benefit of sharing best practices among a community of agencies that  are using a common vendor’s platform.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Despite the perceived need, we found limited uptake of  resources from past and current technical assistance programs in informatics.  In some cases, local stakeholders were not aware of existing resources or could  not find the time to apply them to their work. Many times, resources developed  for national initiatives do not relate specifically to the needs of specific  SHAs or LHDs with particular reporting requirements and focus, and the national  experts developing those resources cannot afford to focus in on the particular  needs of an individual jurisdiction. In these cases, public health  professionals may benefit most from training on the goals of informatics and  direct support with applying those goals to their situation. This might help  LHDs and SHAs approach IT projects as opportunities to assess and improve  workflow and movement of data rather than automating existing processes “as is”  or simply adopting the vendors “out of the box” solution. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Collaboration and integration across federal, state and  local agencies. </b>LHDs may benefit from more collaboration across departments  on informatics and more direction from the state. SHAs manage the majority of  public health data and generally have more resources to maintain expertise. In  some states, such as Florida, state leadership has maintained local flexibility  while providing a common public health EHR to LHDs. Collaboration may also give  agencies greater leverage in negotiating price, functionality and technical  support with vendors. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Funding and governance of IT resources.</b> Our  findings suggest that public health funds some IT projects largely by making  creative use of operational funds from one or more programmatic grants or  special projects. Some stakeholders point out that this approach limits the  strategic impact of these investments and can limit innovation. Funding new  systems and IT investments using operational funds may constrain the timing of  investments and leave limited time for appropriate planning and incorporation  of informatics best practices into decision-making. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Use of programmatic funds specifically, may preclude  agencies from making design investments that allow for integration and exchange  across programs within public health and between public health and related  sectors. We found that many SHAs and LHDs find it difficult to work within  existing governance structures to make strategic capital investments in IT and  systems. <span>In order to fully adopt strategic  approaches to</span> using information systems, public health officials may  need better tools for comparing alternatives and making best use of available  resources. <a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="" id="_ednref57"><sup><sup><span>[57]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Characteristics of leadership.</b> Successful planning  and implementation of public health systems projects requires committed and  knowledgeable leadership. Typically, these individuals come with a very  detailed and practical understanding of the practice of public health as well  as information needs facing public health officials on a regular basis. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Successful leaders engage with vendors and IT  professionals on re-thinking workflows and processes and specifying  requirements. They build enthusiasm for continuous process improvement and  systems projects among public health staff. In some cases, leaders come with  extensive experience and understanding of IT outside of the public health  arena, very often in health-care delivery. Finally, successful leaders also  understand and engage with national public health informatics initiatives and  bring the resources and tools from those initiatives to bear in their work. </p>

</div>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We found public health departments making important  advances in use of IT, but we did not find a single “best practice” approach.  Public health officials face common challenges, including variation and ongoing  evolution of specific public health activities, lack of training on informatics  and process re-design, shrinking funding for public health programs and  constraints that limit strategic investment and encourage data silos. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most agree that, in the future, effective public health  practice will require a more integrated approach to managing information and  increased collaboration with health-care providers and other social service  departments. Public health departments themselves may benefit from openness to  engaging with non-traditional partners, including health-care payers and  providers. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Public health departments can benefit from planning IT  investments around underlying work processes and their current and future  information needs. Importantly, investments should promote use of standards and  interoperability and avoid creating incentives for additional silos. Some  findings suggest that state-level planning on public health IT investments may  yield the most benefits. We found that by articulating a strategic framework  for using IT, some public health departments have taken their IT infrastructure  down a path that reduces unnecessary redundancy and improves the quality and  scope of information available for public health practitioners. For example, by  capturing demographic data one time to support multiple services, aligning data  from multiple administrative and programmatic sources to help address service  needs or integrating data generated by health care providers, public health  departments can more efficiently tackle current activities and take on  innovation. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Developing an effective strategic framework requires  agency leadership with the knowledge to identify a wide range of relevant data,  document current public health practice, understand legacy systems, work  closely with IT vendors and visualize how to improve public health functions  through better information flow. This gives agencies the opportunity to  identify and address IT priorities as funds become available rather than  letting funding opportunities alone drive investment decisions. The federal  government, organizations representing public health, medical associations and  funders of all types can contribute to progress in the use of IT by public  health departments by endorsing the ideas of integration, interoperability and  improved use of systems as priorities and fostering increased collaboration  among agencies with public health responsibility at all levels.</p>
