<p><strong>Letter of support to: ADVISORY COUNCIL ON ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, CARE AND SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>I am the proud mother of Mr. DavidTringo. David is at your meeting today in person representing our family. It is hard to believe that 42 years ago I had David as a 20 year old young lady and was forced immediately to make a decision the Doctor posed; "we can have Willow Brook here in ten minutes-do you want to keep the baby?" I simply asked if he can cry when he is hungry and love me? The doctor said yes; and we went home.</p>
<p><em>February 3, 2014 Federal NAPA Advisory Committee Approves Recommendation 13</em></p>
<p><strong>I am writing to thank all of you for your courageous decision on February 3, 2014 approving Recommendation 13:</strong></p>
<p><em>HHS AND STATE LEAD ENTITIES SHOULD PARTNERTO ASSURE ACCESS TO THE EULL ARRAY OE LTSS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OE PEOPLE WITH AD INCLUDING YOUNGER PEOPLE.NON-TRADITIONAL FAMILIES.PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUALDISABILITIES. SUCH AS DOWN SYNDROME. AND RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK OE ACQUIRING AD.</em></p>
<p><em>MY LIEELONC BURDEN OE CARE</em></p>
<p>For the past 42 years, I have not taken a vacation feeling it is my responsibility to always be by David's side providing his lifelong care. The early onset of dementia is almost too much to endure after providing lifelong care with fierce advocacy and now the accelerated pace of AD with Down syndrome. Preparing for this late battle with this insidious disease in David's life is especially painful since I just buried my Mom and Dad with Alzheimer's disease. I noticed the similar symptoms with David similar to my Parents but Doctors could not confirm the symptoms.</p>
<p><em>Erin Long is simply the best</em></p>
<p>Our Lucan us Center executive director traveled to Washington D.C. on February 3, 2014 and provided public testimony with National Chair Dr. Janicki. Upon returningto Florida, we were all very excited about the promising news to prepare a high quality dementia capable system for our children that was centered on our family. Our Florida Dementia Capable Model gives the funding to dementia care coordinators that create the dementia care plan together with the family.</p>
<p>During our newly created caregiver support groups focused on the death of our child Dr. Buckley kept mentioning Ms. Erin Long and Kate Gordon guiding our specialized dementia capable system. Dr. Buckley would comment on their incredible knowledge, passion and always speaking and seeking our solutions and not simply restating the problem or their solutions within the aging world.</p>
<p>On April 30, 2015 Ms. Erin Long came to Florida and attended the NTG/Lucanus unveiling of the NTG formal curriculum. Ms. Erin Long is an incredible young lady with a heart of gold that spoke of her family member experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She listened to aging caregivers and one in particular sticks in my mind. A father told of scolding his daughter and being so frustrated after APO and her behavior specialist said she needs to control her behavior and the parents need to set stricter rules.</p>
<p>The Father then said that everything she is doing is consistent with her recent diagnosis Alzheimer's disease and now he feels so guilty listening to behavior specialist knowing his daughter had no control of the behavior symptoms. Ms. Erin Long has taken our hopes and dreams for families to create person/family specialized dementia plans and made this a reality that all families deserve. We all speak of Erin and Kate often and acknowledge with a smile they are simply the best and listened to our every wish.</p>
<p>Your support of the Lucan us Center has changed the lives for thousands. David is fully engaged in all Healthy Brain activities and both David and I just sang together as Sonny and Cher in a local talent search. I truly believe David going to Lucan us and adherence to Healthy Brain principles is the reason he is so sharp and active today.</p>
<p>Thank you for creating Alzheimer's respite and now my husband and I took our first vacation in over 42 years to Charleston, SC. David had only vacationed with my husband and I for the past 42 years. David chose to go with his other family, the Buckley's. Tom and Kathy took David to New York City for 5 days and then to Tallahassee advocatingfor families with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. David had a wonderful time with his other "Mom and Dad' and really enjoyed advocating for others in need.</p>
<p>As a Mom, I could never thank you for all you have done for David and our family facing thisinsidious disease. It is hard to believe that just a few months ago our <strong>hopes and dreams were crushed when the local Alzheimer's Disability Resource Center chose not to provide Alzheimer's supports to people with Down syndrome after repeated request. The Lucanus Center and family's partnered with Florida SenatorSobel to sponsor the Florida legislature creating the Alzheimer's pilot for Intellectual Disabilities and Down syndrome. The Florida legislature 2015 appropriated $100,000 to the Lucanus center to create the Florida Alzheimer's waiver for intellectual disabilities and specifically Down syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On behalf of all families in South Florida with a family member with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, we are grateful for your leadership and your incredible ambassador of hope Erin Long. We vow to continue working endless hours until all Americans with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's along with their aging care giver are provided with high quality person centered dementia services and supports.</strong></p>

<p>I am Matthew Janicki. Along with my colleague, Dr. Seth M. Keller, we are the Co-Chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices -- the "NTG". The NTG is a national group affiliated with the American Academy on Developmental Medicine and Dentistry and the University of Illinois's Center on Developmental Disabilities and Health. We are a membership organization supported by a range of formal and informal organizations and are made up of more than 250 members -- representing a broad range of interests focusing on advocating for solutions to issues faced by adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia -- and their families and formal caregivers. The mission of the NTG is multifaceted:</p>
<ul><li>Promote adoption of a specialized screening instrument and process.</li>
<li>Define ways to assess 'cognitive impairment' as part of the annual wellness visit requirement under the Affordable Care Act.</li>
<li>Develop practice guidelines for health and social care practitioners.</li>
<li>Promote 'best practice' service models and systems of care that meet the unique needs of individuals with disabilities and their caregivers.</li>
<li>Aid families by providing information and aids for coping with dementia and its challenges.</li>
<li>Assist in adoptions of standards of care.</li>
<li>Institute public education and training programs.</li>
<li>Collaborate with national and regional organizations in public education, legislative and services development campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>The NTG also has been working in concert with the activities emanating from the <em>National Alzheimer's Project Act</em> (NAPA) to <strong>raise awareness within the context of NAPA of the needs of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia, and their families and other caregivers</strong>. Over the past five years we have watched the Council address a number of issues affecting people with dementia in general, and have been pleased by the actions cited in the Plan related to intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We appreciate the work of the Advisory Council and welcome those of you who are new members and trust you will help address the continued mission of the Council and its work as per the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. With this in mind we would like you to know why focal consideration needs to be given to people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<ul><li>Even as most adults with intellectual disabilities are affected by forms of dementia at the same rate as other adults, adults with Down syndrome are at extreme high risk for dementia and most show early onset and compromised longevity.</li>
<li>Early identification of signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and dementia among adults with intellectual disability is an important first step in managing the course of the disease and providing quality care -- but typical assessment and diagnostic measures are not appropriate for this population due to variability of cognitive abilities.</li>
<li>Many organizations providing community supports are still unprepared to adapt their care practices for older adults who are experiencing decline due to dementia and are in great need of technical assistance and access to creative models of community care.</li>
<li>A large number of older-aged adults with intellectual disabilities live with their families and dementia-related impairments increase the challenges for, and oftentimes overwhelm the capacities of, older caregivers.</li>
<li>An emerging model of dementia-capable' out-of-home care is the use of small community-based group homes and more technical assistance is needed to help providers adapt their care practices to make optimal use of this model.</li>
<li>Supportive education, training, and services can help caregivers minimize fatigue and prevent burnout, and help maintain affected older adults in community settings, but more coordinative and specialized education and training is needed.</li>
<li>Collaborative efforts at the local level, among disability, aging, and health providers can be effective in adapting services and supports to aid adults affected by dementia, as well as their caregivers -- and more emphasis on such collaboration is needed at the state and local level.</li>
<li>With appropriate services, adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia can continue to have quality lives in community settings and because of the presence of such settings the unnecessary institutionalization of older adults simply because dementia is present can be avoided.</li>
</ul><p>In today's remarks, on behalf of Dr. Keller, myself, and the NTG, we would like to offer our appreciation to the Council and its federal partners in their on-going efforts in recognizing the special needs of aging adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia and responding to the issues we have raised over the past five years. We are particularly appreciative of the results of the current series of awards by the Administration on Community Living for the Alzheimer's Disease Initiative grants and the special consideration given to intellectual disabilities, and to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for its multiple awards under the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) and its willingness to draw from the NTG's national education curriculum on dementia and intellectual disabilities so as to assure that issues related to intellectual disabilities will be covered in the education and training to be undertaken by the awardees. We are also very appreciative of the National Institute of Health (NIH) for its efforts to seek out solutions leading to the early identification of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities via the funding of two major multi-site studies designed to identify biomarkers among adults with Down syndrome, as well as support other dementia-related research among persons with lifelong disabilities.</p>
<p>Lastly, the NTG would like to offer its support to the pending proposal to establish a dementia-related caregiving summit among the federal partners and non-governmental organizations, and looks forward to the inclusion of issues facing caregivers of aging people with intellectual disabilities affected by early, mid-stage, and advanced dementia.</p>
<p>We thank the Chair for this opportunity to address the Council and look forward to continued fruitful collaborative endeavors designed to achieve the goals of the National Plan by 2025.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NAPA Advisory Council Meeting<br />
					Public Statement</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to address the Council today. Some of you may remember me as a regular attendee during the first two years after the NAPA was implemented. It is a privilege to be back again today.</p>
<p>I am here as a <strong><em>family advocate</em></strong> for individuals with intellectual disabilities and their families. I also come as a member of the NTG, a grass roots organization designed to increase the awareness of and services for those with ID who face the challenges of aging and further cognitive decline, including dementia.</p>
<p>My Brother Bill had Down syndrome and died of complications of Alzheimer's disease at age 49. (<em>Page 1 handout</em>). As advocates, our family was dedicated to insuring quality of life and quality of care across his life span, with a focus on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease required intensified efforts that we could barely muster and was the greatest challenge that we faced as a family in Bill's lifetime. It was a cruel and painful journey, filled with many unanticipated obstacles. After Bill's death I vowed that I would work hard so that other individuals and families would be spared this same experience. Today I am joined in spirit by the NTG and many families as I appeal to you to further include this special population in all aspects of research, care planning and funding.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past five years I have been blessed to meet many families from across the country. Some have been siblings and some aging parents who have continued to care for their loved ones as they all age simultaneously. There are a number of common concerns (<em>Page 2 handout</em>) that have been expressed. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of information, especially at time of diagnosis</li>
<li>Profound sense of <strong>Loss</strong> with further diagnosis</li>
<li>Fear about future-including financial fears</li>
<li>Difficulty formulating long term plan</li>
<li>Struggle to access community based coordinated care</li>
<li>Difficulty partnering with medical community</li>
<li>Being overwhelmed by demands of caregiving</li>
<li>Isolation and abandonment</li>
<li>End of life issues</li>
</ul><p>During my last public statement at a Council meeting a little over two years ago in the spring of 2013, I spoke of the urgent need of aging caregivers. I told of Betty, currently age 86, Frank, currently age 90 and Richard, soon to be 49, a special family who lives in a very small mid-western town (<em>Page 3 handout</em>).</p>
<p>Despite the presence of a small group home for medically fragile in their former community, Richard was not able to access the facility because of his diagnosis of AD. In April 2013, with family care giving resources depleted, Richard made the move to a 60-bed nursing home that was designed to meet the needs of individuals with ID and physical and mental health challenges. Richard was one of very few patients with AD and the staff was not specifically trained in the disease process. He was initially treated with Risperdal, as he was mobile at the time of admission and deemed a "challenging patient". Soon after he exhibited an adverse drug reaction. His parents alerted the staff to the observable changes and the medication was Dc'd. However, within 4 months of his admission to the facility, Richard had declined rapidly. By August 2013, Richard became wheel chair bound, had limited oral or physical responses and was totally dependent on others for all care. He experienced more frequent seizures and has been on increased medications.</p>
<p>Because of the distance of the facility from the family home and failing health, Betty, age 86, and Frank, age 90, relocated to the town of 1500 where Richard currently resides. They are a presence in the facility and committed to being there for Richard as he continues his decline. They are grateful for the care that Richard receives but mourn the loss of their socially active, garrulous son who can no longer utter a word. Formerly a man with a robust appetite, he can no longer lift a spoon to feed himself. They are pained by the emptiness in his once sparkling eyes. Richard will mark his 49th birthday in August of this year. (<em>Page 4 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Mr. S., age 87, still works part time including as a statistician for a major league football team, despite Parkinson's disease. His wife, soon to be age 84, has Alzheimer's disease. Their son Georgie, who had Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, died at home, this past March with his parents and sisters at his bedside. He was 51 years old and succumbed to aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of AD. (<em>Page 5 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Georgie's parents <strong><em>paid</em> for 24 hour private care</strong> and they honored his wish to stay home for over 3 years, as he declined. The only other option was a nursing home, where he did have a short stay after a broken foot. His sister Mary reported that every day after the nursing home stay, Georgie would wake up and he'd ask his Dad..."I stay home, Daddy?" Three of Georgie's sisters, Nancy, Pattie and Debbie live nearby and were instrumental in his care and that of their Mother. Georgie also had two special caregivers, Chris and Mark who helped to make home care possible. For all it was a labor of love, performed without question. The high cost was heartbreak. (<em>Page 6 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Georgie's family misses his smile and his sense of humor. And when they think of him, they remember his favorite song... <em>I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart...Down in my heart to stay!</em></p>
<p>I close with a brief recount of Fran and her family. She notes that 4 generations have been impacted by aging and concomitant decline. Fran's mother had been in a nursing home for a prolonged period of time and diagnosed with Parkinson's diseases and Lewy Body Dementia. The family assumed the cost of her care up until the time of her death. (<em>Page 7 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Fran's only sibling is a brother, age 65. He lives 7 hours away from her, has Down syndrome and is in the end stages of AD. Efforts to bring her brother closer to her were complicated by funding restraints from state to state and guardianship challenges. When her brother was no longer able to stay in the group home in which he had lived for 2 decades, a crises occurred. Where would he live? Who would cover the cost? What happened to his former funding stream? Her brother is now in a nursing home and the family worries from month to month about how the costs will be covered. Hospice came and went when he no longer met their criteria, taking a greatly needed wheel chair with them. The family then funded a $3500 chair so that he would not be bed ridden. Exhausting advocacy issues have intensified as his disease has progressed.</p>
<p>Fran, like many others, is emotionally overwhelmed and plagued by guilt over lost time with and attention to her husband, children and grandchildren as she tends to issues of intergenerational decline. She laments the fact that her brother, with his lifetime of cognitive impairment, was never able to communicate end of life wishes. She is often is faced with guardianship issues that may have best been modified years ago.</p>
<p>Their plight is real...the needs of individuals and families great. Families who have been lifetime caregivers often feel abandoned in the end. They have worked hard to independently provide care in the past. They now need extensive support that they struggle to access. I urge you to leave here today, more than 4 years after NAPA was signed and implemented, with a renewed awareness of the critical needs that remain in existence today for this underserved group of people.</p>
<p>Documents were previously provided for today's presentations. I am hopeful that Director Hoffman of the Dept. of Health, State of NY will review the populations identified as "disproportionately impacted" in the ADCSI initiative and consider including family members with ID. This could serve as a model of what might be done across the USA. Director Hoffman and many other Advisory Council Members have been our great champions in the past and I am hoping to count on all of you in the future. Thanks for this opportunity to be the voice of many who would otherwise not be heard.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>As co-chairs of the Bipartisan Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus, we have reviewed the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We commend you on this historic effort to fight Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and for the inclusion of Down syndrome in this National Plan. We are pleased the Plan establishes a taskforce to address the unique care challenges faced by people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we are pleased that the Plan includes steps to improve access to long-term services and supports for younger people, including those with Down syndrome.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease attacks adults with Down syndrome at a younger age and with increased frequency when compared to the general population. The pathological findings of Alzheimer's disease have been described in the brains of people with Down syndrome since the 1800s There are genetic factors at play that, in part, explain these pathologic and clinical observations. NIH is funding Down syndrome research using natural history studies and imaging techniques to identify early markers of cognitive decline. These studies will undoubtedly help people with Down syndrome, but they will also have a broader application to those individuals in the general population who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. By recognizing the specific link between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, the National Plan will leverage <em><strong>all</strong></em> of the most current scientific data available. More importantly, millions of American's who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease will benefit from the research that is already underway for those with Down syndrome. This is truly a win-win for the entire community.</p>
<p>Again, we thank you for your inclusion of Down syndrome in the National Plan, but are asking you to go a step farther. <strong>We respectfully request that a representative from the Down syndrome research community be added to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong>.</p>

<p><em><strong>GOAL: Delay onset and slow progression of Alzheimer's disease by 2020 </strong></em></p>
<p>To accomplish this goal:</p>
<ol><li>What do you see as the main obstacles to its achievement? Adequate funding is no doubt an element, but are there other barriers?
<ul><li>Generally, the field is too biased and focused on Aß/amyloid, and there needs to be more research oriented towards other potential therapeutic targets such as tau and factors that can improve synaptic connections (e.g., neurotrophic factors or stem cells). In addition, the field needs to focus efforts on the basic mechanism of disease. For example, there is an urgent need to develop better animal models of the disease, particularly those that represent the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease, and also ones that better mimic co-morbidities, as this disease strikes individuals who are quite aged, and generally suffer from other disorders besides Alzheimer's disease.
<ul><li>Educating the public more about the disease would also be useful, with particular emphasis on the effects of midlife modifiers of risk.</li>
<li>There also needs to be better realization that a monotherapy is unlikely to be successful for treating such a complex human disease and we need to do a better job focusing on considering combination therapies. I believe there are few complex human diseases that are readily treated by a single therapy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do you see as the key areas of emphasis in research needed to accomplish this goal? Please list up to <strong>5 key areas of research</strong> in order of importance (e.g., genetics, clinical trials). Within each area, please list one or two <strong>examples of more specific items</strong> (e.g., a GWAS in a particular population, a clinical trial on a tau-active drug). Please be succinct, realistic and concrete in your responses.
<ol><li>Animal models
<ol><li>Better models are needed of sporadic Alzheimer's disease</li>
<li>Consider using other species besides mice (rats, dogs, rabbits, primates)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Therapies
<ol><li>Targets needed other than Aß (e.g., tau, synaptic connections, autophagy/proteasome)</li>
<li>More than one therapy against more than one target</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Biomarkers/Early detection/Better Neuropsychological Batteries
<ol><li>Imaging other than amyloid: synapses, astrocytosis (surrogate biomarkers)</li>
<li>Better identification of individuals likely to develop AD</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Study of special human populations/minorities as they can provide important insights into the disease mechanisms
<ol><li>Down syndrome: represent largest group with early onset AD</li>
<li>Oldest old: enable us to elucidate risk factors that may prevent dementia in this group</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Clinical trials (people we enroll in the trials don't necessarily represent the generally population)
<ol><li>early treatments and more preventation trials need</li>
<li>consider co-morbidities</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Is the existing federal and private research infrastructure sufficient to support adequately current and future national research efforts addressing neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease? If not, what suggestions do you have for new infrastructure?
<ul><li>Consider developing infrastructure to foster young investigators at all levels (graduate students, postdocs, residents, assistant professors, etc.)</li>
<li>Facilitate transfer of IP to better enable partnerships between academics and drug companies/small businesses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What suggestions would you have for enhancing research collaboration outside of the federal government? That is, what would you recommend toward forging new public-private relationships? Please continue to page 3 5.
<ul><li>Consider developing a national IRB so that when multiple sites are used in a clinical trials, the protocol doesn't need to go to 50 different IRBs.</li>
<li>Important for their to be a mechanism for publishing negative clinical drug trials (this should almost be mandatory) so that others can learn and we can maximize resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What role do you see the Alzheimer's Centers playing in the future of research on Alzheimer's disease? How should the Centers Program evolve to meet the expanding needs for the field? 6.
<ul><li>Need more large multi-site studies.</li>
<li>NACC appears to mainly be a data repository and should evolve to be more of an actual coordinating center and facilitating and initiating true multi-site studies comparable to other coordinating centers.</li>
<li>Greater participation in human research studies by patients and controls could perhaps be encouraged if we revealed the results of genetic testing like ApoE and also revealed the results of imaging studies. Obviously, better counseling would also need to be provided.</li>
<li>More money for pilot projects and more pilot projects are needed; and also consider increasing the time for some pilots beyond one year.</li>
<li>Encourage more high risk and high yield type projects as well, rather than more conservative next step science.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please provide any additional comments you might have for developing a research plan to reach the stated goal by 2020.
<ul><li>Might want to consider working groups that are focused on specific areas. For example, one working group could involve leaders in animal models and coordinate the development of new models that can be widely shared in the field, rather than having individuals compete against each other, often working on very similar things.</li>

<p>On behalf of the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), I am writing to urge the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the "National Plan" to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NDSS is a nonprofit organization representing the more than 400,000 Americans with Down syndrome and over 350 affiliates worldwide. The mission of NDSS is to be the national advocate for the value, acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome.</p>
<p>NDSS would like to stress the important scientific relationship between Ds and ADRD. Research indicates that virtually all individuals with Down syndrome exhibit the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease by age 40, and 25-75% or more of individuals with Down syndrome over age 40 show the signs and symptoms of ADRD and the percentage increases with age. The incidence of ADRD in people with Down syndrome is estimated to be three to five times greater than that of the general population, which according to the Alzheimer's Association is now estimated to be 5.4 million people, 1 in 8 individuals, living with Alzheimer's. In the past several years, important progress has been made by scientists focused on understanding the connection between Ds and ADRD, yet much more research is needed. For many years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested in programs and studies. Some examples include: a 30-year study on aging and dementia in adults with Ds, a current grant focused on aging of the frontal structures of the brain (including dementia), developing imaging techniques to predict cognitive decline in adults with Ds, and a natural history study on the amyloid deposits in adults with Ds.</p>
<p>A more integral and specific inclusion of Ds in the overall ADRD research efforts, both fundamental and translational, would significantly contribute to progress more broadly and rapidly. <strong>To that end, we would respectfully request that a representative from the Ds research community be added to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services and that the National Plan be amended to incorporate Ds in the research section of the National Plan but also in sections related to public awareness, education and care giver support</strong>.</p>
<p>Individuals with Ds and their families deserve to have the need for research and population specific clinical trials identified specifically and clearly as necessary actions in the final ADRD National Plan as well as the care challenges they face that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on this important National Plan. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any further questions.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Area Planning and Services Committee (APSC) on Aging with Lifelong Disabilities, I am sending a letter in response to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute our thoughts and congratulate you and the council on its initiative. Best wishes,</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Area Planning and Services Committee (APSC) on Aging with Lifelong Disabilities, which I serve as chairman, respectfully wishes to make comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The APSC is a regional coalition comprised of some two dozen organizational and individual members from Chesterfield, Hanover, and Henrico counties and the city of Richmond, Virginia, representing intellectual disabilities, parks and recreation, residential services, blindness and visual impairment, communities of faith, higher education, family caregivers, and more.</p>
<p>The APSC works to address both the opportunities and challenges that present themselves as more adults with lifelong disabilities grow into later life. In effect, the APSC acts as a creative form of <em>de facto</em> public policy, trying to respond in the present to issues that formal regulations have not yet incorporated. For instance, how can aging-related services that are offered only to adults ages 60 and above respond to persons with lifelong disabilities who may manifest "aging" behaviors prematurely? In response, the APSC offers training workshops and statewide conferences, has developed health screening tools and DVDs on healthy diets and nutrition for adults with lifelong disabilities, and more.</p>
<p>Increasingly, service providers and family caregivers are pressing us for more focus on matters related to dementia with intellectual disabilities and other developmental disabilities. Our fall 2011 workshop did and our June 2012 statewide conference will concentrate on dementia care with lifelong disabilities. Adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities present new challenges to providers and families. Premature expression of Alzheimer's Disease by adults with Down syndrome generally precludes their engagement in aging-related services funded by the Older American Act which stipulates age 60 for eligibility. Dementia disrupts group homes for individuals with lifelong disabilities, for it overwhelms staff's ability to respond in the face of other continuing needs by those without dementia and breaks the bond of community that the adults with disabilities have developed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the overwhelming majority of today's older adults with lifelong disabilities have grown old in family contexts, in the care of their parents, not in an institutional setting. These caregiving parents, now quite advanced in age, are often under-recognized and under-reinforced by outside services, and the presentation of dementia is often more than they can handle. There are today about one million adults with lifelong developmental disabilities who have reached age 60 and beyond. Again, the great majority have done so through the continuing care of the parent and families. These parents and families need and deserve help.</p>
<p>The Draft National Plan does make mention of intellectual disabilities but we respectfully request that the Draft National Plan make a fuller focus, to include at least the following:</p>
<ol><li>Attention to the special circumstances attendant upon the relatively premature expression of dementia among adults with Down syndrome, an expression that occurs before the individual's own eligiblity for aging-related services funded by the Older Americans Act.</li>
<li>Attention to the expression of dementia among adults with other developmental disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, non-Down intellecual disabilities) and the consequences of the co-morbidity of dementia and the lifelong disability.</li>
<li>Attention to the growing need of managers, service providers, and policy makers with the developmental disabilities service sector for high quality training on Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, training that includes both conceptual and practical day-to-day management content.</li>
<li>Attention to the public reliance upon family caregivers as the mainstay of the long-term care system, as it relates to aging with lifelong disabilities, and to the critical needs of thse family caregivers for training in and support about caring for someone with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities who develops Alzheimer's Disease or another dementia.</li>
</ol><p>We thank you for considering our recommendations. With best wishes, I remain</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease. At the outset, let me express my appreciation and gratitude to everyone who is a part of this community: researchers, caregivers, affected individuals, and families who spend day in and day out caring for our loved ones.</p>
<p>I am providing these comments by way of my son Cole, who was born with an extra 21st chromosome. Since his birth, I have learned a great deal about the direct correlation between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. For example, I have learned that Alzheimer's disease attacks adults with Down syndrome at a younger age and with increased frequency compared to the general population. I have also learned that the pathological findings of Alzheimer's disease have been described in the brains of people with Down syndrome since the 1800s and that there are genetic factors at play that, in part, explain these pathologic and clinical observations. I further understand that NIH is funding Down syndrome research using natural history and imaging techniques to identify early markers of cognitive decline. These studies will undoubtedly help people with Down syndrome, but they will also have a broader application to those individuals in the general population who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Yet, there is so much more that can be learned from this relationship. I believe that both the Alzheimer's and Down syndrome communities would benefit greatly from additional conversations about this unique scientific correlation. To that end, I would encourage you to include a representative from the Down syndrome research community on the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>It has been just over one year since the National Alzheimer's Project was enacted. By recognizing the specific link between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease in the National Alzheimer's Project, the Council would be including all of the most current scientific data available. More importantly, millions of American's who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease will benefit from the research that is already underway in those with Down syndrome. This is truly a win-win for the entire community.</p>

<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia. In addition, as a parent or family member, I am aware of the need to provide special supports for caregivers, often siblings or aging parents, who assume responsibilities for the care needs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia.</p>
<p>It is also case that these individuals have special needs that may differ and require different supports than those provided to individuals in the general population. These needs have been identified by the National Task Group and Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices in an action plan it issued as part of its report: My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports", which has been submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have the need for research and population specific clinical trials identified specifically and clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as well as the care challenges they face that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports.</p>
<p>We are working with many families who are facing this very issue and the numbers are growing. As Executive Director of one of the largest Down syndrome associations in the country, and as a member of the DSAGC Health Professional Advisory Board who also serves as a consultant for the DSAGC who specializes in helping these families, we strongly urge the Council to consider the aging families who are dealing with aging children with Down syndrome who are most likely going to end up with this painful diagnosis. It is devastating diagnosis for families who have fought so hard to provide lifelong opportunities for their loved one...and then to have those opportunities taken away because of Alzheimer's disease is tragic to watch.</p>
<p>Please include us in the national study.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Regarding Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					March, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the development of the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and for the opportunity to submit comments.</p>
<p>The Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation is a national/international 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission to stimulate and support biomedical research that will accelerate development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for children <strong>and</strong> adults with <strong>Down syndrome</strong>. The major objectives include creating new opportunities for <strong>all</strong> Individuals with Down Syndrome to: 1) Lead more independent lives; 2) Participate more successfully in schools &amp; employment; and 3) Prevent additional early cognitive decline with aging &amp; <strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Since its founding in 2004, DSRTF, through its novel research strategy and grants program, has identified and substantively supported much of the research that has led to the recent rapid and unprecedented advances in Down syndrome cognition research and the first clinical trial with a novel drug candidate to focus on as a primary indication and specifically address overcoming cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with Down syndrome by a major international pharmaceutical company, Roche.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the explicit recognition, inclusion and designation of attention to intellectual disabilities populations as unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease within Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease and for populations facing care challenges. However, this is far too limited within the overall plan; it is more than just initiatives addressing only care. As discussed further below, there is a very strong rationale to <strong>explicitly include Down syndrome</strong> in each of the strategies, and designated strategic sub-actions, comprising the National Alzheimer's Plan and resulting initiatives, and Strategy 1 involving fundamental, translational and clinical research in particular.</p>
<p>As research has documented, virtually all individuals with Down syndrome, now numbering more than 400,000 individuals in the US, develop the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40. Research has also shown that, very conservatively, at least 25% increasing to 75% or more of the individuals with Down syndrome between the ages of 40-60 develop the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and the percentage increases with age. These facts underscore the very significant and important relevance of this population as a key and explicit element to be included not only in the National Alzheimer's Plan but also in the development and implementation of all aspects of the Plan, including research (fundamental, translational, and clinical) to effectively prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease, enhancing care quality and delivery, and expanding supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given these facts, explicit and integral inclusion and consideration of Down syndrome in the Plan and associated initiatives can not only significantly address the significant number of individuals with Down syndrome but also the larger non-Down syndrome population developing or with Alzheimer's disease. This requires significant increases in awareness and rational considerations among researchers and clinicians, which can be partly addressed through explicitly including Down syndrome more prominently in the Plan as well as in resulting initiatives and increased proportional funding.</p>
<p>Given the significant size of the Down syndrome population (&gt;400,000 in the US, and up to 10-times that number worldwide) and the virtual certainty that the individuals will develop the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and ultimately the associated dementia further compromising their cognition and life, inclusion of Down syndrome, particularly in the research initiatives (fundamental, translational, and clinical) would significantly contribute important novelty, unavailable otherwise, to as well as enhance and accelerate essentially all aspects of the major objectives specified under Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 as well as Goal 2. NIH grants and funding for <strong>all</strong> of Down syndrome research have remained disproportionately very low, e.g. $20M in FY 2011. This includes a much smaller and too limited subset of research grants investigating the aspects of Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. As only one contrasting example, explicit and significant attention and funding by NIH and its Alzheimer's disease research initiatives, both basic and translational, have been targeted to so-called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, both basic and translational (see e.g., the DIAN initiative) that is much more rare and with a much smaller population. In both Down syndrome and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease myriad research has confirmed the significant involvement of the same gene, APP, and its products (The APP gene is located on human chromosome 21, the chromosome trisomic in Down syndrome, as are a number of additional genes demonstrated to be involved in mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease.). Through more detailed and sufficient investigations in the Down syndrome population, researchers can obtain invaluable insight into how and why Alzheimer's disease develops, and can compare and extend their findings to the much more common late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease as well as enhance and accelerate development of new therapeutics. The relevant trajectory to Alzheimer's disease and size of the Down syndrome population provides a strong rationale for greater recognition and explicit inclusion in the National Alzheimer's Disease Plan and resulting Alzheimer's disease fundamental, translational and clinical research initiatives.</p>
<p>Although by no means an attempt to thoroughly include detailed or exhaustive rationale and recommendations in these comments here, in addition to the suggestions and requests above with respect to more prominent and explicit integral recognition and inclusion of Down syndrome in the ultimate version of the National Alzheimer's plan, I submit the following recommendations for further consideration:</p>
<ul><li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Goal 1 as well as each of the proposed "Actions" under Strategy 1A, including Actions 1.A.1-5.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.B. including Actions 1.B.1-6. This would include not only research in animal models of Down syndrome, but with respect to human clinical studies explicit designation and inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to those clinical studies initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts. The results would be expected to be mutually informative and beneficial.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.C. including Actions 1.C.1-2. Again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success.</li>
<li>As is true for Alzheimer's disease research and development, relevant Down syndrome research is ongoing, and increasing, internationally. It will be important to coordinate with and expand relevant Down syndrome research internationally and collaboratively. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.D. including Actions 1.D.1-2.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.E. including Actions 1.E.1-3. With respect to Action 1.E.1., again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success. With respect to Action 1.E.2., inclusion of private-public collaborations and partnerships between Federal entities such as NIH and non-governmental nonprofit organizations such as DSRTF with its focus on Down syndrome cognition research will enhance productivity, accelerate significant progress and success as well as minimize duplications of efforts and resources. With respect to Action 1.E.3., the critical importance of the increasing development and very significant impact of Alzheimer's disease on individual with Down syndrome and their families and care givers underscores the importance of involvement and communication with this community and associated stakeholders.</li>
<li>As indicated above, given the particular and significant relevance and importance of and impact of Alzheimer's disease on the relatively large population of individuals with Down syndrome, their families and caregivers as well as the healthcare system, it is not sufficient to generally designate "intellectual disabilities" in only Strategy 2.H. "Down syndrome" should be explicitly included in proposed Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies.</li>
<li>Finally, based on the comments, rationale and recommendations outlined above, we would encourage and recommend that a representative from the Down syndrome community be added to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Advisory Council, as the important deliberations, priorities and implementation will have mutual benefits to science/research, clinical care, and long term care not just additionally for individuals with Down syndrome and associated Alzheimer's disease but also for the broader population and research efforts involving Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>I would be very pleased to further discuss, as may be helpful and informative, any aspects of the above concerning the importance of explicit inclusion and considerations of Down syndrome relating to Alzheimer's disease in further detail with those involved in developing the National Plan, including members of the Advisory Committee. I have registered for and plan to attend the upcoming May 14-15 NAPA/NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in Bethesda, and look forward to the opportunity for further discussion of the importance and relevance of Down syndrome for the Plan and its successful implementation as outlined above.</p>

<p>The Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City represents 1200 families in 37 counties in Kansas and Missouri who are all caring for a loved one with Down syndrome. Many of our parents are gravely concerned about their child, teen or adult's future and the strong likelihood that they will develop dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified. We are aware that there is a lot of corollary research going on between Alzheimer's and Down syndrome and feel that more attention should be paid to this to ensure a bright future for both populations of people.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia.

<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have research and population specific clinical trials identified clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. They face many challenges that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is not complete unless it fully addresses the Down syndrome population as well.</p>

<p>The National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS) is a professional organization comprising the directors of state agencies serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The Association assists state IDD agency officials respond to emerging state and federal policy issues that that affect their efforts to ensure the delivery of services and supports to individuals with IDD in their respective states and jurisdictions. Association staff provide member state agencies with extensive technical assistance on a wide range of system and program related issues, in-depth analyses of Medicaid and other federal statutory and regulatory policies affecting people with IDD, and cutting edge information on state-of-the-art programs and service delivery practices. NASDDDS collaborates closely with the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD) and the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG) to improve health and healthcare of people with IDD nationwide.</p>
<p>State IDD service delivery systems are large with total annual state and federal expenditures in excess of $53 billion. Data reported by the University of Minnesota Research and Training Center on Community Living reveal that over 1,000,000 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy and related conditions received publicly financed residential supports through Medicaid and other state/federally funded programs. The majority of these individuals, approximately 57% live with their families, receiving the supports that they need at home, at work and in a variety of in day programs in the community. Of the approximately 440,000 remaining individuals, about 72% live in local group homes or other neighborhood settings of less than 6 persons. Fewer than 28% reside in large state and privately operated institutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this correspondence is to provide feedback to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services regarding the <em>Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. We are pleased that the Draft Plan specifically identifies people with intellectual disabilities in Strategy 2.H as a group of Americans who are at exceptionally high risk for contracting Alzheimer's disease. Including people with IDD in the report recognizes their particular vulnerability to these conditions and suggests the challenges that publicly financed systems of support will need to meet in the very near future. We believe, however, that the report does not go far enough in addressing the specific issues identified by NASDDDS member state agencies and articulated by a national report prepared by NTG entitled, <em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em>, and the related <em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em>. Our specific concerns and suggestions include the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 1</em>. The relationship between the presence of Down Syndrome and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not given proper focus in research and practice recommendations. </strong></p>
<p>Goal 1 of the Draft Plan highlights research but does not reference the need for targeted examination and analysis of the etiology and course of dementia for people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Sustained research in this area is clearly warranted to better understand the course and treatment of the disease and to inform and hopefully improve public policy in this area. We believe that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will also benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, people with Down syndrome demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. It should be emphasized that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that Goal 1 of the Draft Plan emphasize the need for focused basic and treatment research addressing the conditions and support needs of people with Down syndrome at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 2</em>. Addressing the specialized programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS agrees with the observations and recommendations of the NTG that the Council revise the Draft Plan to recognize the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). And that the discussion of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities be mentioned earlier on in this section to make it clear that the strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. It is important that the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same manner as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Furthermore, we believe that it is important that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only address improvements of care for this specific population, but also, are designed to increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that:</p>
<ul><li>The Draft Plan and any resulting guidelines produced include reference to the special circumstances and challenges involved in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities, and that this acknowledgement be placed earlier in the second section so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.B the need for specialized screening instruments that are designed and normed for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The administrative screening tool currently under development by the NTG will have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population that are not normed for use by people with cognitive disabilities.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.E the need for long-term 'dementia capable' services and supports to be offered in small community settings rather than institutional facilities, consistent with the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this small group home model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Issue 3</em>. Need to address the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities. </strong></p>
<p>As noted above, the majority, over 57%, of all people with IDD receiving publicly financed support reside in the home of a family member. The age of family caregivers, like the average age of the U.S. population in general is growing older however, and these caregivers are now themselves needing support. Tragically, the availability of services has not kept pace with the demand for support. Plummeting state budgets and reductions in Medicaid and state-funded supports have expanded waiting lists and placed a greater burden on families with relatives in need of personal care and assistance. The ability to provide quality care to people with IDD who are aging both now and in the future depends on the ability of state and federal service delivery systems to support the capacity of families to furnish needed long term assistance.</p>
<p>The majority of adults with Down Syndrome and other intellectual disabilities need assistance in decision making and consent. Adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs and consideration must be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that the Draft Plan address the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities, (see Strategy 3.C.1)</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 4</em>. Need to expand public education activities to include individuals with IDD and their families. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS believes that Goal 4 be expanded to ensure that the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities are specifically addressed by public education campaigns and to improve coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector. State IDD agencies are instrumental in organizing, managing and delivering services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. It is essential that these state agencies be included in public education efforts and that education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. Aggressive education campaigns addressing the nature of intellectual disabilities and the needs of individuals with IDD should be targeted to universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p>NASDDDS member state agencies furnish a wide array of publicly financed services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. As the age of the population increases, state service delivery systems are working to develop effective strategies for meeting the needs of people with IDD in a way that allows them to age in place and remain a part of their families and communities. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's is an important step forward. We appreciate the work and recommendations of the Advisory Council, not only for the population in general, but particularly for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are especially vulnerable to this condition. NASDDDS gratefully acknowledges the work on this issue by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices and their assistance in forming the recommendations of this Association.</p>

<p>We, Drs. Matthew P. Janicki and Seth M. Keller, are the co-chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. On behalf of the National Task Group, we wish to make our thoughts and recommendations available to the Advisory Council with respect to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To complement the National Alzheimer's Plan Act process, the National Task Group was convened and produced a report titled, "<strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em></strong>", which was designed, in part, to develop and enhance community care options for aging adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The National Task Group also issued the "<strong><em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em></strong>" as part of this report. The National Task Group issued this Action Plan in January 2012 in the hopes that it would promote better understanding of how adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities age and how dementia, in particular, affects them.</p>
<p>We note that the issues we identified in the National Task Group's report, which was submitted to the Advisory Council at its January 17th meeting, has many parallels with those raised in the Draft Plan. Our report summarized and addressed some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Our report also noted that older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have special needs that at times require different actions than those provided for people in the general population. Alzheimer's disease affects everyone; but not everyone can be treated the same way when they are affected by this disease.</p>
<p>We have submitted these comments in order to clarify and provide feedback to the Advisory Council regarding its Draft Plan. First, we would like to note that the National Task Group is pleased that the Draft Plan contains mention of intellectual disabilities (in Strategy 2.H) as this group of Americans is composed of a significant number of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for Alzheimer's disease. We also would like the Draft Plan to contain at least mention of some general issues that we have raised in our Report and also have more elaboration on some key specific issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Given this, we'd like to offer the following comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Missing mention of the significance of Down syndrome in Alzheimer's research</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the text under Goal 1, neglects mention of the research with respect to the needs of people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certainly sustained research is warranted to better understand the etiology and course of dementia in this group of individuals. Additionally, notwithstanding the competing beliefs of whether research involving people with Down syndrome will benefit general research into the nature and cause of Alzheimer's disease, we feel that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will certainly benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down syndrome also demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. We would like to emphasize that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention that given the high risk of Alzheimer's disease among adults with Down syndrome, there is the continued need for focused basic and treatment research involving people with Down syndrome -- and this should be included under Goal 1. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>We note with satisfaction that the Advisory Council's Draft Plan recognized the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). However, we would like to recommend that mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities receive mention earlier in this section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. We would like to see the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Further, under the Strategies noted under Goal 2, it is important to propose that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only look into improvements of care for this specific population, but also, and perhaps more importantly, increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities earlier in the second section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</em></strong></p>
<p>Under Strategy 2.B, we would also like to recommend that mention be made of the challenges of carrying out effective screening and diagnoses for dementia among most individuals with intellectual disabilities due to their inherently varying abilities and cognitive functions. When nationally applicable instrumentation is developed or recommended it would be highly beneficial to make mention in the Draft Plan of the need for specialized screening instruments for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The National Task Group is currently undertaking the development of such an administrative screen, which would have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population. Recognition of this special need and work by the National Task Group would go far to gain acceptance of a regularized screen applicable to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We also would recommend -- adding text under Strategy 2.E -- that the notion that community care, as noted in the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, be the paramount means of long-term 'dementia capable' care delivery. We note specifically the growing evidence-based research that is supporting the inclusion of small group homes -- as a viable assisted living model -- and their role as a potentially powerful alternative care setting for people with dementia, and in particular those with lifelong disabilities. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with certain intellectual disabilities and that any national guidelines produced contain this consideration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also strongly recommend the consideration of the use of small group homes for the community 'dementia capable' care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia as backed by evidence-based research in the intellectual disabilities field.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>As many adults with intellectual disabilities and in particular those with Down syndrome remain in their family homes living with their parents or other family caregivers as they grow older, it is crucial that under Goal 3 inclusion of the challenges faced by these caregivers -- when providing care-at-home to their relatives with intellectual disabilities and dementia -- be given due mention. These 'life-long caregivers' warrant special attention in the Draft Plan as they are providing an important and crucial bulwark against costly institutionalization and oft-times inappropriate admissions to long-term care facilities. They are also often vexed by emerging symptoms of dementia in their adult children who have successfully mastered many general activities of daily living and now are manifesting decline. Special mention to the situations of these lifelong caregivers should be made in the Draft Plan. In this context, the National Task Group also recommends that Strategy 3.C.1. be amended to recognize that in many settings concerned with adults with intellectual disabilities, decisions are often made by proxy (and not by 'middle-aged adults') and that adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs. Thus, consideration should be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the enhanced public education resources related to intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Under Goal 4, we strongly recommend including the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities under public education campaigns and that the greater coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector should get mention. As the state developmental disabilities authorities (agencies) are instrumental in helping organize state functions and programs with respect to intellectual and developmental disabilities it would be extremely beneficial to include these entities (and state developmental disabilities planning councils) in any public education efforts at the state level. Also, education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. As there are health care disparities, an aggressive education campaign should involve universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists as it relates to cognitive and functional disability and its detrimental effect on caregivers and quality of life of the individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The National Task Group recognizes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. Given this, we are very pleased that the Advisory Council recognized the import of the special challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this group in Strategy 2.H. We would hope for those adults with intellectual disabilities currently affected by dementia and those in the next generation who may be affected (as the timeline for the NAPA process encompasses the next 13 years) that the Advisory Council will recognize other areas of inclusion of the specific issues affecting individuals with intellectual disabilities within the Draft Plan and accept our recommendations for additional areas of mention and focus.</p>
<p>We trust the our comments and recommendations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are provided -- as the collective concerns and thoughts of a significant body of professionals, scientists, administrators, family caregivers and advocates, and persons personally affected by dementia -- who are represented by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Testimony</strong><br />
					NAPA Advisory Council Teleconference Meeting<br />
					March 14, 2012</p>
<p>On January 17, 2012 I addressed the Advisory Council about the need to include people with Down syndrome in all aspects of dementia related research, including clinical trials. I come before you today with great concern that any reference to Down syndrome, a genetic condition known to pose a considerable risk with respect to dementia, has been obviously omitted from the current Draft National Plan, particularly in Goal 1. This group of individuals deserves to be specifically identified in the National Plan. A vague reference to their existence embedded in the 21st page of the current Draft is grossly understated and should be remedied in future Draft National Plans.</p>
<p>Support for research is essential to better understand the disease process, the potential for early identification and the possibility for improved treatment practices. This research may not only benefit individuals with Down syndrome but the general population as well. The Research Summit in May 2012 referred to in the Draft National Plan should be inclusive of those involved in the study of Down syndrome. I strongly urge you to give serious consideration to the letter submitted by the nationally recognized group of researchers and clinicians read today by Dr. Peterson. Inclusion will help to reduce the potential for greater medical disparities so often faced by this group of individuals. I urge you to act responsibly in their regard. Though some members of the Advisory Council may consider Alzheimer's disease within the Down syndrome community as a different disease process, I can assure you, as a family member, that it looks the same, acts the same and has the same tragic ending, more often at a much younger age.</p>
<p>Families of those with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities deserve more than inattention by the Advisory Council and the Draft National Plan. Care commitments for adults with late life disability attributed to the onset of dementia can differ from the care commitments required for those with lifelong disabilities who then develop dementia. Certainly, these distinctions warrant mention in the Plan. The plan should include specific reference to the need for special supports for family caregivers now dually challenged by lifetime care sacrifices and the emerging additional needs of an adult child with an intellectual disability affected by dementia. As individuals with intellectual disabilities live longer and may be predisposed to the development of Alzheimer's disease, the role of caregiving is now, more than ever, assumed by siblings of the individual. These family members potentially face the challenges of not only the care needs of their adult sibling with an intellectual disability and dementia but also their parents who may be facing the same issues related to decline. This overwhelming dual role is under recognized and most worthy of notation in the National Plan.</p>
<p>The current draft plan makes no mention of individuals with intellectual disabilities other than the reference in section 2H. Section 2.H.1 recommends the establishment of a future task group to address the issues related to "racial and ethnic minorities and people with intellectual disabilities". It is important to clarify that people with intellectual disabilities tend to develop Alzheimer's disease at the same rate as the general public. People with Down syndrome have a known genetic mutation that results in early onset and a much higher incidence. Reference to the needs of those with Down syndrome should be specifically embedded in all sections of any finalized document, not deferred to some future taskforce.</p>
<p>My great concern is that little or no attention will be paid to the populations disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease after the National Plan is finalized and disseminated. The potential for this to occur can easily become reality as the Affordable Care Act is brought into question and the possibility for a change in HSS leadership exists in an election year. I urge both federal and non-federal members of the Advisory Council to do the hard work required to address the needs of <strong>all</strong> individuals that face the debilitating ravages of Alzheimer's disease. Be thorough and inclusive in your plan and do not yield to the pressure to produce a document that cannot be defined as such.</p>

<p>Francis S. Collins, MD, PhD<br />
					Director, National Institutes of Health<br />
					Bethesda, MD</p>
<p>As you mentioned in the Washington Post yesterday, "The science of Alzheimer's disease has reached a very interesting juncture." In that light, I would like to underscore the importance of the relationship between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>As you know, the pathological findings of Alzheimer's disease have been found in the brains of people with Down syndrome since the late 1800s. You also know that there are 400 genes on the extra chromosome 21 of people with Down syndome. Of these 400 genes, at least 4 candidate genes may play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (APP, BACE 2, SOD 1, and RCAN 1). Moreover, Alzheimer's disease attacks adults with Down syndrome at very young age with increased frequency and venom, resulting in tremendous care taker issues for families.</p>
<p>This evidence points to Down syndrome as an important model for Alzheimer's disease. NIH and NICHD, in particular, are building on this significant correlation through cognitive and imaging research. I believe this research will undoubtedly inform treatment strategies for both the cognitive deficits in Down syndrome as well as the cognitive loss associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>As the Institute moves forward with crucial Alzheimer's disease research, I encourage you to look closely at the models that have been developed with respect to Down syndrome and the important research being conducted by NICHD.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Are dental X-rays causing Alzheimer's disease?</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Caroline Rodgers. I am a researcher and writer specializing in public health issues.</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone here would agree that Alzheimer's disease has turned the prospect of aging into a scary and uncertain future that will rob many of us of our memories, our dignity and even our lives. I am here because I envision a world in which Alzheimer's is once again a rarity and our senior years are a true Golden Age.</p>
<p>Last year my article proposing that dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease was published in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses<sup>1</sup>. I also made a poster presentation on the subject at the 2011 Alzheimer's Association International Conference<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The technical explanation of my hypothesis is:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ionizing radiation from dental X-rays shortens the telomeres of microglia, which are critical to maintaining neuronal health. This reduces the lifespan of microglia, stranding neurons. Stranded neurons subsequently die, causing irreversible dementia. </strong></em></p>
<p>More simply stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>Head exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is causing us to outlive the brain cells designed to support our neurons all lifelong. </strong></em></p>
<p>NOTE: Dental X-rays are the only form of ionizing radiation that virtually all Americans are routinely exposed to at regular intervals throughout their entire lives, starting in early childhood. Although low-dose ionizing radiation amounts have been compared to background radiation exposure received during long airline flights, the amount of whole-body ionizing radiation received cannot be fairly compared to the amount beamed directly into the head.</p>
<p>It is not realistic to believe that decades of dental X-ray exposure would be without consequence for all people. The question is not, "Why should we consider whether dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's," but rather, "Why didn't we think of this sooner?"</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis foundation: </strong></p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's prevalence data</li>
<li>Population-based dental care information</li>
<li>Scientific studies<sup>1-4</sup></li>
</ol><p><strong>Dental care &amp; dementia: A sampling of countries </strong></p>
<p>INDIA</p>
<p>67% have never visited a dentist<sup>5 </sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence estimated at 1/5 -1/4 that of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>CHINA</p>
<p>30% to 43% adults have never visited a dentist<sup>7</sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence about half of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>UNITED STATES</p>
<p>1% have never visited a dentist<sup>8</sup><br />
					13% of people 65 and older have AD<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>Let's test this hypothesis against the facts </strong></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The emergence of AD symptoms is delayed 10 or more years following the presence of AD brain pathology.</p>
<p>Microglial telomere shortening would have a delayed effect on neurons because it reduces microglial lifespan, not function.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD mortality increased rapidly after 1979, making it the sixth leading cause of death by 2000.</p>
<p>Since AD symptoms are delayed by 10 or more years, it is worthwhile to look at health trends taking place in the decades before the surge in AD mortality. This was a time of major changes in the nation's dental health habits.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong> it wasn't until the '40s that X-ray machines were common in America's dental offices<sup>10</sup>. However, nearly two decades later, in 1954 . . .<br /><strong>1957</strong> only 37% had visited a dentist within the year, while 18% reported never visiting a dentist<sup>11</sup>.<br /><strong>2008</strong> 59% had visited a dentist within the year, with only 1% never having visited a dentist<sup>8</sup>.<br /><strong>2010</strong> The national average that had been to a dentist or dental clinic within the year was 69.7%<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to suffer AD-related damage.</p>
<p>It contains both microglia and neural progenitor cells which -unlike other mature brain cells -- keep dividing, making them more susceptible to radiation-induced damage.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Men die sooner than women following an AD diagnosis<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Older men have shorter telomeres than women the same age<sup>13</sup>, so they would have less time if their microglia telomeres were prematurely shortened.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Virtually all people with Down syndrome have AD brain pathology by age 40 -- but there is a wide variance in the onset of dementia<sup>14,15</sup>.</p>
<p>People with Down syndrome lose telomere length faster than the general population, but just like others, there is variation in newborn telomere length<sup>16,13</sup>. Also, people with Down syndrome are subject to many genetic dental anomalies that could entail additional X-ray exposure.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD prevalence is higher in urban areas<sup>17</sup>.</p>
<p>City dwellers make more dental visits<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD is increasing most rapidly in developing countries -- especially Latin America<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, many countries started providing free dental care to all citizens, such as Cuba in 1976, Venezuela in 1999 and Brazil in 2004,.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD does not respond to anti-inflammatory or cholesterol-lowering drugs -- even though AD is associated with brain inflammation and high cholesterol<sup>19,20</sup> .</p>
<p>Neither treatment can help neurons that have lost their support system.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Mentally stimulating activities initially delay AD, yet ultimately accelerate it<sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>Additional brain growth would eventually overwhelm microglia struggling to support existing neuronal networks.</p>
<p><strong>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's, it raises new questions and concerns, such as:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Could diligent dental care explain the increase in non-familial early-onset AD?</li>
<li>At what price, a smile: What are the long-term risks for orthodontia patients exposed to cone-beam CT scanners that create 3-D images -- at much higher radiation levels?</li>
<li>Could head X-rays after sports injuries contribute to early-onset dementia?</li>
<li>If dental X-rays pose risks, could brain imaging utilizing ionizing radiation to monitor AD accelerate disease progression?</li>
<li>Do plateaus in declining cognition relate to intervals between X-ray exposures?</li>
<li>Could the ratio of dental professionals to population be used to create accurate algorithms to predict dementia trends?</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are the prospects for Alzheimer's prevention, treatment or cure? </strong></p>
<p>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease, future cases can be decreased by eliminating or strictly limiting dental X-rays. Dentists can also turn to alternative imaging technologies already developed, yet not in common use. Interventions for people already exposed to dental X-rays yet without AD symptoms could include developing ways to safely transplant self-donated bone marrow or dental stem cells to replenish microglia populations. Other possibilities would be to develop ways to preserve or even lengthen microglia telomere length or to selectively remove permanently senescent microglia cells to stimulate replacement microglia that would actively provide neuroprotection. Sadly, there is no evident cure for people who have already lost their microglial support system to the point where enough neurons have died to cause symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Closing comments </strong></p>
<p>I don't know the answer to the questions I have raised in this short talk. I do, however, know that we have to look in new places with open minds to solve the puzzle of AD's emergence as a major killer and to restore health, dignity and luster to our "golden years."</p>

<p>My name is Mary Hogan. I am one of 8 older siblings of the late Bill Hogan. I submit this request to you today, December 30, 2011, in honor of my brother and hopefully for other families who are facing the challenges related to Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In January 2006, at the age of 45, Bill was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer's type. Over the course of the next 4 years his journey became far more complex. He experienced a very rapid deterioration during the last 13 months of his life and died of chronic aspiration pneumonia on February 25, 2010, two months shy of his 50th birthday. My brother was a member of a subgroup of individuals with Down syndrome that develop AD early, decline rapidly and face a premature death. This has been a great loss for our family and Bill's community at large.</p>
<p>Extraordinary efforts to advocate for Bill were required during the final years of his life. Active advocacy was sometimes lonely and often a frustrating process. Obstacles for advocacy increased significantly after Bill's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Our experience is most likely replicated in other families as well.</p>
<p>I write to you today to request the following considerations for the National Alzheimer Project Act Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services:</p>
<ol><li>People with Intellectual Disabilities, and their caregivers, should be included in future planning with the <strong>same access</strong> to appropriate care and support as individuals in the general population. The growing incidence of Alzheimer's disease will be mirrored in the ID population, most especially with individuals with DS who have a far greater likelihood of developing this insidious disease by age 60. Inclusion in any future planning will be ensure that this often marginalized group will have access to appropriate care across their lifetime.</li>
<li>Most often individuals with ID, including those with DS, are cared for by their families well into their adult lives, often by aging family members. Recognition of the need to enhance support for this group of caregivers will be critical in the future. I ask that NAPA Advisory Council recognize the need for improved dementia care for individuals with intellectual disabilities in conjunction with increased support for family members as caregivers and advocates.</li>
<li>Since individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, families, caregivers, agencies, medical providers and researchers will need to work together to maintain their "quality of life". Families facing DS/AD need access to information about both disease process and advocacy. I suggest a review of what has been produced by Alzheimer's Australia and the Australian government as a sample of what might be provided.</li>
<li>A consortium of providers (i.e. Alzheimer's Association, Health and Human Services, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities or Administration on Aging, UCEDD, families, and advocacy organizations, etc.) should disseminate best practice guidelines related to adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia. This will include training and education for care providers across a multitude of settings. I suggest careful consideration of the forthcoming document produced by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</li>
</ol><p>I am hopeful that in this day of limited funding the needs of <strong>all</strong> people with Alzheimer's disease will be addressed creatively and with the greatest of compassion and that the National Alzheimer Project Act Advisory Council will provide leadership and direction for the future.</p>
<p>I thank you for the considering this request.</p>

<p>Comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					September 27, 2011</p>
<p>By Matthew P. Janicki, Ph.D. on behalf of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices</p>
<p>I am the co-chair, along with Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry, of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. The National Task Group was created in 2010 by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD), and my university center, the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging and Developmental Disabilities (Lifespan Health and Function) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Our charge was to examine the state of practices related to dementia and people with lifelong intellectual disabilities, their families and caregivers, and the organizations that support them, and provide commentary on what needs to be done to further services and practices in the United States related to this population. Our charge also was to provide information and recommendations to the Advisory Council formed under the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>To this end, the National Task Group, composed of some 100 administrators, academics, providers, clinicians, families, and advocates, have coalesced with a number of national disability and family based organizations, federal agencies, and provider representatives to create a report on our findings and recommendations. The report, "'<em>My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected By Dementia to Remain In Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em> " is currently in development and we anticipate having it launched at our next National Task Group meeting in November.</p>
<p>In advance of the release of our Report, it is timely to provide the Advisory Council with some key points from the Report for its use. We have prepared these comments, which I trust the Council members will find informative and helpful:</p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affects adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in similar ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound impact due to particular risk factors -- including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. While mostly the disease follows a typical course, at times some adults are profoundly and aggressively affected. Yet all need the typical types of supports and services usually associated with dementia-capable care. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- believe that adults with intellectual disabilities require the same early and periodic diagnostic services, community education, and community-based supports for themselves, their caregivers, and the organizations responsible for them, as do other adults with dementia in the general population</em>.</li>
<li>Many families are the primary lifetime caregivers for adults with intellectual disabilities and when Alzheimer's disease and dementia occurs, they are particularly affected and need considerable supports. These families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. Many such families are at a loss for providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes progressive and care demands overwhelm them. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased home-based supports for caregivers who remain the primaries for care for adults affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Many intellectual disabilities provider organizations that are the primary resources for residential and day supports are vexed by the emerging trend of increasing numbers of adults with intellectual disabilities in their services showing signs of early decline and dementia with potentially more demanding care needs. In such cases, staff may be unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and may misrepresent or ignore these changes, when early identification could prove beneficial. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased education and training of personnel with respect to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and invest in promoting best practices in models of community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>As it is important to pick up signs of dementia-related cognitive decline early on , we -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and health authorities undertake a program of early identification screening - beginning at age 50 for adults with intellectual disabilities and at age 40 for adults with Down syndrome and others at early risk. We recognize that the Advisory Council may be debating the issue of early identification and screening in the general population. In this regard, <em>the National Task Group</em> has identified a screening instrument, applicable particularly to adults with an intellectual disability, which seems to work as a first-instance screen and <em>recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to begin to identify those adults at risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Most adults with a lifelong intellectual disability live in community settings with support from families, friends and service providers. Research has shown that community-based models of care for adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia include community-based options, such as support for living at home or in small group homes, are viable and gaining preference for all individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. Institutionalization of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia is anathema to the core beliefs and commitments to care practices in the intellectual disabilities field and such institutionalization (via use of long-term care facilities) has been shown to have an adverse affect on lifespan and quality of life. The group home model, where a handful of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia live in a specialized care home, is becoming more prominent across the world. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that these models be expanded and an investment be made into enabling provider organizations to develop and maintain such care efforts, including developing more small community-based specialized 'dementia capable' group homes</em>.</li>
<li>Dementia has a devastating impact on all people one way or another -- including people with intellectual disabilities and the many families, friends, and staff involved as parents, siblings, advocates, and caregivers. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- wish to give emphasis to this point and ask the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to include concerns and considerations for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities in any and all documents, plans, and recommendations to Congress that are part of the work of the Council</em>. The National Task Group stands ready to assist and contribute to such efforts and is pleased that this Council recognizes Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as an ultimate public health issue and a problem to which we collectively need to attend.</li>

<p>My name is Lane Simonian. I am an historian. Seven years ago when my aunt and cousin were in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and my mother was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, I began searching for ways to prevent and treat the disease. As an historian, I began to collect a mass of abstracts and articles in an attempt to tell the story of Alzheimer's disease. At first with a limited background in biology, I made very slow progress in understanding Alzheimer's. Now, though, I can explain almost every new finding in regards to the disease with the attached hypothesis. What used to take me months to figure out now usually only takes a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The critical finding in regards to Alzheimer's disease was made by Mark Smith and his colleagues in 1997: Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease. This damage includes the oxidation (loss of electrons and hydrogen) of glucose transport systems, choline transport systems, the enzyme cholineacetyltransferase, g protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic, serotonin, dopamine, olfactory, adrenergic), the nitration of tau proteins, lipid peroxidation, and the influx of calcium. This damage results in a lack of focus and energy, impaired short-term memory due to a shortage of acetylcholine, disturbed sleep and mood, lack of awareness, impaired smell, behavioral problems (in some instances), disrupted neurotransmission, damage to cellular membranes, and neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>The factors that lead to peroxynitriteformation include (but again are not limited to) high glucose levels, high blood pressure, the APOE4 gene, presenilin gene mutations, bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs, late estrogen replacment therapy, mercury, aluminum fluoride, and stress. Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation also lead to Alzheimer's disease (the connection has not been made as of yet between bisphosphonateosteoporosis drugs and Alzheimer's disease, but the fact that the numbers of cases of Alzheimer's disease has skyrocketed since the introduction of these drugs is perhaps concerning).</p>
<p>Phenolic compounds in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils and polyunsatured fats inhibit peroxynitrite formation and thus inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease. The most direct and concentrated way to deliver phenolic compounds to the brain is through aromatherapy with essential oils high in phenoliccompounds.</p>
<p>An impressive number of animal studies, case studies, and clinical trials indicate that Alzheimer's disease can be treated effectively with peroxynitrite scavengers (compounds that are hydrogen donors convert peroxynitrites into a nitrogen dioxide anion and water). These scavengers partially reverse or prevent all of the damage done by peroxynitrites listed above (for example, they add hydrogen back to muscarinicreceptors allowing more choline to enter cells). In the reference section of the attached hypothesis you will find a partial list of peroxynitrite scavengers (most of them are phenolic compounds) which have helped correct cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. These include rosmarinic acid, grape seed extract, cinnamon extract, eugenol in Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil, and thymol and carvacrolin Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil. In addition, Jimbo and colleagues in Japan were able to improve cognitive function in dementia patients after giving them rosemary and lemon to smell in the morning and lavender and orange to smell in the evening for 28 days. Akhondzadeh and his colleagues achieved similar results using tinctures of sage and lemon balm essential oils for four months. One reviewer looking at this (and perhaps other clinical trials) concluded "excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated."</p>
<p>Several case studies add further validity to the findings from animal studies and clinical trials. Dramatic improvements in alertness and awareness and modest improvements in short-term memory have been noted. In my mother's case she recognizes her home again, feels comfortable around her brother who she used to think was an impostor, sleeps through the night, can recall her name and sometimes spell it, can sometimes remember the order of days and months, can complete phrases such as I scream, you scream, we all scream for...ice cream and April showers...bring May flowers, and is much more alert and aware than she was four years ago before we began aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Essential oils high in methoxyphenols (such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon leaf) and citrus based essential oils appear to work the best. The patient can smell them under each nostril for a few seconds. It takes about a month to begin seeing some improvement (perhaps because it takes time to reverse the damage that peroxynitrtes do to smell).</p>
<p>Let me highlight the critical points:</p>
<ul><li>Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and directly or indirectly causes all the features of the disease.</li>
<li>Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation can cause Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Compound which inhibit peroxynitriteformation inhibit the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>In animal studies, clinical trials, and case studies, peroxynitrite scavengers have lead to improvements in cognitive function.</li>
<li>Phenolic compounds can be used both to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, aromatherapy is likely the most effective way to deliver these compounds to the brain.</li>
<li>This disease can be treated effectively immediately with few side effects.</li>
</ul><p>I wish you good luck in your work. If the opportunity arises, I would like to meet each of you in person. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me. Nothing pleases me more when I receive questions from people interested in my research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>I have two questions: will there be public comment at any or all of the advisory council meetings and what would be the best way to communicate with members of the committee?</p>
<p>Based on animal model studies, clinical trials, and case studies (including my mother), I know how to treat this disease and likely how to delay its onset. In the hypothesis, you will find references that show that peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and that this damage can partially be corrected with peroxynitrite scavengers. Some of the most effective scavengers are methoxyphenols (eugenol,thymol, and carvacrol) in various essential oils (such as cinnamon leaf, clove, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and sage) in part because they can be inhaled directly into to the part of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease: the hippocampus.</p>
<p>With some help from this committee, it is likely that Alzheimer's disease could be effectively treated within this next year.</p>
