</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The aging of the baby boomers is a significant economic and social  		issue. By 2030, older adults are expected to make up 20 percent of the  		population, doubling from 35 to 70 million people. The relationship between  		older age, chronic illness and disability, and higher use of long-term care  		services is well established. In response to the rising demand for long-term  		care, consumer advocates, policy makers, and service providers have encouraged  		the development of new models of organizing and delivering health-related and  		supportive services that are attractive and affordable to older adults,  		particularly those who are poor or of modest means. </p>
<p>Assisted living facilities (ALFs) are a residential model of care that  		has received considerable attention as a potentially less expensive and more  		appealing alternative to nursing homes. The Assisted Living Quality Coalition  		has defined assisted living as a congregate residential setting that provides  		or coordinates personal services, 24-hour supervision and assistance (scheduled  		and unscheduled), activities, and health-related services and is designed to  		minimize the need to move; to accommodate individual residents' changing needs  		and preferences; to maximize residents' dignity, autonomy, privacy,  		independence, and safety; and to encourage family and community  		involvement.<sup><font><a href="lessons-workshops-affordable-housing-plus-services-strategies-low-and-modest-income-seniors.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> While the  		number of ALFs across the country has rapidly expanded over the last decade,  		they have remained largely cost prohibitive for older people with limited  		incomes. Many states have secured waivers allowing Medicaid to cover ALF costs;  		however, assisted living remains primarily private pay. In 2002, Medicaid  		helped pay for approximately 11 percent of the total number of assisted living  		residents in 41 states.<sup><font><a href="lessons-workshops-affordable-housing-plus-services-strategies-low-and-modest-income-seniors.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>A less well-publicized residential care model providing  		  lower-income seniors with access to health-related and supportive services is  		  emerging in publicly subsidized housing communities. This service delivery  		  model, referred to in this report as affordable housing plus  		  services (AHPS), is intended to integrate independent, unlicensed, and  		  primarily subsidized multi-unit housing environments for older adults with  		  services and supports. The goal is to enable older residents who are frail  		  and/or disabled to remain in their housing community even as their health  		  declines and disability increases. </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and  		Urban Development (HUD) and the A.M. McGregor Home in Cleveland, OH, funded the  		Institute for the Future of Aging Services (IFAS), the policy and applied  		research arm of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging  		(AAHSA), to examine the potential of AHPS strategies to meet some of the  		long-term care needs of low and modest-income seniors. IFAS defines AHPS as  		having three elements: </p>
<ul><li>Independent, unlicensed, primarily subsidized, multi-unit housing  		  where large numbers of low and modest-income older adults live in close  		  proximity.</li>
<li>Health-related and supportive services, funded separately from the  		  housing, and available to at least some older residents (e.g., personal care,  		  housekeeping, meals, transportation, health and wellness services, etc.).</li>
<li>A purposeful linkage mechanism connecting residents to needed  		  health-related and supportive services so that they are able to age in  		  place in the face of declining health and increasing disability. </li>
</ul><p>Three reports have been produced in conjunction with the AHPS study:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>A Synthesis of Findings from the Study of Affordable Housing Plus  			 Services for Low and Modest-Income Older Adults</b> (summarizes study  			 findings). [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpssyn.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpssyn.htm</a>]  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inventory of Affordable Housing Plus Services Initiatives for Low  			 and Modest-Income Seniors</b> (describes the AHPS strategies and programs  			 identified by IFAS during the course of the study). [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpsinv.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpsinv.htm</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lessons from the Workshops on Affordable Housing Plus Services  			 Strategies for Low and Modest-Income Seniors</b> (reports on the findings and  			 lessons learned from the proceedings of four invitational workshops held across  			 the country to analyze the merits of AHPS strategies and the barriers to their  			 more widespread diffusion). [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpsless.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpsless.htm</a>]</p>

<ul><li>the IFAS website (<a href="http://www.futureofaging.org">http://www.futureofaging.org</a>);</li>
<li>the ASPE website (<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports.shtml</a>);</li>
<li>the HUD website (<a href="http://www.huduser.org">http://www.huduser.org</a>). </li>
</ul><p>This report presents the findings from the AHPS workshops. </p>
<h2><a name="purpose" id="purpose">II. WORKSHOP PURPOSES AND FORMAT</a></h2>
<p> IFAS had five objectives in organizing and convening the four  		workshops:</p>
<ul><li> Developing a shared understanding of the types of AHPS models  		  emerging across the country.</li>
<li> Learning how specific programs worked in practice.</li>
<li> Identifying the perceived impact of AHPS programs on older adults  		  and housing providers.</li>
<li> Analyzing the regulatory barriers believed to impede implementation  		  and how they might be overcome.</li>
<li> Documenting the issues and questions providers and policy makers  		  believed needed to be addressed before large-scale investments in AHPS  		  strategies. </li>
</ul><p> The four workshops, attended by over 230 stakeholders, were held during  		the summer and fall of 2005. The first workshop, convened in Cleveland, Ohio,  		and hosted by the A.M. McGregor Home, was targeted primarily at the Cleveland  		metropolitan area. The other three workshops, hosted by AAHSA state affiliates  		in California, Rhode Island, and Georgia, were organized to facilitate  		statewide and regional participation. Participants came from the states of  		Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New  		Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and  		included:</p>
<ul><li> Affordable housing providers representing a wide range of  		  properties, including Section 202 Housing for the Elderly, Low Income Housing  		  Tax Credit (LIHTC), public housing, mobile home parks, and cooperatives serving  		  low-income seniors.</li>
<li> Health and aging services providers representing hospitals, health  		  plans, adult day health centers, Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly  		  (PACE), area agencies on aging and other social service organizations.</li>
<li> State and local government officials with responsibilities for  		  Medicaid home and community-based services, the Older Americans Act (OAA), the  		  development and financing of publicly subsidized housing, and community  		  development programs.</li>
<li> Federal officials from HHS and HUD.</li>
<li> Investment bankers.</li>
<li> Attorneys, insurers, and risk managers.</li>
<li> Researchers. </li>
<li> Foundation representatives.</li>
<li> Consumer advocates.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ideal" id="ideal">III. IFAS IDEAL HOUSING PLUS SERVICES MODEL</a></h2>
<p> The context for the workshops was set by IFAS Executive Director Dr.  		Robyn Stone who presented a definition of AHPS and outlined the components of  		an ideal system. The IFAS ideal model is one in which:</p>
<ul><li> The housing arrangement is independent, unlicensed, largely  		  multi-unit publicly subsidized housing or other such affordable property(s),  		  where large numbers of low and modest-income seniors live in close proximity to  		  one another.</li>
<li> A shared philosophy exists between the housing provider, residents  		  and their families, and the community to do what it takes to help  		  residents age in place.</li>
<li> Residents have access to a full spectrum of primary, preventative,  		  and chronic care services in addition to personal care and supportive  		  services.</li>
<li> Services are resident centered--privacy and confidentiality are  		  respected, decisions to accept or reject services are voluntary, and the role  		  of housing and community services providers is to partner with residents who  		  want to remain in independent housing, despite increasing frailty and declining  		  health.</li>
<li> The services system is flexible, supported by multiple funding  		  sources, and able to respond to unpredictable and changing needs.</li>
<li> The system capitalizes on existing resources of the resident and his  		  or her family, friend and neighbor networks of the housing property, the assets  		  of the surrounding community, and existing state and federal health and  		  supportive services programs. </li>
<li> Residents have access to individualized assessment and service  		  coordination, delivered by either property staff or community agencies.</li>
<li> Purchasing and delivery of services takes advantage of potential  		  economies of scale resulting from large numbers of older adults living close to  		  one another.</li>
<li> The who and how of service delivery is  		  tailored to fit the capacity of particular housing and aging services providers  		  and the policy and regulatory environments in which they operate.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="highlight" id="highlight">IV. HIGHLIGHTED AHPS STRATEGIES</a></h2>
<p> Workshop participants were introduced to a number of AHPS strategies  		that have been implemented by housing providers across the country and which  		incorporate at least some of the elements of the IFAS ideal model. These  		presentations were intended to: (1) showcase promising practices; (2) stimulate  		debate about the policy and practice barriers to widespread replication and how  		they might be overcome; and (3) identify new opportunities for developing and  		funding AHPS linkages. </p>
<p> Presentations at the workshops included: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b> Mercy Housings Strategic Health Partnerships</b>. Mercy is  			 a national provider of affordable family and senior housing that operates 46  			 properties around the country designed specifically for lower-income seniors.  			 Mercy has created strategic health partnerships with seven health care systems  			 to increase the supply of affordable housing for low-income seniors and  			 families. The health care systems provide operating support for the housing  			 projects and often donate the land upon which properties are built. Mercy also  			 maintains service coordinators in its properties who provide residents with  			 information on the services available in the community, refer residents to  			 community providers, and coordinate on and offsite educational, health and  			 wellness, and community involvement opportunities. Mercy has developed a  			 senior resident services program model to measure the impact of  			 service coordination on resident receipt of services and ability to age in  			 place, quality of life, self-advocacy, and civic involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> National Church Residences (NCR) Service Coordinator  			 Program</b>. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, NCR has 154 service coordinators  			 working in 194 of its Section 202 and LIHTC properties. The primary role of NCR  			 service coordinators is to provide residents with information and linkages to  			 the resources they need to age in place. NCR adheres to a philosophy of  			 resident-driven service coordination where the service coordinator does not  			 decide and act for the resident, but facilitates the resident meeting their  			 needs to the extent they are able. Service coordinators conduct an evaluation  			 of residents requesting assistance, assessing resident behaviors, functional  			 abilities, and needs based on information from the resident and their own  			 observation. Together they draw up a case management plan that identifies the  			 goals and needs of the resident, and the service coordinator refers them to  			 community agencies, monitors the case management plan and follows-up to ensure  			 the residents needs are actually met. NCR has also instituted a quality  			 assurance program, which tracks each service coordinators performance  			 and, through monthly feedback, ensures they are in compliance with all  			 regulations and standards and are providing residents with the highest level of  			 service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Lifelong Medical Cares Integrated Care Model</b>. Lifelong  			 Medical Care in Berkley, California, blends health care, social services, and  			 affordable senior housing through a collaboration between a community health  			 center funded through the federally qualified health centers program, a PACE  			 program, and a Section 202 property. (PACE is a capitated benefit that features  			 a comprehensive service delivery system including acute care and nursing  			 facility services and integrates Medicare and Medicaid financing.) As a result,  			 eligible senior residents can obtain a comprehensive range of services in one  			 place, including primary health care services, dental care, physical therapy,  			 and chronic care management. Residents can also participate in activities at  			 the onsite adult day care center where they can obtain a wide range of  			 preventative and supportive services, including personal care. Through this  			 integrated approach, healthier seniors have access to health and wellness  			 services while frailer seniors are able to receive services similar to those  			 available in licensed assisted living programs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> The Marvins Partnership with the State of  			 Connecticuts Congregate Housing Program</b>. The Marvin represents an  			 innovative approach to meeting the needs of the elderly through an  			 intergenerational program offering affordable congregate housing to senior  			 citizens while providing a school readiness, full-day childcare program to  			 young children. The senior housing component is funded through a combination of  			 LIHTC and low-interest loans from the state, under the auspices of the  			 Department of Economic and Community Development and the Connecticut Housing  			 Finance Authority. Through participation in a special state grant program, the  			 Marvin is able to provide all senior residents with core congregate services  			 including dinner, weekly housekeeping, a full time resident service  			 coordinator, onsite 24-hour staff coverage, an on-call nurse (with some  			 regularly scheduled hours onsite), and health and wellness services. In  			 addition, eligible residents participate in the Medicaid home and  			 community-based services waiver program where they have access to assisted  			 living type services such as hands-on assistance with daily living activities.  			 Assisted living services are licensed through the Department of Public Health  			 and are provided through a contract with a private assisted living services  			 agency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Northern California Presbyterian Homes and Services (NCPHS)  			 WellElder Program</b>. The WellElder program was created by NCPHS to help  			 reduce the need of residents in their HUD-subsidized senior housing to move to  			 board and care homes or nursing homes to obtain a higher level of care. The  			 WellElder program provides an onsite health educator (Registered Nurse or  			 Licensed Vocational Nurse) to work directly with residents to provide  			 one-on-one consultations and health assessments; advocacy on the  			 residents behalf with doctors, insurance providers, pharmacies and other  			 health services; referrals to medical services; medication reminders;  			 health-related classes and group programs; and information about medical costs  			 and insurance resources. The health educator is also trained to work with the  			 propertys service coordinator to refer eligible residents to the home and  			 community-based services they need to remain in their own apartments. Since the  			 housing provider is not the service provider it has been exempted from the  			 states health facility regulations. Importantly, the participating  			 housing communities have been able to get the costs of the health educator in  			 their operating budget. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>The Osceola County Council on Agings Integrated Housing  			 and Services Strategy</b>. The Kissimmee, Florida, based Council on Aging has  			 developed a consolidated AHPS strategy that provides residents access to a  			 comprehensive range of health and supportive services. The Council is both the  			 conduit OAA funds and the owner and manager of four affordable senior housing  			 properties funded through a combination of the Section 202 program, LIHTC,  			 rural development loans, and loans from the state. The dual role of housing and  			 services provider enables the Council to establish relationships with a host of  			 aging organizations, health providers, and community and volunteer groups.  			 Through these partnerships, the Council is able to offer residents living in  			 their housing properties everything from case management, transportation,  			 meals, discounted commodities, homemaking, home repair, and chore services to  			 health and wellness services and personal care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Presentation Senior Housings Co-location Strategy</b>.  			 Through collaboration between Mercy Housing California and North &amp; South  			 Market Adult Day Health, Presentation has integrated affordable senior housing  			 with adult day health services to support resident desires to age in place.  			 Located in San Francisco, the Section 202 property has 93 apartments, 60 of  			 which are targeted to very low-income frail elders. Approximately half of the  			 building residents participate in the day health program, which provides a  			 variety of health and wellness services such as daily nursing care, social work  			 services, physical, occupational and speech therapy, podiatry services, mental  			 health support, case management, transportation, and a daily meal. Those not  			 enrolled in the adult day health program receive support and services from a  			 service coordinator, as well as a variety of community organizations. Almost  			 three quarters of residents receive services from the In Home Supportive  			 Services program, a Medicaid-funded program that provides homemaker and  			 personal care services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> The Portland Public Housing/Congregate Housing Services Program  			 Partnership</b>. The Housing Authority of Portland and Multnomah County Aging  			 and Disability Services are collaborating at four public housing sites to link  			 senior residents to the services they need to continue independent living.  			 Through the partnership, senior residents have access to service coordination,  			 evening meals, housekeeping assistance, personal care, medication management,  			 senior companions, transportation, and health and wellness programs. Services  			 are funded through the HUD Congregate Housing Services Program (a grant program  			 that no longer funds new programs, but continues to fund existing grantees),  			 with required matching funds coming from the Medicaid home and community-based  			 services waiver program and participant fees (approximately 15% of adjusted  			 income). Services are also provided through OAA programs, in addition to  			 in-kind donations from community organizations and volunteers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Peter Sanborn Place Comprehensive Health-Related and Supported  			 Services Strategy</b>. Peter Sanborns commitment as an independent senior  			 housing provider is to enable residents to live in their property for the  			 duration of their aging years. Located in Reading, Massachusetts, the housing  			 community initiated one of the first refinancing of a HUD Section 202 property  			 in the country to free up resources for building repairs, renovations, and  			 resident services. Peter Sanborn rehabilitated the apartments making them more  			 accessible for seniors with increasing disabilities with features such as  			 walk-in showers, raised lavatories, keyless entry door systems, improved  			 lighting, etc. To ensure the availability of personal care to residents in  			 need, as well as to the surrounding community, Peter Sanborn also created a  			 sister agency, Sanborn Home Care. Sanborn Home Care provides case management  			 and service coordination; personal care, including assistance with showering,  			 grooming, toileting, meal preparation, feeding, mobility, and medication  			 monitoring; homemaker services such as housekeeping, shopping, and laundry;  			 transportation to medical appointments; companion and respite care; and  			 assistance with local errands and other tasks. Peter Sanborn also contracts  			 with the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) for nursing care and rehabilitation  			 therapy and maintains strong partnerships with state and community agencies.  			 Services are paid for through a variety of methods, including self-pay, state  			 programs, Medicaid, and Medicare. Peter Sanborn gives priority to seniors  			 needing a high level of care, a population they were able to target after  			 getting HUD to agree to such priorities in their tenant selection plan.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>Cathedral Square Corporations (CSC) Co-location Services  			 Linkage Model</b>. CSC manages 15 senior communities in Vermont. It looks for  			 opportunities to co-locate its properties with other entities that can provide  			 resources for its residents, with some properties sharing space with an  			 assisted living residence, an adult day center, or a senior center. For  			 example, Cathedral Square Senior Living (CSSL), a Section 202 senior housing  			 property, is co-located with an assisted living program. If a resident needs  			 help with basic activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and  			 toileting, CSSL can license their apartment as an assisting living unit and  			 bring services to them, rather than making them move to the nursing wing.  			 Should they no longer require help with basic living activities, the apartment  			 reverts to independent living. Independent living residents at CSSL may also  			 receive support through the states Housing and Supportive Services  			 program, which funds service coordination and case management, in addition to  			 wellness activities and homemaker services. These services, as well as the  			 assisted living services, are provided directly by CSC staff. Residents of  			 other CSC properties can purchase homemaker services from CSC. At some  			 properties, CSC funds a VNA nurse to visit the site weekly to provide nursing  			 consultation and wellness services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC)/Georgia Institute on Aging  			 Partnership to Connect Seniors to Services Through Technology</b>. ARC,  			 Atlantas area agency on aging, has developed AgeWise Connection, a  			 comprehensive computer database to connect seniors to the array of aging  			 services available in the Atlanta region. ARC partners with the Georgia  			 Institute on Aging, the educational arm of the AAHSA state affiliate in  			 Georgia, to offer AgeWise as a service to senior residents in participating  			 publicly subsidized housing communities. For example, a resident can use the  			 system to search for an adult day center in their neighborhood at a specific  			 daily rate they can afford. Housing staff also can use Care Options, developed  			 by ARC as an online care coordination system. The database allows staff to know  			 which services residents are receiving, enabling them to improve services  			 coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of services. </p>

</ul><h2><a name="lesson" id="lesson">V. LESSONS LEARNED</a></h2>
<p> Workshop participants were asked to spend most of their time discussing  		the merits of linking the residents of affordable senior housing to needed  		services allowing them to age in place. These discussions focused on  		identifying the factors contributing to effective AHPS linkages, the practice  		and regulatory barriers that get in the way and how to overcome them, and  		funding opportunities and options. The following section summarizes participant  		observations and conclusions. It should be noted that no attempt was made to  		reach a consensus on any particular topic. </p>
<h3> What Should an AHPS Model Look Like?</h3>
<p> The workshops, and the research leading up to them, identified numerous  		approaches to linking residents of affordable senior housing to needed  		services. No one approach or model was endorsed as the right one  		for all situations and all organizational and regulatory environments. Some  		participants believed the housing provider should also be the aging services  		provider, directly employing caregiving staff who will serve residents, as is  		typically seen in an ALF model. Some thought it most effective if the housing  		sponsor also controlled most of the funding for services, as might be the case  		if the housing sponsor is also an area agency on aging. Others believed that  		the housing entity should stay out of the service delivery business and instead  		serve as the link between the resident and health and aging services agencies  		in the community. Some participants believed that services should be provided  		in the same building as the housing community, while others believed this was  		too constraining.</p>
<p> For the most part, participants agreed that a wide range of models  		could be effective, and that the approach selected should grow out of the  		states regulatory environment, the capacity of the individual housing  		provider, and the services richness of the surrounding community. Participants  		also largely agreed that the prerequisite for any successful linkage model was  		the availability of a service coordinator to act as an intermediary between the  		resident and the services system, helping to identify needs and arrange and  		coordinate services. Workshop attendees also thought it was important to  		evaluate and compare the outcomes of various AHPS models and the extent to  		which they reduce the use of more expensive assisted living and nursing home  		care and improve resident quality of life. </p>
<p> In discussing the desirable characteristics of AHPS models,  		participants also emphasized that new models need to reflect the changing  		characteristics of seniors seeking affordable housing. For example, some  		housing providers are seeing a growing incidence of residents experiencing  		significant mental health conditions. They also note that more new residents  		are coming with pre-existing disabilities. In fact, they believed that many new  		residents are now seeking out senior housing because of the availability of  		services. Several attendees also pointed out that the future cohort of low and  		moderate-income seniors may not be as likely to own their own homes as  		todays seniors and, therefore, the demand for affordable rental housing  		offering services will increase. </p>
<p> Workshop attendees also discussed the importance of looking beyond  		public funding sources, particularly Medicaid, in developing supportive housing  		models. While Medicaid is obviously a key player in reimbursing a wide range of  		health-related and supportive services, participants were convinced that it  		could not be the sole funding source for a successful AHPS strategy. One  		concern is the lack of predictability of Medicaid funding levels from year to  		year, making it difficult for housing providers and their residents to know who  		will be eligible for services and what will be covered. In addition, many  		residents of affordable senior housing are not poor enough to qualify for  		Medicaid, yet they struggle to buy needed services out of their own pockets and  		often fall through the cracks. Going a step further, participants said that  		linkage models should be designed around resident needs, rather than allowing  		funding sources to drive what services are offered and how they are delivered.  		</p>
<h3> What Services Should Be Provided?</h3>
<p> Most workshop participants thought AHPS models should provide residents  		entree` to a full range of health and supportive services. Transportation  		services ranked high on the priority list, with several attendees questioning  		the capacity of some housing providers to provide or arrange access to needed  		transportation. There was less agreement that the range of available services  		should include primary health care and chronic care management, as laid out in  		the IFAS ideal. Some believed this type of model only worked in association  		with a PACE program, which they perceived as too complex and risky for most  		housing providers. Others noted a growing experience with house  		calls type programs, where physicians and nurse practitioners offered a  		range of primary and preventative services to elderly persons in their own  		homes. Such a model might be ideally suited to affordable senior housing  		settings where large numbers of seniors live in close proximity. </p>
<p> Workshop attendees also recognized that housing providers vary in their  		willingness and capacity to support significantly frail and disabled residents,  		particularly if some services must be available on a 24/7 basis and providers  		have to meet unscheduled needs. While selected affordable housing properties  		may be able to support older adults who need a nursing home level of care, this  		is not likely to be the norm for the foreseeable future. Particular concern was  		expressed about the capacity of affordable housing providers to address the  		needs of seniors with moderate to severe Alzheimers disease or other  		serious mental health conditions. Developing strategies for serving residents  		with cognitive problems was considered an important research and technical  		assistance priority.</p>
<h3> What are the Prerequisites of a Successful  		Strategy?</h3>
<p> Many AHPS programs have been initiated by low-income housing providers,  		aging services providers, and by public agencies at the state and community  		level. The development of successful programs, however, has largely been the  		result of individual efforts, rather than widespread and systemic efforts. Many  		workshop participants observed that bridging the affordable housing and health  		and aging services worlds to create a comprehensive support system requires  		strong leadership and organizations with a do what it takes  		attitude. All of the AHPS programs profiled at the workshops started with the  		premise that their organizations mission was to help lower-income seniors  		age in place. The leaders of these programs were committed to providing  		residents and their families a choice about whether to remain in an independent  		housing setting with needed supports or to move to another living arrangement  		where a more intensive level of care was available. According to workshop  		presenters and participants, a do what it takes attitude involves a  		number of elements, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p> <b>The commitment of housing providers to a broader role</b>.  			 Housing communities that are committed to enabling residents to age in place  			 must see themselves as more than property managers collecting rent and  			 maintaining the physical plant. In addition to a service coordinator, the  			 property manager or sponsor must be prepared to make additional financial and  			 human resource investments to fill critical gaps in the community service  			 system. Housing providers must also be flexible enough to allow residents to  			 refuse services and even to make bad choices. Learning how to support residents  			 to take some measure of risk is an important part of maintaining an independent  			 living environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Partnerships between the housing provider and the surrounding  			 community</b>. Every model highlighted in the workshop was built around a  			 complex and rich array of community partnerships. Most workshop participants  			 seemed to believe that AHPS strategies were cost effective because they largely  			 drew on resources already available in the community. In most cases, the  			 ability to negotiate effective linkages between the affordable housing  			 community, aging and health services agencies, volunteer and charitable  			 organizations, businesses, community leaders, elected officials, and relevant  			 public agencies was deemed the most important attribute of a successful  			 program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Persistence and creativity</b>. The regulatory environments and  			 funding streams governing subsidized housing and health and aging services  			 operate independently of one another. In most cases, the focal point for  			 pulling these pieces together is likely to be organizations and individuals at  			 the community level committed to meeting the service needs of low-income older  			 adults. The workshop experience suggests that successful organizations are  			 typically in a proactive mode of seeking out new community  			 partners, networking with both policy and practice stakeholders at the state  			 and community level, staying on top of new funding opportunities, and working  			 around policy and regulatory barriers. As one presenter mentioned, housing  			 providers often get hung up on regulations that seem to block what they want to  			 do, so they stop. Other providers find ways to structure their programs to be  			 compliant with the regulatory requirements, they obtain waivers of troublesome  			 regulations, or they are able to get such regulations changed because they know  			 how to work the system to achieve their goals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> The need for a catalyst</b>. Bridging affordable housing and  			 services on a wider scale requires a champion or catalyst to bring very  			 disparate worlds together at many different levels. An organization or an  			 individual must take ownership of the goal, identify and convene stakeholders,  			 facilitate information gathering, mobilize resources, and coordinate on-going  			 activities. Without a catalyst, even well-intended and widely supported efforts  			 to launch AHPS projects may fall through the cracks. Workshop participants had  			 a variety of opinions of who should play this role, ranging from state  			 agencies, to aging services and housing providers, to groups such as local AARP  			 chapters or the AAHSA state affiliate. The owner or  			 catalyst will be different depending upon the particular state  			 and/or community involved, the leadership capacity of individuals and  			 organizations, and the origins of the goal of enabling affordable housing  			 residents to age in place. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3> What are the Obstacles and How Can they be  		Overcome?</h3>
<p> The workshops demonstrated that linking affordable senior housing and  		services is doable, and is widely perceived to be beneficial to senior  		residents. Participants also identified a variety of obstacles that need to be  		addressed to achieve more widespread implementation of promising linkage  		strategies, as well as ways to overcome them.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b> Licensing/regulation</b>. In the eyes of many workshop  			 attendees, the level of health and supportive services that can be offered by  			 affordable housing providers is unnecessarily restricted by licensing  			 requirements. Numerous housing providers expressed concern that if they push  			 the envelope in gaining access to services on behalf of their residents, they  			 open themselves up to licensure requirements. In California, for example,  			 licensure laws prevent senior housing providers from directly providing  			 supportive services. They are limited to information and referral and services  			 coordination. Such regulations are perceived as preventing housing providers  			 from creating comprehensive support programs for their residents, leaving them  			 for the most part to piece together services from willing community providers.  			 </p>
<p> A number of housing providers expressed strong opposition to  			 becoming licensed caregiving facilities. They fear that regulatory requirements  			 will increase their costs, making it difficult or impossible to serve their  			 resident base without becoming dependent on Medicaid, a funding stream that  			 cannot be consistently counted on and for which many of their residents are  			 ineligible. Some also cited the rigidity of many regulatory frameworks, which  			 makes it hard to respond to changing resident needs. For example, some state  			 assisted living programs require providers to offer a highly structured service  			 package to a narrowly defined population. Such an approach is at odds with the  			 mission of most affordable housing providers who serve a diverse population of  			 residents, some of whom are healthy and need little or no service and others  			 who are significantly disabled and have substantial personal care needs.  			 Housing providers at the workshop were far more comfortable operating in a  			 services system that allows residents to age in place and where services can be  			 tailored to meet changing needs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Liability</b>. Sustaining residents with higher acuity levels in  			 independent housing also raised a number of liability and insurance issues.  			 Providing services to residents may put housing providers in legal and  			 financial jeopardy should a resident receiving services experience an adverse  			 event. Insuring against potential lawsuits is also difficult. A risk manager at  			 one workshop pointed out that the insurance industry has little or no  			 experience in underwriting housing communities that provide services to frail  			 or disabled residents. He urged housing providers to get involved with  			 underwriters and to help them create an experience base, warning that otherwise  			 they will use a nursing home rate-setting model that could prove unaffordable.  			 Some participants also noted that providing access to supportive services could  			 help allay a providers liability concerns by increasing resident safety  			 and preventing property damage and unsanitary conditions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Consumer choice</b>. Housing providers who do support frail  			 residents with higher needs must also balance liability concerns with consumer  			 choice. In the IFAS concept of an ideal housing with services  			 system, residents are free to accept or reject services. Many workshop  			 participants expressed concerns about granting consumers the right to reject a  			 service if, as a result, their health or safety is compromised. Should a  			 resident reject a needed services or make a poor choice, the provider could be  			 liable. Housing providers also told of being caught between the wishes of a  			 resident to reject services and the expectations of his or her family that the  			 housing property ensure the safety of their relative. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Fair housing laws</b>. Many workshop participants stated that  			 fair housing laws cause confusion for housing providers because, as one  			 participant put it, housing with services environments are neither fish  			 nor fowl. For example, some workshop participants would like to give  			 priority to prospective residents with higher levels of frailty and/or  			 disability. Yet, some believed, fair housing laws can prevent housing providers  			 from admitting persons on the waiting list in any order other than a  			 first-come-first-served basis. Some providers did point out that they were able  			 to obtain waivers from HUD that allowed them to target at least some applicants  			 with higher levels of need. Issues were also raised about the unintended effect  			 of fair housing laws on a providers ability to discuss with prospective  			 and current residents their needs for health-related and supportive services,  			 believing that such discussions could be perceived as a violation of these  			 laws. Some providers also worry about the implications of reasonable  			 accommodation requirements if they provide a service enhanced environment. In  			 this case, the concern is that they will be forced to provide more and more  			 services and supports, at great cost to them, as residents grow accustomed to  			 having their needs met within the housing community. It was also noted that  			 linking residents to supportive services can help protect a housing provider  			 against fair housing violations since these laws prohibit them from evicting  			 residents simply because they are not able to live independently. <b><i>See  			 HUDs response to these concerns and clarification of fair housing laws as  			 they apply to AHPS at the <a href="lessons-workshops-affordable-housing-plus-services-strategies-low-and-modest-income-seniors.html#append">end</a> of this  			 document</i></b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Silo mentality</b>. Housing and aging services providers,  			 regulators, and policy makers usually operate solely within their own world and  			 typically know little about each others programs or policies. In some of  			 the workshops, it was believed to be the first time that representatives from  			 the states housing, health, and aging services agencies had been together  			 in the same room. The failure to consider the implications of affordable  			 housing policies for meeting the services needs of aging residents, and vice  			 versa, creates a variety of problems. For example: </p>
<ul><li>Housing and aging services programs have different eligibility  				criteria. A senior housing resident with significant disability may qualify for  				subsidized housing based on their income, but may not qualify for Medicaid,  				which funds personal care and other home and community-based services that  				might keep him or her out of a more expensive institutional setting. A number  				of workshop participants spoke of their residents being in no mans  				land because they do not qualify for Medicaid, but lack the resources to  				pay for services out-of-pocket.</li>
<li>The LIHTC, Section 202, and many state-funded housing programs  				require sponsors and investors to show that services will be available to  				residents; however, they rarely allow or sharply limit, funding to be used for  				direct services (service coordinators are the exception and may be funded  				within the operating budgets of Section 202 and LIHTC properties). </li>
<li>The Medicaid home and community-based services waiver program,  				the largest source of funding for personal care and other supportive services  				needed by lower-income older adults with physical and/or cognitive impairments,  				is only available to individuals who already need a nursing home level of care.  				Most publicly subsidized housing residents do not meet these criteria.</li>
<li>Without a waiver from HUD, fair housing laws do not allow housing  				providers who are able to offer a wide range of services to establish admission  				policies that target older adults with high levels of service need--the very  				individuals who may most benefit from a service-enriched housing  				environment.</li>
</ul><p> Workshop attendees placed high priority on convincing stakeholders  			 from both the fields of housing and aging services to get into the act as  			 health, long-term care, aging, and low-income housing policies are developed  			 and funding levels are set at the state and local level. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Funding</b>. Almost all workshop participants believed that  			 funding for both affordable housing and resident services is inadequate to meet  			 current needs and, in many cases, is declining. For example, the Section 202  			 program has been level funded for the past few years. With rising development  			 costs, this translates into fewer actual new units each year. In the face of  			 decreased funding from traditional sources, developers must learn to stitch  			 together multiple funding sources (and to work with multiple layers of  			 requirements and regulations) to complete the development of new senior housing  			 communities. The year-to-year uncertainty of funding levels for certain  			 states share of the Medicaid program also raised concerns among many  			 participants. Several stated that that while Medicaid funding continued to be a  			 critical source of services funding, housing plus services programs must have a  			 much broader funding base to succeed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Limited housing provider understanding, commitment, and  			 capacity</b>. According to workshop attendees, many affordable housing  			 providers continue to see themselves as only responsible for traditional  			 housing functions--leasing, collecting rents, maintaining the physical plant,  			 etc. They do not see themselves as architects or even supporters of a housing  			 environment that can adapt to the changing needs of increasingly aged and frail  			 residents. While growing numbers of senior housing sponsors hire service  			 coordinators, housing staff may not perceive any responsibility for enhancing  			 or even supporting the coordinators role of helping residents age in  			 place. In addition, some participants observed that many housing managers and  			 sponsors viewed their jobs as operating independent housing, which they  			 interpret as housing for people who do not need services or supports to live in  			 their apartment. If they need help they should move, or organize it themselves.  			 Discussion also highlighted many housing providers lack of knowledge of  			 the health and supportive services resources available in their community or  			 how they might link their residents to these resources. In addition, not all  			 housing providers were perceived to have the skills and training necessary to  			 build partnerships with community organizations to bring supportive services to  			 residents. Some thought that a new set of administrators with different skill  			 sets would be required. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Resident opposition</b>. Several housing providers said it is  			 the residents themselves who may oppose keeping their frailer neighbors in the  			 property. These residents do not want to be reminded that they too may loose  			 some of their independence as they age. There may be even a tipping point when  			 the property begins to look too much like a nursing home, an environment they  			 wish to avoid. Providers also face challenges in convincing some residents to  			 accept services, even if they desperately need them. Residents may be in denial  			 that their health is declining or they may fear eviction if they admit to  			 needing support to live safely on their own. Overcoming this challenge requires  			 sustained involvement of residents in planning the AHPS program, as well as  			 considerable resident education. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Affordability</b>. Workshop discussants also addressed issues of  			 affordability if services were added to the housing community, adding that  			 services programs need to be designed to minimize costs to the payer, whether  			 it is the resident, the housing provider, or a public entity. One housing  			 provider told of helping to make resident services more affordable by working  			 with a home health care agency to break down the increments of services they  			 provide to residents to 15-minute intervals. Residents do not always need, nor  			 can they necessarily afford, two or four-hour blocks of time. If they can  			 purchase only the amount of time they really need, out-of-pocket costs may be  			 reduced. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Nursing home influence</b>. Participants had differing thoughts  			 on the potential influence of nursing homes on the diffusion of AHPS  			 strategies. Some felt nursing homes have such strong influence over the  			 long-term care system that they would oppose efforts to expand housing with  			 services on a wider scale. Others thought nursing homes could be valuable  			 partners. For example, nursing homes could look for opportunities to  			 collaborate with housing providers to better manage their beds to keep the less  			 frail seniors out of their facility and keep their acuity levels high.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><h3> What are the Funding Opportunities?</h3>
<p> Workshop members identified funding as the primary issue facing housing  		and aging services providers and states committed to developing AHPS systems.  		There was general agreement that traditional funding sources such as the  		Section 202 program and Medicaid are not likely to be reliable sources on which  		to build in the future. A wide range of potential funding strategies was  		suggested, including:</p>
<p><b> New Public Initiatives</b></p>
<ul><li> Creating a state tax credit or bond program to fund resident  		  services as well as affordable housing. </li>
<li> Developing health-related and supportive services savings  		  accounts where pretax contributions of housing providers and residents  		  could accumulate over time.</li>
</ul><p><b> Housing Provider Strategies</b></p>
<ul><li> Developing mixed-income properties where the costs of services for  		  lower-income residents are cross subsidized by wealthier ones, as in nursing  		  homes.</li>
<li> Developing win-win partnerships between housing  		  communities and health care entities. These partnerships can enhance resident  		  access to primary care and chronic care management and increase referrals to  		  cooperating providers and improve their ability to monitor and manage the  		  residents care. </li>
</ul><p><b> Education and Marketing Opportunities </b></p>
<ul><li> Documenting and disseminating the probable return on  		  investment for housing providers if they contribute their own resources  		  to resident services.</li>
<li> Educating service coordinators on how to reduce services costs  		  (e.g., capitalizing on economies of scale, working with community providers to  		  deliver services in smaller, more affordable increments, etc.).</li>
<li> Documenting the benefits of renting out commercial space for needed  		  resident services to housing communities.</li>
<li> Encouraging wider participation in the HUD-funded service  		  coordinator program.</li>
<li> Educating Section 202 housing providers about the potential of  		  refinancing old Section 202 loans to invest in services.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="next" id="next">VI. WORKSHOP OUTCOMES AND NEXT STEPS</a></h2>
<p> The most important outcome of the workshops was that it brought  		together a variety of stakeholders representing housing and aging services and  		provided a forum in which they could begin to identify areas of common  		interest. Several ideas for next steps received widespread support,  		including:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Resident and Family Education</b>. Residents and their families  			 are often not aware of the service opportunities in their community. As one  			 participant put it, many see services as a light switch, which is either  			 on or off. This participant thought the concept of a  			 dimmer switch was more appropriate. Residents and families need to  			 be educated to seek out appropriate services as they are needed rather than  			 waiting for a crisis when it may be too late to maintain independent living.  			 Service coordinators, AAHSA state affiliates, area agencies on aging, AARP  			 chapters, the Red Cross and local Alzheimers groups could all be venues  			 for developing and disseminating awareness and educational materials on the  			 communitys services resources to residents and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Provider Education and Technical Assistance</b>. Participants  			 also emphasized the value of developing a technical assistance program for  			 housing and aging services providers to supply them with detailed information  			 on how the housing and aging services systems work, the characteristics of best  			 practices that support effective program development and implementation, how  			 regulatory constraints can be overcome, and findings from applied research and  			 evaluation studies that help to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of  			 various AHPS approaches. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Broad Awareness Campaign</b>. Participants also saw the need for  			 a broader awareness campaign to increase understanding of the characteristics  			 and needs of the aging residents of affordable housing and the potential  			 benefits of linking them to health-related and supportive services. Some  			 observed that while funding for home and community-based services for older  			 adults and the disabled has substantially increased over the past several  			 decades, little is known about the extent to which the aging residents of  			 subsidized housing have benefited. Many workshop attendees perceived that this  			 group has been left out --that advocates and policy officials have simply not  			 had subsidized housing residents on their radar screens. One suggestion was to  			 try to move AHPS strategies onto the agenda of the Conference of Mayors since  			 municipalities are now dealing with the problem of poor seniors unable to  			 maintain independent living. Workshop attendees also suggested that the role of  			 AHPS in the larger service system needs to be considered as part of the  			 discussion about future directions for health care policy. It was also  			 suggested that advocates for affordable housing adopt a broader platform that  			 includes the importance of developing both supply and services linkages.  			 Advocates for the homeless have been quite effective in disseminating this  			 message on behalf of their constituency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Replicating Workshops in a Rural Area</b>. A number of workshop  			 attendees pointed out that AHPS models that work in urban areas are likely to  			 be quite different than those that work for rural communities. It was suggested  			 that one or more workshops be held to highlight the experience of rural housing  			 providers who are attempting to link their older residents to needed services,  			 the special challenges they face, and ways that these challenges are met. A  			 partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and/or state agricultural  			 extension services might be a good way of organizing such a workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Foster Collaboration Between Market Rate and Affordable Housing  			 Providers and Aging Services Agencies</b>. The experience of subsidized housing  			 providers dominated the workshops. IFAS staff was unable to identify more than  			 a handful of AHPS examples in the private market. Future work should be  			 directed at identifying and supporting housing cooperatives, mobile home parks,  			 neighborhood-based NORCs, SROs, shared housing, and other market-rate housing  			 arrangements to develop needed linkages to health-related and supportive  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>State-Specific Next Steps</b>. At each workshop, participants  			 from the same states were given some opportunity to identify state-specific  			 concerns and potential next steps. The goal was to identify a few concrete  			 actions to which stakeholders within each of the represented states could  			 commit, rather than the development of a detailed work plan. Stakeholders in  			 Washington have formed the Senior Housing + Services Alliance of  			 Washington that has been meeting regularly to promote community  			 partnerships to expand AHPS options. Participants from Atlanta also expressed  			 interest in forming a working group to promote ideas generated at the workshop,  			 including expanding a successful partnership between an Atlanta area hospital  			 and four senior housing properties. Attendees from Rhode Island are also  			 planning a series of meetings with key stakeholders to outline possible next  			 steps. The McGregor Foundation has provided a grant to pull together the ideas  			 that resulted from the Cleveland workshop and to facilitate stakeholder  			 collaboration to implement them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Applied Research and Evaluation</b>. Most workshop members agreed  			 that AHPS options were unlikely to be implemented on a wide scale without  			 demonstrating their effectiveness in improving resident quality of life and  			 reducing the unnecessary use of more expensive health and long-term care  			 services. Participants identified several important issues that need to be  			 fleshed out to garner greater support for expanding AHPS programs. For  			 example:</p>
<ul><li> How many senior residents of affordable housing arrangements  				want and need health and supportive services to maintain independent  				living?</li>
<li> Do AHPS strategies increase the duration of independent living  				and decrease transfers to assisted living and nursing home facilities without  				compromising quality?</li>
<li> What types of strategies work best (produce the most positive  				outcomes) and what are the prerequisites for effective implementation?</li>
<li> Are AHPS programs cost-effective from the perspective of housing  				providers and public policy makers?</li>
<li> What regulatory and practice barriers impede widespread  				replication and how can they be overcome?</li>
<li> What new models are likely to work best in the future?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">VII. CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p> In the eyes of the authors of this report, the study of AHPS  		underscores the potential value of AHPS strategies for meeting some of the  		long-term care needs of low and modest-income older adults. The study has shown  		us that committed individuals working at the community level are able to  		overcome fragmented funding and bureaucratic and policy resistance to implement  		AHPS programs in all parts of the country, often on a shoestring budget.  		However, before more systematic and widespread replication of AHPS is likely,  		the study highlights a number of themes for further consideration. First,  		greater numbers of affordable housing providers must be convinced of the  		benefits of supporting older residents who want to age in place  		rather than moving to a higher level of care. Second, the capacity of  		affordable housing providers to respond to resident services needs must be  		nurtured and strengthened--by matching them with other more experienced  		providers and developing and disseminating technical assistance tools. Third,  		AHPS models and practices must be documented and evaluated, showing how they  		work, under what conditions, and with what impact on residents, providers, and  		costs. Finally, governmental and private funders should be encouraged to  		support the evaluation of new AHPS models. </p>
<h2><a name="append" id="append">APPENDIX: HUDs Clarification of Fair Housing  		Laws as They Apply to AHPS Programs</a></h2>
<ol><li>
<p><b>If a provider is offering housing which also includes supportive  			 services, what kinds of questions can a provider ask prospective tenants about  			 their health or disability status?</b></p>
<p> Under the federal Fair Housing Act, it is generally unlawful for a  			 housing provider to: (1) ask if an applicant for a dwelling has a disability or  			 if a person intending to reside in a dwelling or anyone associated with an  			 applicant or resident has a disability, or (2) ask about the nature or severity  			 of such persons' disabilities. Housing providers may, however, make the  			 following inquiries, provided these inquiries are made of all applicants,  			 including those with and without disabilities:</p>
<ul><li> An inquiry into an applicants ability to meet the  				requirements of tenancy.</li>
<li> An inquiry to determine if an applicant is a current illegal  				abuser or addict of a controlled substance.</li>
<li> An inquiry to determine if an applicant qualifies for a dwelling  				legally available only to persons with a disability or to persons with a  				particular type of disability.</li>
<li>An inquiry to determine if an applicant qualifies for housing  				that is legally available on a priority basis to persons with disabilities or  				to persons with a particular disability.</li>
</ul><p> Courts have held that providers should not inquire as to whether a  			 prospective tenant can live independently, as that inquiry  			 encompasses information which may be unrelated to the eligibility requirements  			 for tenancy, and calls for inquiries into the nature and severity of a  			 persons disability. The inquiry should focus on eligibility for the unit  			 and the ability to meet the requirements of tenancy (i.e., maintenance of the  			 unit, payment of rent, etc.). </p>
<p> Nothing in the Act prohibits providers who offer services from  			 asking applicants interested in the services to demonstrate that they qualify  			 for those services. Housing providers making such inquiries should ask only for  			 the specific information they actually need to determine eligibility for the  			 services, rather than making broad sweeping inquiries about a persons  			 medical history. If the housing provider offers services for persons with  			 disabilities through contractors or other independent enteritis, then only the  			 service provider should be making the inquiries related to qualifying for the  			 services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In planning for the provision of supportive services, how should  			 a provider go about surveying residents needs?</b></p>
<p> Providers may ask tenants to participate in voluntary surveys about  			 services that they would like the provider to offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What criteria are needed for a provider to evict tenants whose  			 service needs can no longer be met?</b></p>
<p> It is lawful under the Fair Housing Act to refuse to rent or to  			 evict a person with a disability because he or she cannot meet the requirements  			 of the lease (which includes the ability to care for a dwelling apartment and  			 to pay rent). If a resident with a disability needs services that are not part  			 of the housing program to enable him or her to meet the requirements of the  			 lease, and the provider cannot meet those needs, then it would be the  			 residents responsibility to obtain those services if he or she wishes to  			 remain in the unit. </p>
<p> If a resident qualifies as a person with a disability under federal  			 civil rights laws including the Fair Housing Act and where applicable, Section  			 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, then the resident has the right to  			 request a reasonable accommodation to policies, practices, and procedures of  			 the housing provider. If a provider has a practice of limiting the kinds of  			 services that a resident may use while living in the unit, then the resident  			 with a disability may make a request for a reasonable accommodation that the  			 provider change that policy to allow him or her to obtain and pay for the  			 additional services that are needed. A housing provider must grant the request  			 unless doing so is an undue financial and administrative burden or a  			 fundamental alteration of the housing program. For a full discussion of the  			 Fair Housing Acts definition of person with disability and the right to  			 receive a reasonable accommodation, see, the Joint Statement of the Department  			 of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice: Reasonable  			 Accommodations under the Fair Housing Act, dated May 17, 2004. This joint  			 statement is available at <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/disabilities">http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/disabilities</a>  			 .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Once services are provided to prevent institutionalization of a  			 frail resident, do federal civil rights laws require the housing provider to  			 find subsequent services to maintain that resident in their own home?</b></p>
<p> The Fair Housing Act does not require housing providers to provide  			 requested accommodations that constitute fundamental alterations of their  			 programs. Thus, if a resident requested skilled care nursing services in their  			 home as a reasonable accommodation, and the provider only provided limited  			 services such as meals, then the provider would not be required to provide the  			 skilled care nursing services, because such a request would constitute a  			 fundamental alteration of the providers program. See Joint Statement of  			 the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice:  			 Reasonable Accommodations under the Fair Housing Act, dated May 17, 2004.  			 </p>
