<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h4>A.Background</h4>
<p>Initially, the term  "family preservation" was  applied to Homebuilders, a foster care placement prevention  program developed in 1974 in Tacoma, Washington.  The  Homebuilders model called for short-term, time-limited  services provided to the entire family in their home.   Services were provided to families with children who were at  risk of an imminent placement into foster care.  </p>
<p>The program was based, in part, on crisis intervention  theory.  This theory holds that families experiencing a  crisis -- that is, about to have a child placed in foster  care -- would be more amenable to receiving services and  learning new behaviors.  Early exponents of the theory also  believed that crises were experienced for a short time  (i.e., six weeks) before they disappear or are resolved.&lt;1&gt;   Social learning theory also played a part in defining the  Homebuilders model.  Social learning theory rejects the  belief that changes in thinking and feeling must precede  changes in behavior.  Instead, behavior, beliefs and  expectations influence each other in a reciprocal manner.</p>
<p>Initially, the program was expected to serve families  with older youth who were referred from mental health  agencies.  Subsequently, the program was used to serve  families with children 0-18 who were referred from the child  welfare agency.  Key program characteristics included:   contact with the family within 24 hours of the crisis;  caseload sizes of one or two families per worker; service  duration of four to six weeks; provision of both concrete  services and counseling, with an emphasis on techniques that  change behaviors and responses among family members; staff  availability to families 24 hours per day/seven days per  week; and an average of 20 hours of service per family per  week.  In addition, the program was characterized by a  philosophy of treating families with respect, emphasizing  the strengths of family members, and providing both  counseling and concrete services.</p>
<p>Since the early 1970s, the term "family  preservation" has been used to describe a variety of  programs that are intended to provide services to children  and families who are experiencing serious problems that may  eventually lead to the placement of children in foster care  or otherwise result in the dissolution of the family unit.   Some of these programs differed in their theoretical  underpinnings.  For example, the FAMILIES program begun in  Iowa in 1974 was based on family systems theory.   Applications of this theory focused on the way family  members interact with one another and attempted to change  the way in which the family functions as a whole.  Under the  original program in Iowa, teams of workers carried a  caseload of 10 to 12 families whom they saw in the families'  homes for an average of four and one-half months.  Both  concrete and therapeutic services were provided and the  principles of working with families in a respectful and  positive manner were emphasized.&lt;2&gt; &lt;3&gt;</p>
<p>The Intensive Family Services Program which began in  Oregon, was based upon a family treatment model.  It relied  less on the provision of concrete and supportive services  and more on family therapy.  Services were provided in an  office as well as in the home and were less intensive than  in the Homebuilders model.  Workers carried a caseload of  approximately 11 families.  Services were provided for 90  days with weekly follow-up services provided for an average  of three to five and one-half months.&lt;4&gt;</p>
<p>Over the years, other states adopted existing family  preservation models.  Some of these programs were slight  variations on the basic Homebuilders model, while others  adapted the Iowa or Oregon approach to family preservation.   Although these programs differed in treatment theory, the  level of intensity of services provided, and the length of  services, they shared a common philosophy of family centered  services including focusing on family strengths, involving  families in determining their case plan goals, serving the  entire family, and treating family members with respect.</p>
<p>In addition, some programs began to provide services to  families whose children had been placed in foster care and  had a case plan goal of reunification.  Often these programs  followed the same service model that was used for placement  prevention -- the difference resting solely in the foster  care status of the children served.  Reunification efforts  have received considerably less attention than the placement  prevention programs in the documented literature;  nevertheless, they represent a related effort to reduce the  length of stay in foster care and to prevent re-entry into  care in cases where prevention of placement was not  initially possible.  </p>
<p>In 1993, Congress passed legislation establishing title  IV, part B-2 of the Social Security Act, creating funding  for family preservation and family support programs.  The  legislation does not endorse any single program model for  family preservation services.  Instead, states are allowed  to determine their own program models with the broad  definition stated below:</p>
<p>Family Preservation Services -- services for children  and families designed to help families (including adoptive  and extended families) at risk or in crisis, including:</p>
<p>·services designed to help children -</p>
<p>-where appropriate, return to families from which they  have been removed; or  </p>
<p>-be placed for adoption, with legal guardian or in some  other planned, permanent living arrangement;</p>
<p>·preplacement prevention services programs, such as  intensive family preservation programs, designed to help  children at risk of foster care placement remain with their  families;</p>
<ul><li>service programs designed to provide follow-up care to  families to whom a child has been returned after a foster  care placement;  </li>
<li>respite care of children to provide temporary relief  for parents and other caregivers (including foster parents);  and  </li>
<li>services designed to improve parenting skills (by  reinforcing parents' confidence in their strengths, and  helping them to identify where improvement is needed and to  obtain assistance in improving those skills) with respect to  matters such as child development, family budgeting, coping  with stress, health and nutrition.  </li>
</ul><p>As evidenced in the above definition, the legislation  further broadened the definition of family preservation  services allowing states a variety of options in how new  federal funds for family preservation would be utilized.</p>
<h4>B. Purpose of This Report</h4>
<p>The National Evaluation of Family Preservation Programs  is expected to help inform future decisions regarding  federal and state policies concerning family preservation  programs.  Because of the intent to conduct a rigorous,  outcome evaluation in a limited number of programs it will  not be possible to examine the full range of programs that  might be considered family preservation programs.  The study  began with the intent to select programs that met the  following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Programs should have a primary focus on a population of  children involved in abuse or neglect reports;  </li>
<li>Programs should be based on well-articulated theories;  </li>
<li>Programs should have been in place long enough to  operate in the way expected by program managers;  </li>
<li>Programs should be consistently implemented within a  site;  </li>
<li>Programs should serve a sufficient number of families  to reach adequate sample sizes (initially estimated at a  total of 500 families per site for the experimental and  control groups); and,  </li>
<li>Key policymakers, managers and line staff should be  willing to allow an evaluation to be conducted.  </li>
</ul><p>The process of identifying site criteria and selecting  candidate programs for the evaluation is an iterative one --  methodological and practical considerations impose certain  limitations on the range of programs that would be suitable  for the evaluation.  However, the criteria must be  consistent with the characteristics of a majority of  programs currently in operation.  In other words, while the  evaluation cannot encompass all types of family preservation  programs, it should not focus on aberrations in the family  preservation field or models that the field appears to be  abandoning.</p>
<p>With these issues in mind, we developed this paper,  along with a companion paper that reviews the family  preservation evaluation literature, to help inform the  selection of candidate sites for evaluation.  This paper  describes the "state of the family preservation field"  and examines in greater depth the characteristics and  operations of programs that are potential sites for the  evaluation.  It also provides a reality check on the initial  site selection criteria -- determining the feasibility of  identifying sites that meet the initial criteria.</p>
<h4>C. Approach</h4>
<p>We identified programs for review through an examination  of the existing literature on family preservation program  models in various states, discussions with national experts  about states and counties with program models that might be  of interest, a review of the state applications for FP/FS  funds and the knowledge of the study team about existing  state programs.  Whether or not they were identified through  any of the above sources, the 20 states with the largest  number of children (0-18 years old) were included in this  review.&lt;5&gt; </p>
<p>We held telephone discussions with an individual in each  state's child welfare agency who was responsible for, or  could describe, family preservation programs in their state.   Four of the 26 states providing information had no  state-sponsored program model.  In some instances states  provided funding for county-operated programs that met very  broad criteria.  In other instances, programs were both  funded and operated at the local level.</p>
<p>In states with no state-sponsored family preservation  model, we asked the state official to identify counties with  family preservation or reunification program models,  particularly those in the three largest counties in the  state.  </p>
<p>For states with a state-sponsored program model or  models, we obtained a description of the model(s).  In  addition, we identified contacts in large county child  welfare agencies and/or the major private providers of  family preservation services, depending upon the nature of  the service delivery system in each state.  We then held  follow-up telephone discussions with officials in at least  one agency within the state, in most instances.&lt;6&gt;</p>
<p>We obtained information about program characteristics  relevant to most site selection criteria.  However, site  visits are planned to secure more detailed information on  those sites that appear to be plausible candidates.</p>
<p>Discussions with state and local child welfare  administrators included the following:</p>
<ul><li><b>Description of the Family Preservation Program  Model: </b> This includes the theoretical basis for the  model, caseload size, length of service and type of services  provided;  </li>
<li><b>Program Maturity</b>:  The year family preservation  services began in each of the major population centers and  the extent to which it changed over time;  </li>
<li><b>Referral Procedures</b>:  Identification of  agencies that refer cases to the family preservation  program, referral procedures, definition of "imminent  risk," and decisionmaking authority;  </li>
<li><b>Population Characteristics</b>:  Criteria for  including and excluding cases and general characteristics of  families who are likely to receive services;  </li>
<li><b>Program Statistics</b>:  This includes the number  of child abuse and neglect allegations per year, the number  of families receiving family preservation services, and the  number of children entering foster care.  Information was  also gathered on whether the family preservation programs  were operating at full capacity and whether or not there  were waiting lists; and  </li>
<li><b>Program Consistency</b>:  The extent to which the  same model is implemented in all counties and by all service  providers.  </li>
</ul><p>Although most of the administrators with whom we spoke  were very cooperative, they could not always provide us with  program statistics of interest.  Family preservation program  administrators could typically provide data on the number of  families served by their program, but not on the number of  abuse or neglect allegations or children entering foster  care.  We obtained some of these data through additional  calls to other staff in the child welfare agency, but we  still had difficulty identifying the number of children  entering care.  Also, even where we obtained program  statistics in all areas of interest, the statistics did not  necessarily cover the same time periods.</p>
<p>Overall, the information we obtained has enabled us to  depict 38 placement prevention and 26 reunification programs  and to make a preliminary assessment of the extent to which  sites meet at least some of the key criteria for  participating in the evaluation.</p>
<h4>D. Relationship of Program Characteristics and Study  Criteria</h4>
<p>Chapters II and III present the findings from our review  of placement prevention and reunification programs  respectively.  Within each chapter, we present an overview  of the findings along key program dimensions for each of the  states contacted.  A more detailed description of each of  the states that is a possible candidate for inclusion in  this study is provided in Appendices A and B.</p>
<p>A summary of the study findings as they relate to the  initial study criteria is provided below.</p>
<h2> 1. Placement Prevention Programs</h2>
<p>The telephone discussions with state and local  administrators provide a preliminary indication of the  extent to which sites meet most of the study criteria.  We  have identified 14 states in which there are one or more  jurisdictions that might be reviewed in further detail.   Nevertheless, it will be more problematic than initially  anticipated to meet some of these criteria.  Findings as  they relate to each criterion are presented below.</p>
<p><b> a.Criterion #1:  Programs should have a primary  focus on a population served by the child welfare agency.</b></p>
<p>This criterion was established for several reasons.   First, this evaluation focuses on programs that meet the  intent of the new legislation, creating title IV-B, part 2  of the Social Security Act which is administered by the  state child welfare agencies.  Second, limiting the study to  child welfare cases will create a more homogeneous sample  making it possible to draw a smaller sample and gather data  on a set of outcome measures relevant to the entire sample  population.  Finally, from a logistical and project  resources perspective, it is more problematic to secure  cooperation and collect the necessary case data from  multiple agencies.</p>
<p>Although the majority of families served by a family  preservation program in most states were referred by the  child welfare agency, few family preservation programs  limited their caseloads to child welfare referrals.   Referrals from juvenile justice and mental health agencies  sometimes accounted for a significant percentage (i.e., more  than 25 percent) of the families served.</p>
<p>In sites that accept referrals from multiple sources,  the study could still be limited to those families referred  by the child welfare agency; however, this approach may  affect the ability of sites to meet Criterion #5 (adequate  sample size).  A more detailed analysis of program referral  practices and recent program statistics will be required to  determine which sites can meet both criteria.</p>
<p><b>b. Criterion #2:  Programs should be based on  well-articulated theories.  </b></p>
<p>Although early family preservation programs attempted to  base their approach to service delivery on theoretical  models -- crisis intervention, social learning theory,  family systems theory, and family treatment -- the  distinction between these theories and their application to  family preservation service delivery models is somewhat  ambiguous.  As other states began developing family  preservation models, they often adapted one of the program  models previously described; however, in describing the  models on which their program is based, administrators tend  to focus on service delivery characteristics (most notably  caseload size and service duration) rather than on the  theoretical underpinnings of the service delivery model.</p>
<p>In short, while programs may not meet this criterion, it  is possible to identify programs that have either replicated  or adapted one of the early program models.</p>
<p><b> c.Criterion #3:  Programs should have been in place  long enough to operate in the way expected by program  managers.</b></p>
<p>To fully determine whether or not programs are being  implemented as managers expect will require an in-depth site  visits to candidate programs.  As a surrogate measure, we  asked administrators about the year in which family  preservation services began and whether or not the initial  program model has undergone any substantial changes.  Our  intent was to eliminate programs that had not been in  operation long enough for program managers to identify and  resolve implementation problems.</p>
<p>Only five of the states examined did not have any family  preservation model operating in at least one jurisdiction  for five years or longer.  Therefore, there are enough "mature"  programs to expect that inconsistencies in implementation  that occur during the formative stages of program  development will not be a problem.</p>
<p><b>d. Criterion #4:  Programs should be consistently  implemented within a site.</b></p>
<p>This criterion was established to minimize variations in  the treatment intervention at a given site.  Variations in  treatment intervention may occur when workers apply the  treatment intervention differently to the cases they serve,  when there are differences among staff in the way services  are provided, or when agencies providing the same treatment  model make formal or informal changes to the model.   Differences may include the length or intensity of services,  the type of services provided, and the experience and skills  of staff providing services.  </p>
<p>Although this review could not explore fully all the  possible sources of inconsistency in delivering the  treatment intervention, it did explore the number of  providers responsible for service delivery.  The presence of  multiple service providers is not synonymous with  inconsistency, but the possibility of inconsistency  increases when multiple providers deliver services.  In  ideal circumstances a "program site" would consist  of one child welfare agency and one family preservation  service provider (either public or private).  </p>
<p>Establishing a definition for a "program site with  consistent implementation" appears to pose more  problems than initially anticipated.  The situation is  complicated by two factors: (1) a small number of families  served in all but the largest urban areas: and (2) service  delivery by multiple private providers within counties and  across counties (or child welfare agency jurisdictions).  In  order to achieve adequate sample sizes, it may be necessary  to define  "a family preservation program" as an  entire state or a sub-section of the state that encompasses  multiple child welfare agencies and/or multiple service  providers.  States that do not have a consistent program  model or a single urban area providing family preservation  services to at least 250 families were excluded from further  consideration as potential sites.  </p>
<p>For states that have a statewide family preservation  model, it may be possible to "create" a program  site for evaluation purposes by combining local child  welfare agency jurisdictions and/or service delivery  providers who are implementing the same model.  However,  even in states that indicate that there is a consistent  model implemented in most or all jurisdictions, we expect  that as the number of child welfare agencies and private  providers increases, consistency will decrease.  Also, there  are practical issues concerning securing cooperation among a  large number of local agencies and providers and  establishing data collection procedures that are consistent  with project resources that must be addressed.  We will  examine the question of program consistency in greater depth  during subsequent site selection activities.</p>
<p><b> e.Criterion #5:  Programs should have a sufficient  number of families to reach adequate sample sizes.</b></p>
<p>Lack of data on entry rates into the placement  prevention program and foster care make it difficult to  determine the precise number of sites that serve enough  families and have a sufficient number of cases entering  foster care, to yield 250 families each in the experimental  and control groups.</p>
<p>For those programs able to provide information, the  number of families receiving placement prevention services  appears to be relatively small in all but the largest urban  areas.  As discussed above, adequate sample sizes may be  achieved by combining sites within a state that implement  the same program model.</p>
<p>Additional statistical data on program size and foster  care entry rates will be required before we can determine  the number of programs serving a sufficient number of  families for sampling purposes.  Based on this information,  we will further review the feasibility of combining program  sites. </p>
<p><b>f.Criterion #6:  Key policymakers, managers and line  staff should be willing to allow an evaluation to be  conducted.</b></p>
<p>We did not raise the question of whether or not programs  will agree to an evaluation with program administrators  during our initial contacts.  Clearly, all relevant  stakeholders in a site would require detailed information  about our plans before determining whether or not they  wanted to be part of this evaluation.  Since the purpose of  these telephone discussions with programs was to obtain  preliminary program information, we did not undertake a  detailed discussion of evaluation plans.  Nevertheless, some  administrators did indicate an interest in learning more  about the study design and discussing their participation in  the national evaluation.</p>
<h2>2.Reunification Programs</h2>
<p>The review of state and county reunification programs  indicates that there are fewer reunification programs than  placement prevention programs.  Furthermore, existing re-  unification programs tend to be extremely small and are  often not clearly defined.  Our review indicates that  evaluation design and site selection criteria as they  pertain to the reunification programs will need to be  re-examined.</p>
<p>The relationship between the study criteria and the  characteristics of reunification programs is described  below.</p>
<p><b> a.Criterion #1:  Programs should have a primary  focus on a population served by the child welfare agency.</b></p>
<p>Like the placement prevention programs, reunification  programs may serve families from the juvenile justice and  mental health systems as well as the child welfare agency;  however, twelve of the 20 reunification programs examined in  depth serve only child welfare cases or primarily child  welfare cases.</p>
<p><b> b.Criterion #2:  Programs should be based on  well-articulated theories.  </b></p>
<p>Of the reunification programs examined, seven programs  were an integral part of the placement prevention programs--  that is, reunification cases were served by the same staff  and received the same types of services as placement  prevention cases.  Services were mostly provided after the  child had been returned home.  In these programs that were  part of a placement prevention program, the reunification  program was based on the same theories of behavior and  treatment.</p>
<p>Like the placement prevention program administrators,  reunification program administrators seldom described their  programs in terms of theory.  Rather they focused on the  duration and intensity of their service model, and to some  extent, on the types of cases they typically served (e.g.,  children recently entering foster care, children who have  been in placement at least six months, or children who are  in group care).</p>
<p><b> c.Criterion #3:  Programs should have been in place  long enough to operate in the way expected by program  managers.</b></p>
<p>Unlike the placement prevention programs, the majority  of reunification programs have been in place for only a  short time.  Thirteen of the 20 programs examined were  established in 1990 or later.</p>
<p>Of the seven programs established before 1990, only two  programs are distinct reunification programs.  The others  are an integral part of a placement prevention program. </p>
<p>The lack of a large number of mature programs will be of  concern in selecting sites, although it is possible that  some of the more recent programs will be operationally  stable and consistent with the program design described by  managers and policymakers.</p>
<p><b> d.Criterion #4:  Programs should be consistently  implemented within a site.</b></p>
<p>As discussed above, this criterion is intended to  minimize variations in the treatment intervention in a given  site.  As was true of the placement prevention programs, the  challenge in meeting this criterion is complicated by the  small number of families served by most programs.  Although  the reunification programs in Los Angeles and New York City,  serve a sufficient number of families to meet the sample  size requirements, neither program defines a specific  service delivery intervention.  Instead, the service  delivery providers are given considerable latitude in  determining the nature of the service intervention.   </p>
<p>It appears that it will be difficult to find sites that  meet this criterion.  Further consideration of the effect of  studying sites that do not meet this criteria is required.</p>
<p><b> e.Criterion #5:  Programs should serve a sufficient  number of families to reach adequate sample sizes.</b></p>
<p>As noted above, only two programs -- Los Angeles and New  York City -- meet this criterion.  Other programs ranged in  size from fewer than 25 families to approximately 150  families, considerably less than is necessary to have  experimental and control groups with approximately 250  families in each group.  Furthermore, the lack of statewide  programs serving any sizeable number of families will make  it difficult to achieve the necessary sample sizes by  combining like programs within a state to form one  evaluation site.</p>
<p>An inability to meet this criterion will require a  re-examination of the study design.</p>
<p><b> f.Criterion #6:  Key policymakers, managers and  line staff should be willing to allow an evaluation to be  conducted.</b></p>
<p>As described above, this question was not addressed  during the initial telephone discussions with agency and  program administrators.  We do not expect, however, that it  will be particularly problematic to secure consent for an  evaluation of the reunification programs.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>PLACEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h2>
<h4>A.Overview</h4>
<p>We contacted administrators in 26 states and asked them  to describe the family preservation program models operating  in their state.  It was not a simple task to define the  parameters of the family preservation programs included in  this review.  Many respondents focused on describing a  single program model for intensive family preservation  programs established by the child welfare agency in the  state.  However, some also included models that were  operated by other agencies such as mental health and  juvenile justice.  Others described funding mechanisms for  purchasing a range of services that may assist in placement  prevention.  Still others described managed care programs  for severely emotionally disturbed children that use  multi-disciplinary teams to prevent placement, reunify  families, or arrange for placement in the least restrictive  setting.  For this review, we excluded programs operated by  other agencies, specialized programs for emotionally  disturbed and developmentally disabled children, and funding  mechanisms for purchasing preventive services.  Descriptions  of selected placement prevention programs are provided in  Appendix A.</p>
<p>Even when the programs from other agencies, specialized  programs and general funding mechanisms are excluded from  consideration, it is difficult to completely capture the  diversity of family preservation programs.  Both states and  counties appear to be exploring new ways to better serve  families.  States that implemented one type of program for  several years are now piloting alternative models.  In other  instances, counties may be simultaneously implementing both  a state program model and other models suited to the needs  of their families and available through the service  providers in their area.  Among those states that assert  that there is a single model in operation throughout the  state, many acknowledge that counties and private providers  may vary in their implementation of the state model.</p>
<p>Of the 26 states we contacted, four -- California,  Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- do not have a  specific program model that guides program implementation.   These states have made funds available to counties and have  allowed them to determine their own model or models.  </p>
<p>In three of these states; California, Ohio and  Pennsylvania, we contacted large population centers with  programs recommended by the state agency.&lt;7&gt;  In  California, we reviewed programs in Contra Costa, Los  Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, and Solano counties.   Each  of these counties has its own family preservation program  model.  In Pennsylvania, programs in Allegheny County  (Pittsburgh) and Philadelphia County were reviewed.   Pittsburgh operates two distinct family preservation models.   Philadelphia contracts with a variety of providers, each of  which may have a special program intended to meet the needs  of a special population (e.g., pregnant and parenting  teenagers), but all of which follow the same 12-week service  delivery model.  In Ohio, we contacted Cuyahoga (Cleveland)  and Franklin (Columbus) counties.  Three family preservation  programs -- one in Cleveland and two in Columbus--were  identified.  </p>
<p>The remaining 22 states have one or more statewide  models.  Of these, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire  and Oregon, have two family preservation program models.</p>
<p>Collectively, 38 statewide or countywide programs were  identified.  We analyzed these programs' characteristics,  and the findings are presented in Section B.</p>
<p>In addition to these 38 fully-described programs, we  identified other programs.  For  example, both Dallas and  Houston have programs consistent with the family  preservation model described by the state, but also have  other program models in operation.  In Connecticut, there is  a statewide model operated by 11 service providers  throughout the state and several small programs intended for  special populations operated by the Yale Child Development  Center.  In instances where a statewide model exists, we did  not include other small programs operated by the county in  the analysis.</p>
<h4>B.Analysis of Family Preservation Program  Characteristics</h4>
<p>The 38 family preservation programs reviewed in this  study vary along several dimensions, including:  the type of  program model, the sources of referral for family  preservation, and the referral practices (including the way  imminent risk is defined, the review of decisions to refer  cases to family preservation, and the types of cases  excluded from receiving services).  Programs also differ in  the length of time in operation and the number and type of  providers who deliver family preservation services.   Programs vary by size, but most are small in comparison to  the number of abuse and neglect reports and children  entering foster care each year.  Exhibit II-5, which appears  at the end of this section, provides a summary of each  program along the dimensions listed above.  A discussion of  each dimension and the similarities and differences among  programs is provided below.</p>
<h2> 1.Program Model</h2>
<p>Some of the earliest family preservation programs  designed their programs based on theories about family  dynamics.  The Homebuilders program in Tacoma was based on  theories about crisis intervention and social learning.   Iowa's earlier models focused on family systems theory, and  Oregon's program was designed to provide a family treatment  intervention.  The differences in theory translated to  somewhat different service delivery characteristics.   Homebuilders serves only two families per worker for a four  to six week period.  Iowa's earliest program, FAMILIES, used  a two-person team with a caseload of 10 to 12 families and  provided home-based services for up to seven months.  The  family treatment approach, as implemented in Oregon's  Intensive Family Services (IFS) program, has a single  therapist who provides three months of treatment for 10 to  12 families.  Services are delivered in both office- and  home-based settings.</p>
<p>As evidence of the changes that have occurred since  these programs began, Oregon continues to operate its IFS  treatment model, but has recently begun to implement the  Homebuilders model as well, through its Intensive Home-Based  Services (IHS) program.  In Iowa, the Iowa Family  Preservation Program (IFPP), provides services to an average  of 3.5 families per worker for a maximum of eight weeks.   Iowa also funds another family-centered service program  whose implementation varies by provider, but is generally  less intensive and of longer duration than the IFPP.   Although Homebuilders is still the major family preservation  model in Washington, recent efforts to decentralize child  welfare service delivery may result in communities modifying  or selecting different service delivery models.</p>
<p>The family preservation programs reviewed represent all  of these models as well as various "hybrid"  models.  However, the programs tend not to describe  themselves in terms of theoretical approaches.  Instead,  they describe their model in terms of caseload size, service  duration, and whether they use one worker or a team approach  in working with families.</p>
<p>Exhibit II-1 identifies each of the programs reviewed in  terms of caseload size and duration.  Programs using teams  are noted.  This exhibit shows the relationship between  caseload size (which establishes the level of service  intensity) and service duration.  Simply stated, high  intensity of service is associated with short service  duration.  As caseload sizes increase, duration increases.</p>
<p>The exhibit also indicates that the majority of programs  have adopted or adapted the small caseload/short duration  model originally developed by Homebuilders.  Of the 37  programs providing complete data, 9 replicate the  Homebuilders model in terms of both caseload size and  duration (Alabama, Colorado-Model A, Kentucky, Michigan,  Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon-Intensive Home-Based Services  (IHS), Tennessee and Washington).  An additional nine  programs provide services for four to six weeks, but have  allowed workers to serve up to four families at one time  (California - Contra Costa and Solano; Florida - Intensive  Crisis Counseling Program; Minnesota; New Hampshire - Crisis  Intervention; New York; North Carolina; Ohio/Cuyahoga  County; and Pennsylvania/Allegheny County - Crisis Model).     Only seven programs occupy the other end of the spectrum.   Of these, Los Angeles provides services for up to 52 weeks  to caseloads of 5-8 families, Sacramento, California and  Oregon-Intensive Services provide 12 weeks and 16 weeks of  service respectively to caseloads ranging from 9 to 12  families.  Colorado's Model B serves 9 to 12 families per  worker and may extend services for up to 36 weeks.  The  Family Builders program in Florida and the statewide model  in Texas provide 12 weeks of service for caseloads ranging  from five to eight families.  New Hampshire's Long-term  service program serves an average of five families for 24  weeks.  It is interesting to note that four of these  programs have been implemented in states which also have  short-term, more intensive service models.</p>
<p>[Exhibit II-1 here is a table showing caseload size and  case duration for several programs.]</p>
<p>Only four programs indicated that they typically use a  team approach rather than a single worker.  As expected,  these are some of the programs that have slightly larger  caseloads (Arizona; Sacramento, California; Family Builders  in Florida; and the Intensive Home-Based Program in  Franklin, Ohio). San Diego and Cuyahoga, Ohio noted that  some cases are staffed by a team, but that this decision is  made on a case-by-case basis.  Also, there may be other  variations by program site.  For example, although Florida  indicated that its Intensive Crisis Counseling Program  (ICCP) uses one worker per case, the provider in  Hillsborough, Florida indicated that it staffs its ICCP  cases with a team.  In Arizona, where the state indicated a  team approach to service delivery, one of the providers in  Tucson indicated it uses one worker per caseload.  Hence,  variation in the use of teams may be greater than child  welfare administrators believe.</p>
<p>These findings have some implications for selecting  sites in which to conduct the evaluation.  Initially, the  evaluation was to be conducted in two sites that were  modeled after the Homebuilders program, and in two sites  that had a less intensive/longer duration approach to  service delivery.  However, these findings suggest that the  choice of programs that are not modeled after Homebuilders  is somewhat limited.  Moreover, most of the programs with  longer/less intensive services are in less populous states  or counties (e.g., Arizona, New Hampshire) or in states and  counties that have only recently developed programs (e.g.,  Colorado).  This is not intended to suggest that programs  not modeled after Homebuilders should be excluded from  consideration; however, when all study criteria are  combined, greater flexibility in selecting program models  will be needed.</p>
<h2>2.Referral Sources</h2>
<p>Although this program review was intended to focus on  family preservation programs that served child welfare  referrals, it is somewhat difficult to disentangle programs  by referral sources.  As previously noted, separate and  distinct family preservation models established in agencies  such as mental health or juvenile justice were not included  in this study.  However, many family preservation programs  serve the child welfare agency as well as other agencies.   Even when family preservation services are provided by the  public child welfare agency (e.g., Alabama), cases referred  from other agencies may be accepted.  Exhibit II-2 provides  a listing of programs that serve only the child welfare  agency, programs that receive 50 percent or more of their  referrals from the child welfare agency and programs  receiving less than 50 percent of their referrals from child  welfare.  Information was available for 32 of the 38  programs.  The remaining programs are presumed to serve  primarily child welfare cases, but this information was not  provided.</p>
<p>As noted in the exhibit, 11 programs receive referrals  only from child welfare.  Only one state, New Hampshire,  receives less than half of its referrals from the child  welfare agency.  The remainder of cases come from juvenile  justice and mental health agencies.  Juvenile justice and  mental health agencies represent the majority of other  referrals in almost all programs.  In Alabama, Florida, Iowa  and New Jersey referrals from other agencies to family  preservation are screened by the child welfare agency.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that because of the  organizational structure of an agency and the way in which  status offenders are treated, distinctions between cases  referred from a child welfare agency and cases referred from  juvenile justice may be ambiguous.  For example, cases  referred from the juvenile justice agency in Kentucky are  status offenders.  In New York, status offenders are served  by the child welfare agency, which may refer them for family  preservation services.  Thus, although the sources of  referral may differ from state to state, the types of cases  referred may be similar.</p>
<p>One of the site selection criteria for the evaluation is  that the program serve predominantly families referred from  child welfare.  Although most agencies accept referrals from  multiple agencies, the types of cases referred may be  similar.  The inter-relationship between referral sources  and case characteristics will have to be explored in greater  depth with candidate sites in order to determine optimal  procedures for identifying cases for inclusion in the study.</p>
<p>[Exhibit II-2 here shows referring agencies by State.]</p>
<h2> 3. Referral Practices</h2>
<p>In examining the way in which cases are referred to  family preservation, we explored three issues:</p>
<ul><li> <b>Definition of Imminent Risk</b>:  When family  preservation programs first emerged, they had an explicit  goal of serving families who were at "imminent risk"  of having a child placed in foster care.    </li>
<li> <b>Decision-making</b>:  Decisions regarding referral  for family preservation and the related determination of  whether or not a case is at "imminent risk"  typically begin with the CPS investigator or other child  welfare agency staff who initially assess the family.  The  question explored in this program review was whether or not  there were additional review procedures in place that  examined the appropriateness of worker referrals (especially  as it pertains to meeting imminent risk criteria).  </li>
<li> <b>Exclusion Criteria</b>:  Although all programs  will exclude cases in which the danger to a child's safety  is too great, many programs also have criteria for excluding  cases that they believe are not likely to benefit from  family preservation services.  This review explored the  types of cases typically excluded from referral to family  preservation programs.  </li>
</ul><p>The findings in each of these areas are discussed below.</p>
<h2>  a. Definition of Imminent Risk</h2>
<p>Recent evaluations of family preservation programs have  questioned whether the cases referred to family preservation  were at risk of imminent placement.  In many instances, the  cases appeared to have serious, multiple problems which  might eventually lead to foster care placement or further  abuse or neglect; however, it did not appear that placement  would have occurred immediately in these cases, in the  absence of family preservation services.&lt;8&gt; &lt;9&gt;   Data for the evaluations conducted in California, Illinois  and New Jersey indicated relatively low placement rates for  the control groups, as well as for the experimental groups.   The control group placements rates were 20, 17 and 57  percent, respectively.&lt;10&gt; &lt;11&gt; &lt;12&gt;</p>
<p>Child welfare agencies and family preservation programs  have been struggling to address this issue.  Some programs  have abandoned the use of the term, requiring only that  cases referred have serious problems which cannot be  addressed by less intensive services.  In other instances,  programs have an "imminent risk" criterion, but no  definition is established to guide worker decisions about  whether or not a case meets the criterion.  Still other  programs attempt to guide the worker by having the worker  complete a risk assessment scale.  These scales, however,  generally assess the risk of danger and other serious  problems to the child rather than the likelihood of  placement, including such factors as a history of abuse and  neglect and parental motivation to change (see Schuerman and  Rossi, January 1994).&lt;13&gt;</p>
<p>Finally, some programs have attempted to provide a time  limit during which placement would be expected to occur  (e.g., a child will be placed in five days if family  preservation services are not provided).  Although this  approach to defining imminent risk appears to address the  issue of likelihood of placement, workers may have  difficulty operationalizing this criterion.  In essence, a  CPS investigator or other worker with authority to seek  placement, can decide at a given time whether or not to seek  placement based on the information available to them at that  time.  It is almost impossible to ask a worker to predict  what actions might be taken at a later date when more  information may be available.  Nevertheless, programs that  have established such a criterion, at least appear to be  reinforcing the concept that probable placement is an  essential criterion in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Exhibit II-3 provides a list of the programs employing  each of the definitions described above.  As noted in this  Exhibit, five programs do not require that a case be at  imminent risk of foster care placement in order to receive  family preservation services.  In the long-term programs in  Iowa and Oregon and in the programs in Los Angeles and San  Diego, California, there has been a specific decision not to  employ this criterion.</p>
<p>[Exhibit II-3 here shows alternative definitions of  imminent risk used by programs.]</p>
<p>Nine programs indicated that imminent risk was a  referral criterion, but these programs had not developed a  definition of imminent risk.  Of these nine, North Carolina  had recently reorganized its family preservation program and  may be developing a definition in the near future.  Texas  also indicated that it was planning to improve consistency  in the implementation of the state model across regions and  may eventually develop such a definition.  In Florida,  Hillsborough County has developed its own definition.</p>
<p>Twelve programs do not define imminent risk, but expect  that workers will make that judgment based on the findings  of a uniform risk assessment protocol.  However, only Utah  described using the scale to establish a specific referral  criterion.  Families must score four or five (on scale of  one to five) to be referred for family preservation  services.  All other programs indicate that the risk  assessment protocol is used to guide worker decisions  regarding referral.  </p>
<p>For the 11 programs that defined imminent risk as a  specified number of days before placement occurs, the time  periods identified ranged from 3 to 14 days.  Most programs  cited a two- to five-day time period, with five programs  citing a three-day period.  Georgia was the only program  using a 14-day time frame.</p>
<p>For programs that have imminent risk as a criterion, the  lack of a clear definition that workers can operationalize  suggests that programs are likely to serve families who may  or may not have otherwise experienced a foster care  placement.  Since placement in foster care is a key outcome  variable in the evaluation, these findings may pose problems  that will need to be addressed in the evaluation design and  selection of candidate sites.</p>
<h2>  b. Decision-making</h2>
<p>The process used to decide which cases are referred for  family preservation services will also affect the likelihood  that such cases are at imminent risk of placement.  The  initial decision to refer a case for family preservation  services is made by a CPS investigator or other worker  making an assessment of the problem.  In some programs,  workers may refer cases directly to the family preservation  program.  In others, a supervisor may need to approve the  referral; however, it is unclear if this approval involves a  detailed review of the appropriateness of the referral or  simply a perfunctory sign-off procedure.  Some programs also  may require a more formal review process involving other  parties less intimately involved in the case to determine if  the case meets program criteria.</p>
<p>A second level of review typically occurs after the  family preservation worker has made an initial assessment of  the family.  The secondary review from the family  preservation program tends to focus on whether child safety  issues have been adequately assessed and whether there is at  least one caretaker who is able to accept services.  This  review seldom involves a determination of whether the family  is at imminent risk of placement.  (One exception to this  appears to be in Missouri, where program statistics indicate  that some cases were rejected because they did not meet  imminent risk criteria.)</p>
<p>The decision-making process used by the child welfare  agency in each of the programs studied is described in  Exhibit II-4.  As noted in this Exhibit, 13 programs  indicated that workers may refer cases directly to family  preservation without further screening and 8 indicated that  cases were referred after a supervisory review.  Eleven  programs had some other system in place.  The most frequent  approach was some type of review committee or monitoring  team.  Both Solano County and Contra Costa County in  California; Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Utah established  screening committees to review referrals. Also, two counties  in Washington experimented with formal review committees,  but these procedures were not established on a permanent  basis.  Colorado plans to establish monitoring teams to  review referrals for both of its programs.  Similarly, Iowa  has established regional Clinical Assessment and  Consultation Teams that receive referrals from all county  offices and determine whether or not family preservation  services are needed.  </p>
<p>In Franklin County, Ohio, referrals to both programs are  reviewed jointly by the CPS investigator and the supervisor  of a planning unit.  New Jersey trains screeners to review  referrals in each county.  Typically, screeners are child  welfare agency staff members; however, in three  jurisdictions a screener is part of the provider's staff.</p>
<p>[Exhibit II-4 here describes the decision making  processes used by programs.]</p>
<p>Although it is not possible to determine the precise  relationship between the existence of a referral review  process and the application of existing imminent risk  criteria, it is plausible to assume that programs with  external review procedures (beyond an investigative worker  and supervisor) are more likely to refer cases that meet  existing criteria for imminent risk of placement.  We will  seek more detailed information on the nature and extent of  existing review procedures, and explore the feasibility of  establishing additional review procedures for the evaluation  with potential sites.</p>
<h2> c. Exclusion Criteria</h2>
<p>Some of the earliest family preservation programs  excluded cases with certain characteristics.  Most  frequently, families in which the caretaker had a serious  substance abuse problem, mental illness or other incapacity  that severely limited to their ability to cooperate with a  family preservation worker were excluded.  In addition,  families in which the caretaker was completely unwilling to  accept family preservation services were also typically  excluded.   </p>
<p>As family preservation programs were implemented in more  jurisdictions, particularly in major urban centers, the  effects of such exclusion criteria were re-examined.  In  particular, there was a high correlation between serious  substance abuse and cases at imminent risk of placement.   Child welfare administrators would informally comment that  programs with major exclusion criteria, especially criteria  relating to substance abuse, would not serve the population  that was most likely to be at risk of imminent placement.   As a result, programs began to modify their criteria by more  narrowly defining the types of cases to be excluded (e.g.,  chronic substance abusers who refuse to enter treatment) or  abolishing such criteria entirely.</p>
<p>The programs reviewed for this study were asked to  identify whether or not there were any exclusion criteria  used to screen referrals to their program and, if so, to  describe them.  Twelve programs had no exclusion criteria  (Colorado-both programs; Georgia; Iowa-both programs; New  Hampshire-both programs; New Jersey; North Carolina;  Franklin County, Ohio-both programs; and Utah.</p>
<p>The four most frequently cited exclusion criteria were  sexual abuse, when the perpetrator has not left the home;  substance abuse, when the caretaker refuses treatment;  mental illness/mental retardation, when a caretaker is not  taking prescribed medication or is actively psychotic; and  family refusal of services.  Within each category, programs  varied in their exact statements of the criteria.  For  example, Sacramento, California excludes all sexual abuse  cases and Minnesota excludes serious sexual abuse cases,  whereas eight of the states listed exclude a sexual abuse  case only if the perpetrator is still in the home.  Los  Angeles excludes if the perpetrator still has access to the  child.</p>
<p>Similarly, six programs exclude substance abusers who  are not receiving treatment (Arizona, Florida-both programs,  Michigan, Minnesota, and Missouri-St. Louis only).  In  Cuyahoga County, Ohio, cases are not accepted until the  caretaker completes treatment or has made substantial  progress.  Only Wisconsin indicated that it would not serve  substance abusers.  </p>
<p>Nine programs specifically cited lack of a caretaker  willing to participate in the program as a reason for  exclusion.  Programs may also vary in the threshold applied  for determining when a caretaker is unwilling to  participate.  For some, unwillingness may mean that the  family is not motivated, while for others it means that the  family indicated they preferred a child be placed in care or  that they refused the worker entry into their home.  </p>
<p>In addition to these major criteria, other exclusion  criteria identified by more than one program included the  following:  homelessness (Solano and Contra Costa counties,  California and Michigan); juvenile delinquency  (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Tennessee); serious physical  abuse (San Diego, California and Michigan); and domestic  violence (Michigan and Suffolk County, New York).</p>
<p>Overall, family preservation programs appear to set few  limits on the types of cases that they will accept.   However, lack of categorical exclusion criteria does not  mean that a cases cannot be screened out on an individual  basis.  Nevertheless, it does not appear that large numbers  of families who may be at risk of experiencing placement are  routinely excluded from services.</p>
<h2> 4. Program Maturity</h2>
<p>The earliest family preservation programs were developed  in 1974. Homebuilders started in Washington with funding  from Catholic Community Services and the National Institute  for Mental Health for the purpose of providing an  alternative to psychiatric hospitalization for adolescents.   In Iowa, Families, Inc. was originated to serve children who  had been referred for residential care.  Both of these  programs have been modified over time.  The Homebuilders  model, currently implemented by Behavioral Sciences  Institute, began in 1982.  Iowa's current Iowa Family  Preservation Program began in 1987.</p>
<p>Family preservation programs proliferated in the 1980s.   Four programs (Florida-ICCP, Texas, Oregon-IFS and Utah)  began in 1982, and Solano County, California began in 1983.   Kentucky, both programs in New Hampshire and North Carolina  began operating in 1985.  Eleven programs began between 1987  and 1989 (Alabama, Arizona, California-CC, Connecticut,  Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio-FCCR,  Pennsylvania-ACR and Tennessee).  Of the remaining programs,  15 began in the 1990's, and 2 began at various times as  different providers within a state were identified.</p>
<p>Some of the later programs also have been modified over  time.  In addition, the development of specific county  programs within a state sometimes has occurred over several  years.  For example, although Texas began family  preservation services in 1982, the programs in Harris,  Dallas, and Bexar counties were initiated in 1984, 1987 and  1993 respectively.  </p>
<p>When programs are in their early stages of development,  they are likely to still be experimenting with the treatment  intervention.  Moreover, it takes time to iron out  operational problems and ensure that the program is actually  being implemented as intended.  If an outcome evaluation is  conducted during the early stages of program development,  there will be considerable inconsistencies in the treatment  intervention.  The existence of 21 programs that have been  in operation for at least five years will simplify the site  selection process for this evaluation.</p>
<h2> 5. Service Providers</h2>
<p>Family preservation programs are operated by both public  and private agencies.  In 25 programs, all services are  provided by private agencies.  In three programs, services  are provided directly by the public child welfare agency  only (Alabama; California-Sacramento; and Ohio-FCCR).  Of  the ten programs using a combination of public and private  providers (California, San Diego; Colorado-Models A and B;  Iowa-FCS; Minnesota; Missouri; New York; Texas&lt;14&gt;;  Utah; and Wisconsin), New York relies primarily on private  providers and Utah relies primarily on the public agency to  directly deliver services.</p>
<p>Whether services are provided by private or by public  agencies is not of concern for site selection purposes;  however, the number of agencies delivering services in a  defined program may affect the consistency of the service  intervention.  A large number of agencies will also  complicate the processes of securing cooperation among all  parties and collecting data.</p>
<h2> 6. Program Statistics</h2>
<p>Programs were asked to provide information on their  annual rates of child abuse and neglect allegations, foster  care entry and family preservation program entry.  Programs  were also asked whether they were operating at full  capacity, had a backlog or waiting list of cases, or had  vacancies in their program.  These data were important for  three reasons.  First, a program had to be of sufficient  size to permit an adequate sample to be drawn within a  12-month period (preferably 250 families served per year in  the family preservation program).  Second, in a random  assignment experiment, some families who are otherwise  eligible for services will be assigned to a control group.   If the program cannot currently serve all eligible families,  then establishing a control group is less problematic since  all families would not have received the service even if the  evaluation was not in effect.  Thus, programs that have a  backlog of families or turn families away are more likely  candidates for evaluation.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a possibility that current referral  practices may be modified to ensure that the families  referred for service during the evaluation are at imminent  risk of foster care placement.   Under these circumstances,  it is not possible to determine whether or not the program  will be able to serve all families referred or whether there  will be more families eligible than program space permits.   However, higher ratios of foster care entry rates to family  preservation slots increase the likelihood that a control  group can be established without denying services to  eligible families.</p>
<p>Most programs that could provide information on whether  they operated at full capacity, indicated that they were at  capacity.  The exceptions were Michigan and Hennepin County,  Minnesota.  Sites were generally unable to identify whether  there was a case backlog, since family preservation programs  do not keep waiting lists (presumably families require  immediate service to prevent placement).  Only Missouri, New  Jersey, and North Carolina provided data on cases turned  away due to lack of space.  In Missouri, 34 percent of the  cases referred were rejected due to lack of space statewide.   In New Jersey, the rejection rate due to lack of space was  37.4 percent, and in North Carolina it was 7 percent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the availability of consistent  statistical data was limited, and a final  determination of  the most promising sites cannot yet be made,  However, it  was possible to eliminate some programs from further  consideration because available information on the number of  families receiving family preservation services indicated  that it would not be possible to meet minimum sample size  requirements, even if counties providing the same service  intervention were combined.  The programs included  Connecticut, New Hampshire, both programs in Franklin  County, Ohio, and both programs in Allegheny County,  Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2>REUNIFICATION PROGRAMS</h2>
<h4>A. Overview</h4>
<p>In 1990, 60 percent of children in foster care had a  case plan goal of returning to the home from which they were  initially removed.&lt;15&gt;  For most of these children,  efforts to reunify them with their family are made by the  foster care worker, a child welfare worker who is assigned  to child's parent or caregiver, or both.  However, high  caseloads and other factors often prevent workers from  spending the time and resources necessary to facilitate the  reunification process.  As a result children may remain in  foster care longer than would otherwise be necessary, or  they may be returned home without the factors initially  leading to foster care placement having been adequately  resolved.</p>
<p>To address this problem, special programs that focused  solely on facilitating reunification and ensuring the  child's safety upon return home began to emerge in the  1980s.  The earliest reunification programs were often an  integral part of an existing placement prevention program --  that is, families in the reunificaion program were provided  with the same services, with the same level of intensity and  for the same duration, and by the same staff as families in  the preplacement program.  These cases were typically  referred when reunification was about to occur and services  were provided to ensure the child's safety and prevent the  need to place the child in foster care again.  In other  words, these programs focused on what happens after  reunification occurs.  </p>
<p>More recently, reunification programs have been  developed to facilitate the goal of reunification.  In these  instances, services are provided to a parent or caregiver to  resolve problems relating to their ability to care for their  child.  Services may include drug treatment, parent  training, counseling, or behavior management.  They may also  include concrete services such as locating adequate housing  or making home improvements that are necessary to a child's  safety.  Services may also be provided to the child to  enable the child to remain in the home and community.  In  addition, reunification programs may facilitate parent and  child visitation.  Services provided by these programs may  end once reunification occurs, or they may continue for a  short period of time after the child has returned home.</p>
<p>Programs vary on the type of cases that are referred to  a reunification program, most notably on the length of time  that a child was in foster care prior to referral.  Some  programs focus on children recently placed in foster care,  expecting that intensive efforts to work with parents  immediately or shortly after a child is placed will prevent  children from languishing in foster care.  This approach is  consistent with research that indicates that the longer a  child remains in foster care (particularly longer than two  years), the less likely the child is to return home at all.</p>
<p>Other programs focus on children for whom past efforts  of child welfare workers have not succeeded in returning the  children home.  Often these programs are considered a last  resort for children who have remained in foster care for  long periods of time without specialized intervention.   Because these programs often be serve more difficult cases,  they may experience lower rates of reunification or require  a longer period of service to achieve specified goals.  </p>
<p>In addition to the length of time in foster care prior  to referral, programs may also use other criteria for  accepting referrals, such as the age of the child or the  type of placement in which the child currently resides.   Younger children and those with disabilities may have  special vulnerabilities.  When cost is considered,  reunification programs may focus on serving children whose  out-of-home care is most expensive (those in group care or  institutions or those whose age or special needs results in  higher foster care payments). </p>
<p>The variability in scope of reunification programs and  the target populations that they serve pose some distinct  problems for the evaluation.  Initially, it was expected  that all reunification programs were intended to facilitate  the reunification of children who might otherwise remain in  foster care for a considerable period of time.  Under these  circumstances, the major outcome variables used in the  evaluation would be the percentage of children reunified and  the length of time spent in foster care before reunification  occurred.  However, if some programs are serving children  who, at the time of referral, have already returned home or  are about to return home, then the appropriate outcome  measures must be reconsidered.  Outcome measures such as  re-allegation of abuse and neglect and re-entry into foster  care would need to be examined.</p>
<p>In the 26 states we contacted as part of this review, we  asked about the existence of reunification programs.  We  identified reunification program models using a process  similar to the process we used to identify placement  prevention programs.  Both statewide and county  reunification program models were identified with some  states and counties identifying more than one program model.   In general, the states that had a statewide model for  placement prevention also had a statewide model for  reunification; however, there were considerably fewer  reunification programs.  States and counties with multiple  placement prevention models also had multiple reunification  programs.</p>
<p>We identified twenty-six programs in 15 states.  A  summary chart appears at the end of this chapter, (Exhibit  III-7), that provides available information on all 26  programs.  We note that some of these programs were very  recent, and policies regarding eligibility and service  delivery had not been established (e.g., both programs in  Colorado).    </p>
<p>Programs that were an integral part of the family  preservation program indicated that only a small percentage  of cases served were reunification cases.  These programs  typically provided aftercare services.  Because these  programs provided identical services to reunification cases  and placement prevention cases, they often did not keep data  that differentiated between these cases, nor did they have  explicit referral criteria for reunification cases.  These  programs include both programs in Oregon and the statewide  program in Minnesota.  In Utah, there was a reunification  program in place for several years that was currently  undergoing a complete reorganization.  Since there was  little information available on the characteristics of these  programs or the families that they served, they are not  included in the analysis provided in Section B (below) that  focuses on the 20 programs identified in Exhibit III-1.   </p>
<h4>B. Analysis of Reunification Programs</h4>
<h2>1. Relationship to Placement Prevention Programs</h2>
<p>It is important to distinguish between reunification  programs that are an integral part of the placement  prevention program and reunification programs that stand  alone.  A stand alone program is defined as one which has a  distinct service delivery model and/or separate staff, units  or providers that serve reunification services and referral  practices.  As shown in Exhibit III-1, these included eight  programs that are part of the placement prevention program,  11 programs that have distinct reunification programs, and  one program that is a mixture of combined and distinct  programs depending upon the service provider.  </p>
<p>[Exhibit II-1 here is a list of reunification programs.]</p>
<p>It is somewhat questionable whether all of the programs  that are an integral part of a placement prevention program  can truly be considered reunification programs.  As  described later in this section, most of these programs  serve children who have already returned home.  Their goal  is to ensure the child's safety and prevent the need for  another foster care placement.</p>
<p>Although the state and county child welfare officials  described these efforts as reunification programs, we might  consider an alternative description.  These programs serve  cases that might be considered placement prevention cases  that are referred for services through a different process.   Instead of being referred by CPS investigative staff because  a child is at risk of imminent placement, they are referred  by foster care workers when the child's return home is  imminent, but there is a high risk that the child may  re-enter foster care.  An evaluation of such cases would be  based on examining subsequent abuse or neglect allegations  and rates of replacement in foster care.</p>
<h2>2. Program Models/Caseload Size and Duration</h2>
<p>Like the placement prevention programs, most  reunification programs provide a mixture of concrete  services and counseling, primarily in a family's home or  where the child is currently residing.  Programs differ,  however, on the intensity and duration of service.  Although  most programs specify an average caseload size and service  duration, some programs make case specific decisions  regarding length of service and determine the number of  cases assigned to a specific worker based on the  characteristics and complexity of his or her caseload.   Exhibit III-2 indicates the relationship of caseload size  and service duration and identifies those programs which  vary along one or both of these dimensions.</p>
<p>The findings presented in this exhibit resemble those  described for the placement prevention programs.  As service  intensity decreases, length of service increases.  However,  the reunification programs are likely to provide services  for a longer time than the placement prevention programs.   The programs that provide a very brief period of service are  those that provide reunification services as part of their  placement prevention program.</p>
<p>[Exhibit III-2 here describes caseload size and duration  for programs.]</p>
<p>It is important to note that the program in New York  City departs from the other reunification programs examined  in one respect.  Rather than identifying a specific  caseload, service duration, or set of services, decisions  regarding service delivery are made by the private agencies  and public agency staff who have responsibility for the  child's placement in foster care.  They are given a fixed  amount of funding and are expected to use it to deliver,  arrange or provide the services necessary to effect  reunification.  In other words, the New York City program is  a managed care program.  As a result, there is no single  service intervention to evaluate.  Rather than determining  the efficacy of a specific intervention, the New York  evaluation would examine whether or not a managed care  system is a cost effective approach to serving children who  are in foster care.</p>
<h2>3. Program Maturity</h2>
<p>The date programs began operation is shown in Exhibit  III-1.  There appears to be a relationship between the  maturity of the reunification program and whether it is a  distinct program or part of a placement prevention program.   Of the 20 programs with available data, only 7 programs were  in operation before 1990.  Five of these programs are an  integral part of the placement prevention program.  Only two  programs, both operating in Bexar County, Texas, were  established as independent reunification programs in the  1980s.</p>
<p>In contrast, seven programs were established in 1993 or  1994, and six of these are distinct reunification programs  (Montgomery County, Alabama; Michigan; Missouri; New York  City; Allegheny County, Pennsylvania - long-term; and  Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania).  The remaining six  programs for which we have start dates, were established  between 1990 and 1992.  Three of these have a distinct  reunification program.</p>
<p>As discussed in Chapter I, program maturity was one of  the initial site selection criteria.  While the majority of  placement prevention programs meet this criterion, most  reunification programs do not.  When the programs that are  an integral part of the placement prevention program are  excluded from consideration, only five reunification  programs remain in operation for more than two years.</p>
<h2>4. Program Size</h2>
<p>From an evaluation standpoint, program size is the  characteristic that is of greatest concern.  As shown in  Exhibit III-3, of the 16 programs providing data, only five  served more than 100 families (Los Angeles, Sacremento, and  San Diego California; New York City, New York; and Allegheny  County, Pennsylvania).  Sacramento, New York City and  Allegheny County serve primarily child welfare cases, Los  Angeles and San Diego serve cases referred from other  agencies as well.  Only New York City and Los Angeles serve  enough cases to meet the estimated sample size of 250 cases  in the experimental group.</p>
<p>The question of program size is further complicated by  the fact that four programs accept cases from multiple  sources.  An additional four programs serve primarily child  welfare cases, but may accept cases from other sources.  If  cases referred from other agencies are excluded from the  study, then the potential sample sizes would be even smaller  in several sites.</p>
<p>Since most programs do not even come close to achieving  the necessary sample sizes, the implications of this finding  for site selection will require further review.</p>
<p>[Exhibit III-3 here describes the number of families  served by programs and referral sources.]</p>
<h2>5. Status of Child's Return Home</h2>
<p><b> </b>As previously discussed, some of the  reunification programs serve families for whom reunification  has already occurred or is expected to occur in a matter of  days or weeks.  Exhibit III-4 provides information on the  status of the child's return home at the time of case  referral.  For two programs (Florida-FB and Allegheny  County, Pennsylvania's Crisis Program), services begin  immediately after the child has returned home.</p>
<p>For nine programs, the child is expected to return home  within a specified time period, ranging from 1 to 12 weeks.   Child welfare administrators indicated that for programs  serving families on the brink of reunification (scheduled to  occur in one to three weeks), the decision to reunify has  been made, and reunification is almost certain to occur  irrespective of the outcomes of the services provided.</p>
<p>For seven of the programs, the status of the case at the  time of referral may vary.   These programs serve cases in  which the case plan goal is reunification; however, in some  instances the decision to return the child home within a few  weeks has been made, while for others, a date for  reunification has not been determined.  </p>
<p>The differences among programs concerning the likelihood  of reunification affect the nature of the services  delivered.  As shown in Exhibit III-5, programs in which  reunification is almost certain to occur primarily provide  aftercare services to the child and family.  As previously  noted, the goal of such programs is to ensure the child's  safety and prevent the need to place the child in foster  care again.</p>
<h2>6. Referral Criteria</h2>
<p>Although some programs do not specify a time period in  which children will be reunified, and they provide services  both prior to and after reunification occurs, they have  other case referral criteria that may also affect the  likelihood or reunification.  Most notably these criteria  relate to the length of time a child must have been in  foster care before referral to the reunification program.</p>
<p>[Exhibit III-4 here describes the status of child's  return home at time of referral for reunification services.]</p>
<p>[Exhibit III-5 here describes the extent to which  aftercare services are provided.]</p>
<p>Programs fall into three categories:  (1) those that  target children who have recently entered foster care; (2)  those that target children who have been in foster care for  a specified minimum period of time (ranging from at least  three months to at least one year) and, (3) those that do  not specify a foster care length of stay.  Exhibit III-6  provides information concerning this variable.</p>
<p>Although the majority of programs do not specify a  minimum period of time in foster care before referral, those  that do are likely to be serving different subpopulations.   These </p>
<p>differences are likely to result in different service  delivery patterns as well as differences in the likelihood  of reunification.  Again, this raises the question of  determining the appropriate outcome measures.</p>
<p>For the six programs that begin reunification services  virtually at the time of entry, the intent is to begin  services before allowing "foster care drift" to  occur.  Early onset of services can also ensure that a  parent and child do not lose contact with one another.  In  the absence of other criteria that specify referral of cases  that are identified as particularly problematic, caseloads  in these programs will include families whose problems vary  in severity.</p>
<p>In contrast, two programs target children who have been  in care for at least three months.  The New York City  program specifies a minimum of three months, but notes that  most children have been in care much longer.  This program  initially served children who had been in care at least two  years.  Bexar County (Long term), expects that cases  referred will have been in foster care at least six months.   Children referred to these programs are likely to have  already experienced foster care drift, and the ties to their  parents may have been somewhat eroded.  Such cases are  likely to be more problematic and, in the absence of other  referral criteria, may have a lower probability of  reunification or may require services for a longer period of  time to reach that goal.  Bexar County's Long-term program  allows for services for up to nine months.  The New York  City program varies the length of service, based on family  needs.</p>
<p>[Exhibit III-6 here describes children's length of time  in foster care prior to referral to reunification services.]</p>
<p>In addition to targeting children who have either just  been placed or those who have already spent some time in  foster care, some programs have targeted children of a  certain age or those who are in more expensive placements.   Programs in Florida and Allegheny County (crisis),  Pennsylvania generally serve younger children (under 5 years  in Florida); however, the programs do not mandate that the  children be under a certain age.  In Bexar County Texas, the  families in the crisis intervention program tend to be  parents with young children, while families served in the  long-term program are more likely to have older children.   Iowa targets children in group care, and New York City  targets children in foster boarding homes, including  relatives' homes.  These criteria or referral practices are  likely to effect both the nature of the service delivery and  the outcomes achieved.</p>
<p>For programs that did not specify referral criteria, it  is difficult to determine whether the population they serve  is heterogenous, or whether there are informal referral  practices that limit the nature of the cases served.  We  will require a more detailed understanding of referral  criteria and population characteristics for site selection.</p>
<h2>7. Service Providers</h2>
<p>Reunification services are provided by private and  public agencies.  In five  programs, services are provided  by the public agency.  In 14 programs, services are provided  by private agencies.  In two programs, both public and  private agencies provide reunification services.   (Program-by-program breakdowns are provided in Exhibit  III-7.) </p>
<p>As noted in the previous chapter, public or private  sector service provision is not of concern for site  selection purposes.  However, the number of providers within  a program area may have an effect on the consistency with  which services are delivered and the ease with which data  can be collected.  Of the county-wide programs operated by  private providers, five have three or more agencies that  provide reunification services.  In Los Angeles, 18  networks, each including multiple providers, deliver  reunification services.  In New York City, 6 agencies are  involved in the managed care reunification program.  Among  the statewide programs, Connecticut contracts with 11  providers, Iowa with 10, Missouri with 10, New York with 24,  and Tennessee with 15 providers.</p>
<p>Because most programs serve such a small number of  families, there will be a need to include multiple  providers, where appropriate, in order to achieve the  necessary sample sizes. </p>
<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>
<h2>DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED PLACEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>This Appendix presents more detailed information on the  following states:  Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida,  Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York,  Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington.  At  least one program in each state is a potential candidate for  site selection.  These states were selected because they met  most of the criteria previously described.  The criterion  most programs had difficulty meeting concerns sample size;  however, to the extent that all of the selected states  except California and Ohio have statewide programs, it may  be possible to combine local programs implementing the same  model to achieve necessary sample sizes.  The counties  described in California serve enough families to meet the  sample size criterion.  </p>
<h2>1. Alabama</h2>
<p>The family preservation program in Alabama, Family  Options, began in 1989.  Since 1991, the state has operated  under a consent decree that, by 1999, will guarantee to all  children in foster care and at risk of entering care the  right to treatment and services.  As a result, groups of  counties comprising 15 percent of the child welfare  population begin each year the process of converting their  child welfare programs to emphasize family-based services.   Each successive group of counties has one and one-half years  to complete their conversion process before they are held  accountable by the state's quality assurance system and the  federal court monitor for operating according to the consent  decree. </p>
<p>The conversion includes an enhanced emphasis on  preventive services aimed at both preserving families and  avoiding unnecessary foster care placement.  For example,  social workers now must receive the Alabama Certification  Training (ACT).  According to the state representative, the  training teaches workers to work "aggressively" to  keep families safely together.  Under the consent decree,  counties also have been allocated new flexible funds  available at the local level to be used for individual  families' needs.</p>
<p>Currently, there are seven family preservation programs  that serve 19 of Alabama's 67 counties, (Several of the  programs operate regionally).  A state-funded Family Options  Unit in the Family and Children's service program of the  County Department of Human Resources provides the services.   Among the largest programs are the Family Options programs  in Madison, Montgomery, and Jefferson counties.   </p>
<p>According to state officials, the seven programs serve  50 percent of the children who have a chance to enter the  foster care system statewide.  The State plans to expand the  services this year by funding two additional programs that  will serve two counties.  These new programs will be served  by a team of private community providers based on the Family  Option model. </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>The Family Options program follows the Homebuilders  model.  Workers serve caseloads of two families for four-six  weeks.  According to the state, the programs usually stick  to a four-week intervention.  Jefferson County reported that  during the intervention period, an average of 40  face-to-face hours of counseling and services are provided.   Flexible funds are available, although they are minimal:   Montgomery County reported having $30 per family; Jefferson  County was not specific, but also said it was a small fund.   However, all families served through these two counties,  because they are converting their operations to achieve the  terms of the consent decree, may have additional flexible  funds spent to prevent unnecessary placement in care.</p>
<p>In FY 94, Jefferson County's Family Options served 55  families (operating at capacity), and Montgomery County's  program served 75 families.  According to the state, in the  fourth quarter of FY 94, Montgomery County had 70 abuse  neglect reports and 181 children in foster care; Madison  County had 240 reports and 283 children in care.  Jefferson  County reported that for FY 94, there were 2,587 reports of  abuse and neglect.  New admissions into foster care totaled  258, there were 90 re-admissions, and 266 children left  care.  At the end of the year in Jefferson County, there  were 596 children in foster care in Jefferson County.  </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Alabama's counties are going to great lengths to reduce  the need for court proceedings or placement of children.   Reports of child abuse and/or neglect are referred to the  Child Abuse and Neglect Assessment Unit for assessment  (investigation).  Following the assessment, the case may be  unfounded and closed, opened for ongoing protective or  preservation services, or the child may be brought into  foster care, if he or she cannot safely remain at home.  If  the Assessment Unit worker determines that the child can be  left in the home, he/she develops a short term  Individualized Service Plan (ISP) together with the family  and with the help of a supervisor.  This plan may include an  immediate referral to family preservation or a referral to  any other ongoing services.  </p>
<p>Families referred for ongoing services may later be  assigned to Family Options.  Families initially assigned to  foster care also may be referred later to Family Options, so  long as the child has not been in care for more than 30  days.  A permanent Individual Service Plan is developed for  each family in the program after the family has stabilized,  and in conjunction with the family, the family workers, and  any others whom the family requests.   </p>
<p>Currently the target population for the Family Options  program is children (0-18) at-risk of removal or at-risk of  entering state-paid care within 5 days.  While clients from  the juvenile justice and mental health systems may be  served, they must enter through an abuse and neglect report,  a judge's court order, or by a parent attempting to  voluntarily place a child in foster care.  </p>
<p>Imminent risk is determined by the worker and is based  on the worker's assessment of the family's history and  current situation, and on the family's willingness to  participate in the program.</p>
<p>There is county variation in the populations served and  types of cases excluded from services.  For example:</p>
<ul><li>Jefferson County reported that it tended to serve  single-parent families.  Families must be willing to work  with the program.  Almost all of the referrals to Jefferson  County in 1994 were child welfare referrals except for 5-10  percent which were court-ordered referrals for children in  need of supervision (CHINS).  In FY 94, 108 families were  referred to the program for services, and an additional 26  for consultation only.  Of the 108 families referred for  services, 75 were accepted; 20 of these did not complete the  initial 72 hour assessment period put in place by the  program.  Of the 33 families that were not accepted, 20 were  refused by the program because there was no vacancy and 13  were refused because the child referred was not at imminent  risk of placement.  </li>
<li>The Montgomery County program requires at least one  adult willing to work with the program.  If the child at  risk of placement is a teenager, he or she must agree to  stay in the home.  The program declines very few cases.  It  does exclude cases of sexual abuse if the perpetrator is in  the home and there is no "safety net," and cases  involving mentally ill caretakers, if the caretakers are not  in touch with reality.  The program does not screen out  cases involving substance abusers, but notes that these are  the least successful cases.   </li>
</ul><h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>Each month, each county Family Options Unit reports  service utilization and case data to the State Coordinator  who oversees the Family Options program.  In addition,  children and families served through Family Options are  tracked at three, six, nine, and twelve month intervals  after the service intervention to determine whether the  children have successfully remained safely in the home.  The  criterion for determining success is based on the number of  children served who have not entered state paid care for a  period greater than fourteen days any time over the past  three, six, nine, and twelve month intervals.  For Fiscal  Year 1994, data is available for six of the seven county  programs which indicates that, 84 percent of the children  served for the twelve months in the calendar year safely  remained with their families.  Of those served, the programs  have a success rate that ranges from 73.8 to 88 percent for  the year.  </p>
<h2>2. Arizona</h2>
<p>Arizona has been operating its family preservation  programs since 1989.  Services for CPS clients are provided  through the state's Department of Economic Security (DES),  Division of Social Services by private contractors.   Currently, there are family preservation programs in each of  the state's six districts, but not in every county.  By the  end of FY 95, there will be a total of 25 family  preservation services teams across the state.  There are  also family preservation programs provided through the state  mental health and juvenile justice agencies by private  contractors.  </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Currently, there are nine private providers of family  preservation services to CPS clients.  Of these, three serve  the Phoenix area, and two serve the Tucson area.  Together,  these two areas contain the majority of the state's general  and child welfare populations.  Statewide, in 1993  approximately 195 families received services.  The statewide  model of family preservation prescribes six-eight weeks of  service with a possible extension of four weeks.  There is  some variation in how private providers structure their  family preservation programs.  For example, in Tucson, the  two providers, Arizona Children's Home Association (ACHA)  and Our Town each have a different program model.</p>
<p>·<b>Arizona Children's Home Association.</b>  The  ACHA program established in 1989, is an eight-week program  that uses two-person teams (therapist and parent aide) and  has a caseload of six families per team.  The model provides  structural strategic therapy in addition to concrete  services.  Flexible funding of $300 is available per family.   In FY 93, ACHA served 34 families.&lt;16&gt;</p>
<p>ACHA is the largest provider of family preservation  services in Arizona.  In addition to the DES program, it has  two other family preservation contracts.  The agency  contracts with mental health in Phoenix to provide a  five-week intensive program established in 1992.  This  program uses three-person teams which include a special  education teacher and focuses particularly on behavior  management.  These teams carry a caseload of 10 families.   The Association also has a contract with juvenile court to  provide Renewing Arizona's Family Traditions (RAFT) to  probation clients.  RAFT uses a four-week, two cases per  worker, Homebuilders model.  </p>
<p>·<b>Our Town.  </b>Our Town provides a  Homebuilders model (four weeks, two families per worker).   In FY 93, Our Town served 35 families.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Referrals to the family preservation program are made by  CPS intake workers, in consultation with their supervisors.   Currently, the state's child welfare program serves only CPS  families.  However, as mentioned earlier, several of the  providers, such as Arizona Children's Home, have contracts  with other agencies (such as probation and mental health) to  provide family preservation services to their clients.     </p>
<p>No imminent risk criteria are provided by the state.   The workers use their own judgment concerning risk of  placement. </p>
<p>State program definition prohibits the program from  serving:  substance abusers when an abuser was unwilling to  seek treatment, severely retarded parents, and parents  exhibiting psychotic behavior.  The Arizona Children's Home  Association reports that it is dealing more often with  sexual abuse cases and is beginning to focus more on cases  involving chronic chemical dependency.  The respondents  noted that the criteria are looser in rural areas.  The  Association will take referrals there that they might refuse  in Phoenix or Tucson, where there are more available  resources.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The state completed an analysis of Arizona's family  preservation services in FY 93.&lt;17&gt;  This evaluation  focused on three areas:  </p>
<ul><li> information on client families;  </li>
<li> information on program outcomes; and   </li>
<li> information on program costs.  </li>
</ul><p>The evaluation found that a total of 195 families with  567 children were accepted to the program during FY 93.   Most of the children who entered the program (67 percent)  were age ten or younger.  The average family was enrolled in  the program for 56 days, and received an average of 45  direct service hours.  Follow-up services were provided to  57 percent of the families after they exited the program,  usually community-based services. </p>
<p>Outcomes were based on before-and-after comparisons  conducted in three areas:  the risk levels of families, the  number of substantiated reports of maltreatment, and the  number of out-of-home placements.  No control group was used  for this comparison.  The evaluation reports that the  program enjoyed a high degree of success based on these  criteria.  </p>
<p>The average program cost per family was calculated at  $2,901.  Emergency grants provided to 38 percent of the  families by the program averaged $123.  Families spent these  grants on car and household repairs, rent, food, and  utilities.</p>
<h2>3. California</h2>
<p>California has had family preservation programs in place  for over a decade. Original authorizing legislation funded a  number of demonstration sites to provide preplacement  prevention services.  Subsequent legislation provided  funding through a competitive process to four pilot  counties.  Beginning in 1993, state authorizing legislation  opened up the potential for program funding to any county  that wishes to apply.  Currently, California has  state-subsidized family preservation programs available in  16 counties.  </p>
<p>Any county that wishes to receive state funding for a  family preservation program must submit a plan for services  that specifies how foster care placements will be  redirected. Subject to state approval of the county's plan,  each county can design and provide its own continuum of  services, including reunification services.  Savings in  foster care dollars are also projected by the county.   Counties that do not meet these projections in out-years can  lose part of their state contribution.  </p>
<p>Following are details of the programs in Contra Costa,  Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Solano counties.   According to the state representative and others, these are  among the largest and best-established programs in  California.</p>
<h2> a. Contra Costa County</h2>
<p>Family preservation services in Contra Costa County are  provided by FamiliesFirst, a private, non-profit agency  under contract to the county.  The program includes the  usual range of concrete and support services.</p>
<p>In addition to the Families First program, Contra Costa  County has contracted with five community agencies to  provide after-care, such as parent education, parent aides,  and counseling.  Service may be provided for up to one year  after the intensive program ends.</p>
<p>FamiliesFirst is the only provider of intensive  crisis-oriented services in the county.</p>
<p>In 1994, 774 children entered foster care in Contra  Costa County.  Of these, 589 were referred by DSS and 185 by  Probation.</p>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>The Contra Costa County program was established in 1988.   It follows a modified Homebuilders model.  The caseload for  the program is two to three families per worker.  Service is  provided for four to six weeks, except for cases referred by  the mental health agency, which receive service for eight  weeks.  Flexible funds are available to provide less  intense, longer term services to families through  specialized contracts.  Third party and private pay  contracts are also accepted for individualized Family  Preservation Services.  </p>
<p>The objectives of the program are to ensure safety,  negotiate outcomes, achieve those outcomes, and prevent  placement.  Success is defined case by case and involves  assessing the family's behavior and acquisition of skills.   </p>
<p>The program operates at capacity.  It served 178  families in 1994.</p>
<p>Families in Contra Costa are eligible for aftercare  services by five designated agencies within the three county  regions.  The services range from individual and family  services to in-home support services.  All services are  available for a minimum of six months and a maximum of one  year.</p>
<p>2) Operation        </p>
<p>FamiliesFirst serves children age 0-18 at risk of  placement.  Referrals come from CPS (60%) and Probation  (40%), and under a separate contract, from the county mental  health agency (15-20 families per year). </p>
<p>There are no guidelines for determining risk of imminent  placement:  the determination is made by the referring  worker and, according to the county contact, interpretation  varies widely. Referrals from Probation follow a suspended  court order for placement.  Referrals from CPS follow the  filing of an abuse/neglect petition. </p>
<p>Contra Costa County has a Review Committee that screens  worker referrals.  Occasionally, in an emergency, a case is  referred directly, but it is later referred to the Committee  for review.  FamiliesFirst may screen referrals also, but  usually only to determine whether the referral is timely.  </p>
<p>Criteria for acceptance into the program are broadly  defined.  The program includes substance abusing parents.   It excludes families in which there has been a death caused  by a parent; homeless families; psychotics who refuse  medication; and sexual abuse cases if the perpetrator (other  than a sibling perpetrator) is still in the home.</p>
<h2>b. Los Angeles County</h2>
<p>The Los Angeles County Family Preservation Program (FPP)  has been in operation since 1991.  It is operated by the  County under contracts with lead agencies for Community  Family Preservation Networks.  Funding for the FPP comes  from state funds administered by the county  Department of  Children and Family Services.  A citizen's advisory group  helps to set policy and direction and oversees the operation  of the program.  The Family Preservation Program began with  nine networks in the six Los Angeles County Community areas  with the highest number of foster care placements.  In 1994,  three more communities and networks were added, and three  additional networks were added to the original nine in the  initial six community areas.  FPP currently comprises 18  separate programs, including 15 community family  preservation networks and 3 special county programs for  Black and Latino families.  Each of the networks is led by a  different community agency (which sub-contracts with other  local agencies).  The overall program includes placement  prevention, reunification, and juvenile diversions.  </p>
<p>Since January 1993, FPP has served 7,000 children,  one-third of these with reunification services, and  two-thirds with placement prevention services.  In 1994,  13,359 children entered foster care in Los Angeles County.   Of these, 11,881 were referred by child welfare and 1,478 by  Probation.  </p>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>The Los Angeles program has developed its own service  model, having rejected the Homebuilders model in favor of a  program that provides Homebuilder-type services coupled with  21 other services that include accessing health, education  and social services at the community level.  </p>
<p>The program defines family preservation as "an  integrated, comprehensive approach to strengthening and  preserving families who are at risk of or already  experiencing problems in family functioning with the goal of  assuring the physical, emotional, social, educational,  cultural and spiritual development of children in a safe,  secure and nurturing environment."  The program goals  are to assure the safety of children; empower families to  resolve their own problems; build on family strengths;  identify problems early and solve them; involve the  community in family support; decrease the need for public  resources over time; and break multi-generational dependency  upon public services. </p>
<p>The community network outreach workers carry a caseload  of 5-8 families.  Services are usually provided for 3-12  months, average 4.9 months, and must be reauthorized every 3  months.  Services can extend beyond one year, with the  approval of the Deputy Director of the Department of  Children and Family Services.  Cases are closed when the  child is no longer at risk.  DCFS workers serve as case  managers and carry a caseload of about 38 children. </p>
<p>2) Operation     </p>
<p>Cases are referred from Probation and CPS and are  assigned to the appropriate community network for services.   These networks provide both direct services and linkages to  other agencies.  The direct services include  in-home/outreach service and several types of counseling;  homemakers; emergency caretakers; parent training;  transportation; mental health treatment matched with  Medi-Cal; therapeutic day treatment; auxiliary funds; and  self-help groups. The linkages are made to a range of  agencies providing such services as substance abuse testing  and treatment, housing, employment support, health care,  child care, education and developmental services.</p>
<p>The program began with a focus on imminent risk of  placement, but it found that local agencies had to broaden  their referral criteria to include cases in which there is a  problem with family functioning in order to receive adequate  funding.  The family rate per month payment mechanism  resembles an HMO arrangement with flexibility in use of the  capitated funding.  The program does not screen out cases  referred to it, however, referral sources exclude cases  involving sex offenders with uncontrolled access to children  and families that refuse services. </p>
<h2> c. Sacramento</h2>
<p>Family preservation services have been provided in  Sacramento County since 1991.  The program began with two  units and expanded by two additional units in 1992 and 1993.   The program, called Family Preservation and Child  Protection (FPCP), is one of five divisions within the  Department of Health and Human Services.  Public staff from  the FPCP division provide all case management activities,  and the program contracts with nine partner agencies to  provide client services such as drug counseling, service  centers, homeless family shelters, anger control counseling,  family support, and housing assistance.  Other services,  such as mental health services, nursing, and drug and  alcohol counseling are provided by public employees from  within the Department.  </p>
<p>Annually, the county receives about 3,000 reports of  child abuse and neglect per month, and responds to  approximately 500 of these.  Currently in the county, 3,000  children are in foster care, with 633 entering in 1994.   </p>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>Family preservation services in Sacramento County are  provided by a team of a social worker and a family support  worker who serve 8-10 families each.  Services are provided  for 90 days, with extensions possible.  Clients are involved  for approximately 5-20 hours per week (including services  provided by contract agencies), and families are able to  access a program social worker via the 24 hours a day, seven  days a week emergency response line.  </p>
<p>The Family Preservation/Emergency Response Unit targets  multiple referral cases and pregnant adolescents.  With the  latter group, services are provided pre-birth and 90 days  post delivery.  The Family Preservation units in Family  Maintenance and Family Reunification target imminent risk  cases.  The Family Preservation/Emergency Response Program  is considered a primary prevention program.</p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>The program keeps accumulative statistics on the number  of children served since 1991.  It is estimated that  approximately 65 family cases were referred and accepted  each month (or approximately 1,000 children per year).  The  majority of these referrals originate following a child  placed in protective custody and involve neglect and drugs.   In addition, approximately one percent of referrals  originate from mental health, and the program is required to  accept 200 female juvenile justice referrals per year.  The  program accepts all cases (including substance abuse) with  the exception of those involving sexual abuse.  However, the  program will continue to serve such cases if sexual abuse  comes to light after the case has been accepted.  </p>
<p>The average age of the parent served is 31, and the  average age of the child is six.  Most of those referred are  poor and live in urban areas; the majority of those served  live in the eight highest poverty areas in the city.   </p>
<p>CPS cases enter family preservation through either the  24-hour emergency response line or the Dependent Intake  Unit.  Cases that enter through the emergency response line  are assessed for imminent risk and referred by the  Assessment worker and his or her supervisor.  Cases that  enter through the Dependent Intake Unit are assessed for  imminent risk and referred by the Assessment worker and  supervisor and by a family preservation worker and  supervisor.  After the assessment is completed, a decision  is made to:  screen the case out, refer to child welfare  services (Family Maintenance), refer the child to family  preservation services, or place the child in foster care on  an emergency basis.  </p>
<h2> d. San Diego County</h2>
<p>San Diego's Intensive Family Preservation program has  been in existence since January 1991.  The program operates  as a division within the county CPS office and is staffed by  CPS employees.  It serves high-risk families, using both  child welfare staff and private providers.  Moderate and  low-risk families are served by private providers who are  under contract to the agency.  A case manager oversees these  cases and controls the services provided and their  intensity.  </p>
<p>In 1994, the intensive family preservation program  estimates they served approximately 230 families.  The  program operates at capacity.  That year, there were an  average of 6,390 reports of child abuse and neglect per  month in San Diego county.  The average monthly number of  children in foster care totaled 5,481.  An average of 2,400  children enter foster care each year. </p>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>Services in the intensive program are flexible and  designed  to meet the needs of the  individual family.  Some  cases are teamed, others are served by a single caseworker.   Service duration varies from two weeks to 90 days, with  extensions permissible up to nine months.  Caseworkers are  assigned no more than four cases (most have three on  average).  A maximum of $500 per month in flexible funds is  available.  </p>
<p>Services provided include traditional family  preservation services such as counseling and also include  public health, mental health, substance abuse treatment,  transitional residential, and international liaison services  for recent immigrants.  All of these services are provided  by program staff.  Additional services are furnished by  private providers on a contractual basis.  </p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>There are multiple referral sources for the San Diego  family preservation program, including CPS, child welfare  services, juvenile justice, courts, developmental  disabilities, mental retardation, mental health, and  children in residential care.  In addition, program staff  routinely track cases in foster care and advocate that they  be referred for intensive services. Imminent risk is not a  criteria for referral, although the program contact stresses  that many of these cases are served.  During November 1994,  49 cases were referred, 23 were rejected, and 19 were  opened.</p>
<p>The program contact also stresses that the program  serves many types of families and problems, including sexual  and substance abuse cases.  The program does not accept  cases in which there is a high probability of a child's  death.  The program defines these cases as cases involving  psychotic parents, parents with IQs below 70, cases of  sadistic abuse, and cases in which a child has sustained  serious blows to the head, burns, or bone breaks.  The  program also excludes parents whom a psychiatric evaluation  has found incapable of parenting.  </p>
<h2> e.  Solano County</h2>
<p>Family preservation services in Solano county are  provided by FamiliesFirst, a private, non-profit agency  under contract to the county.  The program provides both  family preservation and reunification services.  It includes  the usual range of concrete and support services.</p>
<p>FamiliesFirst is the only provider of intensive  crisis-oriented services in the county.  Solano County  Department of Social Services has some family preservation  workers who provide ongoing services.</p>
<p>In 1994, 300 children entered foster care in Solano  County.  Of these, 148 were referred by DSS and 152 by  Probation.  </p>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>The Solano County program was established in 1983.  It  follows a modified Homebuilders model.  The caseload for the  program is two to three families per worker.  Service is  provided for four to six weeks.  Flexible funds are  available to provide less intense, longer term services to  families through specialized contracts.  Third party and  private pay contracts are also accepted for individualized  Family Preservation Services. </p>
<p>The objectives of the program are to ensure safety,  negotiate outcomes, achieve those outcomes, and prevent  placement.  Success is defined case by case and involves  assessing the family's behavior and acquisition of skills.   </p>
<p>The program operates at capacity.  It served 92 families  in 1994. </p>
<p>2) Operation        </p>
<p>FamiliesFirst serves children age 0-18 at risk of  placement.  Referrals come from CPS (60%) and Probation  (40%).</p>
<p>There are no guidelines for determining risk of imminent  placement:  the determination is made by the referring  worker and, according to the county contact, interpretation  varies widely. Referrals from Probation follow a suspended  court order for placement.  </p>
<p>Solano County has a Review Committee that screens worker  referrals.  Occasionally, in an emergency, a case is  referred directly, but it is later referred to the Committee  for review.  FamiliesFirst may screen referrals also, but  usually only to determine whether the referral is timely.  </p>
<p>Criteria for acceptance into the program are broadly  defined.  The program includes substance abusing parents.   It excludes families in which there has been a death caused  by a parent; homeless families; psychotics who refuse  medication; and sexual abuse cases if the perpetrator (other  than a sibling perpetrator) is still in the home. </p>
<h2>f. Evaluation</h2>
<p><b>Statewide evaluation.  </b>Walter R. McDonald and  Associates (WRMA) has conducted several evaluations of  California's effort to impact foster care placement.  These  evaluations are funded through the state authorizing  legislation.  </p>
<p>Currently, ten sites are being evaluated.  Nine of these  sites are providing case-specific data through  mini-automated systems. The tenth, Los Angeles County, is  undergoing a separate process evaluation.  This evaluation  is entering its second year.  For a previous evaluation,  completed in 1990, WRMA collected data on over 700 families  that were referred to family preservation services. These  data included:  </p>
<ul><li> the characteristics of the families and children  served;   </li>
<li> the kinds of problems they faced;   </li>
<li> services planned and provided; and   </li>
<li> placement outcomes for the eight months following  referral to the program.    </li>
</ul><p>In addition, during the third year of this evaluation,  five programs participated in a comparison study in which  data were collected on a group of families and children  referred for services.  These referrals were assigned to  either receive intensive in-home services or other child  welfare services.    </p>
<p>No significant differences in placement rates were  observed between these two groups.  Eighty-two percent of  the project's children in the treatment group were not  subsequently placed in foster care compared to 83 percent of  those in the control group.  Approximately one-quarter of  the families in each group had a subsequent investigation  for child abuse and neglect.  In addition, no significant  differences between the two groups were found in terms of  placement incidents, length of time in placement, and  overall placement costs.    </p>
<p><b>Contra Costa and Solano Counties.  </b>Families  First, the family preservation program in Contra Costa and  Solano Counties, has been evaluated several times.  In  1987-88, the University of California-Davis conducted an  extensive evaluation of the program, using an experimental  design.  This research found that children whose families  received family preservation services did not require  outside placement at the rate of those in the conventional  group, who received only traditional counseling services.   Families First also was part of the WRMA evaluation and is  currently being evaluated by the State.  </p>
<p><b>Los Angeles County.  </b>The Los Angeles County  Family Preservation Program has recently undergone a process  evaluation by Walter R. McDonald and Associates.</p>
<p>In the three months since February 1992, the increase in  the number of foster care placements has risen 3 percent in  the initial 6 communities as compared to 36 percent in all  other communities in Los Angeles. </p>
<p><b>Sacramento and San Diego Counties.  </b>Sacramento  County (like the other 16 Family Preservation counties) was  involved in a year long comprehensive evaluation by Walter  McDonald, whose report is due in December 1995.  Since its  inception, Family Preservations' fiscal success and foster  care avoidance have been evaluated by the State.  County  statistics indicate over 90 percent of the children in  Family Preservation/Family Maintenance are home two years  after termination of Family Preservation services.  One  hundred percent of the children served by Emergency  Response/Family Preservation are home 1 year after  termination of services.</p>
<h2>4. Florida</h2>
<p>In Florida, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative  Services (DHRS) is responsible for the administration of  family preservation programs. There are two statewide  programs offered in all 15 DHR  districts: Intensive Crisis  Counseling Program (ICCP) and Family Builders (FB).  There  is variation in implementation among the districts.  Both  programs exist in all of the large population centers, but  some of the geographic areas are too large and not densely  populated enough to support one or the other  program.   Services are delivered by private providers contracting with  the 15 state districts. </p>
<p>Recent legislation establishing a "family response  system," has had an impact on who receives family  preservation services.  When a child abuse and neglect  report is received at the District level, families are  prioritized and placed into two groups:  1) Family Services  Response (FSR) or 2) Investigation.  Families that are sent  to FSR receive any type of family preservation service (home  maker, child care and intensive in-home services), without  entering the child welfare system.  Investigation families  enter the child welfare system and are investigated.  Some  of these families may later be referred for family  preservation services.   The Office of Alcohol, Drug Abuse  and Mental Health also has developed a family preservation  model called SEDNET, which works to stabilize severely  emotionally disturbed (SED) children in their families,  through a variety of community supports.  </p>
<p>According to the state contact, Hillsborough County (the  Tampa area) has one of the oldest and best-established  family preservation programs in Florida, and it has a  reunification program as well.  Details of the Hillsborough  County program are included in the following description.   </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>The two major family preservation programs in Florida  are ICCP and Family Builders (FB).</p>
<p><b>ICCP.  </b>ICCP, which began as a pilot program  1982, is the older and larger of the two Florida family  preservation models.  Staff of this program provide a basic  Homebuilders model, serving caseloads of two-four families  for service durations of four--six weeks.  While the program  itself does not have any flexible funds attached, new  legislation allows districts to use leftover emergency  assistance funds or foster care funds to help preserve  families.  ICCP workers use these dollars as flexible funds.   In FY 94, ICCP served 2,418 families statewide.  </p>
<p>In Hillsborough County, ICCP services have been somewhat  modified.  Family preservation services are provided by a  single private agency.  Service is provided by two-person  teams comprising a professional and a para-professional.   The caseload is six families per team.  The duration of  service is six weeks, with a possible two-week extension.</p>
<p>Hillsborough's ICCP serves about 225 families per year.   In 1994, 423 children entered foster care in the county.  In  December 1994 there were 1,075 children in foster care in  the county.  In November 1994, 1,072 families, representing  2,283 children, received protective services.     </p>
<p><b>Family Builders.</b>  Family Builders was  established in 1990.  The program pairs a professional with  a para-professional to provide services to four-six families  at a time.  The teams serve families for three-four months.   There is also up to $500 of flexible funding available per  family.  Florida officials consider this the more intensive  of their two programs.  It is possible that a family that "failed  in ICCP," might be referred to Family Builders, but for  the most part these programs are mutually exclusive.  </p>
<p>In FY 94, Family Builders served 1,397 families  statewide.  Discussions with the program contact revealed  that this underrepresented the actual number, since only 11  of the 15 districts had reported for the last quarter.  He  estimated the number should be 25 percent higher.</p>
<p>Some districts have modified the basic Family Builders  program.  In Jacksonville, for example, there is a  well-defined follow-up program which includes pairing  families with more functional community families for six  months after they leave the program.</p>
<p>Hillsborough County's Family Builders program sticks to  the model and uses two-person teams who carry a caseload of  six families per team.  Services are provided for 90 days  and may be extended for an additional month.  Family  Builders serves about 175 families per year. </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p><b>ICCP</b>.  Referrals to ICCP can come from juvenile  justice or child welfare, but they cannot be court ordered.   Ninety percent of the referrals come from child welfare.   According to the state contact, this is partly because  juvenile justice is developing its own program.  Referrals  generally come from investigators (75 percent), but can also  come from any other DHRS workers, (protective supervision,  adoption, foster care, or Voluntary Family Services worker).   </p>
<p>Imminent risk is required for entry into ICCP, but the  state has not defined the term.  According to the state  representative, workers use their own judgment to make the  determination.   To receive family preservation services  there must be a parent who is willing to work with the  program and substance abusers must be willing to accept  treatment.  Policy also states that there must be the  knowledge that with services, risk can be reduced. </p>
<p>The state representative noted that ICCP seems to be  serving families with older children.  There is some  district to district variation in target populations because  certain providers have contracted to serve special  populations, such as substance abusers, teen parents or  Spanish speaking populations.  </p>
<p>In Hillsborough County, the referring caseworker uses a  risk assessment tool to assess risk of imminent placement.   Workers have to determine that the child will be placed  within 24 hours to meet the imminent risk criterion.  The  program excludes families who are not willing to participate  in the program and substance abusers who are not willing to  accept treatment services.  </p>
<p><b> Family Builders.</b> The Family Builders target  population is similar to ICCP, but the program tends to  serve the more complex cases and younger children.  In most  cases, these children are under seven years old, and they  are more likely to be under five years old.  Imminent risk  is required for entry into Family Builders.  </p>
<p>In Hillsborough County, Family Builders excludes the  same types of families excluded from ICCP.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The state has just completed a two and a half year  evaluation of its family preservation programs.  The  evaluation was conducted with Florida State University in  the first four districts of Family Builders.  Hillsborough  County was among the sites studied.  </p>
<h2>5. Iowa</h2>
<p>Although family preservation services have been  available since 1974, the Iowa Family Preservation Program  (IFPP) began on a demonstration basis in 1987 and became  available statewide in the Fall of 1990.  Home-based  preventive services are available throughout the state  through a number of public and private providers, some of  which operate multiple sites across the state.  Among the  largest of these providers are: Lutheran Social Services,  Gerard Treatment Program, Alternative Treatment Associates  and Boys Town.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Throughout the state, two home-based preventive services  programs are available:  1) Iowa's Family Preservation  Program (IFPP) and 2) Family-Centered Services.  </p>
<p><b> IFPP.</b>  IFPP is housed within the Department of  Human Services in Des Moines and five regional offices.   Services are provided by ten agencies, some with multiple  sites across the state.  The basic outline of the program is  proscribed, including caseload size, service duration, and  core services to be provided.</p>
<p>The worker providing family preservation services is in  contact with the family every day at the start of the  intervention and is available to the family on a 24-hour  basis.  Caseload size averages 3.5 families per worker;  however, service standards for FY 95 shall reduce caseloads  to three families.  Services can be provided for up to 60  days, but the average length of service is about 45 days.   The services are geared toward providing immediate services  in order to relieve a crisis situation and include  restorative living skills, social skills, therapy and  counseling, psychological/social evaluations, and family  skills development.  Family preservation providers have  access to flexible family assistance funds to meet concrete  family needs.  </p>
<p>Polk County (Des Moines) is the largest catchment area  in Iowa.  In Polk, approximately 33 families are served  during a month.  With an average length of service delivery  of 45 days, approximately 297 families are served in a year.   The majority of the families in Polk are served through one  private agency.</p>
<p>In FY 94, there were 2,097 incidents of abuse or neglect  involving 3,264 children reported in Polk County.  Of these,  669 reports involving 919 children were substantiated.  The  average monthly number of children in foster care was 425.   In 1993, statewide, 2,415 families were provided intensive  family preservation services; over 2,450 were served in  1994.</p>
<p><b> Family-Centered Services.</b>  Iowa's  Family-Centered Services program is statewide and is also  targeted at families in crisis.  However, it is implemented  differently in every site.  Services are provided by a  combination of private providers and Department of Human  Services (DHS) staff.  </p>
<p>Most family-centered services are court-ordered.  The  services usually begin with contact with the family  approximately three times per week, although no caseload  size is prescribed.  The major components of family-centered  services are: parent skills training, therapy,  recreation/leisure, diagnosis and evaluation and  supervision.  Specific services include day care, homemaker,  therapy, and specialized assessments.  </p>
<p>Diagnosis and evaluation is limited to 45 days.  All  other components are limited to six months but can be  extended for another six months.  The average length of  intervention is seven and one-half months.  </p>
<p>In 1994, 2,500 families were provided family-centered  services statewide.  Boys Town provides an example of how  private providers may structure family-centered services.   The Boys Town family preservation program provides services  in six southwest Iowa counties and includes both an  intensive crisis program, which was established in 1989, and  an ongoing program, Family Center, which was established in  1994.  The programs are differentiated by the level of risk  in the family.  </p>
<p>At Boys Town, family preservation services are not time  limited.  The duration of services averages 7 weeks, but it  may last 20 weeks or more.  Boys Town workers carry a  caseload of two or three families each, and flexible funds  are available.  The program provides the usual range of  concrete and support services with an emphasis on teaching.</p>
<p>Last year, Boys Town's intensive program served a total  of 70 families, with one unit.  A second unit is being  added, and the program expects to serve 100 families this  year.  The ongoing program served eight families in 1994.   </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Iowa's 99 counties and regions both play a role in the  child welfare case flow.  Investigations and court  procedures take place on the county level.  Investigators or  judges refer cases to a regional Clinical Assessment and  Consultation Team (CACT).  The team also takes referrals  from juvenile justice and mental health, however 80 percent  of the family preservation referrals come from child  welfare.  </p>
<p>The CACT serves as gatekeeper for all services and  determines whether a family is appropriate for Family  Preservation.  CACT teams are available 24 hours a day.   When the CACT team has made the determination that the  family should receive family preservation services, the  family is given the choice of several providers.   </p>
<p>Some of the family preservation providers are the same  agencies who provide family-centered services.  Some  contracted providers may be targeted to serve specific </p>
<p>populations (e.g., a few mentally  retarded/developmentally disabled children are served  through family preservation, but more cases involve mentally  retarded parents than mentally retarded children).</p>
<p><b> IFFP.</b>  Families referred for family  preservation services must have a child at immediate or high  risk of placement and be willing to participate in the  program.  According to the state contact, the definitions of  risk levels have been operationalized;  we have requested a  copy of the operationalized definitions.  </p>
<p><b> Family-Centered Services.  </b>Family-centered  services are provided to the same target population as IFPP  services.  However, imminent risk of an out-of-home  placement is not required for entry into the family-centered  services program.  </p>
<p>The Boys Town family preservation program serves  children age 0-18 at risk of placement.  Referrals come from  DHS and may include abused and neglected children and  children referred from juvenile justice and mental health  agencies.  The only criteria for acceptance in the program  are a child at risk of placement and a parent willing to  accept services.  Referrals may occur at any time.  Boys  Town screens all cases referred, except for those in which  the parents refuse services or the risk to the child is  extreme.  The program provides the usual range of concrete  and support services, with an emphasis on teaching.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p><b>Statewide evaluation.  </b>Iowa State University  conducted an outcome evaluation in 1993.  This evaluation  was mandated by the state legislature.  It collected a large  amount of data and information on family preservation  services, but not on the other home-based services or foster  care.  The evaluation contained the following measures of  success:</p>
<ul><li> Family functioning:  Family Risk Scales were used at  beginning and end of intervention;   </li>
<li> Foster care avoidance:  The evaluation used avoidance  of placement at 30 days, six months and 12 months after end  of FP; dropping six month measure because essentially the  same as 12 months.    </li>
</ul><p>A continuing problem in the evaluation was the control  group.  Originally DHS was to rate all families in  family-centered services or in placement on a score of one  to three, from clearly in need of placement, to need family  preservation or would place in foster care, to would benefit  from other family-centered services.  The second group (need  family preservation or would place) was to be divided  between families who got family preservation and families  who could not get family preservation services because  caseloads were full.  The third group could get  family-centered services or placement or other services, but  not family preservation services.  However, family-centered  service workers modified their intervention to meet the  needs of families who really were appropriate for family  preservation.  Thus, there was no longer a true "control"  group.  </p>
<p>The control group problem was even more significant in  districts with private family preservation providers.  In  those districts, family-centered workers would not rate a  family as needing family preservation if they did not know  ahead of time that a slot was available for the family.  The  state family preservation program managers directed the  local family preservation offices to follow the control  group rules, and where family preservation services were  publicly provided, referring workers went along with the  procedures because the state family preservation program  seemed to want them to follow the procedures.  However,  where family preservation services were privately provided,  there appeared to be less commitment to the research, and  referring workers never really abided by the control group  rules.</p>
<p><b> Boys Town Evaluation. </b> Boys Town evaluates all  of its programs in-house, using standardized instruments.   Iowa is considered a research site and is heavily studied.   The  preservation rate for the Iowa program is 91 percent at  termination, 87 percent at 30 days after termination, 85  percent at 90 days, and 79 percent at one year after  termination.  No control group has been studied.   Preservation is not achieved if the child is placed for more  than 13 days in non-kinship care.  </p>
<h2>6. Kentucky</h2>
<p>Kentucky's family preservation program began in 1985,  with support from the Governor and legislature.  The state  provides preplacement prevention services, using the  Homebuilders model, in all of its 14 districts.  Currently,  services are available in 93 of 120 counties, and the state  is expanding to 10 more counties.  The program is  administered by the Cabinet for Human Resources Department  for Social Services (DSS) and provided by 14 private  agencies statewide.  One of the largest programs, according  to the state representative, is the program in the Jefferson  County District (City of Louisville).  Details of this  program are included below.  </p>
<p>A separate program, Kentucky Impact, is funded by the  Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  The state classifies this  program as a collaborative model of service delivery.  Teams  work with families with SED children to provide services to  keep the family functioning and help children avoid  hospitalization.  This program is modeled on Florida's  SEDNET program and is operational statewide.  Implementation  varies greatly from region-to-region.  The state is  currently developing a best practices guide to reduce  variation.   </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>The state's preplacement prevention program adheres to  the Homebuilders model.  Family preservation workers carry a  caseload of two families, and services are provided for  four-six weeks.  Flexible funds are available. DSS workers  serve as case managers and carry caseloads of 30-35  families.  </p>
<p>The state claims that little variation in the program  exists between districts because state staff are involved  with the interviewing and hiring of all program staff.  All  staff receive training by Behavioral Sciences Institute.  Nevertheless, the state contact noted that service providers  do not always stick to the four-six week intervention  period, and may allow services to extend longer.  Jefferson  County reported enforcing the six-week maximum.    </p>
<p>In FY 93, the program served 772 families statewide.  This represented 1,355 children who  were at risk of being  removed from the home. A comprehensive automated data system  tracks all children in the child welfare system.  </p>
<p>Jefferson County served 600 families in family  preservation in FY 94.  The County averages 600 CPS  investigations per month; the range is 525-700 cases per  month.  Of these, 43-45 percent (260) cases are  substantiated.  In December 1994, there were 950 children in  foster care in the county; 400 cases enter foster care per  quarter.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Children are referred to Homebuilders from juvenile  justice, mental health, and public health services.  In FY  94, 69 percent of the referrals were CPS clients; the  remainder were status offenders and mental health clients.   Jefferson County reported that referrals may be made at  intake or later.  </p>
<p>The state has not developed criteria for imminent risk;   workers make their own determinations of the level of risk.   In Jefferson County, the investigative worker uses a risk  assessment tool to determine imminent risk for CPS-referred  cases.  Status offender cases come through the court and are  assumed to be at imminent risk because a petition has been  filed. A supervisor screens the worker referrals and  discusses them and the initial risk assessment with the  provider.  Another screening is conducted at the first  family visit. The respondent noted that the definition of  imminent risk, "is not as crisp as we would like."  </p>
<p>In order to receive services, the family must have some  apparent strengths and be willing to participate in the  program.  The program excludes cases involving sexual abuse  if the perpetrator is in the home, and active abusers if  that fact is known ahead of time. </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>There has been no formal outcome evaluation of the  Kentucky family preservation program.  There was a formative  evaluation during the first years the program was in  operation.  It focused on implementation.  </p>
<p>The Jefferson County program has been evaluated by the  Cabinet for Human Resources Quality Assessment Branch.  </p>
<h2>7. Michigan</h2>
<p>In 1987, in response to rapidly increasing state  spending for foster care, the Michigan legislature  appropriated $5 million in redeployed foster care dollars as  a line item for the development of family preservation  services. The program, which is called Families First, began  in 1988 in selected counties with more than 100 children in  foster care.  It is now operated statewide.  </p>
<p>The program is administered by the Department of Social  Services. Services are provided by some 47 agencies across  the state.  Ten Families First agencies serve Wayne County  (Detroit). </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Families First is based on the Homebuilders model.   Workers carry a caseload of two families and services are  provided for four-six weeks.  The program has a strong  centralized training and quality assurance component.  </p>
<p>As of March 1993, a total of 5,700 families had been  served since the program's inception.  In Wayne County,  1,500 referrals are made to Families First per year.&lt;18&gt;   The program operates at 80 percent capacity.  In January of  1993, 10,455 children were in foster care; 2,774 children  were in the delinquency program.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Families First targets families with:</p>
<ul><li> one or more children at risk of foster care placement;  </li>
<li> one or more children who have been in placement for  less than 72 hours;  </li>
<li> children at high risk due to domestic violence;  </li>
<li> children recently adjudicated in juvenile court;  </li>
<li> children at risk of entering, or returning, from  institutionalization.    </li>
</ul><p>State policy defines imminent risk as children who are  at risk of removal from their home.  This is operationalized  to mean that placement would occur in the next 72 hours  without preventive services, or that a child has been in  placement less than 72 hours.  One adult family member must  be willing to participate in the program.    </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>An evaluation of Families First was conducted between  June 1988 and December 1990.  The state claims that this  evaluation showed that foster care placements declined by  12.2 percent in counties with Families First programs, while  placements rose by 29 percent in counties without the  program.  Since there was no comparison group, one cannot  necessarily attribute observed changes to the program.  </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>  At the request of the state contact, we  deferred contacting local family preservation and  reunification programs.  We plan a site visit to Michigan in  the near future, when we will be able to obtain more  information on the state's programs.  </p>
<h2>8. Missouri</h2>
<p>The State of Missouri's family preservation services  program, called Families First, was initiated in 1987 by the  Department of Mental Health in cooperation with the  Departments of Social Services and Elementary and Secondary  Education.  The program was designed to prevent out-of-home  placements of SED children and youth.  In 1988, the three  departments joined with Citizens for Missouri's Children to  develop a model that could be replicated statewide and also  serve abused and neglected children.  This family  preservation program became statewide in 1992.  </p>
<p>New state legislation, Senate Bill 595, has instituted a  two-track approach to investigations of child abuse and  neglect.  When an allegation is made, cases are referred to  one of two categories, based on their severity.  These  categories are criminal investigation and assessment and  services.  The goal of the new program is to approach  families in the second category not as child abusers, but as  troubled families in need of services.  </p>
<p>The City and County of St. Louis (together called St.  Louis Metro) comprise the largest catchment area in the  state.  St. Louis Metro includes one-half of the state's  population and the majority of the child welfare population.   Jackson County, which includes Kansas City, is one of the  next largest catchment areas.  Details of the programs in  these two areas are included below.  </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Families First programs funded by the state are held to  basic Homebuilders standards, but each program is allowed to  develop its own project plan.  Workers carry caseloads of  two families each.  Service is provided for four-six weeks.   Flexible funds are available.  </p>
<p>Services are provided by a mixture of private and public  contractors.  Statewide, there are a total of 40 Division of  Family Services (DFS) staff and 150 contracted staff  providing services.  These services focus on teaching  skills, including problem solving and parenting.</p>
<p>Families First served 1,397 families (including 3,721  children in FY 94).  </p>
<p>The St. Louis Metro Project operates under the aegis of  the State of Missouri, as part of the public child welfare  system, though some services are contracted out to private  providers.  The St. Louis Metro Project has 40 family  preservation specialists located in the St. Louis  City/County area.  In addition to the St. Louis Metro  Project there is a Families First Program in St. Louis  County.   </p>
<p>During FY 94, St. Louis Metro received 519 family  preservation referrals and served 348 families.  St. Louis  City served 241 families and St. Louis County served 107  families.  During this time, Jackson County received 383  referrals and served 137 families.&lt;19&gt;</p>
<p>In addition, in FY 94, St. Louis City, St. Louis County  and Jackson county reported the following statistics:</p>
<p>[Table not included.]</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Referrals to Families First can come from a variety of  sources.  In FY 94, St. Louis received 79 percent of its  referrals from DFS and 21 percent from other sources.  The  majority of other referrals came from the court.  Jackson  County received 96 percent of its referrals from DFS and 4  percent from the court.  The statewide average is 75 percent  from DFS, and 25 percent from other sources.   </p>
<p>All referrals must be made by someone with the authority  to remove a child (this includes the court and law  enforcement).  Once the referral is made, the provider and  DFS decide if it is appropriate for the program.  According  to the St. Louis Metro Project, targeting decisions are made  by DFS investigators in conjunction with Juvenile Court  officials and sometimes law enforcement personnel. (The  latter sometimes places children directly without the child  welfare agency having a say in the matter.)  Decisions are  made through discussions among the principal actors.</p>
<p>St. Louis reported that the state defines imminent risk  as the child is at high-risk of being placed within 72 hours  of the allegation, or within 72 hours after the child has  been placed, if an emergency placement has occurred.  </p>
<p>In order to be accepted into the program at least one of  the parents must be willing to participate in services.   According to state staff, this requirement tends to rule out  families with serious drug abuse problems.  In addition, the  program does not accept cases involving mentally retarded  parents, substance abusers unwilling to complete treatment,  serious abuse or sexual abuse if the perpetrator remains in  the home.   </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>An annual report published by the Missouri Department of  Social Services for FY 94 summarizes program activities and  client characteristics throughout the state and for all 35  individual family preservation program sites.  The report  presents information from two different computer systems:  the Referral System and the Intake and Tracking System.  The  numbers from these two systems do not reconcile because of  the more complete capture of data in the Intake and Tracking  system, however both systems provide valuable information.</p>
<p>From the Referral System:</p>
<ul><li> 2,178 families referred;   </li>
<li> 1,052 accepted (48 percent);  </li>
<li> 1,126 not accepted (52 percent) -- of these, 21  percent due to no immediate likelihood of placement, 19  percent due to a lack of program openings -- child remains  at home, 16 percent due to child safety, 15 percent due to a  lack of service openings -- child placed, 13 percent because  the primary caretaker was unwilling to participate, and 7  percent because the primary caretaker was unavailable;  </li>
</ul><p>From the Intake and Tracking System:</p>
<ul><li> 1,397 families (3,721 children) accepted;  </li>
<li> 75 percent of referrals from the Division of Family  Services, 8 percent by the courts;  </li>
<li> 1,008 families exiting (with 85 percent intact at that  time);  </li>
<li> 2,054 at-risk children exiting (with 87 percent intact  at that time);  </li>
<li> head of household characteristics: 80 percent female,  66 percent white, 33 percent black, 48 percent aged 30-39,  21 percent aged 23-29, 57 percent unemployed, and 53 percent  earning less than $10,000; and   </li>
<li> at-risk children characteristics: 10 percent under one  year old, 29 percent 1-5 years old, 35 percent 6-12 years  old, and 26 percent were 13 and over.   </li>
</ul><h2>9. New Jersey</h2>
<p>The New Jersey family preservation initiative began in  1987 with programs in four counties. New Jersey is currently  operating preplacement prevention in 14 of its 21 counties  and plans are underway to expand the program to the  remaining seven counties. The Division of Youth and Family  Services funds 12 community-based agencies to provide  services.  </p>
<p>According to the state, all of the family preservation  programs operate similarly. State authorizing legislation  mandates that programs adhere to the Homebuilders model and  specifies the qualifications for staff.  Training is  provided to all programs by Rutgers University, through the  State Family Preservation Institute.  In addition, BSI  trains all supervisors and front-line staff.</p>
<p>Several other preventive programs also serve various  target populations.  Two of these include:  1) The Family  Managed Care program which works to maintain children in  their homes, stabilize foster care placements, and reunify  children who have been cared for in institutional settings;  and 2) The Youth Incentive Program (YIP) serves families  with SED children.  It provides both family preservation and  family reunification services.  YIP follows a  multi-disciplinary model involving several levels of  coordinating councils.   </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>The state's intensive preplacement prevention program is  based on the Homebuilders model. Caseworkers carry a  caseload of two families (three if one is terminating).   Services are provided for four-six weeks.  In FY 94, the  program served 742 families statewide.  </p>
<p>Following are the number of cases referred in FY 93 and  their disposition by county:</p>
<p>[Table not included]</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>The state's intensive preplacement prevention program  targets "all" children at risk. Statewide, the  program referrals average 63.5 percent from CPS, 11 percent  from mental health crisis intervention units, 10.5 percent  from the courts, and 15 percent from other sources.   Referrals must be made by someone with placement authority.   A CPS caseworker screens referrals from mental health crisis  intervention units, from the courts, and all other sources  before referring them to family preservation.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, imminent risk means that foster care  placement would occur within 72 hours in the absence of  services.  Currently, there is a lot of discussion  throughout the state on what constitutes imminent risk and  what constitutes exhausting all other resources.  The state  views its intensive preplacement prevention program as the  last resource that should be used before placement occurs.</p>
<p>The program serves cases involving sexual abuse and  substance abuse.   There are no exclusions.  Most of the  children served are over age 10.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>An evaluation of the state's family preservation program  was completed in December 1991.  For this study, 214  eligible children were randomly assigned to family  preservation services or a control group that used other  existing services.  The evaluation found that family  preservation families had fewer children enter placement and  that they entered placement at a slower rate than the  control group.  However, the study also found that this  trend dissipated fairly rapidly over time.  By the end of  the first year, 42.7 percent of the family preservation  families had a child in placed in foster care compared to  56.7 percent of the control group.</p>
<p>No statistically significant differences were found in  the type of substitute care utilized nor the time spent in  out-of-home care.  In addition, few measures of change in  family functioning or social support were significant  between the two groups.  </p>
<h2>10. New York</h2>
<p>In 1988, the New York State legislature established the  Family support services program, designed to enhance the  State's capacity to support and strengthen families and  avert foster care placements.  The three programs  established under this initiative were: intensive home-based  family preservation services, respite care services and  therapeutic foster boarding home programs.  These efforts  built on the already existing statewide program of  preventive services for families with children at risk of  foster care.  The preventive services program, created by  the Child Welfare Reform Act of 1979, is funded with 75  percent State and 25 percent local funds.  Families are  entitled to receive such services where their child has been  deemed as at risk of foster care.  Preventive services  include case management and planning, clinical services,  homemaker, parent aide/training, day care, transportation,  housing subsidies, and other supportive services.   Preventive services may also be provided to families where  the risk of foster care is not imminent; such services are  reimbursed with 50 percent State funds.</p>
<p>In 1988, $6 million was made available for the Family  support initiative for start up of programs.  On-going  operating funds would be provided through existing  preventive and foster care funding streams.  Over the years  since then, 20 localities have received funding for start up  of intensive home based family preservation services.  In  addition, a number of localities have initiated such  services on their own, notably the City of New York, which  made such services available city-wide.</p>
<p>In 1993, the State legislature appropriated $10 million  for the creation and expansion of family preservation  centers within the State's highest need communities.  These  centers serve as a resource for information and referral,  support, networking and community planning.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>New York State's intensive family preservation programs  follow a modified Homebuilders model.  State guidelines  specify that caseworkers are to carry a caseload of two  families (four maximum) and be available to families 24  hours per day.  Services are provided to families for 30  days with an additional 30-day extension possible.  State  guidelines do not define the scope of services, beyond  specifying that a mixture of therapeutic and concrete  services must be provided at an intensity of at least 10-15  hours per week.  At least one-half of the services provided  must be delivered within the family's home.  Families also  can be referred to services within the community.  </p>
<p>The four largest catchment areas currently served by the  intensive family preservation program are New York City,  Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk counties), Buffalo (Erie  county), and Rochester (Monroe county).  Erie and Monroe  Counties belong to the Upstate Intensive Family Preservation  Network, which includes a total of 15 programs.  Among other  activities, the Network facilitates training with BSI.   Programs in this Network appear to adhere the closest to the  Homebuilders model.  </p>
<p>Following is information on Erie, Monroe and Suffolk  Counties.  All of these programs are operating at capacity  and do not keep a waiting list.  </p>
<p>[Table not included.]</p>
<p>In Erie County, intensive family preservation services  are provided through three non-profit agencies.  One private  agency in Monroe County and one in Suffolk County, provide  services.  All of these agencies also offer a wide array of  other child welfare and related preventive and follow-up  services.  </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>Variation among the New York family preservation  programs primarily exists in the referral process.   According to the state contact, CPS workers do not always  trust programs provided by non-profit agencies.  As a  result, many programs had problems receiving an adequate  number of referrals during start-up.  Most programs have  remedied this shortfall by accepting referrals from  Children's Services; foster care cases that are in the  process of being reunified (approximately 10-15 percent of  all cases).</p>
<p>Other than the risk criteria mandated by the 1979 state  Child Welfare Reform Act for all referrals, the state does  not provide criteria governing imminent risk.  The  Act  mandated that the following be taken into account when  making referrals: </p>
<p>· health and safety needs of child;</p>
<p>· child service need (danger to self and others);</p>
<p>· parent need (emotional, physical, or financial);</p>
<p>· unborn child at-risk (substance abuse by pregnant  woman);</p>
<p>· parent unwilling to take care of child; and</p>
<p>· various other risk factors or behavior.  </p>
<p>Generally, counties use the "seven day criteria"  in conjunction with the above criteria.  If a determination  is made that the child is at high-risk (on a low, medium, or  high scale) of being placed in foster care within seven  days, that child is considered eligible for family  preservation services.  </p>
<p><b>Erie</b> <b>County.  </b>In Erie County, there are  three family preservation programs; they are operated by  private providers under contract.  One of these programs  serves the general population, another serves a primarily  African American population, and the third serves the Native  American community.  Virtually all of the cases referred to  the first two of these family preservation programs  originate from CPS, except for substance abuse cases, unless  the parent has just undergone treatment.  Because the  programs operate at capacity, program staff conduct their  own assessment and often quiz the referring CPS worker on  the appropriateness of the referral and actual risk of child  removal.  </p>
<p>The Native American program, the smallest of the three  programs in Erie county, does not accept non-Native American  referrals and primarily targets families in which substance  abuse places the child at-risk of foster care placement.   Although the program keeps no waiting list, in the past,  families have been provided substance abuse treatment or  other less-intensive preventive services until intensive  family preservation services become available.   </p>
<p><b>Monroe County.  </b>In comparison to Erie County,  Monroe County is less strict in its targeting. According to  the respondent, the provider works closely with the DHSS  liaison who knows the program capacity and only refers cases  when there is an opening.  All referred cases are accepted  by the program.  </p>
<p>A joint assessment is conducted by the investigative  worker and the referring worker to determine whether one  family member is in crisis and whether one child is at-risk  of foster care placement.  The DHHS liaison takes referrals  from multiple sources.  In 1993, the program served 22 CPS  cases, 40 community mental health referrals, 21 cases in  which families referred themselves for services, 10 from  other preventive services, and 8 probation cases.  </p>
<p><b>Suffolk County.  </b>Suffolk County focuses  primarily on serving voluntary foster care placements.  The  program excludes cases of domestic violence and unmotivated  parents.  Cases are received directly from the foster care  system.  In addition, the program receives referrals from  the Office of Mental Retardation, the Office of Mental  Health, and Probation in cases in which parents are  voluntarily placing their children.  The program reports  that many of the referrals originate when voluntary  placement support cases are not processed quickly enough by  the referring agency.  In these instances, some families  refer themselves to the program.    </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>New York State has conducted an evaluation of its oldest  family preservation programs.  Erie County was included in  this evaluation.  An outcome evaluation of these programs  was scheduled to be completed in 1994.  </p>
<h2>11. Ohio</h2>
<p><b> </b>Ohio has a county-administered child welfare  system.  All program information was obtained through  contacts at the county level.  Specific information on  placement prevention programs was obtained for two counties  -- Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Franklin (Columbus).  </p>
<h2>a. Cuyahoga County</h2>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>Cuyahoga County runs the public child welfare agency,  but contracts all services out to private providers (e.g.,  residential treatment facilities) and one public agency  (Public Mental Health Board), depending on service needs.   The county agency makes referrals and reviews cases with the  contracting agencies who then provide all direct services.   </p>
<p>In 1994, 12,846 reports were made to CPS, of which 3,050  (24%) were substantiated.  Also, in 1994, 3,463 children  were placed in foster care, as follows:  904 were placed in  relative's homes, 936 were placed in non-relative foster  homes, and 1,623 entered specialized placement.</p>
<p>Cuyahoga County's Family Preservation Program defines  itself as not Homebuilders.  The goal of the program is to  refer moderate risk children and their families in order to  prevent foster care placement.  The caseload is usually two  families per worker; at times three families will be shared  by a 2-worker team.  Service duration in the 42-day program  model of intensive home services, is as follows: 1st week -  12 hours; 2nd week - 10 hours; 3rd week - 10 hours; 4th week  - 8 hours; 5th week - 6 hours; and 6th week (termination  week) - 4 hours.  In FY 94, the program served 404 families.   It functions close to, but not at, capacity.</p>
<p>Cuyahoga also has other family preservation programs.   These programs are usually of eight weeks duration, with  face-to-face contact five hours per week.  Typical services  are foster parent support services for a limited period of  time each week with the family (families are </p>
<p>provided a total of six weeks of service); homemaker  services; and a parenting conflict program that deals with  the problems of unruly teenagers.  (The Family Court also  has a delinquency prevention program).</p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>The target population for the program consists entirely  of child abuse and neglect cases.  Chronic mental illness  and mental retardation cases are excluded, as are families  with substance abusing caretakers.  The latter are offered  inpatient or outpatient services, and when substantial  progress has been made, may qualify for the program.</p>
<p>Imminent risk of placement is determined through the use  of the Washington State Risk Assessment Tool.  This  targeting device establishes severity, chronicity and  baseline risk.  Caseworkers initiate the process, after  which a case review takes place.  Input from the family is  also obtained.</p>
<p><b>b. Franklin County</b> </p>
<p><b> </b>1) Structure</p>
<p><b> </b>Franklin County's Planning Unit both provides  and contracts with private providers for family preservation  services.  The county offers two programs: Crisis  Intervention and Intensive Home-based Services.  Eight  county workers provide the Crisis Intervention Services.   Three county teams (2 or 3 workers on a team) and five  private agencies provide Intensive Home-based Services.   Crisis Intervention Services have been provided for the past  seven years while Intensive Home-based Services have been  provided for the past four or five years.</p>
<p><b>Crisis Intervention Services</b> are provided by  workers with caseloads of approximately five families.   Families are served for 30-45 days.  </p>
<p><b>Intensive Home-based Services</b> are provided  through a 90-day program.  Caseloads are three to four  families for a 2-worker team.  The workers are assigned  either primary or secondary roles for each case, having  primary roles on some cases and secondary roles on others in  their caseload.  The five private providers do not adhere  strictly to the same program model in terms of caseload and  duration of services.  Each of the four regional offices in  the county use a private provider and the fifth provider is  used for case overflow.  Services include individual and  family counseling, parent education, employment, financial  and housing assistance.  </p>
<p>Flexible funds are available on an informal basis to all  families receiving family preservation services.  The funds  can be used for paying off utilities bills or for other  reasons.</p>
<p>The following table provides information on the number  of children served by Franklin County.</p>
<p>[Table not included.]</p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>Referrals to Crisis Intervention and Intensive  Home-based Services come from one of three agencies -- child  welfare, juvenile court, or mental health.  However, the  majority are child welfare cases.</p>
<p>There is no established definition of risk of placement.   Investigation workers use a risk assessment protocol to  establish risk.  After a referral has been investigated, the  planning unit is notified by the investigating worker.  The  planning supervisor and the investigating worker decide  whether or not family preservation services are warranted.   A meeting is scheduled with a team of individuals (including  two administrative staff outside the investigative unit),  planning unit staff, the investigating worker and his/her  supervisor, and the family.  The meeting usually takes place  within a day or two after the investigation on serious cases  and within two weeks on less serious allegations.  The team  uses the STRIDE (Situation, Targeted goals, Roadblocks,  Ideas around roadblocks, Decision, and Evaluation) to reach  a decision regarding whether or not the family should  receive Crisis Intervention or Intensive Home-based  Services.  </p>
<p><b>Crisis Intervention Services</b> are usually  provided to cases in which there has been an isolated  incident of abuse/neglect and not chronic neglect.  These  cases tend to be families with unruly older children, and  there is parent-child conflict that has escalated to the  point at which the family is ready to have the child placed.  </p>
<p>Services are provided to families with short, or  non-existent, histories with the child welfare agency,  however families with an extensive history with the child  welfare agency but recent improvements or a record of  improvement can also be accepted.  One of the main reasons  these services are provided is so that an official agency  case does not need to be opened and the families can remain  "out" of the system.  The child can be out of the  home in emergency care when the family is first served.   There are no "hard and fast" rules as to the  maximum period of time a child can be out of the home and  services still be provided. </p>
<p><b>Intensive Home-based Services</b> provided by  private providers primarily target abuse/neglect cases  involving younger children for whom an official case is or  already has been opened and closer supervision of the  caretaker is needed.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>There has been no recent evaluation of family  preservation services in Ohio.  </p>
<h2>12. Oregon</h2>
<p>Oregon has had family preservation programs in place  since 1982.  The programs are administered by the Oregon  Department of Human Resources Children's Services Division  (CSD).  In the past, state employees directly provided many  family preservation services, but the state recently  concluded that case management case load sizes have become  too large.  As a result, the state has moved all of its  employees into case management and has contracted out all of  the treatment programs to private providers.</p>
<p>Oregon has two family preservation models.  Its older  model, Intensive Family Services (IFS), began in 1982.  The  new model, Intensive Home-Based Services (IHS), is a pilot  program that began in 1994.  In addition to these two  models, there are placement prevention services that target  juveniles at risk of involvement in the juvenile justice  system, a Family Sex Abuse Treatment Program, Family Unity  meetings that find and build on a family's resources, a  parent training program, and a respite care program.  </p>
<p>The following section focuses on the IFS and IHS  programs and includes descriptions of the programs in  Multnomah County (Portland).  These programs were named by  the state contact as programs of special interest.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p><b> Intensive Family Services (IFS).</b>  IFS operates  statewide, except in a few rural areas that do not have  complete coverage.  The model is a family systems treatment  based model which serves 10-11 families for up to 120 days.   A case manager oversees services provided by a family  treatment worker.</p>
<p>Most of the services or treatment provided by the family  therapist are considered "soft services" (e.g.,  family empowerment).  Therapists are able to make client  referrals through the CSD worker to homemaker services or  parent skills training sessions.  Agencies that contract  with CSD to deliver IFS, provide different approaches.   Some, but not all, use an in-home approach to maximize the  service hours in the home of the family.  </p>
<p>One example of the IFS program is found in Multnomah  County.  This program was established in 1980. It was  originally designed to help families with a child at  imminent risk of placement and served primarily parents  requesting placement of an unruly adolescent child.  Now the  program serves younger children who have been abused or  neglected.  </p>
<p>Workers receive four new cases per month and carry 12  open cases at any given time.  Families receive services for  four months, and these services can be extended. The  Multnomah program opens approximately 40 cases per month and  serves about 450 cases per year.  At any one time in  Multnomah County, there are an estimated 2,400 children in  out-of-home care, of whom 1,900 are in foster family care.   </p>
<p><b> Intensive Home-Base Services (IHS).</b>  IHS is a  pilot program offered in nine sites.  This program is a  clearly defined Homebuilders model which provides services  to two-four families for four-six weeks.  Services are  provides by private contractors, except in a few rural sites  where the Children's Services Division (CSD) case manager  may provide services.</p>
<p>One of these programs, Self-Enhancement, Inc., is a  private, non-profit agency under contract with CSD to  provide family preservation services to low-income, minority  families in Portland. </p>
<p>The program, which was established in April 1994,  follows a modified Homebuilders model, targeted toward a  special population, African American families.  Intensive  services are provided for four-six weeks, followed by up to  90 days of aftercare.  During the intensive phase, workers  carry caseloads of two families and provide direct services.   During the aftercare phase, workers carry a caseload of 18  or 19 families and broker and monitor services.  </p>
<p>The objective of the program is to re-engage the family  so that the home is safe for the children.  Measures of  success include the child's staying safe and the family's  staying out of CSD for 90 days, and no repeat referrals for  the same issue.  </p>
<p>The program, which is operating at capacity, had served  47 families, including 117 children, by the end of 1994.   </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p><b> Intensive Family Services (IFS).</b>  Families  receiving IFS must be child welfare clients.  Imminent risk  is not a criterion for referral.  The program identifies  three categories of risk for families:  1) imminent risk  (within 30 days a child would be placed in out-of-home  care); 2) potential risk (within some unspecified amount of  time, perhaps three months, the child would be placed); and  3) families at risk because a child is returning from foster  care.  </p>
<p>In Multnomah County, all cases served by IFS are open  cases in CSD.  Referrals to IFS are made by the child's CSD  worker.  IFS must, by contract, accept every family referred  for assessment.  The program serves every family referred  and assessed, except for those families who refuse services,  after three attempts to engage them have been made.  After  referral, intake staff decide which services a family should  receive.  Family Unity meetings, a meeting of all sources of  formal support (program and service staff) and informal  support (extended family, religious community, etc.), are  sometimes a part of the services provided.  In order for a  family unity meeting to be held, a separate case is opened  for funding purposes.  The same workers who provide IFS  services also facilitate family unity meetings, but not for  their own clients.   </p>
<p><b> Intensive Home-Based Services (IHS).</b>  IHS  serves only child welfare clients.  According to the state  official interviewed, imminent risk has been defined in  legislation but he acknowledged that it is not mandatory for  referral to family preservation.  Theoretically,  participation in IFS and IHS should be mutually exclusive.   It is possible that either might refer families to FSAT or  Parent Training.  </p>
<p>Self-Enhancement, Inc. in Multnomah County, serves  African American children age 0-6.  Referrals come only from  CSD and are limited to abused and neglected children.  Most  of the children referred are at imminent risk of placement:   the referring worker has determined that placement will  occur.  Some of the children referred are already in  placement, pursuant to a court order.  The director  describes Self-Enhancement as a program of last resort.   </p>
<p>The program provides the usual range of concrete and  support services and screens the referrals it receives.  The  program accepts families with a high probability of success  and excludes cases of sexual abuse.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>A study of IFS was completed in April, 1985 by William  Showell, Roland Hartley, and Marcia Allen.  A total of 261  children (one per family) that had been approved for  placement and were referred to IFS were tracked for a total  of 15 months.  The study period covered the 90-day treatment  period and included a 12-month follow-up period.  </p>
<p>In Multnomah County, CSD evaluates IFS every two years.  The division also tracks child placement among families  served by the program.</p>
<h2>13. Tennessee</h2>
<p>The Tennessee family preservation program, Home Ties,  began in 1989 in a limited number of sites.  It was expanded  in 1992, and now operates statewide.  Home Ties is  administered by an interdepartmental committee which  includes the Departments of Human Services, Mental Health,  Youth Corrections, and Finance and Administration.  Services  are provided under contract by 15 agencies, all but 3 of  which are community mental health providers.  The 15  agencies represent 27 teams of family preservation workers.   The state believes each county's providers are keeping the  program model consistent.  According to the state contact,  the largest and best-established programs are in Davidson  County (Nashville), Knox County (Knoxville), and Shelby  County (Memphis).  The Shelby County program is included in  the following description.    </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Home Ties, the family preservation program in Tennessee,  is a behaviorally oriented, intensive, short-term, in-home  crisis intervention and family education program that  replicates the Homebuilders model.  Workers serve two  families each and must serve a minimum of 18 families per  year.  The Home Ties specialists are available to their  families 24 hours a day; 7 days a week.  Services are  provided for four to six weeks, with an average length of  service of four weeks.  Flexible funds of $250 per family  are available.  Funds spent must be documented in detail and  have some therapeutic value.</p>
<p>Home Ties services include teaching problem resolution  by assisting the family in its examination of alternatives  to prevent the reoccurrence of abuse, neglect or family  conflict; direct provision of any identified service needs  such as parenting education, child development training,  anger management, advocacy, family, individual and marriage  counseling, communication and negotiation skills, home  maintenance skills, concrete services, job readiness  training, and developing linkages with natural helping  networks; referral and linkage with any needed concrete or  follow-up services.  Flexible funds are available at a  maximum of $250 per family.  </p>
<p>In 1993-94, the Davidson County program served 432  families, the Knox County program served 180 families, and  the Shelby County program served 378 families.  </p>
<p>In addition to Home Ties, the Shelby County contract  agency has an ongoing family preservation program, called  Lifecoach.  Lifecoach was established in 1994.  It follows a  modified Homebuilders model.  Workers carry a caseload of  four families.  Service is provided for four-eight hours per  week for an unlimited number of weeks.  Lifecoach has served  40 families to date.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>In Tennessee, families are referred to family  preservation programs by anyone with placement authority;  including mental health providers, juvenile court judges and  CPS investigators and youth correction officers.  Children  and families are served based on behavioral criteria rather  than legal or psychological labels.  Overall, 49.7 percent  of referrals come from human services agencies, 22.4 percent  come from mental health/mental retardation agencies, 12.5  percent come from youth corrections programs, 6.9 percent  come from community health agencies; and 8.5 percent come  from other sources.  </p>
<p>In Tennessee, imminent risk means that the child would  be placed if the Home Ties program was filled to capacity.   Eligible families must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<p>· at least one child at imminent risk of removal  (if Home Ties was not operating or there were no opening)  worker will proceed with placement within five days;</p>
<p>· the child at risk of removal must be either  severely emotionally disturbed (diagnosed), unruly  adolescent or status offender, adjudicated delinquent or  pending charges, receiving aftercare supervision from DYD,  or child is dependent neglected or abused; (NOTE:  Sexual  abuse cases where perpetrator in the home are excluded, as  are youth convicted of serious crimes).  </p>
<p>· less intensive community services have been  exhausted or were not appropriate;</p>
<p>· referring worker has seen family within two days  of making referral, discussed the Home Ties program with the  family and at least one member of the family has agreed to  services;</p>
<p>· families with a child in out-of-home placement 30  days or less are eligible if the child will be returning  within seven days of the Home Ties specialist's initial  contact; and</p>
<p>· at least one adult or teen-aged member of family  must confirm that out-of-home placement of a member who is  17 years of age or less is imminent.   </p>
<p>Originally, Home Ties teams targeted families with "at  risk" children due to serious emotionally disturbance,  unruly/status offender behavior or delinquent behavior.   These children were selected because they were known to be  the hardest children to serve successfully, the most  expensive to place, and the most difficult to reunify.  When  the program was expanded, younger children who had been  abused or neglected were included.  </p>
<p>In Shelby County, the contract provider of Home Ties  services reported that it screens all referrals and can  withdraw from the case within seven days if it believes the  referral is inappropriate.  Imminent risk is defined to mean  that there must be risk of placement within one week.  If no  slot is available but there will be an opening in a few  days, the child can go to a shelter for a few days, (but for  no more than five days before placement).  </p>
<p>The contract agency's other family preservation program,  Lifecoach, serves families who do not meet the imminent risk  criteria.  Families may be referred from one program to the  other.  However, families cannot be referred to Home Ties  for six months after case closure.  If a family in this  situation still needs services, a referral to Lifecoach is  made.  Both programs provide the usual range of concrete and  support services.  In addition, Lifecoach has a therapist on  call.  </p>
<p>Both Home Ties and Lifecoach exclude children who have  committed serious crimes against persons and perpetrators of  sexual abuse who are still in the home.  <b> </b></p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The University of Tennessee - Knoxville recently  completed a three-year evaluation of Home Ties, including  the program in Shelby County.  The evaluation used an  overflow design.  Control group families were families who  were referred to Home Ties but for whom there was no  opening.  Results of the evaluation were positive enough (79  percent of the children were still at home 6 months  following the intervention and 69 percent were still home at  12 months) to support statewide expansion.</p>
<h2>14. Texas</h2>
<p>Texas has had family preservation services since 1982,  but the implementation of these programs has varied  significantly across the state.  State legislation, enacted  in 1992, has expanded the overall family preservation  program and has established standards to improve program  consistency.  The state also is working to establish  multi-disciplinary committees comprised of representatives  from all the departments.  Both Child Protective Services  (CPS) and the Department of Mental Health and Mental  Retardation (DMHMR), have family preservation programs.   There is also a new program being developed by the Juvenile  Probation Commission.</p>
<p>The state child welfare agency administers the family  preservation program.  Services are delivered through 10  regional offices and provided by both public and private  providers through regionally issued contracts. </p>
<p><b> </b>The largest catchment areas served are the  counties of Dallas, Harris, Tarrant, El Paso, and Bexar,  which include Dallas, Houston, Ft. Worth, El Paso, and San  Antonio.  The Dallas, Houston, and Bexar County programs are  described separately below.  </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Service models are not specifically defined in  legislation.  The CPS programs use a state developed model  with a family systems approach.  The DMHMR programs follow a  modified Homebuilders model.  </p>
<p>Currently, there are 40 CPS family preservation programs  statewide in Texas.  The CPS family preservation model is  not prescriptive.  Most providers adhere to caseloads of up  to six families.  Service duration is 90 days and can be  extended to 120 days, if necessary.  Workers make at least  two in-home contacts per week.  A caseworker is available 24  hours a day, seven days a week.  Services provided are  defined as mostly educational, and a mixture of therapeutic  and concrete.  Most programs have flexible funds available  for families.  </p>
<p>The DMHMR program follows a modified Homebuilders model.   Workers carry a caseload of two-four families.  Service is  provided for four-eight weeks, but can be extended to six  months.  </p>
<p><b>Bexar County.</b>  In Bexar County (San Antonio  area), CPS has provided FPS since 1993.  The program follows  a family systems model.  Workers carry a caseload of  three-five families for three-eight months.  Flexible  funding is not available.  </p>
<p>The program operates at capacity.  In 1994, it served 40  families.  In Bexar County, in FY 93, 17,614 children  received protective services.</p>
<p><b>Dallas County.  </b>In Dallas County, one private  provider provides in-home services to low-risk families.   CPS provides services to high-risk families through four  intensive units and to moderate-risk families through two  units.  The first of the intensive CPS units was started in  1986; the fourth, a joint project with the Juvenile Justice  Department, was instituted in October, 1994.  The first of  two other moderate risk CPS units was initiated in March,  1994.  The second began in September, 1994.</p>
<p>During FY 94, the three established intensive CPS family  preservation units each served approximately 80 families.   The program does not have a waiting list.  In FY 93 in  Dallas County, an average of 95 children were placed in  foster care each month.  During that year, a total of 12,632  investigations of child abuse and neglect were completed.   In December 1994, 1,028 children were in foster care. </p>
<p>Workers in the Dallas County moderate risk units serve  10-12 families for four-six months duration; however,  services can be extended up to nine months.  Workers must  make a minimum of one in-home visit per week. The services  provided by moderate risk units are the same as the services  provided by the intensive units including:  individual and  family counseling, parent education and assistance with  employment and housing.  Flexible funds of $150 per family  are available for both moderate and intensive family  preservation cases.</p>
<p>The moderate risk program currently operates at  capacity.  Since September, 1994, the program has served 133  families.</p>
<p><b>Harris County.  </b>In Harris County (Houston area),  three intensive family preservation units are located in  Department of Protective and Regulatory Services.  Two of  these units were instituted in 1984; the third was started  in 1994.  State employees provide services, along with  private providers of protective day care and psychiatric  evaluations.  </p>
<p>The program has only recently begun to keep statistics  on the number served.  However, based on the average number  of referrals logged by the program each month (16-20), and  the percentage of referrals accepted (70 percent) the  program estimates that it serves a total of 140 to 168  families each year.  The program usually operates at or near  capacity;  it does not have a waiting list. </p>
<p>In FY 93, 13,607 families, involving 30,650 children,  were reported for child abuse and neglect in Harris County.   That year, the county's foster care caseload totaled 3,801,  with 1,321 children entering care.&lt;20&gt;          </p>
<p>A separate provider, Depelchin Children's Center, has  provided less intensive family preservation services in  Harris County since 1982.  It is the oldest provider of  these services in the State of Texas.  Depelchin Children's  Center follows a family systems therapy model.  Families are  provided individual and group counseling services for three  to six months.  Caseworkers carry a caseload of eight to ten  families and see families once or twice a week.  One  caseworker is always available to families 24 hours a day,  seven days a week.   </p>
<p>Depelchin is under contract to Harris County to provide  family preservation services to 77 CPS families per year.   Depelchin has similar contracts with three other counties to  serve an additional combined total of 36 cases.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>The state does not have a general definition of imminent  risk, other than that there is risk of placement in the "immediate  future."</p>
<p><b>Bexar County.</b>  In Bexar County, the FPS unit  serves abused and neglected children at imminent risk of  placement, or those that have been recently placed.  Cases  are referred by the family's worker.  Imminent risk is  decided by the referring worker, using a risk assessment  model.  </p>
<p>FPS staffs and screens each referral and recommends  appropriate services.  Within 24 hours, the staff also meets  with the family to develop a service plan.  The program  reports that it staffs and screens cases more intensively in  which the child has been formally removed, since the plan  will be presented in court.  The program provides the usual  mix of concrete and supportive services.</p>
<p>The program excludes substance-abusing caretakers if  they are not in treatment or willing to enroll.  The program  usually screens out cases involving sexual abuse, and  consistently declines cases if the perpetrator is still in  the home.  The program also excludes cases with retarded or  psychotic caretakers.  </p>
<p><b>Dallas County.  </b>In Dallas County, the intensive  family preservation units serve cases that would require the  child's placement if immediate intensive work with the  family were not provided. These cases include families with  young children who have been abused or neglected, and  teenage mothers with newborn infants, (many of which are  classified as failure to thrive infants).  These units do  not accept sexual abuse cases; the county believes that  cases involving sexual abuse cannot be treated with  short-term services.  </p>
<p>Three of the four intensive family preservation units  serve cases referred by CPS.  Most of the CPS cases are  referred following an initial Child Abuse/Neglect report and  investigation.  Cases that are screened in are investigated  by an in-home assessment team to determine risk of  placement.  Depending on the level of risk to the child, the  worker can take custody of the child, refer the family to  intensive family services, or provide less intensive  services.  If the family is referred to intensive services,  the program conducts an emergency assessment.  Some cases  are referred to these units when families originally  referred to less intensive services subsequently enter a  crisis that may result in foster care placement. These cases  also are assessed for imminent risk of placement.  In all  instances, program referral must be agreed to by the  investigation worker and supervisor and the intensive  services worker and supervisor.  These intensive units do  not accept cases in which the child is not at immediate risk  of foster care placement </p>
<p>The fourth intensive family preservation unit serves  cases referred by the Probation Department.  Juvenile  Probation Officers identify and refer to the unit families  that have one older child (the juvenile) and younger  children in the home who are being abused or neglected by a  parent and are close enough in age to be impacted by the  juvenile's behavior.  The older child may be in the home or  in out-of-home placement.  Imminent risk of removal of the  younger children, or of the juvenile, if he or she is at  home, is not required for referral to this unit.  </p>
<p>In Dallas County, the moderate risk units serve cases in  which there is no imminent risk of removal.  These cases  tend to involve families with older children who have been  abused or neglected, and families exhibiting chronic neglect  and generational abuse or neglect.  About half of their  caseload involves sexual abuse cases.  </p>
<p><b>Harris County.  </b>The family preservation caseload  in Harris County is similar to the family preservation  caseload in Dallas County, with one exception:   A  significant portion of Harris County caseload comprises  families with adolescents.   Harris County's referral  process is very similar to Dallas County's.  An in-house  assessment is conducted by CPS to decide the appropriateness  of the referral.  Cases referred to FPS are then screened by  the program.  CPS and the program must agree on all  referrals.</p>
<p>The program excludes cases involving mental retardation,  severe mental illness, and active addiction.  The program  also excludes cases involving sexual abuse, believing that  these cases require a longer intervention period than this  program provides.  </p>
<p>Depelchin Children's Center's family preservation  program has two separate components.  One serves cases  involving voluntary foster care and institutional placement;   the second serves CPS cases.  Referrals to the CPS  component originate from a county liaison who works closely  with the program to determine program capacity and  acceptable cases.  The program does not refuse referrals  from this source.  </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p><b> </b>Outcome evaluation of Texas' family  preservation program has only recently been initiated.  Data  collection began on January 1, 1994, and data analysis will  take place in the next few months.  The programs initiated  during the early and mid-eighties did have an evaluation  component as part of their grant funding, but the operation  of those programs and the program implemented statewide in  1994 is too different to provide worthwhile information.</p>
<p>The University of Texas at Arlington Graduate School of  Social Work, conducted an evaluation of the Tarrant county  program in 1993.</p>
<h2>15. Utah</h2>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>Established in 1982, Utah is one of the oldest family  preservation programs.  It is one of two states in which  state employees are the primary services providers (there  are two private providers). Currently, the family  preservation units are distinct units within the Division of  Family Services. </p>
<p><b> Family Preservation Service (FPS).  </b>FPS is  currently only offered in the major population centers, but  should be available statewide by the end of this fiscal  year.  All of the sites have common model in terms of  caseload size (four cases) and service duration (up to 60  days).  However, a recent doctoral dissertation project  uncovered differences in the services available from one  county to the next (e.g., transportation, emergency funds,  etc).</p>
<p>There are five mandated core services:</p>
<p>· eligibility, termination and casemanagement;</p>
<p>· counseling and parent skills training;</p>
<p>· drug and alcohol assessment;</p>
<p>· parent aide and homemaker; and</p>
<p>· visitation (specifically for foster care  reunification case.</p>
<p>Flexible funds are also available. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<p><b>Other Family Preservation</b>.  There are a variety  of other services (or programs) that Utah considers family  preservation.  Examples include: protective supervision,  parent skills training, homemaker services, protective  services and day care services.   Each of these programs has  its own target group and referral criteria.  The programs  are supposed to be available statewide, but are, in fact,  implemented to varying degrees depending on the funding  available in different regions.  These services are provided  by a combination of public and private providers. There are  12,000-14,000 families being served by home-based services  statewide.  </p>
<p>There should be a relationship between the other  home-based services and FPS.  FPS workers can refer their  clients to these services both during the FPS service period  and afterward as a follow-up.  </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>FPS targets children who are at imminent risk of  out-of-home placement due to abuse, neglect or  ungovernability, and children being reunited with their  families. There are five criteria that a family must meet to  receive family preservation services:</p>
<p>· are at imminent risk of placement;</p>
<p>· less intensive services are not appropriate;</p>
<p>· have a parent who agrees to work with the  program;</p>
<p>· child out of the home must be returned within 7  days; and</p>
<p>· need to be able to provide services safely.</p>
<p>There were 809 families served in the state in FY 94.&lt;21&gt;  State officials expect this number to increase as more state  funds are allocated to the program. </p>
<p>There are detailed criteria for establishing imminent  risk.  They use a risk scale with behaviorally anchored  levels (1-5).  Below 3 is not an imminent risk situation.   They must be either a 4 or 5.  Child must be referred by  someone with placement authority (who can file a petition  for removal), and a statement must be written explaining why  risk is imminent.  All referrals are reviewed and approved  by a screening committee.</p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>There have been many evaluations undertaken since the  inception of the program in 1982.  Utah was part of the  study conducted by Frasier and Pecora which resulted in the  book, Families in Crisis: Impact of Family Preservation.   There are also several doctoral dissertations which have  focused on various outcome measures.  Currently, one  researcher is working on a 3.5 year longitudinal study of  outcomes, and another is comparing voluntary and  court-ordered participation in family preservation.</p>
<h2>16. Washington</h2>
<p>Since 1974, Washington has provided placement prevention  services to families in their own homes.  The state provides  both Homebuilders (in its current form since 1982) and other  family preservation services, each of which is separately  described below.  Almost all family preservation services in  Washington are provided through regional contracts with  private providers.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p><b> Intensive Family Preservation Services (IFPS).   </b>IFPS, the Homebuilders model, are provided solely by the  Behavioral Sciences Institute&lt;22&gt;.  Currently, the  Homebuilders program is provided in portions of 12 of 39  counties in the state.  IFPS (Homebuilders) serves two  families per worker for a duration of four to six weeks.   The goal of services is to prevent out-of-home placement.   Homebuilders serves approximately 50 families per month.    </p>
<p><b> Other Family Preservation Services.  </b>Washington  also has Family Reconciliation Services (FRS) and Home Based  Services (HBS) as part of its overall family preservation  program. FRS comprises 15 hours of voluntary in-home  counseling delivered within 30 days for families in  conflict.  The FRS program serves approximately 228 families  per month.  It served 3,319 families in 1990.  </p>
<p>HBS is a service providing flexible funds for purchase  of goods or services.  The funds are being used for  short-term, home-based therapy.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p><b>IFPS</b>.  Homebuilders defines imminent risk as a  situation where the worker is planning to seek authorization  through the court or the family is voluntarily accepting  placement within 72 hours.  A gatekeeper (which may be an  individual or a team) must approve the services.</p>
<p>The Homebuilders intake worker asks the following  questions to determine whether the criteria for "imminent  risk" has been met:</p>
<p>· Is one child in the family at risk of imminent  placement?  Will placement occur within 72 hours?</p>
<p>· Has a parent agreed to participate with BSI/HB?</p>
<p>· Where would the placement occur?  If the  placement would have been with a relative or other non-state  funded placement, referral is not considered appropriate.</p>
<p>The intake questions posed to the DCFS referring worker  try to prompt options the worker may still need to consider  (a placement with a relative, for example).  The intake  worker tries to narrow down which child in the family is at  imminent risk because DCFS can re-refer to BSI/HB (without  waiting the normal 90-day period) if a different child  becomes at risk of imminent placement.</p>
<p><b>Other Family Preservation Programs.  </b>The target  population for FRS and HBS is similar to the target  population for Homebuilders.  However, FRS and HBS do not  require a child to be at imminent risk of placement in order  to receive services.  FRS is a voluntary service program.   It is more likely to serve families with adolescents at risk  of running away than is HBS.  </p>
<h2> c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>Homebuilders has conducted a recent study on targeting  in intensive family preservation. </p>
<h2>APPENDIX B</h2>
<h2>DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED REUNIFICATION PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>This Appendix provides more detailed descriptions of 12  programs in seven states.  The programs selected are located  in:  Alabama; the three California counties of Los Angeles,  Sacramento, and San Diego; Hennepin County, Minnesota;  Missouri, New York City; the two Pennsylvania counties of  Allegheny and Philadelphia (Allegheny County has more than  one reunification program); and Bexar County, Texas (which  also has more than one reunification program).  These  programs were selected because they met the criteria  described in Chapter and served more than 25 cases per year.</p>
<h2>1. Alabama</h2>
<p>There is no statewide reunification program operating in  Alabama.  There is a distinct program operating in  Montgomery County.  This program was recommended by the  state contact and is described below.</p>
<p>Counties undergoing the child welfare reform process are  placing special emphasis on reunifying children with their  families for children whose case plan goal is "return  home".  While no special program may be identified with  such efforts, county child welfare workers in conversion  counties are identifying children with such case plan goals  and are developing individualized service plans to quickly  move the child to accomplishment of the plan to return home  or to determine the need to revise the goal.  In addition an  emphasis is being placed on visitation between children and  their families while in foster care and also in residential  group care.  New training is underway in conversion counties  for foster parents to emphasize their role as partners with  birth families in parenting the children placed in their  care and in assisting birth families in achieving the goal  of reunification with their children.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>The Montgomery County program is operated by a separate  unit within the county CPS, agency.  The program, called  Family Reunion, began in April of 1993.  The caseload is  five to seven families per worker, depending on the number  of children involved, and the duration of service is  unlimited.  Services cease when the child is at home and the  situation is stable.  Flexible funding is not available.   The program, which is not yet operating at full capacity,  served 30 children in 1994.  </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p><b> </b>The reunification program in Montgomery County  serves children age 0-18 in any type of out-of-home  placement for whom there is a chance for reunification.  No  cases are excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>Referrals, which come only from child welfare, are made  by the child's worker.  This worker, the reunification  worker, the family, and any other providers working with the  family prior to referral develop the reunification plan  together.</p>
<p>Children and families may be identified for  reunification at any point during foster care.  The program  noted that 80 percent of the families it has reunified are  still together.</p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The Montgomery County program has not been evaluated.</p>
<h2>2. California</h2>
<p>There is no statewide reunification program in  California.  The programs in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and  San Diego counties, which were recommended by the state  contact are described below.</p>
<h2>a. Los Angeles County</h2>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County program is comprised of  community-based networks under contract to the County  Department of Children Services and the Probation  Department.  These networks are designed to help families  access services in their communities.  Some of these  networks emphasize reunification or began as reunification  projects.  These networks are organized as described under  the placement prevention section of this paper.  Services  are provided to 6-12 families per worker and families are  served for 12-52 weeks. </p>
<p>Since January 1993, the Los Angeles County family  preservation program has served 7,000 children, with an  estimated 1,500 cases having received reunification  services.</p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>The reunification component of the Los Angeles County  program serves children who can be reunified within 90 days  of referral.  These children may be in foster care for any  length of time and may include children in permanent  placement referred to prevent adoption disruption.   Referrals to the program come from both child welfare and  probation.</p>
<p><b>  </b>3) Evaluation</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County program has recently undergone a  process evaluation conducted by Walter R. McDonald and  Associates.</p>
<h2> b. Sacramento</h2>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>In Sacramento County, there are two units providing  Family Maintenance/Family Preservation, one unit providing  Family Preservation/Emergency Response services, and one  unit providing Family Preservation/Family Reunification.   The Family Preservation/Family Reunification unit was  instituted in the Fall of 1991.  It is part of the county  Division of Family Preservation and Child Protection, one of  five divisions in the Department of Health and Human  Services.  The program targets new entrants into protective  custody in an attempt to facilitate their return home.   Visitation is pursued aggressively.  </p>
<p>Like the placement prevention services, reunification  services in Sacramento County are provided by a team  comprising of a social worker and a family support worker.   Each team serves 7-8 families.  Services are provided for 90  days, with extensions possible.  Clients are involved for  approximately 5-20 hours per week (including services  provided by contract agencies), and families are able to  access via phone a program social worker 24 hours a day,  seven days a week.   </p>
<p>The program keeps accumulative statistics on the number  served since the beginning of the program.  The contact  stated that the program capacity, which is always met,  allows for 8-10 cases at any one time for approximately 90  days.  This program contact estimated 150 cases (families)  were served in a year.    </p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>Reunification referrals primarily originate from  protective custody foster care cases.  Each of these cases  is screened weekly until the dispositional hearing is held.   The program targets cases, especially those cases involving  children recently placed in foster care, in which parents  indicate interest in reunification by asking for visitation  or inquiring about the child during this time period, and  there is a likelihood with intensive services a child's safe  return home would be expedited.  These cases are referred to  the reunification unit, space permitting.  A few cases are  referred to the reunification unit after the dispositional  hearing has been held.</p>
<p>3) Evaluation</p>
<p>Sacramento County recently underwent evaluation by  Walter McDonald and Associates.  County statistics indicate  a 42 percent rate of return from foster care following 90  days.  This does not count cases returned after the 91st  day.  </p>
<h2> c. San Diego</h2>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>San Diego County has no separate reunification program.   However, the intensive family preservation program,  described in the placement prevention section of this paper,  serves a number of reunification cases each year.  The  program operates in a division within the county child  welfare office and is staffed by county workers.  In  November 1994, the program opened ten reunification cases.   From this, program staff estimated that the program served  approximately 120 reunification cases each year.  In FY 94,  there was a monthly average of 5,481 children in foster care  with 2,400 children entering care each year. </p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>San Diego County's placement prevention program accepts  referrals from multiple sources, including child welfare,  juvenile justice, mental retardation, and mental health.   Since reunification services are provided through the  county's placement prevention program, it is assumed that  cases for reunification originate from multiple sources as  well.  Family preservation staff may also routinely review  foster care cases to identify families who might benefit  from reunification cases.</p>
<p>The reunification program accepts children residing in  all types of foster care, including residential and family  care.  In addition, the program accepts children who have  been in foster care for various lengths of time, including  both new entrants and long-term foster care cases.</p>
<p>3) Evaluation</p>
<p>The San Diego program has not been evaluated.</p>
<h2>3. Minnesota </h2>
<p>There is no separately established reunification program  in the state of Minnesota.  Reunification services are  provided through Families First, the state placement  preservation program.  In addition, Hennepin County has a  separate reunification program that is described below.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>The Hennepin County DSS Children and Family Services  Division was reorganized into a family preservation model  comprising three functions:  immediate response,  reunification, and permanency. </p>
<p>The reunification program was established in 1992  adhering to these three functions.  Three community agencies  do whatever DCFS requires to facilitate reunification.   Service is provided for 90 days, with extension possible.   Workers carry two to four cases each, and flexible funds are  available.  </p>
<p>This program has served 200 families since its founding  in 1992. </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p><b> </b>The reunification program serves children age  0-18 in the child welfare system and placed out of the home.   It serves children in all types of placement and  specialized originally in children who had been in placement  for over one year.</p>
<p>Referrals may be made at any point, depending on the  case.  The reunification unit is mobilized when it appears  that the child will be going home.  A 30-day notice of  return is preferred.  Workers decide which cases should be  referred for reunification, and the supervisor reviews the  referral.  Then, the provider assesses the family, meets  with agency staff, and draws up a reunification plan that  becomes the agency-provider contract. </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The Hennepin County program has not been evaluated.</p>
<h2>4. Missouri</h2>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p><b> </b>Family Reunion, is a pilot project that works  to reunite families when it appears that the children would  not otherwise be returned home.  The program is available in  Jackson County (Kansas City) and in St. Louis City and  County (St. Louis Metro area).  Workers carry a  caseload of  three families, and service is provided for 60 days, with a  possible 30 day extension.  Originally, the program was  designed to return the child home within two weeks of  referral and to use the remaining time to work with the  intact family.  However, it has actually taken closer to a  month to ready the family for child's return, so most cases  have been extended to 90 days of service.  The pilot project  facilitates visitation.  In addition, flexible funds are  made available to the family.    </p>
<p>According to the state manual, program staff are  expected to work intensively with 13-15 families per year.   Up to 13 hours per week (an average of 5-10 hours) of  face-to-face or telephone contact is expected to be devoted  to each family.  The majority of this contact is to be  face-to-face.  Staff are on-call to families 24 hours per  day.  During the three months the programs were operating in  FY 94, St. Louis City/County served 31 families in the  program and Jackson served 24 families.</p>
<p>Jackson County representatives explained that the child  is returned home within two weeks after the specialist  accepts the case.  The specialist then works with the family  for 8-12 weeks.  Ninety days later, if the situation is  stable, the court releases jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>The target population for Family Reunion is children  0-18 who in the absence of the program would not otherwise  be reunified in a six-month period.  Jackson County  representatives explained that children are identified for  reunion by the family's worker and supervisor.  After the  referral is made, the case is screened by a committee that  includes the court, DFS and the provider.  If the referral  is approved, a specialist is assigned.  The specialist, the  DFS worker and the family meet for a final assessment.   Specialists do not accept the case unless they believe  reunification is going to work.  The state does not specify  the length of time a child must have remained in foster care  before being referred to the program, but the court prefers  that it have jurisdiction before referral.  </p>
<p>Jackson County representatives described the program  criteria as the following:</p>
<p>· The child is in alternative care and reasonable  efforts have bee made to return the child without this  service;</p>
<p>· The family has not been in the family  preservation program for the last six months;</p>
<p>· The goal for the family is reunification, but  special services are needed to make it happen;</p>
<p>· Safety issues have been identified and resolved,  or are being resolved;</p>
<p>· The child and at least one caretaker are willing  to participate; and  </p>
<p>· The court is in agreement.</p>
<p>All of the referrals to Family Reunion come from child  welfare. </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The Family Reunion program is currently being evaluated  by the University of Missouri at St. Louis.  The Jackson  County Family Reunion program is a research project.  The  University of Missouri is tracking it.  Of the 24  reunifications completed to date, six have disrupted,  yielding a reunification rate of 75 percent.</p>
<p>Information is kept by hand, but the state is working  toward automating all of the Family Reunion data from the  three research sites.</p>
<h2>5. New York</h2>
<p><b> </b>There is no reunification program in the state  of New York.  Some counties (such as Erie county) are  providing reunification services through placement  prevention services.  In addition, a reunification  demonstration project has been in operation in New York  City.  This project is described below.</p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p>HomeRebuilders is an ambitious attempt to provide  reunification services in a cost effective manner.  The  HomeRebuilders program is largely based on an analysis of  New York State's administrative data which showed that  children languishing in care (often with a goal of  reunification) were driving up the state's foster care  caseload and the cost of providing care.</p>
<p>This three-year reunification demonstration project  operates  in New York City, the sole catchment area.  The  program is targeted at children who have been residing in  foster boarding homes, including relative's homes for some  time.  Six voluntary agencies are providing services.  The  demonstration is currently serving a total of 2,000  children, representing an estimated 7.5 percent of the  City's eligible caseload.  </p>
<p>Agencies that provide HomeRebuilders are reimbursed for  the program through a capitated payment based on the  estimated cost of providing care for the child in the  absence of the program.  Agencies are allowed to develop  their own set (or sets) of specialized services, and to vary  program implementation in terms of caseload size, and  service duration.  </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p>HomeRebuilders defines its target population using the  following factors:  </p>
<p>· age of child (16 and under);</p>
<p>· type of foster care placement (foster family  homes, including relative's homes); </p>
<p>· permanency planning goal (reunification and/or  adoption); and</p>
<p>· time in care prior to onset of demonstration.   </p>
<p>HomeRebuilders is targeted at children who were in the  system at the time the program started.  Children accepted  to the program usually have been cared for in the foster  care system for at least 90 days, and often for much longer.    </p>
<p>The Office of Case Management, New York City Child  Welfare Administration, approves all program discharges and  referrals.  Individual programs decide in conjunction with  the families and the Office of Case Management when services  should cease.  The capitated payment covers the board and  maintenance rate, discharge planning, and aftercare  services.  The total amount of the payment is based on the  estimated length of stay in care, in the absence of the  program.   </p>
<h2>c. Evaluation</h2>
<p>The demonstration project is currently being evaluated  by the state.</p>
<h2>6. Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>There is no statewide reunification program.  The  programs in Allegheny County and Philadelphia County are  described below.</p>
<h2>a. Allegheny County</h2>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>Allegheny County has both crisis-oriented and  longer-term family reunification programs.  The programs are  operated by ten private providers under contract to  Allegheny County Children and Youth Services.  The crisis  oriented program, which was established in 1992 operates  countywide.  It provides crisis response when a child has  been returned home on short notice and without a plan.  This  program follows a modified Homebuilders model.  Workers  carry a maximum caseload of four families and provide  services for six weeks.   </p>
<p>The longer term program, which was established in  February 1994, also operates countywide.  This program  follows the Iowa model. Workers in this program carry a  caseload of four families and provide service for three  months, with the possibility of extending service to seven  months.  Services decrease in intensity during these months.  </p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>The crisis-oriented component targets young children and  children in short-term placement or shelters.  It provides  crisis intervention services countywide to children who are  being returned home on short notice and without a plan.  The  longer-term component provides more traditional  reunification services to families with a child in  out-of-home placement for whom the plan is reunification.   Currently, the program is focusing on children in shelter  care and those who have been in foster homes for six months  or less.  </p>
<p>Referrals are made to the reunification program's  central intake by the child's worker.  The referrals are  then screened by this unit.  The reunification providers are  grouped geographically by county regional office.  Children  are referred to the provider that serves the area in which  the child's family lives.</p>
<p>No cases are categorically excluded from the program.  </p>
<p>3) Evaluation</p>
<p>The State of Pennsylvania is currently evaluating the  family preservation program through Shippensburg University.   DCYS began an evaluation of the reunification program in  January 1995. </p>
<h2>b. Philadelphia County, PA</h2>
<p>1) Structure</p>
<p>The Philadelphia County reunification program began in  1994.  The county has contracted with three private  providers to provide the services.  Each of the providers  follow the same 12-week model, philosophy and program.   Program guidelines were established by the state, and  programs must follow them in order to be eligible for grant  funds.</p>
<p>Ideally, the program works with the child and family for  six weeks before the child is returned and for six weeks  more after reunification.  Sometimes, however, this period  must be shortened, for example, when the court orders a  child to be returned immediately.</p>
<p>The program is not yet at capacity.  It has served 75  families since it was established in April 1994.  This  number is expected to double this year. </p>
<p>2) Operation</p>
<p>The reunification program serves children in various  types of foster care settings including institutions.  There  is a single criterion for entry into the program: a child  for whom the plan is reunification and for whom  reunification can be accomplished within the next six weeks.   Children may be identified for reunification at any point  in the case process.   </p>
<p>Referrals are made by the child's worker to the Family  Preservation unit.  The Family Preservation unit directs  referrals to specific programs, based in part on space  available, and in part on the provider's experience and  expertise.  The providers are part of the assessment  process, and the assessment is regarded as a collaboration  between the agency and the provider.</p>
<p>3) Evaluation</p>
<p>No evaluation has been conducted.</p>
<h2>7. Texas</h2>
<p>The statewide reunification program is still in its  formative stages.  Policy is currently being developed by  CPS to outline parameters for a reunification program.   Bexar County (San Antonio) has two long established  reunification programs; they are separately described below.   </p>
<h2>a. Structure</h2>
<p><b> </b>There are two reunification programs in Bexar  County -- one for recently placed children and one for  children in long-term placement.  There is a separate unit  for each program.  Both programs follow a family systems  model, and both serve only CPS cases and children for whom  the agency has custody (called conservatorship in Texas).   </p>
<p>The program for recently placed children was established  in 1987.  Workers in this unit carry a caseload of three to  five families.  Service is provided for as long as 18  months; the average is eight to nine months.  The program  for children in long-term placement was established in 1983.   Workers in this program carry a caseload of six to eight  families.  Service is provided for six to nine months.   Flexible funds are not available for either program. </p>
<p>The objective of the reunification program is to find  permanency for the child.  The unit for recently-placed  children has served 138 families since 1987.  The unit for  children in long-term placement served 70 families in 1994.   </p>
<h2>b. Operation</h2>
<p><b> </b>The reunification program serves children for  whom the agency has custody.  One unit serves children who  have just entered placement.  These children are usually  young and placed in foster family care.  Their parents also  tend to be young.  The family has not yet been treated, and  the goal is to have the child home within three weeks.  Even  if the child returns home, the agency retains custody, and  at six months files a petition to return custody to the  parents if the situation warrants.  Services continue until  the situation is stable.  Referrals are made by the child's  worker.  Sometimes the court or the child's guardian ad  litem requests the service.  The unit can screen the  referrals.  </p>
<p>A second reunification unit serves children who have  been in care, usually for six months or longer.  These  children are typically older and may have been in any type  of foster placement.  The families have had treatment, and  there is a plan to return the child.  The agency retains  custody for three to six months after the child is returned  and may provide services after custody is returned to the  parents, if the situation warrants.  </p>
<p>Referrals are made by the child's worker when the worker  decides that return is appropriate, usually four to six  weeks before the child returns.  Workers meet with the  family, the foster family and other providers ahead of time  for pre-unification work.  This is the established protocol,  but sometimes the court orders quicker action, and the  agency must respond.  </p>

<p>&lt;5&gt;     An extensive evaluation of the Illinois  family preservation program has recently been completed.   Since state officials are unlikely to undertake another  rigorous evaluation in so short a time period, Illinois was  excluded from this program review.  Three states (Indiana,  Louisiana, and Virginia) have not yet responded to a request  for information.</p>
<p>&lt;6&gt;     In some states, the information provided  by the state was sufficient to determine that the state was  not a likely candidate for further study (e.g., program was  only recently established).</p>
<p>&lt;7&gt;     Massachusetts gives funds to regional  offices who in turn fund programs by district.  It was not  possible to identify a significant population center  employing a specific model.</p>
