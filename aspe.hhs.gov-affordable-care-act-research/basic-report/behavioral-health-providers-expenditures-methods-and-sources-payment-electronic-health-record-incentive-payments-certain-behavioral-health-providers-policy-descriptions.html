</dl><h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>This report is intended to describe sources of payment for behavioral  		health providers and types of payments (methods, units, adjustments and  		updates) made to inpatient, outpatient, independent practitioners, and other  		providers of behavioral health services. A significant focus of this report  		describes these same factors in terms of Medicare and Medicaid spending.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report, behavioral health is defined as the  		diagnosis and treatment of mental health and/or substance use disorders. The  		term behavioral health will precede the words providers, services,  		payments, organizations, and funding and have the same meaning as described in  		this paragraph throughout the report.</p>
<p>The term substance abuse treatment and substance use treatment are used  		interchangeably. For years, the treatment of addiction and heavy substance use  		was known as substance abuse treatment. The treatment community has identified  		with the terms addiction disorders, substance abuse and substance use  		treatment, among others to describe their discipline.</p>
<p>Information on the activities of the Certification Commission for Health  		Information Technology (CCHIT) related to the Comprehensive Behavioral Health  		Stand Alone and Behavioral Health Add-On to Ambulatory Care Electronic Health  		Record (EHR) Criteria hasbeen provided under separate cover. This description  		is intended to align the CCHIT criteria to the standards of the Office of the  		National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology (HIT) contained in  		the January 13, 2010 ONC IFR.</p>
<p>Lastly, a determination of behavioral health providers who could qualify  		for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR incentive payments  		if they meaningfully use a certified EHR product as described in the January  		13, 2010, The CMS Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) is included at the end  		of this report.</p>
<h3>Caution to Readers</h3>
<p>Financing behavioral health services in the United States is a complex  		web of resource decisions and allocations, funding strategies, payer sources  		and recipient eligibility requirements that include a wide range of public and  		private payers. The information in this report is based on research that has  		been made publicly available through federal agencies including executive  		branch and congressional agencies; national trade associations that represent  		different providers of behavioral health services; scholarly journals; and  		information obtained through years of studying the financing of behavioral  		health services throughout the United States. Sorting through the information  		to illustrate a clear picture of behavioral health spending across payers and  		services is no easy task. The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Interim  		Report to the President released in October 2002 summed up the situation  		precisely: </p>
<blockquote><p>"The mental health services system defies easy description. Loosely  		  defined, the system collectively refers to the full array of programs for  		  anyone with mental illness. The programs deliver or pay for treatments,  		  services, or any other types of supports, such as disability, housing, or  		  employment. These programs are found at every level of government and in the  		  private sector. They have varying missions, settings, and financing. The  		  mission could be to offer treatment in the form of medication, psychotherapy,  		  substance abuse treatment, or counseling. Or it could be to offer  		  rehabilitation support. The setting could be a hospital, a community clinic, a  		  private office, or in a school or business. The financing of care, which  		  amounts to at least $80 billion annually, could come from at least one of a  		  myriad of sources -- Medicaid, Medicare, a state agency, a local agency, a  		  foundation, or private insurance. Each funding source has its own complex,  		  sometimes contradictory, set of rules."<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>

<p>Nonetheless, tables and information displayed in this report are  		intended to help educate the reader amid the difficulties of collecting  		information about a decentralized, multi-payer system of behavioral health  		services. </p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">OVERVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPENDING IN THE UNITED  		STATES</a></h2>
<p>Each year, more than 33 million Americans access behavioral health  		services to treat conditions resulting from mental health or substance use  		disorders at a cost of $121 billion. Approximately 28 million Americans, or 13%  		of the total United States population aged 18 or older, received mental health  		treatment in an inpatient or outpatient setting, and more than 6% of American  		children and adolescents (about 13 million American children) aged 517  		had contact with a mental health professional in a 2-month period according to  		the 19981999 National Health Interview Survey.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Similar to other forms of health care, payers of behavioral health are  		many and diverse. For 2003, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  		Administration (SAMHSA) estimated that spending on behavioral health services  		amounted to $121 billion.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> The following table illustrates behavioral  		health spending among major United States payer sources.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Public sources of funding, Medicare, Medicaid, State Children's Health  		Insurance Program (SCHIP), other federal, and states, are the predominate  		payers of behavioral health services. Together, these payers contribute more  		than $75.4 billion, or 62% to total behavioral health spending. <i>Medicaid, a  		jointly funded federal and state program, is the largest payer of behavioral  		health services. </i>Of the public payers, states play the most significant  		role in paying for services through state appropriations for non-Medicaid  		services, block grant spending, and the states match for Medicaid and  		SCHIP programs. For Fiscal Year (FY) 2003, the states share of total behavioral  		health spending equaled $42.3 billion, or 35% of total spending among all  		payers. </p>
<p>In 2003, the Federal Government through Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP and  		other federal spending contributed $33.1 billion, or 27% of total behavioral  		health spending among all payers.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>State Mental Health Agency (SMHA) is the term used to describe the state  		agency that has primary responsibility for the delivery of mental health and/or  		substance abuse services in each state. SMHAs have unique spending  		and operational characteristics which can exacerbate an already  		complex system of funding streams and provider designations. SMHAs take on many  		roles and may be considered as a payer and provider for the same behavioral  		health service. The SMHA can be one or more of the following:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>A state general fund payer of behavioral health services purchasing  			 such services at hospitals, community mental health centers, or independent  			 practitioner offices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A provider offering services to Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries  			 at a state hospital or state-operated community mental health center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recipient of federal funds that are passed-through to other  			 government organizations or private outpatient mental health centers for the  			 payment of behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Of the $121 billion in behavioral health spending, $20 billion or 17%  		was attributable to substance use treatment and $100 billion or 83% for the  		treatment of mental health conditions. This amount includes 7% spending on  		insurance administration for both mental health and substance use diagnosis and  		treatment. </p>
<h3>Public Behavioral Health Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The role of the federal and state governments as primary funders of  		behavioral health services is important to understanding who are the providers  		of behavioral health services. The difference between the Federal Government,  		through Medicare, and how states structure their Medicaid behavioral health  		systems is important to understanding behavioral health spending and payment  		systems under the two insurance programs.</p>
<p>In 2008, Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental  		Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to reduce discrimination against those  		seeking treatment for health and substance use conditions. The Act closed  		several loopholes left by the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act and extends equal  		coverage to all aspects of health insurance plans. The new Act does not apply  		to Medicare patients. Prior to passage of the 2008 Parity Act and also in 2008,  		Congress provided for Medicare coinsurance parity for Medicare patients by  		2014, when it enacted phase-in parity under the Medicare  		Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. The later Parity Act of 2008 does  		apply to Medicaid managed care health plans.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Medicare</b></i></p>
<p>Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D cover behavioral health services and  		providers for elderly and disabled Americans. These programs include a range of  		behavioral health services:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Medicare Part A -- 190 day lifetime limit for inpatient  			 free-standing psychiatric hospital stays. Stays in specialty psychiatric units  			 of general hospitals in or general acute care beds are not subject to the  			 190-day limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicare Part B -- Mental health and substance abuse services  			 (counseling, testing, medical management) are provided on an outpatient basis  			 by a physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, clinical nurse  			 specialist, nurse practitioner or physician assistant in an office setting,  			 clinic or hospital outpatient department. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicare Part C -- Medicare Part A and Part B behavioral health  			 services are provided through private health plans. These Medicare Advantage  			 (MA) plans may expand behavioral health services available to enrollees for an  			 additional charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicare Part D -- Coverage for certain outpatient and psychotropic  			 prescription drugs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Medicaid</b></i></p>
<p>Medicaid provides behavioral health insurance coverage for certain  		low-income Americans. States administer Medicaid within federal requirements  		which mandate coverage for certain individuals and services. States may chose  		to cover optional populations and services for which they receive federal  		matching funds. With the exception of early and periodic screening, diagnostic,  		and treatment (EPSDT) services for individuals under 21, states may impose  		restrictions on the number of services a recipient receives, the type of  		service that is provided, where the services are provided, and from whom the  		recipient receives the service. Each service must be sufficient in amount,  		duration, and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose. States may place  		appropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity.  		</p>
<p>State Medicaid programs may cover behavioral health services by a  		variety of providers and settings. While there are not eligibility groups tied  		explicitly to mental health or substance use illness nor are there behavioral  		health benefits that are explicitly included in the required set of Medicaid  		benefits, behavioral health treatment instead is covered under several broad  		categories of benefits by <b>all</b> state Medicaid programs. Behavioral health  		services are covered by <b>all</b> states in the following mandatory health  		services:</p>
<ul><li>Physician services,</li>
<li>Lab services,</li>
<li>Inpatient hospital services,</li>
<li>Outpatient hospital services,</li>
<li>EPSDT services,</li>
<li>Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) services,</li>
<li>Rural health clinic (RHC) services, and</li>
<li>Certified pediatric and family nurse practitioner services.</li>
</ul><p>States Medicaid agencies develop their Medicaid covered behavioral  		health services with their states behavioral health system in mind. For  		example, if a state general-funded behavioral health system covers medications  		for persons not covered by the Medicaid program, the Medicaid agency may opt to  		cover psychiatric medications for its Medicaid-eligible populations.</p>
<p>Optional Medicaid services are prevalent in state Medicaid plans. States  		may chose to cover behavioral health services as optional Medicaid services  		under their state plan. Behavioral health services are frequently selected by  		states to cover a broad range of behavioral health services that would  		otherwise not be covered by mandatory Medicaid services. Optional behavioral  		health services have included prescription drugs, care provided by licensed or  		certified professionals who can bill independently, rehabilitation services,  		clinic services, case management, peer support, and other special or remedial  		care. Nationally, 29.3% of all Medicaid recipients (including recipients of  		behavioral health services) are enrolled in Medicaid through state optional  		programs and account for 42% of all Medicaid spending. Every state in the  		nation has included the Rehabilitation Option in their Medicaid State Plan and  		offer behavioral health services through this program.</p>
<p>More than 65% of Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in some form of  		managed care. As of June 2005, 26 states contracted with a behavioral health  		care organization (BHO or managed care organization ( MCO)) or an  		administrative services organization (ASO) that specialize in the delivery and  		management of mental health and substance use services. States may  		carve-out mental health services or specialty populations from a  		managed care BHO or ASO Medicaid arrangement or, from a fee-for-service (FFS)  		Medicaid program. In June 2005, there were 34 such carve-out arrangements  		nationwide. Carve-out arrangements allow for mental health and substance use  		services to be provided by specialty providers and separates insurance benefits  		by condition or disorder, service category and/or population. Under a managed  		care behavioral carve-out, certain managed care tools such as utilization  		management, provider incentives, quality management and network access targets  		are required by states and used by behavioral health MCOs. States can seek  		authority under federal law through Medicaid waivers such as an 1115  		demonstration waiver or 1915(b) managed care waiver to offer behavioral health  		managed care either through a carve-out organization or integrated with other  		waiver services provided to entire Medicaid populations regardless of condition  		or disorder.</p>
<p>Medicaid and Medicare payment for behavioral health services is  		significantly different and are described throughout this paper. </p>
<h2><a name="who" id="who">WHO ARE PROVIDERS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES?</a></h2>
<p>Behavioral health conditions can be treated by many different medical  		and social service providers in a variety of settings. Each year,  		psychiatrists, non-psychiatric physicians, psychologists, nurse practitioners,  		physician assistants, licensed clinical therapists, other licensed and  		certified clinicians, behavioral health paraprofessionals and technicians, and  		case managers and peer support specialists provide mental health and substance  		use services to more than 33 million Americans. These services are provided at  		inpatient facilities (hospitals and residential treatment facilities),  		outpatient clinics (e.g., community mental health centers), and substance abuse  		treatment facilities, through crisis mobile services, in a persons home  		or in other informal settings. </p>
<p>Specialty mental health providers include psychiatrists, psychologists,  		and psychiatric nurses possessing formal graduate degrees in mental health.  		Mental health providers are also social workers, counselors, nurses, and  		therapists who either have received additional, specialized training in  		treating mental health problems and illnesses prior to their professional  		practice, or have chosen to practice in a mental health care setting and gained  		advanced knowledge in treating mental problems and illnesses through  		experience. These mental health providers may also provide substance use  		services. In the Institute of Medicines report on improving quality care  		for mental health and substance use conditions, the report cited SAMHSAs  		most recent estimates of the numbers of clinically trained (CT) and clinically  		active (CA) mental health personnel and are shown in the following  		table.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>

<p>Inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs) refer to all providers of  		24-hour care for the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health conditions.  		Facilities include non-governmental free-standing psychiatric hospitals, state  		psychiatric hospitals (these first two are often referred to Institutes for  		Mental Disease, or IMDs, under Medicaid), general hospital psychiatric units,  		and residential treatment centers (RTC). In 2008 the number of IPFs in the  		United States totaled 2,257 and had direct expenditures of $20.6  		billion.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>According to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 42 Part 482 Section  		482.60, the term Medicare/Medicaid psychiatric hospital means an institution  		which:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Is primarily engaged in providing psychiatric services for the  			 diagnosis and treatment of persons with a mental illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfies the requirements of §§1861(e)(3) through (e)(9)  			 of the Social Security Act, requirements for general hospitals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintains clinical or other records on all patients as defined by  			 the Secretary of HHS for individuals entitled to Medicare Part A hospital  			 benefits (specified in §482.61).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meets staffing requirements as defined by the Secretary of HHS in  			 §482.62 to carry out active treatment for persons receiving services in  			 the facility.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In addition, psychiatric inpatient hospitals are required to meet the  		conditions of participation (CoPs) specified for general hospitals (i.e., found  		in Sections: 482.1 through 482.23; 482.25 through 487.57). Notable psychiatric  		hospital CoPs include the following requirements:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Additional social service record keeping, including reports of  			 interviews with patients, family members, and others, must provide an  			 assessment of home plans and family attitudes, and community resource contacts  			 as well as a social history (482.61(4)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each patient in a psychiatric inpatient hospital must have an  			 individual comprehensive treatment plan that must be based on an inventory of  			 the patients strengths and disabilities including a substantiated  			 diagnosis, short-term and long-range goals; specific treatment modalities used;  			 responsibilities of the members of the treatment team; and adequate  			 documentation to justify the diagnosis and the treatment and rehabilitation  			 activities are carried out (482.61(7)(c)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychiatric inpatient hospitals must employ adequate numbers of  			 qualified personnel and supportive staff to evaluate patients, formulate  			 written, individualized comprehensive treatment plans, provide active treatment  			 measures, and engage in discharge planning (482.62).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional standards for the director of inpatient psychiatric  			 services, clinical director, and nursing services (482.62(b)(c)(d)).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>An RTC, also known as a psychiatric residential treatment facility (PRTF  		under the federal Medicaid laws and rules) is any non-hospital facility that  		holds a provider agreement with a state Medicaid agency to provide inpatient  		services benefit to Medicaid-eligible individuals under the age of 21. These  		facilities must be accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of  		Healthcare Organizations or any other accrediting organization with comparable  		standards recognized by the state. PRTFs must meet the requirement in Sections  		441.51 through 441.182 of the CFR. PRTFs must comply with CoPs on the use of  		restraint and seclusion as well as the reporting of serious occurrences to the  		state Medicaid agency and to the state-designated Protection and Advocacy  		Organization per Section 483.374(b).</p>

<p>The IMD exclusion is one of the few instances in which federal Medicaid  		law prohibits federal contribution to the cost of medically necessary  		behavioral health care by licensed medical professionals for Medicaid  		recipients.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> The 1965  		law that established the exclusion for all Medicaid recipients was later  		amended to allow federal financial participation for persons under 21 years of  		age and 65 years and over who stayed in stand-alone governmental and  		non-governmental psychiatric hospitals (thus maintaining the exclusion of  		Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 21 and 64). The law was also amended  		to allow free-standing psychiatric hospitals with less than 17 beds to receive  		federal Title XIX contributions. Two categories of inpatient facilities remain  		affected by the Medicaid IMD exclusion: non-governmental inpatient psychiatric  		hospitals and state psychiatric hospitals.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Residential Treatment Facilities (RTC)</b> -- The 2008 NAPHS Annual  		Survey indicated that the primary payer of RTC services is Medicaid, paying for  		45.2% of all admissions to RTCs due to a high number of child and adolescent  		admissions and stays. Other payers included commercial insurers (28.3%),  		state/local government (15.5%), and other payers (11%).</p>
<h3>Inpatient Hospital Payment Rate Setting, Adjustments,  		and Updates -- Medicare and Medicaid</h3>
<p>Payment methods vary greatly among payers of IPFs. For this report, of  		particular interest are the different methods used by Medicare to set inpatient  		psychiatric non-governmental free-standing and specialized hospital-based unit  		rates and state Medicaid programs for IPFs (government and non-government), and  		RTC facilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Medicare</b></i></p>
<p>CMS sets rates for Medicare IPFs. Effective January 2005, Medicare  		implemented an IPF prospective payment system (PPS). This method of payment is  		applicable to Medicare-certified free-standing government and non-government  		psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general hospitals and critical  		access hospitals (CAHs). The IPF PPS is based on a standardized Federal per  		diem base rate calculated from IPF average per diem costs and adjusted for  		budget-neutrality in the implementation year. The federal per diem base rate is  		the standard payment per day under the IPF PPS adjusted by the applicable  		wage-index factor, and the patient and facility-level adjustors that are  		applicable to the IPF stay (42 CFR § 412.428). Further, the per diem  		adjusted rate (inclusive of geographic, facility and patient characteristics)  		is multiplied by the variable per diem adjuster which is higher for the first  		day when an emergency department is present (i.e., multiplier is equal to 1.31)  		and lower when a emergency department is not present (i.e., multiplier is equal  		to 1.19) or patients length of stay is beyond one day (day two multiplier  		equals 1.12; 22 or more days multiplier equals 0.92).<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>For rate year (FY) 2010, the base payment rate is $652, based on the  		national average of daily routine operating, ancillary, and capital costs in  		IPFs in 2002. The base rate is adjusted for patient characteristics of age,  		diagnosis, comorbidities and length of stay. Facility adjustments include  		wage-index, rural location, teaching (interns and resident ratios), cost of  		living, and emergency department adjustments. IPFs also receive additional  		payment for each electroconvulsive therapy treatment furnished to a patient. An  		outlier payment policy and payment pool of 2% of total payments is available  		for extraordinarily high cost cases.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Current law does not define a mechanism for updating the base payment  		IPF rate. According to MedPac, CMS has stated that it intends to update the IPF  		payment rates annually by the increase in CMSs hospital market basket,  		which measures the price increases of goods and services hospitals buy to  		produce patient care. </p>
<p>Most recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),  		signed into law on March 23, 2010, amended the inpatient psychiatric PPS annual  		update process by revising the hospital market basket reduction. This, in  		addition to the productivity adjustment and are as follows: -0.3 in FY 2014,  		-0.2 in FY 2015-2016, and -0.75 in FY 2017, FY 2018 and FY 2019. </p>
<p>A limited number of psychiatric patients are cared for in  		non-specialized medical/surgical beds located in general hospitals, referred to  		as scatter beds. Scatter beds are used for voluntary psychiatric admission,  		meet medical necessity requirements, and rely on the education and training of  		general medical staff. Under Medicare, hospitals are reimbursed under hospital  		diagnostic related group (DRG) rates and are not reimbursed under the IPF PPS  		for scatter bed stays. A June 2010 joint SAMHSA and Agency for Healthcare  		Research and Quality study of general hospital psychiatric admissions (which  		does not include stand-alone state or private psychiatric facilities or RTC  		admissions) found that more than 93% of psychiatric patients received care in  		specialty units of general hospitals while less than 7% of psychiatric patient  		admissions were cared for in scatter beds of general hospitals.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Medicaid</b></i></p>
<p>Medicaid inpatient facility rates are set by each state operating under  		their Medicaid state plan, waivers, amendments and options. States Medicaid  		unit rates for IPFs are often, but not across the board, per diem  		pre-determined rates. One exception includes payment to RTC facilities whereby  		there is pre-payment or block purchase of RTC beds to ensure adequate RTC  		capacity. Reconciliation to the block purchase or pre-payment is completed at  		the end of a states fiscal year.</p>
<p>Under Medicaid FFS, inpatient hospital payment rates are adjusted  		according to states Medicaid plan provisions. State Medicaid agencies who  		administer the state plan must make findings and assurances to CMS that the  		rates paid to inpatient hospitals are adequate and reasonable to meet the costs  		incurred of an efficiently and economically run facility and that Medicaid  		recipients have reasonable access to inpatient settings that provide quality  		services. States provide this assurance to CMS upon review of state plans,  		amendments or waivers.</p>
<p>More than 65% of the total Medicaid population is enrolled in some form  		of Medicaid managed care program.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> Under Medicaid managed care, state Medicaid  		agencies must comply with 42 CFR § 438.6 and ensure actuarially sound  		capitation rates are paid to MCOs. Actuarial sound capitation rates  		are rates that have been developed in accordance with generally accepted  		actuarial principles and practices; are appropriate for the populations to be  		covered and the services to be furnished under the contract; and have been  		certified as meeting the requirements of the regulation by actuaries who meet  		the qualification standards established by the American Academy of Actuaries  		and follow the practice standards established by the Actuarial Standards Board.  		Payments to inpatient facilities are often included in the capitation rates  		established for MCOs.</p>
<p>Medicaid rates for inpatient facilities can be determined in a number of  		ways. As of April 2010, <b>payment methods</b> used by state Medicaid agencies  		for many types of inpatient settings (acute and psychiatric) include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Per Stay Medicare-DRG (Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky,  			 Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,  			 Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, West Virginia).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per State -- Medicare Severity DRGS by state (Michigan, New  			 Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per Stay -- All-Patient Refined DRGs (Montana, New York, Rhode  			 Island).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost Reimbursement (Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho,  			 Maine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per Stay -- All Patient (District of Columbia, Georgia, Indiana,  			 Nebraska, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per Diem (Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana,  			 Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per Stay -- Other (Delaware, Massachusetts, Nevada,  			 Wyoming).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other regulated charges (Maryland).<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>States may assign a modifier or tier to the type of hospital  		stay (for example, psychiatric stays). This results in a different payment rate  		for the psychiatric hospital or for a psychiatric stay in a specialty unit or  		scatter bed of a general hospital.</p>
<p>A recent policy brief from the Center for Health Care Strategies calls  		out the need for Medicaid payment reform for both hospital inpatient and  		hospital outpatient care as more and more low-income individuals become  		eligible for Medicaid services under the PPACA (P.L. 111-148, March 23, 2010 as  		amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, P.L.  		111-152, March 30, 2010). With expansion of Medicaid eligibility it is expected  		that more individuals with mental health and substance use conditions will be  		entitled to insurance coverage. In addition, the national health reform  		legislation calls for development and testing of innovative payment methods in  		Medicaid; multiple demonstration projects that increase federal medical  		assistance percentages or combine funding authorities (Medicaid and Medicare);  		and bundled payments to accountable care organizations that provide financial  		incentives for cost containment across multiple patient care sites.</p>
<h3>Health Information Technology Implementation</h3>
<p>In a 2009 behavioral health information systems survey, close to 50% of  		hospital and RTC respondents reported their hospital or RTC has either fully or  		partially implemented some of the major components of a HIT system. These  		components include billing, scheduling, clinical assessment, and treatment  		planning. Most hospitals and RTCs reported that they have yet to implement the  		quality improvement and outcomes functionality of an HIT system. More than 90%  		of the psychiatric hospitals surveyed reported that cost was a barrier and more  		than 55% reported that insufficient reimbursement was a barrier. Of the RTCs  		surveyed, more than 70% reported that cost was a major barrier to implementing  		HIT and 56% responded insufficient reimbursement was also a factor.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In the American Hospital Associations 2008 Annual Survey  		Information Technology Supplement, 76% of psychiatric hospitals reported that  		their hospital does not participate in any regional arrangements for the  		exchange of electronic health information. Additionally, the non-participation  		by psychiatric hospitals is significantly less than that of medical/surgical  		hospitals (57.6% non-participation rate). Furthermore, psychiatric hospitals  		(mean = $.5 million) spend significantly less than medical/surgical hospitals  		(mean = $6.9 million) on operating and capital information technology  		(IT).<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="outpatient" id="outpatient">OUTPATIENT PROVIDERS -- PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION,  		COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS, OUTPATIENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROVIDERS</a></h2>
<p>Outpatient behavioral health providers refer to providers of <b>less  		than 24-hour care</b> for the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health  		conditions. For the purposes of this report, outpatient providers include  		partial hospitalization (hospital-based outpatient treatment centers),community  		mental health centers (CMHCs), outpatient substance use treatment centers, and  		other mental health organizations for which data is available. Independently  		licensed practitioners and other licensed or certified provider information are  		described in the next two sections of this report. </p>
<p>Partial hospitalization is a type of treatment program that is used to  		treat behavioral health conditions. An individual who is being treated in a  		partial hospitalization program is living at home, but commutes to treatment  		center up to seven days a week. Partial hospitalization services are affiliated  		with a hospital and may be licensed as part of the hospital or a separate  		free-standing program. Group therapy, individual therapy, medication management  		and other services are provided in the partial hospitalization setting.</p>
<p>CMHCs are publically and privately operated and funded. CMHCs provide a  		variety of behavioral health services to persons living in the community. CMHCs  		fulfill a treatment need to provide community-based care as an alternative to  		institutional care provided in large psychiatric hospitals and asylums  		throughout the United States. Initial funding for many CMHCs came from  		Community Mental Health Act of 1963 to build and develop behavioral health  		facilities and programs throughout the United States. Prior to the passage of  		the 1963 Act, CMHCs served multiple purposes for a community, including  		treatment of mental retardation and the provision of other low-income services  		and were known as multi-service mental health organizations. The 1963 Act  		concentrated CMHC efforts to fund federal priority populations including adults  		with serious and persistent mental illness and children under 18 who exhibited  		severe emotional or social disabilities. With the passage of the 1981 Omnibus  		Reconciliation Act, mandatory federal funding ceased to federally qualified  		CMHCs (thus, eliminating the federal designation of CMHC) and funding was block  		granted to states for the delivery of behavioral health services to multiple  		provider organizations, including CMHCs and other multi-service mental health  		organizations.</p>
<p>Outpatient substance use treatment centers may provide intake,  		assessment, referral, detoxification services, psychoanalytic therapy and  		counseling services among the many types of substance use treatment services.  		Outpatient substance use treatment services can be provided by specialty  		substance abuse centers, CMHCs or other providers of substance abuse  		services.</p>
<p>CMHCs and outpatient substance use treatment centers can be operated  		through large health care organizations that provide a continuum of mental  		health and substance abuse services including residential treatment, outpatient  		treatment, day treatment services, detoxification services, and other clinic  		services. Annual behavioral health budgets for these organizations can be  		millions or tens of millions of dollars and can be provided to clients from all  		across the state and sometimes from clients living outside a particular  		providers state. In contrast, some behavioral health providers that  		provide mental health and substance abuse services are small, have annual  		behavioral health budgets below $1.0 million dollars and provide very specific  		treatment services to a population. </p>
<h3>Number of Outpatient Providers by Provider Type</h3>
<p>There is not a clear designation process for determining if a provider  		is as an outpatient provider or other type of provider that  		provides less than 24-hour care. Outpatient providers are often synonymous with  		community-based providers. At other times, however, a RTC or PRTF is considered  		community-based, although it is considered an inpatient provider for payment  		purposes.</p>
<p>This contradictory use of terms creates different methods for counting  		providers, thus, results in a variety of outpatient provider counts being  		categorized under the umbrella term of outpatient providers. <a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#table8">Table 8</a> estimates the number of outpatient providers by the  		three outpatient provider types discussed in this section.</p>

<h3>Sources of Public Payment</h3>
<p>Outpatient providers receive payment from a variety of payers. Payer  		information by the three outpatient providers by payer is not available.  		However, <a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#table9">Table 9</a> provides estimates of spending for  		outpatient provider types by payer, substance use services, mental health  		services, and behavioral health services. These estimates assume that: (i)  		expenditures are distributed across the Medicare, Medicaid and other payers in  		the same way as was described for all behavioral health services (see  		<a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#table1">Table 1</a>) ; and (ii) the distribution of spending on  		substance abuse and mental health services is the same for outpatient providers  		as was reported in the SAMHSA 2007 spending report.</p>
<p>As illustrated in <a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#table1">Table 1</a>, Medicare (6.8%) and  		Medicaid (24.7%) paid for 31.5% of all behavioral health spending in 2003 for a  		total of $38.4 billion. As reported in the 2007 SAMHSA spending report, 49% of  		all substance use spending went to outpatient settings ($10 billion) while 31%  		of all mental health services were provided in outpatient settings ($31  		billion). Additionally, Medicare accounted for 5% of all substance use  		treatment spending and Medicaid accounted for 18% of all substance abuse  		spending. Likewise, Medicare accounted for 7% of all mental health spending and  		Medicaid paid for 26% of all mental health spending. Applying these same  		percentages across outpatient provider settings, a total of $12.6 billion can  		be attributed to Medicare and Medicaid spending for outpatient services.

<p>Payment methods vary greatly to outpatient providers. For this report,  		of particular interest are the different methods used by Medicare and state  		Medicaid programs for partial hospitalization, community mental health centers  		and outpatient substance use treatment facilities. As described below, Medicare  		and Medicaid payments to eligible outpatient providers follow different  		statutory language and rules. </p>
<p><i><b>Medicare</b></i></p>
<p>Medicare covers mental health care given by a doctor or qualified mental  		health professional. Medicare covers mental health services on an outpatient  		basis by a doctor, clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker,  		clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioners or physician assistant in an  		office setting, clinic or hospital outpatient department. Medicare also covers  		substance abuse treatment in an outpatient treatment center if they have agreed  		to participate in the Medicare program.</p>
<p>Medicare does not recognize CMHC as a provider type and thus does not  		set a payment rate for CMHC services. Instead, Medicare may pay for services by  		a qualified professional practicing in a CMHC, as long as the qualified  		professional is billing individually for services provided. </p>
<p>General provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) govern Medicare  		reimbursement of all services, including mental health services. Section  		1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act states that no payment may be made for services that  		"are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or  		injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member."<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Providers of mental health and substance abuse services must be  		qualified to perform the specific mental health services that are billed to  		Medicare. For services to be covered, mental health professionals must be  		working within their state scope of practice act, be licensed or certified to  		perform mental health services by the state in which the services are  		performed, and have a Medicare provider agreement.</p>
<p>Payment to Medicare outpatient providers follows the established  		Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). Pursuant to Section 1861(s)(2)(A) of  		the Act; 42 CFR § 410.26, Medicare allows physicians to bill for mental  		health services performed by their staffs and furnished to patients if the  		services are rendered incident to the physicians professional  		services. Under Medicare, psychologists receive 100% of the MPFS and licensed  		clinical social workers receive a portion of the MPFS for procedures defined in  		the CPT/Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System code sets.</p>
<p>The MPFS and corresponding Medicare payment is affected by three key  		factors: (i) the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) which includes  		adjustments (units) for physician work, practice expense, and professional  		liability insurance; (ii) geographic practice cost indexes, and (iii) the  		Medicare conversion factor.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> This process has been in place since 1992  		and replaced usual and customary charge payments previously used by CMS.</p>
<p><i><b>Medicaid</b></i></p>
<p>States establish their own payment rates for Medicaid providers. Federal  		regulations require that these rates be sufficient to enlist enough providers  		so that covered benefits will be available to Medicaid beneficiaries at least  		to the same extent they are available to the general population in the same  		geographic area. Qualified outpatient providers must be working within their  		state scope of practice act and licensed /certified to perform mental health  		and substance abuse services by the state in which the services are performed  		and documented in the state Medicaid plan.</p>
<p>Medicaid outpatient provider rate setting, adjustments, and updates  		follow a similar course to that of inpatient providers. State laws and rules  		may determine the method by which rates are adjusted, or absent state laws or  		rules, Medicaid rates may be set administratively. For example, states may  		update rates annually following Medicare rates for psychiatric procedure codes,  		provide a cost of living adjustment to an already established rate, re-base  		rates with new updated adjustments, or do nothing at all. Some state Medicaid  		programs use variationsof the Medicare RBRVS to determine physician  		reimbursement rates. Because the RBRVS fee schedule was created originally for  		Medicare only, many behavioral health CPT codes do not have a corresponding  		MPFS rate (physicians are not the primary provider of behavioral health  		services) and thus requires states to develop its own rate setting methodology  		beyond the use of RBRVS and the MPFS.</p>
<h3>Health Information Technology Implementation</h3>
<p>During FY 2009, community behavioral health providers reported average  		spending of approximately $485,000 on IT including hardware, software,  		maintenance, personnel, training and other IT expenses. Substance use and  		addiction treatment providers reported significantly less IT-related expenses  		totaling slightly $140,700 per year.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<p>More than 93% of community behavioral health providers have partially  		implemented (14%) or fully implemented (79.1%) electronic billing capacity as  		part of their electronic clinical information system and approximately 56% of  		community behavioral health providers have partially implemented (32.7%) or  		fully implemented (13.5%) quality improvement and outcomes measurement. Of  		substance use and addiction treatment providers, more than 90% of treatment  		providers have electronic billing capacity while 40% have either partially  		implemented (10%) or fully implemented (30%) a quality improvement and outcomes  		measurement component of their information system.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="independent" id="independent">INDEPENDENT LICENSED PRACTITIONERS</a></h2>
<p>The types of independent licensed or certified practitioners (other than  		physicians) who can provide behavioral health services vary from state to state  		and from payer to payer. Independent licensed or certified practitioners become  		licensed or certified by the state in which they practice. The license or  		certification may require accreditation by a national accreditation  		organization. </p>
<h3>Number of Independent Licensed or Certified  		Practitioners by Provider Type (Excluding Physicians)</h3>
<p><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#table2">Table 2</a> provides an estimate of more than 534,000  		CA and CT behavioral health practitioners throughout the United States. These  		clinicians work in inpatient, outpatient, schools, and criminal justice  		facilities and/or in independent practice settings and therefore it is almost  		impossible to determine how many practice independently. </p>
<h3>Sources of Public Payment -- Independent Licensed  		Practitioners (Including Physicians)</h3>
<p>While both Medicare and Medicaid pay physicians, clinical nurse  		specialists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants that otherwise  		provide physician services, Medicare coverage of non-physician services  		performed by non-physician practitioners is more limited compared to Medicaid.  		Medicare pays for services performed by clinical psychologist and certified  		social workers but does not reimburse marriage and family therapists or  		licensed professional counselors. Medicaid policy does not prohibit these  		latter two professions from independently billing for services and allows for  		Medicaid reimbursement according to states scope of practice acts.</p>
<p>Pastoral counseling (PC) is a type of behavioral health discipline that  		may be licensed by a state. Six states have licensure or certification for PC  		and 37 states license them under another counseling discipline. Medicaid may  		reimburse PC services provided to eligible Medicaid members if it is defined in  		the Medicaid state plan.<sup><font><a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Aggregate Public Spending By Payer/Program</h3>
<p>Research findings from the 2003 SAMHSA report indicates that 22% of  		behavioral health payments went to physicians and other professionals operating  		independently of inpatient, multi-service mental health organizations or  		specialty substance abuse centers. Using the 2003 SAMHSA data, it is possible  		to estimate Medicare and Medicare payments to physicians and other licensed or  		certified professionals. <a href="behavioral-health-providers-expenditures-methods-and-sources-payment-electronic-health-record-incentive-payments-certain-behavioral-health-providers-policy-descriptions.html#table11">Table 11</a> illustrates the  		estimated amount that was paid to these providers.</p>

<p>Behavioral health services may be provided by other providers in other  		settings not previously described in this report. For example, nursing homes  		may provide behavioral health services provided by any number of health care  		professionals (e.g., physicians, psychologists, nurse practitioners, behavioral  		health technicians, and others). Similarly, home health agencies may provide  		behavioral health services through registered nurses, family support workers,  		and social workers. Behavioral health services can be delivered through other  		organizations that may be covered by Medicaid, depending on a states  		Medicaid plan. For example, in Arizona, there is a Medicaid provider type known  		a Community Service Agency. It has to meet certification (not licensing)  		requirements and is restricted to Medicaid and state-only non-emergency  		transportation, peer support, and skills training among other medical  		support/rehabilitative services and payments.</p>
<h3>Sources of Public Payment</h3>
<p>Other licensed or certified providers and related payments may or may  		not be included in the information contained throughout this report. For  		example, nursing home and home health agencies accounted for 6% ($7.26 billion)  		of $121 billion in behavioral health spending reported by SAMHSA for 2003.  		However, it is almost impossible to determine whether peer support, respite  		providers or other providers are included in the figures for outpatient  		provider spending. We do know, however, that Medicaid and state funds are a  		primary payer of other non-nursing home/non-home health licensed or certified  		behavioral health providers and their services.</p>
<p>Very limited information is available concerning the numbers of other  		licensed or certified providers that provide behavioral health services, the  		aggregate public spending by payer/program, and payment methods and rates for  		behavioral health services delivered by these other provider types. </p>
<h2><a name="payment" id="payment">BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS QUALIFYING FOR  		CMS NRPM EHR INVENTIVE PAYMENTS</a></h2>
<p>The CMS NPRM for EHR Incentive Program (<i>Federal Register</i>, January  		13, 2010) includes definitions of eligible professionals (EPs) for the Medicare  		FFS, MA and Medicaid programs. Certain behavioral health providers are eligible  		to receive incentive payments under the CMS NPRM.</p>
<h3>Medicare Providers -- Fee-For-Service and Medicare  		Advantage Eligible Professionals and Hospitals</h3>
<p>The following non-hospital-based providers qualify for Medicare FFS or  		MA EHR incentive payments if they meaningfully use a certified EHR product as  		described in the NPRM:</p>
<ul><li>doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy, </li>
<li>doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine, </li>
<li>doctor of podiatric medicine, </li>
<li>doctor of optometry, </li>
<li>chiropractor. </li>
</ul><p>The following eligible hospitals qualify for Medicare FFS or MA EHR  		incentive payments if they meaningfully use a certified EHR product as  		described in the NPRM:</p>
<ul><li>Acute Care Hospitals;</li>
<li>CAHs.</li>
</ul><p>Other requirements must be met for qualifying MA-employed EPs and  		qualifying MA-affiliated hospitals to be eligible for Medicare incentive  		payments under the CMS NPRM. The requirements specific to MA Organizations can  		be found in the <i>Federal Register</i>, §495-200, page 1998.</p>
<p>Doctors of medicine and doctors of osteopathy (physicians) who practice  		psychiatry, addiction, or other behavioral health specialties are EPs and may  		qualify for Medicare EHR Incentive Payments if they meaningfully  		use a certified EHR product as described in the CMS NRPM. </p>
<p>The NPRM specifies that physicians who provide substantially  		all of their professional services in inpatient and/or outpatient  		hospital settings are ineligible for Medicare EHR payment incentives. The NPRM  		defines EPs who provide substantially all professional services in  		these settings as EPs providing 90% or more of their services in these  		settings. The ineligibility of hospital-based EPs for EHR incentive payments  		applies to all physician specialties. </p>
<p>However, the CMS NPRM proposes to use Place of Service (POS) codes 21,  		22, and 23 to determine whether/where the EP delivers services. As stated in  		the NPRM, POS code 21 is defined as: Inpatient Hospital  is a  		facility, <b><i>other than psychiatric</i></b>, which primarily provides  		diagnostic, therapeuticand rehabilitation services by or under the  		supervision physicians. (page 1906, emphasis added). Other POS  		codes for psychiatric services, including POS code 51 for services delivered in  		IPFs, are not included in this NPRM definition. Thus, at this time per the  		NPRM, EPs practicing in IPFs should be eligible for EHR incentive payments,  		presuming the EPs meet the meaningful use requirements. Thus, per the NPRM,  		physicians who practice psychiatry, addiction or behavioral health specialties  		in IPFs may qualify of EHR payment incentives. It is important to note that  		this outcome treats EPs practicing in IPFs differently than EPs practicing in  		other inpatient settings. Whether EPs practicing in IPFs will qualify for EHR  		payment incentives or will be ineligible for such incentives should be  		reevaluated when HHS publishes the Final EHR Payment Rule. </p>
<h3>Medicaid Providers -- Medicaid Eligible Professionals  		and Hospitals</h3>
<p>The following non-hospital-based Medicaid EPs may qualify for Medicaid  		EHR incentive payments if they use a certified EHR product as described in the  		NPRM:</p>
<ul><li>physician,</li>
<li>dentist, </li>
<li>certified nurse midwife,</li>
<li>nurse practitioner, </li>
<li>physician assistant practicing in a FQHC or a RHC, led by a physician  		  assistant. </li>
</ul><p>The following eligible hospitals qualify for Medicaid EHR incentive  		payments if they meaningfully use a certified EHR product as described in the  		NPRM:</p>
<ul><li>Acute Care Hospitals;</li>
<li>Childrens Hospitals.</li>
</ul><p>Physicians and nurse practitioners who practice psychiatry, addiction,  		or other behavioral health specialties are EPs and may qualify for Medicaid EHR  		Incentive Payments if they meaningfully use a certified EHR product as  		described in the CMS NRPM. Other requirements must be met for qualifying  		Medicaid EPs to qualify for incentive payments under the CMS NPRM (i.e.,  		certain Medicaid patient volume requirements). The requirements are specific to  		Medicaid EPs and can be found in the <i>Federal Register</i>, §495.304,  		page 2001. </p>
<p>The NPRM uses the same definition of hospital-based EP for  		the Medicaid EHR incentive program as used in the Medicare EHR incentive  		program, (page 1930). Physicians and nurse practitioners who practice  		psychiatry, addiction, or behavioral health specialties and provide  		substantially all of their services at a Medicaid-eligible  		inpatient/outpatient hospital are considered hospital-based EPs and are  		ineligible for the Medicaid EHR Incentive program. In determining whether a  		Medicaid EP provides substantially all of their professional services in a  		hospital setting, the NPRM uses the same set of POS codes to determine whether  		or not a Medicaid EP is a hospital-based professional as is used for Medicare  		EPs. Thus, per the NPRM, similar to Medicare EPs, Medicaid EPs who  		provide substantially all of their services in IPFs would also be eligible for  		EHR incentive payments, presuming EPs meet the EHR meaningful use  		requirements.</p>
<p>Medicaid EPs who do not provide substantially all of their  		services at a Medicaid-eligible hospital must meet one of the following  		requirements to be eligible for the Medicaid EHR incentive program if they  		meaningfully use a certified EHR product:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Have a minimum 30% patient volume attributable to individuals  			 receiving Medicaid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a pediatrician and have a minimum of 20% patient volume  			 attributable to individuals receiving Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice predominately in a FQHC or RHC and have a minimum 30%  			 patient volume attributable to needy individuals as defined in  			 §495.302.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Physician assistants providing mental health or substance use disorder  		services and in an FQHC or RHC in which the facility is led by a physician  		assistant also qualify for Medicaid EHR incentive payments if they use a  		certified EHR produced described in the CMS NPRM.</p>
<p>The NPRM defines Medicaid-eligible hospitals as an acute care hospital  		that has at least 10% Medicaid patient volume (each year for which incentives  		are sought) or a childrens hospital that has an approved CMS  		certification number and predominately treats individuals less than 21 years of  		age. The NPRM excludes childrens hospitals from meeting the volume  		requirements. </p>
