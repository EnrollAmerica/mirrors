</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>Changes in Medicare payment policy (e.g., implementation of the  		inpatient prospective payment policy) and in the structure of long-term care  		(e.g., the growth in the assisted living industry) have led to a nursing home  		population that is increasingly frail and medically complex.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> With almost 2 million Americans  		currently residing in nursing homes and an expected increase to almost 5  		million by 2030, understanding the role of physician oversight in the medical  		care of nursing home residents is of critical importance.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nursing home residents are becoming increasingly sick and frail. Between  		1997 and 2000, the percentage of nursing home residents receiving at least nine  		prescription medications increased from 18% to 27%.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> Trends such as these suggest the  		need for active oversight of and consistency in patient care from nursing staff  		and physicians to ensure that complications do not arise. The attending  		physician is responsible for supervising the medical care of nursing home  		residents, yet very little is known about the practices of physicians in  		nursing homes. </p>
<p>In 1987, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA  		'87) that specified the role of physicians in the medical care of nursing home  		residents, as well as other major changes in the operation and oversight of  		nursing homes. OBRA '87 required that nursing homes ensure that: (1) the health  		care of every resident is supervised by a physician<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note3">3</a></font></sup>; and (2) the initial and periodic  		reviews of the care plan are completed by a team that includes the  		physician.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Federal regulations specify that physicians are required to participate  		in care planning for nursing home residents and that each resident's  		comprehensive care plan include measurable objectives and a timetable to meet a  		resident's medical needs.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> In addition, federal regulations require that  		physicians supervise the medical care of each resident.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Physicians monitor current clinical conditions and provide evaluation  		and management of new conditions or symptoms. However, how physicians provide  		such oversight in nursing homes is not described well in the literature. The  		few studies available on physician practices in nursing homes suggest that  		physician presence in nursing homes is limited and that the majority of nursing  		home visits are made by a limited number of physicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> In a 1997 survey completed by the American  		Medical Association, most physicians reported spending no time in treating  		nursing home patients (77%) and among physicians who did practice in nursing  		homes, most reported spending two hours or less per week caring for their  		nursing homes patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note7">7</a></font></sup>  		This lack of physician presence is reflected in resident reports of  		dissatisfaction. Complaints for unattended symptoms, which include the failure  		to provide physician services for a change in condition, were the 10th most  		common complaint in 2000, up 44.4% from 1996.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Against the backdrop of sicker patients needing more physician care,  		there is a physician workforce with the interest, experience, and skill in  		nursing home care that is shrinking. In a survey of physicians who provide  		nursing home care, 50% indicated that they planned to decrease their  		involvement in the care of nursing home residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> Physicians planning to reduce their nursing  		home caseloads cited poor reimbursement by Medicare Part B for their physician  		services, a high volume of telephone calls from the nursing homes, onerous  		paperwork, and a lack of physician authority in nursing homes as reasons for  		leaving the nursing home environment.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		contracted with the University of Colorado to examine physician services in  		nursing homes delivered to an increasingly medically complex nursing home  		population. ASPE set forth the following objectives: (1) describe physician  		practice models used to deliver medical services to nursing home residents; (2)  		describe the financing arrangements, methods, and rates associated with various  		physician practice models in nursing homes; and (3) determine what is known  		about the impact of physician practice models on the quality of care received  		by nursing home patients and on the quality of care provided in nursing homes.  		In addition, the University of Colorado was asked to propose research designs  		that could be used in future research efforts to better understand how  		physician practice models impact access, quality, and costs associated with  		providing care to nursing home residents. </p>
<p>In the context of the overall project goals, this literature review  		first summarizes the current knowledge of physician practice in nursing homes  		and identifies gaps in the knowledge base. It then presents the physician  		practice models applied in nursing homes, including integrated and managed care  		delivery models, and describes the characteristics of physicians who practice  		in nursing homes. After describing the current state of nursing home practice,  		as found in the literature, factors that determine physicians' choice to  		practice in a nursing home and affect the quality of physician care within a  		nursing home will be presented. The expert opinions offered during a Technical  		Advisory Group (TAG) meeting that was conducted as an objective of this project  		are incorporated to substantiate or expand on the literature findings. The  		project also involved discussions with stakeholders in nursing home care. The  		results of these discussions are not presented in this literature but are  		contained in the final project report. </p>
<h2><a name="design" id="design">DESIGN AND METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The literature synthesis was distilled from published literature and  		supplemented with sources of information such as professional associations,  		government agencies, and expert opinions derived during a TAG meeting of  		professionals working in the field of nursing home care. </p>
<p>Topics and phrases for the literature search included the following  		terms in combination with the words nursing home and/or long-term care: cost,  		practice patterns, models of care, utilization, quality, outcomes, staffing,  		acute care, guidelines, visits, training, experience, physician misconduct,  		discipline, reimbursement, and malpractice. Pertinent citations from the  		selected literature also were reviewed. Finally, a list of authors who were  		encountered frequently in the physician practice pattern literature was  		compiled and a search by author name was performed. Literature with data prior  		to OBRA '87 was not reviewed due to the fundamental changes this act created in  		nursing facilities. Other sources were scanned for relevant information such as  		the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Project listings and the web sites of the  		American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) and the Centers for Medicare  		&amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). </p>
<p>Three investigators completed the literature review. As new articles  		were obtained, the reference was entered into a Reference Manager database to  		avoid duplication of effort. After approximately 50 articles were obtained, the  		investigators performed an initial overview of the available literature to  		develop a conceptual framework around the following topics: physician  		characteristics, physician payment structure, nursing home traits and practice  		organization. Four tables were constructed, one for each of these four topics  		(Appendices I-IV). </p>
<p>As a mechanism for organizing the literature into the conceptual  		framework, subheadings pertaining to each of these four topics were proposed  		with the expectation that some subheadings would be revised, deleted, or added  		as necessary, as the references were entered into the tables. To ensure that  		the three investigators reviewing the selected articles were extracting similar  		information from the articles, each of the three investigators randomly  		selected two articles previously reviewed by the other two investigators for a  		second and third review. The results then were compared among reviewers. All  		three investigators were consistent in selection of material from the articles.  		</p>
<p>Finally, after the references with relevance to topics in more than one  		column in each table were entered, investigators developed the following  		themes: practice organization and design, access to physician care and  		physician workforce, and quality of physician care. In this report, we first  		describe the current, traditional organization of physician services in nursing  		homes, followed by a discussion of alternative practice models. We then present  		the barriers to accessing physician services in nursing homes and finally the  		impact of physician practice on nursing home care. </p>
<h3>Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Meeting</h3>
<p>On April 29, 2004, stakeholders with expertise in nursing homes and  		physician practices in nursing homes were asked to participate as members of a  		TAG in Washington, DC. The purpose of the meeting was to: (1) present the  		available literature on physician practice patterns in nursing homes, (2) allow  		the panel of experts to discuss the available body of literature and add their  		practical knowledge of physician practice patterns, and (3) identify areas in  		need of additional research regarding physician practice patterns in nursing  		homes. </p>
<p>The ten member expert panel consisted of six physicians, two nurses, one  		geriatric nurse practitioner (GNP), and one nursing home administrator. In some  		cases, specific physicians were asked to participate in the meeting because of  		their prior research or practical experience with nursing home physician  		practice models. In other cases, advocacy or professional organizations were  		asked to nominate a member of their organization with knowledge and interest in  		physician practice models. The following organizations were represented:  		American Geriatric Society, AMDA, National Coalition for Nursing Home Reform,  		American Medical Association, American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, American  		Health Care Association, American Association of Homes and Services for the  		Aging, National Association of Directors of Nursing Administration in Long-term  		Care, and CMS. </p>
<p>The TAG members' opinions and comments were added later to the  		information gleaned from the review of published literature and were  		incorporated into the literature synthesis document. </p>
<h2><a name="current" id="current">CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF PHYSICIAN SERVICES IN NURSING  		HOMES</a></h2>
<h3>Regulations and Guidelines</h3>
<p>OBRA '87 and its amendments are the basis for federal regulations  		pertaining to physician care of nursing home residents. They are documented in  		the <i>State Operations Manual</i>, which contain the federal interpretive  		guidelines for states to conduct survey and certification of nursing homes.  		While most physician nursing home visits occur at the discretion of physicians  		and are determined by medical necessity, a set of minimum required visits for  		nursing home residents are mandated by CMS in regulations and the <i>State  		Operations Manual</i>.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note6">6</a></font></sup>  		Surveyors verify that physician services adhere to the following regulations:  		</p>
<ol><li>Physician must see each resident for <b>routine</b> evaluation every  		  30 days for the first 90 days and every 60 days thereafter (<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendV">Appendix V</a>). Physicians may delegate every other visit to a  		  physician extender (physician assistant (PA), nurse practitioner (NP), or  		  clinical nurse specialist, as state law permits), except for services that  		  explicitly require the services of a physician (i.e., initial comprehensive  		  visit for skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients). The physician must  		  supervise all services performed by a physician extender,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> and</li>
<li>Physicians must be available or arrange for the provision of  		  emergency services 24 hours/day.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></li>
</ol><p>In addition, within seven days of the completion of the required  		comprehensive assessment, a care plan must be prepared by an interdisciplinary  		team that includes the attending physician, a registered nurse, and other staff  		such as a physical therapist or nutritional therapist, and, when possible, the  		resident and resident's family.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Federal regulations also include a few, minimum requirements regarding  		delivery of medical care. For example, laboratory and radiology services can be  		provided only to facility residents when ordered by a physician, and the  		physician is to be "promptly notified" of the results of such tests (42 CFR  		483.75(j) and (k)).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note12">12</a></font></sup>  		The physician requirements outlined by CMS can be reviewed in  		<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendV">Appendix V</a>. </p>
<p>In addition to the required federal survey and certification, some  		nursing homes elect to be accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation  		of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). The JCAHO is a voluntary, nongovernmental  		organization that establishes standards for the operation of hospitals and  		other health care facilities, including nursing homes. Compliance with JCAHO  		standards is recognized by the issuance of certificates of accreditation and,  		to date, it accredits more than 2200 organizations offering long-term care and  		sub-acute care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note11">11</a></font></sup>  		Nursing facilities may seek JCAHO accreditation because of the marketing  		advantages such accreditation may provide (e.g., encouraging contracting  		arrangements with managed care organizations). </p>
<p>JCAHO accreditation requirements include a focus on the organization's  		quality improvement efforts, professional staff recruitment, and staff  		education. JCAHO accreditation may not substitute for the federally required  		state survey and certification process. The requirements focus on the items  		listed in <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendV">Appendix V</a>. </p>
<p>Certain JCAHO standards are more comprehensive than general CMS  		requirements with regard to physician visitation. For example, the timing of  		the first comprehensive visit under JCAHO standards is more specific than under  		CMS regulations. JCAHO requires that the initial physician visit cannot be more  		than 24 hours before admission or later than 72 hours after admission. Specific  		details comparing physician visits defined by CMS and JCAHO are outlined in  		<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendV">Appendix V</a>. </p>
<p>The Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) is  		another mechanism for achieving certification beyond the federal requirements.  		However, CARF accreditation is not widely sought with some states having no or  		only a very few CARF-accredited facilities (i.e., one CARF accredited nursing  		home in California).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note13">13</a></font></sup>  		We observed no literature commenting specifically on CARF accreditation of  		nursing homes. </p>
<h3>Physician Practices in Nursing Homes</h3>
<p>Residents are admitted into nursing homes predominately from the  		community or a hospital. Admissions directly from the community in 1999  		accounted for 29% of all nursing facility admissions while 46% were admitted  		from a hospital and 11% from another nursing home.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> The remaining residents were admitted from  		retirement homes and board and care homes. Data are not readily available  		regarding the number of physicians who provide care across care settings from  		the hospital or community into the nursing home. Admissions to a nursing home  		after a minimum of a three-day hospital stay for a Medicare beneficiary who  		requires daily skilled care are covered by Medicare in SNFs. Medicare pays for  		13% of nursing home residents. The average length of stay for SNF care is 23  		days. </p>
<p>While federal and state requirements and JACHO provide some guidelines  		for physician care of nursing home residents after admission, these entities do  		not require physicians to follow their patients from the community or hospital  		setting into nursing homes. In fact, the trend in physician specialization in  		delivery of care in one care setting undercuts the ability of physicians to  		provide this continuity of care. For example, in recent years, the  		"hospitalist" specialty has emerged specializing in the delivery of care in the  		hospital environment.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note15">15</a></font></sup>  		Increasing specialization in one site of care reduces the number of physicians  		who are following patients from the office to the hospital and then to the  		nursing home setting. </p>
<p>There are no specific, current statistics available on the number of  		physicians who continue to follow patients into the nursing home, but the TAG  		commented that there are fewer in practice each year. The group suggested that  		some physicians who remain in nursing home care also are beginning to  		specialize in this type of care in a manner similar to physicians who  		specialize in hospitals as their sites of care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Traditionally, the majority of physicians who care for nursing home  		residents are community physicians with both an office and hospital-based  		practice as opposed to practicing in one of these settings exclusively. In a  		cross-sectional survey of 170 family physicians, 55% followed at least one  		patient into the nursing home.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A second study comparing physicians with nursing home practices to  		physicians without nursing home patients indicated that physicians with nursing  		home practices were more likely to have a hospital practice (60% vs. 39.5%);  		see more outpatients each week (105 vs. 78), and work more hours each week (57  		vs. 49). Physicians in rural communities also were more likely to have a  		nursing home practice.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> This does not imply that rural areas have an  		adequate supply of physicians caring for nursing home residents, but it is a  		reflection of the tendency for rural physicians to care for patients during the  		entire lifespan from birth to death. </p>
<p>Because physicians are not required to follow their patients after  		transfer to a nursing home, they often are unaware of what happens to their  		patients. Processes and mechanisms to exchange health information to and from  		nursing homes and other settings and providers of care (e.g., physician  		offices, emergency rooms, hospitals, etc.), including the use of electronic  		health information systems to exchange information, are often not available in  		long-term care environments. Failure to exchange information across care  		settings, may engender unfamiliarity on the part of the physicians with  		processes of care in nursing homes and the unique needs of nursing home  		residents. </p>
<p>Physicians visit their nursing home residents when not in clinic or  		performing hospital rounds. Thus, the ability to perform urgent visits is  		dictated by the flexibility of their nonnursing home clinical responsibilities,  		with nursing home residents typically accounting for a small fraction of their  		caseloads. One study of physician staffing patterns in 353 nursing homes in New  		York with an average of 167 residents per facility, indicated that 60% of  		facilities had no daily physician presence; nonstaff physicians (physicians  		from the community who were not employed by the facility) cared for 70% of  		residents; there were an average of 8.6 attending physicians per facility; and  		on average, each physician followed 32 residents in each facility.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The average number of attending physicians and number of residents  		followed by a physician provide some of the only descriptive information on  		physician staffing patterns in nursing homes. It is unlikely that physicians  		would follow 32 patients from their office practices into a single nursing  		home, unless they are in a rural community where there is only one or a few  		nursing homes, or they have a largely geriatric practice with many patients  		needing nursing home care on a regular basis. Thus, the implications of this  		descriptive data suggest that once patients are admitted to nursing homes, they  		are unlikely to be followed by their physicians who had been treating them in  		office practices. </p>
<h3>Physician Training and Specialization</h3>
<p>To be competent in the care of nursing home residents, physicians  		should, at a minimum, develop skills in the management of multiple and  		interacting illnesses and conditions, such as delirium, dementia,  		rehabilitation and the propensity for falls, behavioral disorders,  		incontinence, pressure ulcers and wound care, and malnutrition; and the  		management of multiple and interacting medications. These competencies are  		described well in two textbooks which serve as guides to physicians providing  		medical care to nursing home residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note20">20</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most of the physicians who provide nursing home care as part of their  		practices are family physicians or internists with no specialized training  		either in nursing home care or in the care of older patients  		(geriatrics).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> This  		may be expected, given that training specific to the medical care of nursing  		home residents is largely confined to a few hours during geriatric rotations in  		internal medicine or family practice residency. </p>
<p>While 86% of family practice residency programs require geriatric  		medicine training, only 25% of internal medicine residency programs require any  		training in geriatric medicine and fewer still in nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> This suggests that many medical  		residents are completing training with little to no instruction in the care of  		nursing home residents. </p>
<p>In recent years, the Residency Review Committee of Family Practice and  		Internal Medicine has acknowledged the importance of specific training in the  		care of nursing home residents and recommended nursing home rotations during  		medical training. In addition, the Institute of Medicine recently recommended  		nine months of geriatric experience for family practice and internal medicine  		residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Physicians who complete a geriatric fellowship have the training to deal  		with the complex needs of frail, elderly patients. Geriatric fellowships  		consist of a one or two-year curriculum following residency training and focus  		on the care of older adults. In 2004, less than 1% of physicians had completed  		a geriatric fellowship. However, even among those with geriatric training, this  		specialized training in the care of older patients may not emphasize nursing  		home care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p>While physicians who complete a geriatric fellowship do obtain training  		in nursing home care, members of our TAG commented that the amount of nursing  		home exposure varies widely from one geriatric fellowship program to  		another.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note16">16</a></font></sup>  		Additionally, geriatric fellows in many programs complete their fellowships  		without having received extensive training in the care of nursing home  		residents. </p>
<p>Physicians who pass an examination in geriatric care given by the  		American Board of Medical Examiners obtain a certificate of added qualification  		in geriatrics. While geriatric fellows may take this examination, fellowship is  		not a requirement. Physicians with any training background are eligible to take  		the examination. However, currently only 8,800 physicians (1.2%) possess this  		certificate.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> One  		possible explanation for the low level of interest in this added qualification  		is that the certificate of added qualification in geriatrics does not enhance  		career growth or increase salary, thereby negating the desire for physicians to  		obtain this added qualification. Physicians who do obtain the certification  		generally are fellowship trained in geriatrics and complete the certification  		as a part of the fellowship requirements. Research on how the quality of  		medical care differs between physicians with standard residency training versus  		those who have completed a geriatric fellowship or obtained a certificate of  		added qualification in geriatrics does not exist. </p>
<p>Another method by which physicians may acquire competence and skill in  		nursing home care is as a nursing home medical director. The designated role of  		nursing home medical directors, as specified in the <i>Code of Federal  		Regulations</i>, Title 42 §483.75(i)(2), is to assume responsibility for  		the <i>implementation of resident care policies and coordination of medical  		care services in the facility</i>. Several studies have examined the role of  		medical directors in the physician care of nursing home residents. In an Office  		of Inspector General report on medical directors, all medical directors  		reported having professional medical training, primarily in family practice  		(44%) or in internal medicine (47%).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> Twenty-two percent sought training in  		geriatrics during their medical training; 4% completed geriatric fellowships,  		and 30% had a certificate of added qualifications in geriatrics. While medical  		directors are not required to be practicing or licensed physicians (although  		they must be a physician), 92% reported being licensed to practice medicine.  		</p>
<p>Another study reported that, on average, medical directors spent 29% of  		their time as medical directors on resident care activities (not related to  		their attending physician responsibilities), including emergency care,  		comprehensive care plan development, and communication with attending  		physicians on individual resident problems.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note27">27</a></font></sup> However, in the pursuit of these activities  		as medical director (as opposed to as an attending physician), physicians who  		serve as medical directors of nursing homes are estimated to spend less than  		1.5 minutes per resident each day, suggesting that medical directorship is not  		a sufficient criterion to define one who specializes in the care of nursing  		home residents. </p>
<p>Medical directors also often provide direct care to nursing home  		residents. Those who serve as both medical directors and attending physicians  		may represent a group of physicians who could be considered specializing in the  		care of nursing home residents. One study indicates that approximately  		two-thirds of medical directors serve as the attending physician for some  		residents and, on average, care for 43% of patients in their  		facilities.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> In a more  		recent investigation, involving a survey of medical directors in 1999, nearly  		80% of medical directors served as attending physicians and, on average, were  		the attending physician to 44% of the patients in their facilities.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note28">28</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> While  		medical directors who also serve as attending physicians seem to play important  		roles in the nursing home physician work force, the role and qualifications as  		a physician specializing in the care of nursing home residents has not been  		explored beyond several surveys. </p>
<p>Given the minimal exposure to and emphasis on nursing home care in  		medical training, it is not surprising that very little attention has been  		focused on physicians "specializing" in nursing home care. In summary, the  		concept of physician specialization in nursing home care is not clearly  		defined, and while there are several concepts that potentially could be used to  		define specialization (e.g., advanced training, serving as medical director,  		physicians that follow patients across the continuum of care including into  		nursing homes, or time spent in practicing in nursing homes), the number of  		physicians that would meet these criteria is limited. </p>
<h2><a name="alternate" id="alternate">ALTERNATIVE PHYSICIAN PRACTICE MODELS</a></h2>
<p>Physicians also may be a part of practice models that differ from the  		traditional physician practice model providing community and hospital-based  		care. These models may involve community physicians operating under alternative  		reimbursement programs, including those with nursing home-only practices, that  		employ physician extenders. Other models include physicians employed directly  		by managed care entities or nursing facilities to care for nursing home  		patients. This section provides an overview of the Medicare program  		requirements related to physician extenders and then describes alternative  		physician practice models in nursing homes. </p>
<h3>Physician Extenders</h3>
<p>Some nursing home practices incorporate physician extenders to assist  		physicians in caring for nursing home patients. Medicare regulations permit the  		use of physician extenders (NPs and PAs) in lieu of physicians for some visits,  		such as visits for acute illnesses and every other required nursing home  		visit.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Advanced practice nurses (APNs) currently are used throughout various  		models of primary care delivery. An APN's role and qualifications for licensure  		as defined by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, consistent with  		the Nurse Practice Act, include nurses who have successfully completed the  		requirements to practice as and hold a current national certification as a  		nurse midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or NP from an appropriate national  		certifying body. Additionally, an APN must have successfully completed a  		post-basic advanced practice formal education program in his or her nursing  		specialty.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>For the purposes of this literature review, we will refer to APN  		physician extenders as NPs or GNPs. The reviewed literature indicates that APN  		physician extenders in nursing homes are primarily NPs or GNPs.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note31">31</a>, <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a>, <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note33">33</a>, <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note34">34</a>, <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note35">35</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note36">36</a>, <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note37">37</a>, <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note38">38</a></font></sup> The NP is a subcategory of APNs that  		primarily focuses his/her clinical practice on primary care in community  		settings, rather than acute care in inpatient or ambulatory settings. </p>
<p>Although NPs and PAs both are considered physician extenders, NP and PA  		roles differ in practice. NPs traditionally work under an independent nursing  		license, billing their time separate from the physician. In some states, they  		can have an independent practice with prescribing authority.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note38">38</a></font></sup> PAs customarily practice under  		a physician's license, with close supervision from a physician. </p>
<p>TAG members consistently commented that both NPs and PAs enhance the  		overall quality of care in nursing homes. They also mentioned that NP/GNPs are  		more prevalent than PAs in nursing homes because NP/GNPs are trained in a  		nursing model of education. This background facilitates communication with the  		nursing home nurses who also were trained under a nursing educational model.  		CMS allows physician extenders to substitute for physician care in nursing  		homes to the extent noted in <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVI">Appendix VI</a>.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 granted NPs direct Medicare  		reimbursement for Part B services, separate from physician billing. Prior to  		this legislation, NPs were able to receive reimbursement only in rural areas  		and SNFs. Overall, NPs are reimbursed at lower rates for the same services  		provided by physicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note38">38</a></font></sup> In an exploratory survey designed to  		establish relative work values using magnitude-estimation scaling, NP relative  		work values did not differ significantly from physician relative work values.  		In fact, NPs spent significantly more time with residents, whereas physicians  		spent significantly more time prior to and following resident visits in care  		coordination activities such as speaking to families, reviewing medications and  		arranging for discharge follow-ups.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Medicare will reimburse 85% of the physician fee schedule to extenders  		employed by physicians for services as described in the schedule of allowable  		substitution for physician nursing home visits found in <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVI">Appendix VI</a>. As outlined in <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVI">Appendix  		VI</a>, physician extenders may not perform the initial comprehensive visits,  		but they may perform other medically necessary visits. <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVI">Appendix VI</a> illustrates the services that can and cannot  		be performed by physician extenders with specific comparisons between SNF care  		and nonSNF care. </p>
<p>In addition, NPs may provide other services that a nursing home or  		physician finds valuable.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note39">39</a></font></sup> For example, NPs who are employed within the  		facility can monitor patient conditions on a daily basis, decreasing  		inconvenient visits for physicians. NPs can increase patient access to medical  		care and assist physicians by reducing the number of telephone calls physicians  		would take from or make to the nursing home. NPs participate in family  		conferences, coordinate care between the physician and the nursing staff, and  		address minor patient problems. </p>
<p>However, current federal guidelines from the CMS places limitations on  		the utilization of NPs substituting for all physician services.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note40">40</a></font></sup> Specifically, CMS prohibits the  		use of NPs to perform the initial comprehensive visits, and NPs must alternate  		visits with physicians for required nursing home visits. </p>
<h3>Evercare</h3>
<p>The Evercare project, employing community physicians and physician  		extenders in a demonstration program, is an innovative practice model providing  		for the health care needs of elderly nursing home residents. Evercare is a  		variant of the Medicare+Choice health maintenance organization (HMO)<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note31">31</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note41">41</a></font></sup>  		providing benefits under both Medicare Parts A and B.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> The goal of the Evercare program is to  		reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and costs by providing more intensive  		primary care for residents who experience a clinical decline. </p>
<p>Nursing homes operating an Evercare program receive a fixed capitated  		amount for each long-stay nursing home resident. Evercare employs NPs as  		physician extenders to work with the residents' primary care physicians.  		Evercare NPs spend more time than physicians in each nursing home, allowing for  		more regular resident and family contact, and for the opportunity for formal  		and informal in-service staff training.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note31">31</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note41">41</a></font></sup> Although NPs  		provide most of the direct primary care to residents, Evercare primary care  		physicians assume ultimate responsibility for physician services for nursing  		home residents and must see their residents a minimum of every 30 days for the  		first 90 days and every 60 days thereafter. </p>
<p>Evercare contracts with physicians to accept Evercare patients and be  		paid by Evercare instead of by Medicare with fee-for-service (FFS) rates at  		least equivalent to Medicare Part B rates. The Evercare FFS payment model also  		includes payment to physicians for emergency visits to the nursing home and for  		the time spent in care planning conferences and family consultations.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> Evercare programs are currently  		serving nearly 600,000 individuals nationwide, with 1,500 employees in 15  		states.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Closed Staffing</h3>
<p>Closed staffing models refer to the use of physicians salaried or  		employed by a nursing facility as opposed to an open staff where community  		physicians, who are neither salaried by, nor employed by the nursing facility,  		care for residents in the facility. The current number of nursing homes in the  		United States with closed physician staffs is not known. However, a study  		conducted in 1994 found closed staffing models were used by 43% of the 636  		facilities in New York state.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note43">43</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition to employing physicians, these facilities typically employed  		more physician extenders and tended to have more beds than facilities with open  		staffing models. This study found that closed staff physicians were more likely  		than community physicians to be on site daily; to provide cross-coverage for  		acute and emergency cases; to provide emergency responses; to build greater  		accountability, responsibility, and allegiance; and to promote more efficient  		communication and supervision than community physicians not in a closed model.  		</p>
<h3>Managed Care and HMOs</h3>
<p>Some physicians see nursing home residents under managed care plans.  		These physicians generally are either salaried by the plan or receive a  		capitated payment to manage individual patients in the plan. They may be  		assigned a panel of patients and follow those patients if they enter a nursing  		home, or the physicians may be dedicated to treating only nursing home  		residents. Also, at least in the past, some Medicare managed care plans would  		provide an additional payment to a physician who continued to manage a  		patient's care when the patient was admitted to a nursing home. </p>
<p>HMOs deliver physician care to nursing home residents through many  		organizational approaches. As an example, Kaiser Permanente employs physicians  		who devote 100% of their practice to the care of nursing home residents. In a  		study that reviewed the records for 24% of Medicare HMO enrollees in 21 HMOs  		with a primary care nursing home program, all but one program used a common  		model of physicians and physician extenders.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note35">35</a></font></sup> HMOs with primary care nursing home programs  		tended to have more enrollees than HMO's without primary care nursing home  		programs, an average of 71 residents per NP and 270 residents per physician.  		</p>
<p>Another study that looked at panel size found a typical panel for an  		office-based HMO physician consists of 1000-1250 older patients, while a panel  		of nursing home residents for a nursing home-based physician was as low as  		300-400 residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note44">44</a></font></sup>  		Only three of 21 programs reported that the physicians followed their residents  		into the hospital when they needed acute care. Most physicians had dedicated  		nursing home practices with no competing clinical duties. HMOs that had not  		developed a primary care nursing home program explained that there were too few  		enrollees in nursing homes to justify the cost.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Specialists</h3>
<p>The Netherlands currently has a unique specialization for nursing home  		physicians. At present, it is the only country in the world where nursing home  		patients receive care from a physician specifically trained to care for nursing  		home residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note45">45</a></font></sup> This  		model of care originated in 1972 with the creation of the Dutch College of  		Nursing Home Physicians (NVVA). It was recognized that family physicians and  		other consulting physicians did not have enough time or experience to treat  		nursing home patients with the quality of care they deserved. The NVVA's goals  		were to conduct research for evidence-based nursing home medicine and care,  		create a residency training program in nursing home medicine, initiate academic  		teaching of medical students in nursing home medicine, and construct continuing  		medical education in nursing home medicine. </p>
<p>Under this model, the Dutch frail elderly can receive medical services  		from three types of physicians:</p>
<ol><li>The family physician, who provides medical care to the elderly in  		  residential homes and in the community,</li>
<li>The nursing home specialist, who provides medical care to nursing  		  home and institutionalized patients, and</li>
<li>The hospital geriatrician, who focuses on medical care for the  		  elderly within the hospital setting. </li>
</ol><p>Today, Dutch nursing homes have care teams, consisting of nursing home  		physicians and nurses; occupation, speech, physio- and physical therapists;  		dietitians; psychologists; social workers; and pastoral workers who are all  		employed by the nursing facility. Promising benchmark outcomes have been noted  		among patients cared for by specialized nursing home physicians. Results show  		increased satisfaction among nursing home residents cared for by nursing home  		specialists when compared to residents treated by physicians not specializing  		in nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Several British studies suggest that having one physician in the nursing  		home may be more beneficial than current models of multiple physicians in  		nursing homes. In a retrospective cohort study done in Mansfield,  		Nottinghamshire, it was found that nursing home patients received twice as many  		physician contacts when one physician was caring for all of the nursing home  		patients as compared to a model where multiple physicians provided care to  		patients in a given facility.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note46">46</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, a quantitative analysis completed in Darlington, County  		Durham, found that large proportions of nursing home patients served by only a  		few general practitioners caused an increased workload, presenting problems in  		the organization of care. Each nursing home patient was found to equal three  		practice patients under 65 years of age, indicating that some general  		practitioners were reluctant to become involved in nursing home care due to the  		time requirements. Given this information, physicians considering a nursing  		home-only practice may need to maintain a reduced patient load to account for  		the additional time required to care for these complex patients. </p>
<p>One doctor in sole charge of the nursing home may benefit the nursing  		home residents by providing consistent quality of care compared to multiple  		physicians who are less consistent in quality of care as a result of having  		only a few nursing home residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note47">47</a></font></sup> A prospective comparative study completed in  		Glasgow supports medical care in a nursing home provided by one practice,  		finding that this type of "specialization" enabled more proactive and  		preventive interventions for all residents compared to models where physicians  		followed their patients into nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note48">48</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="barrier" id="barrier">BARRIERS TO ACCESSING PHYSICIAN CARE IN NURSING  		HOMES</a></h2>
<p>Recruiting and retaining physicians in nursing homes is difficult. Many  		barriers, some of which have been discussed, exist to discourage physicians  		from choosing to establish nursing home practices or adding nursing home care  		to their practices. Other obstacles are causing physicians with nursing home  		practices to consider scaling back or dropping their nursing home practices  		altogether. </p>
<p>A study published in 1998 by a Los Angeles, California, physician,  		interested in the reasons why physicians specific to that region either  		hesitate or refuse to see nursing home patients, found reimbursement, nursing  		facility traits, patients' family involvement, location of facility, practice  		model, and reputation of nursing home care as the top six barriers to providing  		nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note49">49</a></font></sup> In  		1970, a Senate Subcommittee on Long-Term Care published findings on reasons  		physicians avoid nursing homes, and the findings were almost identical to those  		in the more recent 1998 study. It appears that although the government in 1970  		studied this topic area, 28 years later the state of barriers to nursing home  		care is the same as before. </p>
<h3>Training and Experience</h3>
<p>Physicians may not consider nursing home care because they generally  		have not received training that encourages or prepares them for such care.  		General practitioners who provide the majority of nursing home care may not be  		trained to provide care in nursing homes, as reported from a survey of recent  		medicine residency graduates. When graduates were asked if their formal medical  		training did at least a "good" job of preparing them to be a general  		practitioner, 42% of family practice and 62% of internal medicine graduates  		reported spending too little training time in nursing homes. Only 1% in each of  		these two specialties reported spending too much time in nursing  		homes.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note50">50</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Training and preparedness influence the willingness of a physician to  		participate in nursing home care. Family practice residents with nursing home  		experience during training tend to continue to provide nursing home care after  		graduation, and internal medicine residents who provide primary care to nursing  		home residents have improved attitudes toward seniors and improved skills in  		the assessment of geriatric syndromes.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> Similarly, graduates of family practice  		residencies who rate their training in geriatrics favorably are significantly  		more likely to make nursing home visits after graduation. </p>
<p>Increased training in nursing home care may be difficult to achieve. As  		previously noted, the extent to which geriatric fellowship programs emphasize  		nursing home care varies significantly across programs. In a study conducted in  		1994, researchers estimated that in order to develop the capacity to train  		academic geriatric leaders, the number of geriatric fellowship graduates would  		need to increase from 100 per year to 250 per year to meet the goal of 2100  		academic geriatricians by the year 2000.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> This goal still has not been met in 2004.  		</p>
<p>TAG members supported such findings from the literature.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> TAG members identified: (1) a  		lack of continuity of physicians between the hospital and nursing home, and (2)  		a lack of academic leadership with expertise in nursing home care as potential  		barriers to training physicians in the care of nursing home residents.  		Characteristics considered important by members of the TAG were early and  		continued exposure to nursing home care. One TAG physician recalled that his  		sole experience in nursing homes prior to going into practice 20 years ago was  		one visit on one occasion during his residency. </p>
<p>TAG members added that the educational component has not changed  		drastically since that point in time.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> The group believed that more physicians  		would choose to deliver care in nursing homes if they had a comprehensive  		clinical experience in nursing homes during medical school or during the first  		year of residency. At many academic programs, the geriatric rotation is not  		completed until the third year of residency training. By then, the majority of  		residents are well on their way to having identified their area of specialized  		interest and it is too late to consider geriatrics and/or nursing home care.  		One suggestion for improving exposure to nursing home care during training was  		to require resident physicians to visit their patients once they are  		transferred from the hospital to a nursing home. </p>
<p>Additionally, TAG participants considered "continued medical education"  		courses, the medical courses that follow formal medical residency training, as  		an important opportunity to both expose physicians to nursing home care and  		retain physicians in nursing homes who already care for nursing home  		residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note16">16</a></font></sup>  		Unfortunately, the TAG members noted a paucity of and resistance to  		incorporating training on nursing home care into national medical conferences  		providing continuing medical education. For example, at a recent national adult  		primary care meeting, only three courses out of hundreds of courses focused on  		the care of nursing home residents. Physicians with knowledge in the area of  		nursing home care reported offering to provide sessions on the care of nursing  		home residents at this conference, but the Academy of Family Practice responded  		that the training necessary for those interested in nursing home care is  		provided. This suggests that leaders in primary care are either not aware of  		and/or not interested in providing education on the care of nursing home  		residents. </p>
<p>Further encouragement of nursing home specialists may be difficult. On  		one hand, most physicians who see nursing home residents are family  		practitioners or internists with no training in nursing home care. On the other  		hand, geriatricians also may not receive adequate training in nursing home  		care. </p>
<p>The training and experience of the available NPs may limit the ability  		to implement physician extender models. TAG participants cautioned that the  		amount of geriatric and nursing home care taught during the training of NPs  		depends largely on the interest of the faculty in geriatrics and nursing home  		care. The scope of the training programs may influence the decision to use such  		practitioners. One participant, who routinely hires NPs, noted that NPs without  		geriatric training are far less prepared to practice in nursing homes than  		those who received such specialized training. Many of the physician extenders  		hired for his practice require specific education in the care of older adults  		before they can care independently for nursing home residents. For example,  		according to the expert TAG member, NP and GNP students receive minimal  		information on falls and pressure ulcers, two of the most common geriatric  		problems in nursing homes. Another barrier identified for GNPs is the  		availability of faculty with academic credentials to train GNPs and infuse more  		NPs with geriatric training into the medical community. </p>
<p>The existing labor supply of physician extenders may also constrain  		their use and their cost-effectiveness. For example, the Evercare demonstration  		project was unable to find enough GNPs and was forced instead to employ general  		NPs.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> A New York State  		demonstration project that required nursing homes to hire NPs found that the  		increased demand for NPs and PAs drove salaries for physician extenders to  		nearly double the national average in some areas of the state.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> The cost of utilizing NPs may  		be borne by third-party payers, such as Medicare, or shared with the NPs'  		employers. Employing an NP requires a large volume of nursing home visits to be  		cost effective. It is estimated that to support an NP's salary entirely through  		Medicare reimbursable services, an NP would need to perform an average of 16  		visits per day at the 99312 code (the most common subsequent visit coding  		level).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note39">39</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Reimbursement</h3>
<p>Payment incentives affect physician practice choices, including nursing  		home care. For most nursing home residents, Medicare reimburses physician care  		in the nursing home through Medicare Part B insurance. Nursing home residents  		with Medicare Part B coverage (approximately 95% of those enrolled in Part A  		coverage) will have physician visits paid by Medicare, regardless of the payer  		that covers the cost of the nursing home stay, which may be a private payer,  		Medicaid, or Medicare Part A. Medicare determines physician payments through  		the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. There are eight Current Procedural  		Terminology (CPT) codes assigned to nursing home care. Three codes apply to  		increasingly complex evaluation and assessment visits, three to increasingly  		complex subsequent care visits, and two to services provided on the day of  		nursing home discharge. The descriptions and guidelines for each of the six  		nursing home codes can be found in <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVII">Appendix VII</a>, and a  		detailed description of how the payment amounts are determined is in  		<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVIII">Appendix VIII</a>. </p>
<p>Physicians may prefer to avoid nursing home care and focus on office and  		hospitalized patients due to the relative payments for nursing home, office,  		and hospital visits for the same type of service. <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendX">Appendix  		X</a> presents the 2004 Medicare payment schedule in Colorado and in  		Philadelphia for all nursing home CPTs, as well as the CPTs for similar care in  		other settings: office visits, hospital consults, emergency room visits. It  		presents the values associated with each of the three components of payment  		formula: professional work, overhead, and malpractice. For example, the CPT  		code (99301) for a 30-minute new nursing home assessment would pay $64.76 in  		Philadelphia. In comparison, the same physician in Philadelphia would receive  		$102.49 (CPT 99203) for a 30-minute new office visit with a Medicare patient  		and $70.38 for a new 30-minute hospital care visit. Physicians are paid less  		per hour for nursing home care than care in other settings and, thus, may have  		no incentives to see patients in nursing homes. </p>
<p>Medicare Part B payments change each year in response to alterations in  		relative value units (RVUs), the Geographic Practice Cost Index, and the  		conversion factor. For example, the work component for nursing home visits was  		very low when the system was first implemented, but it was upgraded  		significantly between 1992 and 1996 to reduce the gap between nursing home  		visits and hospital visits.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note51">51</a></font></sup> The nursing home component still is lower,  		however, and the 2004 RVU for the work component of a 30-minute service is  		1.20, 1.34, and 1.28 for nursing home, office, and hospital, respectively. </p>
<p>Recently, the proposed 2004 fee schedule had deep cuts in the practice  		expense RVUs for nursing home care that would have dropped payment rates  		between 15% and 22%. The final fee schedule did not adopt these cuts in  		response to protests from organizations involved in long-term care, but the  		threat of future cuts may deter physicians from starting a nursing home  		practice.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note52">52</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The level of reimbursement is speculated to influence physician  		decisions to decline to treat nursing home residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note53">53</a></font></sup> Some investigators argue that the current  		payment structure for physician services in nursing homes does not support the  		nursing home workforce and is insufficient to maintain numbers, skills, and  		stability of staff caring for an increasingly frail older population.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note54">54</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nonreimbursable Activities</h3>
<p>Another concern is the time spent on nonreimbursable activities. A time  		and motion demonstration project in New York State determined that 64% of a  		physician's time practicing in a nursing home was spent on nonreimbursable  		activities compared to 30% in an office setting.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> Four common nonreimbursable activities for  		physicians in nursing homes were found to be: telephone evaluation, care  		planning meetings, staff communication about the resident, and meetings with  		family members. While all physician specialties face a range of nonreimbursable  		activities, nursing home care and other types of care for frail elderly  		patients (e.g., home health care) require more of these activities than other  		types of practice, according to physicians responding to a survey issued by the  		AMDA.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note55">55</a></font></sup> The survey  		found physicians were performing a significant number of tasks for each nursing  		home visit. More than half of all physicians reported spending time in the  		following seven tasks for each billed nursing home visit: scheduling,  		reviewing, and obtaining clinical reports; coordinating home/outpatient care;  		coordinating therapy; making phone calls; coordinating ancillary services;  		responding to or monitoring change in condition; and responding to pharmacist  		or nutritionist questions. Most of these are nonreimbursable  		activities.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note56">56</a></font></sup></p>
<p>TAG members agreed that a significant amount of time is spent in family  		care planning, making telephone calls, and communicating with other providers  		regarding the patient's health. This time is not reimbursable under most  		practice organization models. However, TAG members again mentioned the  		importance of paying close attention to documentation and explained that  		physicians can receive reimbursement for certain activities that do not involve  		direct patient care by documenting the time spent performing these activities  		in their progress notes. </p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid nursing facility requirements specify that the  		medical record must contain discharge information documented either by: (1) "a  		physician" because the resident is being transferred or discharged because the  		health of others in the facility would otherwise be endangered, or (2) the  		"resident's physician" because the resident's needs cannot be met in the  		facility or because the individual has improved and no longer requires the  		services provided by the facility (<i>42 CFR §483.12(2)(i), (ii), and  		(iv), and (3)</i>). Resident records also are required to contain a final  		resident discharge summary that describes the resident's stay, summarizes the  		resident's status, and addresses the resident's post-discharge needs (<i>42  		C.F.R. §483.20(l)</i>). Facilities must develop a post-discharge plan of  		care that is developed with the participation of the resident and his or her  		family, which will assist the resident to adjust to his or her new living  		environment. (<i>42 C.F.R. §483.20(l)</i>). This requirement applies to  		discharges to a private residence, to another nursing facility, or to another  		type of residential facility such as board and care or nursing facility.  		Physicians can bill for services provided on the day of nursing home discharge  		(<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendVII">Appendix VII</a>). </p>
<p>In hospitals, the Medicare conditions of participation specify that a  		hospital must have a discharge planning process; discharge plans must be  		developed by qualified personnel; and that patient transfers must occur with  		the necessary medical information.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note57">57</a></font></sup> While Medicare pays physicians a higher rate  		for the production of discharge summaries for patients being discharged from  		hospitals (in comparisons to Medicare payment rates for discharge summaries for  		patients being discharged from nursing homes, see <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendX">Appendix  		X</a>), hospital discharge summaries are often absent or incomplete which  		contribute to poorly executed transitions across care settings and increased  		physician time obtaining necessary records. An AMDA survey of 3000 sequential  		admissions to ten Long Island nursing homes from 25 different hospitals found  		the following: 22% of transfers had no formal summary of information; legible  		summaries were available only 56% of the time; test results were omitted in  		31-67% of transfers; advance directives and code status were absent in 81% of  		transfers; and a legible phone number for the transferring physician was  		present in only 33% of transfers.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p>These poorly executed transitions increase physician burden and  		nonreimbursable activities associated with tracking down and completing needed  		paperwork for nursing home visits may be attenuated by electronic medical  		records.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note60">60</a></font></sup> Further,  		poor information exchange at times of transition is known to increase costs  		because of the associated inefficiencies, potential medical errors, and  		duplication of tests and services leading to greater utilization of hospital,  		emergency, post-acute, and ambulatory services. Electronic medical records,  		which are not currently available widely in nursing homes, may be an important  		future direction to improve transfer of the discharge information.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note58">58</a></font></sup> In a study completed by Kramer,  		<i>et al.</i>, one of the most highly valued functions of the electronic health  		information systems used by post-acute care and long-term care settings was  		access to real time information at times of transition.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note59">59</a></font></sup> The time spent in acquisition and review of  		medical reports may be reduced by the introduction of standardized electronic  		medical records across settings. </p>
<p>Other nonreimbursable time is the travel time to the nursing home and,  		thus, it may only be cost-effective for a physician to follow nursing home  		residents in nursing homes where he/she treats multiple residents in that  		facility. Further, when a physician is called concerning an individual resident  		who is experiencing acute decline, a single visit in the facility may not be  		cost effective and creates incentives for physicians to request that the  		resident be sent to the hospital or emergency room.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note61">61</a></font></sup> Again, the use of electronic  		health information systems and telemedicine could mitigate these costs.  		However, Medicare payment policy presently does not pay for physician or  		physician extender services delivered via telehealth to nursing home  		residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note65">65</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another aspect of payment that may discourage physicians from nursing  		home care is a concern that their nursing home claims will be denied. A carrier  		is the entity contracted by Medicare to determine payment. Claims submitted in  		excess of the required monthly visits must contain documentation to support the  		medical necessity of both the service and the frequency of visits or they will  		be identified as "routine" rather than medically necessary. </p>
<p>Billing requirements also may influence physicians' choices to practice  		in nursing homes because the billing process is more complex in nursing homes.  		Learning to bill properly takes time and practice. While federal requirements  		do not dictate a minimum number of medically necessary visits for  		community-dwelling elderly who are chronically ill, federal requirements do  		dictate the minimum number of physician visits to nursing home residents (<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendV">Appendix V</a>). Visits that occur in excess of the 30 or  		60-day window must be deemed medically necessary by the physician's carrier.  		Carriers commonly disallow visits between the required 30-day or 60-day  		intervals as routine when not well documented.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>TAG members identified a need to address the misperceptions and fears of  		coding and billing for nursing home physicians. Several participants reported  		very low denial rates once billing codes and documentation for visits were  		carefully examined for accuracy. In particular, one participant estimated that  		physicians could expect to achieve denial rates less than 1% with attention to  		billing practices. Participants agreed that the source of physician denials and  		subsequent perception that reimbursement for nursing home work is poor is more  		likely due to misunderstanding or lack of adequate education about correct  		billing and coding procedures than the actual reimbursement rates. However,  		with little training or education in nursing home care, physicians are not  		likely to feel comfortable in their billing practices for nursing home care.  		</p>
<p>In summary, the extent of nonreimbursable time necessary for the care of  		geriatric patients contributes to physicians' attitudes toward caring for these  		residents. The full range of primary care tasks performed by physicians in the  		nursing home and the time spent on each can be found in <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendXI">Appendix XI</a>. </p>
<h3>Burden of Practicing In Nursing Homes</h3>
<p>Many barriers discussed in the literature related to establishing and  		maintaining a nursing home practice focus on the inconveniences inherent in  		nursing home practice. Nursing homes are required to immediately report any  		change in a resident's physical, mental or psychosocial status condition to the  		resident's attending physician.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note62">62</a></font></sup> When called for a change in condition, the  		physician has several options, including: (1) an urgent visit to the nursing  		home, (2) management by phone, or (3) transfer to a hospital. An urgent visit  		to the nursing home may avoid a hospitalization and yield better diagnostic  		accuracy than treatment by phone, but it generally is not convenient or  		possible due to the demands of a busy clinic or inpatient practice and the  		typically remote location of the nursing home relative to the physician's  		office/hospital practice. </p>
<p>Physicians are required to monitor changes in the medical status of  		their residents and to provide consultation or treatment when called by the  		facility.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> While such  		calls are designed to be in the best interest of the resident, this requirement  		frequently results in many unnecessary calls, according to physician  		organizations such as the AMDA, and suggests the need for refinement of the  		federal definition of significant change in condition. For example, in November  		2000, the Minnesota Department of Health issued a formal statement regarding  		unnecessary phone calls, urging facilities to develop notification policies  		that ensure adequate care of their residents but that avoid unnecessary  		contacts.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note63">63</a></font></sup> AMDA also  		published guidelines in response to the complaint from physicians that too many  		calls from nursing homes were unnecessary. "Protocols for Physician  		Notification" in the long-term care setting was created to guide nurses in  		avoiding unnecessary phone calls.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note64">64</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The activity most likely to deter physicians from seeing nursing home  		residents is the expectation of a large number of phone calls from the nursing  		home.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> In addition,  		the inconvenience of seeing residents outside of the office also is speculated  		to influence physician decisions to decline to treat nursing home  		residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note53">53</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Malpractice</h3>
<p>Malpractice is one of the biggest issues in physician practice today,  		and nursing home care exposes physicians to the additional financial risk  		associated with a lawsuit against the nursing home. If a nursing home resident  		dies at the nursing home, the physician may fear that he/she will be sued for  		failure to respond to a change in condition. In addition, physicians may fear  		that not hospitalizing a patient who subsequently dies in the nursing home will  		lead to a lawsuit. In lawsuits directed against a nursing home for poor care,  		the physician is named directly in approximately 10% of cases.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note66">66</a></font></sup> Recently, insurance companies  		who have settled lawsuits against a nursing home where the physician was not  		named then have sued the physician after the settlement in order to recoup some  		of the losses associated with paid claims.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note66">66</a></font></sup> Physicians who feel they are accepting legal  		responsibility for the care delivered by the nursing home staff may be  		reluctant to see nursing home residents or may be more selective in declining  		residents from specific nursing homes. As nursing homes face increasing  		liability insurance premiums, many, where licensure laws permit, are choosing  		to go "bare," or without coverage, making the physician's personal malpractice  		insurance a more attractive target for litigation. </p>
<p>Increasingly, both nursing homes and physicians that practice in nursing  		homes are finding it difficult to obtain insurance coverage or, at minimum,  		affordable insurance coverage. The inability to get coverage for nursing home  		care or the increasing cost of such coverage may deter physicians from  		providing care to nursing home residents. Physicians report difficulty  		obtaining coverage for their nursing home work and note malpractice insurance  		policy renewal premium increases of up to 300 times previous  		premiums.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note67">67</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A recent AMDA survey found that 27% of nursing home medical directors  		claimed they had reduced patient care hours, no longer provided certain  		services, or referred complex cases to other physicians as a result of  		malpractice concerns. Of physician and medical director respondents, 5.6% were  		unable to get liability coverage because they worked in nursing homes.  		Additionally, in 2002, more than 20% of respondents who work in nursing homes  		reported that while they were able to ultimately obtain malpractice insurance,  		they did have problems doing so because carriers had stopped providing  		malpractice insurance in nursing home markets in their region or premium costs  		were too high.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note67">67</a></font></sup> Some  		experienced average premium increases of 154% in one year. One in 20 medical  		director respondents indicated they had stopped working in nursing homes due to  		lack of liability coverage.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note67">67</a></font></sup> Many people expect a surcharge to be added  		to malpractice premiums for all physicians who see nursing home residents,  		similar to the add-on for physicians who assist in surgeries.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
<p>At present, if a physician practices in a nursing home that does not  		have liability insurance, many malpractice insurance organizations will refuse  		to insure the physician, which is a significant concern for medical directors  		in nursing homes. </p>
<h2><a name="impact" id="impact">THE IMPACT OF PHYSICIAN PRACTICE PATTERNS IN NURSING  		HOMES</a></h2>
<p>Although many factors such as director of nursing tenure, facility size,  		and management practices are believed to influence nursing home quality, there  		has been little investigation of the effect of physicians practice patterns on  		the overall quality of care provided.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> The quality of care delivered by physicians  		in nursing homes is difficult to measure, but we can observe some activities  		that are associated with physician/ medical care services in nursing homes,  		such as frequency of physician and other medical care services, hospitalization  		rates, and patient satisfaction. </p>
<h3>Frequency of Physician and Other Medical Care  		Services</h3>
<p>Nursing home patients have been found to receive significantly more  		visits from physicians or physician extenders under various alternative models  		compared to traditional models. For example, physician and NP visits in the  		Evercare model were more frequent for Evercare enrollees as compared to  		nonEvercare residents.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition, one study compared HMO to FFS plans and found HMO patients  		in nursing homes received more combined visits (physician and NP) than FFS  		patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note68">68</a></font></sup> In this  		investigation, HMO physicians were paired with NPs, and HMO physicians averaged  		0.63 physician visits per month, and FFS physicians averaged 0.83 physician  		visits per month. HMO NP visits averaged 0.93 visits per month. There were no  		NP visits in FFS. The average number of combined visits per month was 1.63 in  		the HMOs versus 0.83 in FFS. </p>
<p>In a study of HMO nursing home care, the approaches of three HMOs were  		compared against each other and against nonHMO plans.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> Overall, the response to acute problems,  		such as falls and fever, was better documented and more prompt among HMO  		residents compared to residents not enrolled in an HMO. One of the plans that  		partnered NPs and physicians had fewer emergency room visits and lower  		hospitalization rates. Satisfaction did not differ between HMO and nonHMO. The  		most successful HMO provided the same number of physician visits as nonHMO, but  		supplemented with NP or PA visits. Reasons for less success in certain HMO  		plans was attributed to needing a very strong physician component, including  		frequent visits and close supervision to reduce hospitalization. The program  		must be maintained meticulously with very little margin for error, and dedicate  		physicians solely to the care of these patients to achieve the best results.  		</p>
<p>Health Partners, a nonprofit HMO with a Tax Equity and Financial  		Responsibility Act (TEFRA) risk contract, located in Bloomington, Minnesota,  		contracts with nursing homes in the area to reserve beds for members of the HMO  		who would benefit from an acute nursing home stay. Board-certified  		geriatricians are employed by the HMO to care for these geriatric residents. A  		short nursing home stay with care from geriatricians avoids hospitalization. A  		total of 1144 patients participated in the one-year program and 100 Health  		Partners physicians were surveyed about the program. Post-acute length of stay  		in the program was significantly lower than that in nonparticipating nursing  		homes (14.3 vs. 20.5 days). In addition, re-hospitalization rates from these  		units were comparable to or better than those from nonparticipating nursing  		homes. Patient and primary care physician satisfaction with the units was  		high.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note69">69</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Hospitalization and Other Measures of Quality and  		Cost-Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Unnecessary hospitalization of nursing home residents is an area of  		concern. Beyond the disruption and discomfort to the resident of a  		hospitalization, there is significant risk in hospitalization of older  		patients, including a greater risk of complications unrelated to the reason of  		hospitalization and other hazards such as functional deterioration from  		immobilization while hospitalized.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note70">70</a></font></sup> To promote patient safety and quality of  		life, hospitalization should be used only when medically necessary. </p>
<p>A number of factors encourage physicians to hospitalize patients that  		could be successfully treated in the nursing home. Past studies have found up  		to 76% of hospitalized nursing home patients could have been treated in the  		nursing home.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note71">71</a></font></sup> The  		following issues, already discussed in this paper, contribute to the  		unnecessary hospitalization of nursing home residents:</p>
<ul><li>Physician time commitment to conduct an urgent nursing home  		  visit;</li>
<li>Current reimbursement rates;</li>
<li>Methods for physician visits in nursing homes, hospital and  		  outpatient settings; and</li>
<li>Fear of a medical malpractice claim arising from treating patients in  		  nursing homes. </li>
</ul><p>Some practice models and demonstration projects have redesigned the  		payment structure to provide incentives for fewer hospitalizations. These  		structures tend to increase the payment for providing physician and medical  		services in the nursing home, sometimes resulting in a reduction in overall  		costs by avoiding expensive hospital days. </p>
<p>One demonstration project encouraged the treatment of acute conditions  		due to a "sudden decline" within the nursing home using a case management  		system that involved Medicare and Medicaid waivers. The program provided  		additional payments to nursing homes and physicians who chose to diagnose and  		treat an acute illness in the nursing home rather than hospitalize the  		resident. The program encouraged SNFs to treat acutely ill patients in the  		nursing home when safe and feasible. Physicians were paid for daily visits as  		long as the patient qualified for acute care services, up to 100  		days.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note71">71</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The project observed 112 acute episodes treated under the "sudden  		decline" benefit. Of these, independent evaluations determined that 76% of the  		episodes would have required at least an emergency room visit under the  		traditional Medicare and Medicaid system and that 88.4% of the cases were  		appropriately covered under the program. The cost for the patients with acute  		episodes treated under the program was $83 per patient day. Treating the acute  		episodes in the nursing home resulted in an estimated Medicare cost savings of  		$3,000 per episode of illness, not including the savings to Medicaid of holding  		the beds open while patients would have been in the hospital.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note71">71</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A quasi-experimental study investigated the use of hospital services for  		nursing home residents participating in the Evercare program.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> Evercare enrollees from five  		sites across the nation were compared with two control groups that included  		both nursing home residents of Evercare facilities, but not enrolled in the  		Evercare program, and nursing home residents at facilities that did not have an  		Evercare program. Unlike traditional nursing homes, the Evercare program offers  		payment incentives by reimbursing nursing homes for NP care and providing care  		for residents who otherwise would be hospitalized. This incentive component is  		referred to as intensive service days, or ISD. Evercare also reimburses  		unlimited physician visits. </p>
<p>Results of the study indicated that the Evercare sample population had  		fewer hospitalizations than the control sample. However, it was noted that the  		Evercare program is expensive to implement and operate, with costs to Medicare  		higher than in the traditional nursing home medical model. Increased Medicare  		costs arise from Medicare capitated payments being higher than comparable costs  		in the Medicare SNF payment.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> This indicates that, although cost savings  		through reduced hospitals costs are apparent, those saving may be offset by the  		increase in costs to implement and run the program.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Research suggests that geriatricians are more efficient than  		practitioners without training in geriatrics at treating older patients and  		that specialized training in geriatrics may lower hospitalizations.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note72">72</a></font></sup> In a comparison of long-term  		care facilities, a facility served primarily by geriatricians had lower  		hospitalization rates than a facility served primarily by general primary care  		physicians, after adjusting for case-mix. Overall, monthly Medicare Part A and  		B costs also were lower in the facility served primarily by geriatricians. In  		this analysis, costs included reimbursement for physician and therapy services;  		laboratory tests; X-ray services; and hospitalizations. The first facility (60%  		of primary care visits by geriatricians) had an average monthly Medicare Part A  		and B cost per resident that was $162 lower than the second facility (25% of  		primary care visits by geriatricians). </p>
<p>Research studies consistently demonstrate that the integration of  		physician extenders can reduce hospitalizations and overall costs.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note31">31</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note73">73</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note74">74</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note75">75</a>;  		<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note76">76</a></font></sup> For example, in a 92-bed, private,  		for-profit teaching nursing home facility in central Georgia, a PA practice  		model was introduced.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note77">77</a></font></sup>  		The PA made three-to-four weekly visits to the nursing home to complete the  		initial assessments, provided nearly all acute care visits, received calls  		during business hours, and consulted daily with attending physicians and  		residents. In the facility studied, the number of hospital days utilized per  		year declined by 68.6% after implementation of the model compared to the  		pre-implementation time period. Most residents in the study were managed by the  		same group of health care providers allowing for continuity of care practice  		protocols in the management of acute illness. They observed a decline in  		aggregate hospital DRG reimbursements of $96,043 because of reduced  		hospitalizations.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note77">77</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Within three models of care delivery in HMOs, Reuben, <i>et al.</i>,  		found residents enrolled in a model that paired physician extenders with  		physicians had fewer emergency room visits, and a smaller number were  		hospitalized compared to enrollees in a model that utilized only  		physicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> TAG  		members also associated the use of PAs/NPs with fewer hospital visits overall  		in their practices. </p>
<p>Research at three geriatric teaching centers indicates that the use of  		geriatrician faculty and GNPs with daily presence in the nursing home and focus  		on avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations by timely management of acute clinical  		decline, results in lower hospitalization and improved care processes with  		lower use of inappropriate medication.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note33">33</a>; <a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>While some research has reported an overall decrease in Medicare's  		aggregate costs as a result of using physician extenders, the use of and  		payment to physician extenders does increase the cost of providing medical  		visits to the nursing home. The Georgia study, mentioned previously, found the  		payments for physician/PA services to increase by $22,304 per patient each year  		in the nursing home. In that study, the associated savings from the decline in  		hospital costs was more than quadruple the cost for additional physician/PA  		visits.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note77">77</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nursing home traits may limit the ability of physicians to provide the  		"best practice" model. Specifically, the technology available in nursing homes  		may be below the standard needed to effectively treat a patient for an acute  		event. For example, physicians may not be confident in their abilities to  		effectively treat an acute respiratory illness when it may take two days to  		obtain the results of a chest radiograph performed in the hospital.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note78">78</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In a six-year case study series (1992-1997) with pre and  		post-experimental design, the availability of prompt lab, radiologic, and  		electrocardiographic services and the ability to administer intravenous  		medications allowed serious diseases to be evaluated and treated in study  		nursing homes in lieu of hospitalization to perform these functions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note77">77</a></font></sup> This study found that 78% of  		nursing home residents with pneumonia could be managed in the nursing home if  		the nursing home had daily physician presence, availability of mobile  		radiographic services, and the ability to administer intravenous antibiotics.  		</p>
<h3>Patient Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Another outcome measure is patient satisfaction. Closed staffing models  		may be associated with higher patient satisfaction. Three experimental models  		of care in New York with closed staffing were compared to the traditional FFS  		model.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> The three  		models included an NP model where staff NPs worked collaboratively with the  		facility medical director, a PA model where the PA was supervised by staff  		physicians or the medical director, and a physician model where only staff  		physicians cared for the nursing home residents. In this investigation,  		resident satisfaction was significantly better in the closed models. Residents  		reported improved access to providers, more comprehensive examinations, and  		more compassionate care. </p>
<p>Other studies find no differences in patient satisfaction between  		practice models. The <i>Evaluation of the Evercare Demonstration Program Final  		Report</i> indicated that quality of care and patient satisfaction of Evercare  		enrollees were equivalent to the care received by control patients in nursing  		homes participating in the Evercare program and nonparticipating Evercare  		nursing homes. However, both Evercare residents and their families reported an  		appreciation for the close attention and care coordination from primary  		caregivers, and they were more confident that hospitalization would occur when  		indicated.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In a study of HMO nursing home care, the approaches of three HMOs were  		compared to a traditional model of care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> Satisfaction did not differ between HMO and  		nonHMO plans. A final study comparing HMO and FFS plans asked two questions of  		patients to assess satisfaction. No differences were found between HMO and FFS  		residents when asked: "Does your doctor see you often enough?" "Were you  		treated for sickness as well as you could have been?" Further, the majority of  		residents and their families responded "yes" to the latter question under both  		plans. </p>
<h3>Unanswered Questions</h3>
<p>The published literature on physician practice patterns in nursing homes  		is limited, and several questions remain unanswered or only partially answered,  		including:</p>
<ul><li>Amount, duration, and scope of physician (and/or nonphysician  		  provider) visits to nursing homes;</li>
<li>Financing methods, coverage requirements, and rates for physician  		  (and/or nonphysician provider) services in nursing homes;</li>
<li>Perceived impact of physician (and/or nonphysician provider) visits  		  to nursing homes;</li>
<li>Any policy issues/concerns that arise from the physician practice  		  models and financing arrangements;</li>
<li>How physician presence in nursing homes affects the medical care of  		  residents beyond decreasing hospitalizations; and</li>
<li>Potential use of electronic medical records in improving transfer of  		  information among hospitals and nursing homes, and other settings/providers of  		  care. </li>

</tr></table><h2><a name="appendVIII" id="appendVIII">APPENDIX VIII. Medicare's Payment Formula for  		Physician Visits</a></h2>
<p>Payment amounts for each code are determined using the resource-based  		relative value system (RBRVS), the geographic practice cost index (GPCI), and  		the conversion factor. RBRVS and GPCI assign values to three components for  		each code: professional work, practice overhead, and malpractice. RBRVS  		determines the RVUs for all CPT codes while GPCI determines the relative cost  		of practicing in 93 distinct geographic areas of the Unites States. The GPCI  		adjusts payments in different areas of the country (<a href="literature-review-and-synthesis-physician-practices-nursing-homes.html#appendIX">Appendix IX</a>). For example, the areas with the highest  		malpractice GCPI are Detroit and Miami, while Manhattan and San Francisco have  		the highest practice overhead GCPI. The conversion factor is a dollar amount  		updated once a year and designed to maintain a constant rate of total Medicare  		spending on Part B as required by the 1997 Balanced Budget Amendment. The  		conversion factor is fixed across all physician specialties and all geographic  		areas. The fee schedule then multiplies the RVU by the GPCI for each component  		and then multiplies that number by the conversion factor to get the dollar  		payment for that CPT code. To illustrate how Medicare pays for nursing home  		visits: </p>
<p>CPT code 99302 -- Mid-level assessment code for nursing home care in  		Denver, CO </p>
<p>(1.61<sub>RVU Work</sub> * 1.0<sub>GPCI Work -Colorado</sub> +  		.54<sub>RVU Practice</sub> * .992<sub>GPCI Practice -Colorado</sub> +  		.06<sub>RVU Malpractice</sub> * .821<sub>GPCI Malpractice -Colorado</sub>) * $  		37.34<sub>2004 Conversion Factor</sub> = $81.96 </p>
<p>The above formula breaks down payment into payment for the three  		components: professional work, practice overhead, and malpractice. The first  		piece is the payment associated with the professional work; the professional  		expertise, time and effort of the physician required to complete the service.  		It is comprised of the relative value of that work and the geographic  		difference in the cost of providing it. The second piece is payment associated  		with practice overhead; the costs of providing the service not related to the  		physician including office overhead and ancillary personnel. Again, it is  		comprised of the relative costs to the service and the geographic variation in  		those costs. The final piece of payment is the malpractice component and it  		covers the liability cost to providing the service relative to other services  		and adjusted for geographic variation. The sum of these three components  		represents the relative physician weight of the service. It is then multiplied  		by a dollar value, constant across services, that CMS updates annually to  		maintain budget neutrality.</p>
