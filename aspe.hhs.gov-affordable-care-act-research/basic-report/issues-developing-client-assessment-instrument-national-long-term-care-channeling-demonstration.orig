<p> We are indebted to many individuals in the field of gerontology and  		services to the elderly for consulting with us on client assessment issues.  		Background papers on the major domains were prepared for us by Drs. Linda  		George (social and mental functioning) and Gerda Fillenbaum (activities of  		daily living, physical functioning, and demographic charateristics) of the  		Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, Duke University and by  		Drs. David Dellinger (services) and Richard Burton (financial resources and  		physical environment) of the Graduate School of Business Administration, Duke  		University. Drs. Leonard Gottesman and Ellen Costello, and Barbara Schneider of  		the Institute on Aging, Temple University (the technical assistance contractor  		for the National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation) provided helpful  		comments on initial drafts of this report, and co-sponsored review of clinical  		and operational concerns with a panel of practitioners. Drs. Sylvia Sherwood  		and John Morris of the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged, Roslindale,  		Massachusetts, reviewed a draft of the report and contributed valuable  		suggestions on many issues. Several other nationally recognized researchers  		shared their experience and suggestions with us, among them Dr. Betty Havens of  		the Manitoba Department of Health and Social Development, who provided a  		detailed critique of a draft of this report, Dr. M. Powell Lawton of the  		Philadelphia Geriatric Center, and Dr. Barry Garland of the Columbia University  		Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology. Dr. Robert Kane and Rosalie Bane kindly  		shared their manuscript of a comprehensive work in progress on client  		assessment of the aged. Drs.

<h3>A. Background</h3>
<p> The United States Department of Health and Human Services has initiated  		the National Long Term Care Demonstration to improve care for functionally  		impaired adults, particularly the elderly. The demonstration will emphasize  		community-based services, and a concept called "channeling," which relies on  		client assessment and case management to organize care that meets individual  		needs and controls long-term care expenditures. The purpose of the  		demonstration is to improve long-term care delivery systems at the state and  		the community level, and to evaluate the impact of channeling on costs, service  		utilization, providers, and client well-being. The project will require the  		development of an instrument capable of evaluating client functioning and  		service needs. Case managers will use this instrument to assess clients, and  		researchers will use its data to evaluate the effectiveness of the  		demonstration. Practitioners will administer the assessment questionnaire to  		clients receiving services at the sites, and trained interviewers will  		administer it to the research control group.</p>
<p> This draft report is the product of the first steps needed to develop a  		client assessment instrument for the National Long Term Care Demonstration: an  		extensive literature review, evaluation of existing instruments, and an  		appraisal of the previous experiences of others who have designed and used  		similar instruments (both practitioners and researchers). Before making  		recommendations, the report discusses conceptual and operational issues,  		representative instruments, and the advantages and liabilities of different  		approaches. It should provide a solid basis for review by the Department of  		Health and Human Services, experts in the field, states, demonstration sites,  		and other participants in the National Long Term Care Demonstration.</p>
<p> This draft report is not an exhaustive analysis of assessment of the  		aged and functionally impaired. It is a summary of major issues, available  		choices, and proposed ways to address the central issues in client assessment  		as they pertain to this project.</p>
<h3>B. Context: The Channeling Demonstration and  		Evaluation</h3>
<p> The objectives of the National Long Term Care Demonstration, as  		identified by the Department of Health and Human Services, are:</p>
<ul><li>to direct long-term care community resources in ways that minimize  		  overall costs;</li>
<li>to increase access to existing services;</li>
<li>to match services to the identified needs of clients;</li>
<li>to concentrate public resources on those persons with the greatest  		  need for subsidized long-term care;</li>
<li>to develop needed in-home and community services and increase those  		  in short supply;</li>
<li>to reduce unnecessary use of publicly-subsidized long-term care  		  services, including costly medical and institutional services;</li>
<li>to promote a reasonable division of labor between informal support  		  systems (families, neighbors, friends), privately-financed services, and  		  publicly-financed care; and</li>
<li>to maintain or enhance client outcomes, including physical and mental  		  functioning and quality of life.</li>
</ul><p> To achieve these objectives, twelve sites have been selected across the  		nation to demonstrate application of the channeling concepts on the local  		level. Up to nine additional sites will be selected in FY 1981. In each, a  		community agency, whose auspices and structure will vary by state, will provide  		a set of core channeling functions--primarily centralized client assessment and  		case management. These functions, intended to decrease the fragmentation of  		services in the existing system, are directed at the problems faced by both the  		individual client and the service delivery system.</p>
<p> At the individual level, the idea of channeling is to ensure that  		functionally impaired persons with multiple needs have access to and receive  		the most appropriate services. It is proposed that this be accomplished through  		a central intake for needy individuals; systematic identification and  		assessment of their needs; and case management to arrange, monitor and adjust  		the appropriate set of services to changing client needs.</p>
<p> At the system level, channeling is intended to ensure that a wide range  		of services is available, accessible, responsive to the needs of the target  		population, and delivered in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  		Channeling should help target government-financed services to the most needy  		clients in such a way that the service system and budget will not be  		overwhelmed by exploding demands.</p>
<p> The main purpose of the demonstration is to provide information the  		government can use to determine future national policy toward long-term care.  		To accomplish this, the research evaluation will attempt to answer the  		following basic questions:</p>
<ul><li>What are the barriers to effective implementation of channeling? How  		  can they best be overcome? What are the best ways to organize and administer  		  the channeling process?</li>
<li>How does channeling affect client service use?</li>
<li>What are the cost impacts of channeling to the government, to clients  		  and their families, and to society?</li>
<li>What impact does channeling have on the quality of life of clients  		  and their families?</li>
<li>What is the response of providers and the service delivery system to  		  channeling?</li>
<li>Is channeling cost-effective?</li>
<li>Which channeling model is the most effective?</li>
</ul><p> To answer these questions, the evaluation of the demonstration will use  		an experimental methodology to compare what happens under channeling, with what  		would have happened in its absence. By randomly assigning potential  		participants to a treatment or control group within the sites, observed  		differences in outcomes can be attributed to program impacts with a known  		degree of statistical confidence. This approach will be applicable to all  		questions that rely on data about individuals: the analyses of service  		utilization, individual well-being, costs and cost-effectiveness. The other  		research issues--implementation/process, and provider response/supply--are best  		evaluated by observing differences between demonstration sites and comparable  		comparison (non-demonstration) sites, and by examining differences among the  		demonstration sites.</p>
<p> Evaluating the multiple aspects of the channeling demonstration and  		answering the questions raised above clearly requires an extensive data  		collection effort. many sources will be used: individual participant  		interviews, project narratives, screening data, a mail survey of providers,  		extracts from provider records, special cost case studies, channeling agency  		expenditure reports, and data from an automated client tracking system.  		However, because so much of the evaluation is contingent on observation of and  		documentation about individuals, the most important data source will be the  		individual interviews, i.e., the client assessments and reassessments.</p>
<h3>C. Client Assessment for Care Planning and Research</h3>
<p> Client assessment is obviously central to evaluating the impact of  		channeling interventions on client populations, service systems, and public  		expenditures for long term care. But beyond its importance as a data source,  		client assessment is essential to adequate care planning, to procurement of  		appropriate services, efficient resource use, and for monitoring and modifying  		service delivery to individuals. Although research and practice may require  		different levels of specificity and content in the client assessment, both  		purposes must guide instrument development. The instrument must be relevant to  		the needs of caregivers if it is to be useful for research purposes. The  		factors that must be assessed are actually common to both groups: physical  		health and mental health, ability to perform activities of daily living, social  		support and participation, financial and related resources, physical  		environment and living arrangements, and services (as described in the  		RIP).</p>
<p> Among these components of general well-being, there exists considerable  		interaction, frequent overlap, and different theoretical bases. Consequently,  		existing assessment instruments vary significantly in emphasis, structure,  		method of administration, and grouping and weighting of components and items.  		It is clear that one multidimensional instrument encompassing all these areas  		is needed for both operational and research purposes.</p>
<p> Given the nature of the service delivery process and of the research  		needs, it is appropriate to emphasize functional measures. For purposes of care  		planning, a client assessment should identify: major areas of impaired  		performance or ability; compensating or aggravating factors in an individual's  		behavior, skills, environment, social support systems or resources; and  		services an individual is already receiving. These need to be identified well  		enough to (a) provide a full baseline picture of an individual and (b) suggest  		appropriate referrals for delivery of services. Such referrals <b>may</b>  		include more detailed assessment (physical examination, medical history,  		psychological testing) in a particular functional domain by specialists.  		Assessment by a case manager (primary service contact) need not, and in some  		cases should not, encompass all the detail of specialized diagnostic  		evaluations. For purposes of evaluating the national demonstration, it will  		generally be more useful to know the domain, nature and impact on normal living  		of an asset or liability, than to know its etiology. Care planners will also be  		concerned with this, because decisions about what type of service provider a  		client should be directed to, the environment in which that care will be  		provided, and the degree to which a person will be removed from his (her)  		natural setting to receive care, all tend to be influenced greatly by the  		person's functional abilities.</p>
<h3>D. Criteria for Selection of Instruments</h3>
<p> This draft takes an "inclusive" rather than "exclusive" approach to  		areas of personal well-being and service use that may be measured in the  		assessment instrument. At this early stage, it is appropriate to consider all  		significant variables that may be pertinent to the demonstration. However, the  		length of the instrument and the duration of the assessment interview must be  		tightly controlled. After the research hypotheses, data collection strategies,  		and analytic design are final, and the operational needs of practitioners and  		the demonstration sites more clearly defined, the many variables considered in  		this draft can be reviewed and the final instrument limited to those items that  		are clearly essential.</p>
<p> Only a limited number of the myriad instruments in use or in the  		literature tap information on all the functional areas (plus services and  		resources) described above. Nor does any single multidimensional and  		functionally-oriented instrument meet both the operational and research needs  		of the demonstration. In addition, more limited instruments are available for  		in-depth assessment of dimensions not well covered in the multidimensional  		tools. The state of the art and the nature of this demonstration clearly point  		to a hybrid assessment instrument that draws on the strengths of established  		multidimensional instruments and on more specialized ones, when  		appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to develop a multidimensional, functionally-oriented client  		assessment instrument that also includes services data, the following criteria  		must be met. The instrument should:</p>
<ul><li>assess the basic areas of functioning and well being;</li>
<li>include information on service utilization;</li>
<li>satisfy the needs of case managers;</li>
<li>provide research data.</li>
</ul><p>Two additional criteria must be considered--strength of the instrument  		and operational constraints.</p>
<p> For research purposes, we must be certain the components of the  		instrument have a well-developed theoretical foundation and clearly define the  		variables being measured. It is particularly important that the various domains  		(such as social functioning and service utilization) be kept separate and  		distinct, because they often interact. The instrument should distinguish  		different levels of functioning, yield a good range of responses, and be  		sensitive to change over time. There should be clear, consistent procedures for  		administering the instrument and recording information. It is important that  		the components of the instrument be applicable to a wide range of disability  		types and levels, and to institutionalized persons and those in the community.  		The "burden" of the instrument, in terms of length and design, should be  		minimized to avoid attrition and subject fatigue, and to facilitate assessor  		use. We believe the assessment should be limited to approximately one hour.  		(Periodic reassessment will be somewhat briefer because certain baseline  		questions on demographics and other fixed items need not be asked again.)</p>
<p> Because of the complexity of this demonstration, meeting all the  		criteria for instrument selection and development is difficult, and  		establishing the reliability and validity of the instrument components is  		similarly difficult. Some well-tested instruments with established psychometric  		properties are not self-report tools; much of the psychometric evidence for  		existing instruments considers only summary scores or ratings for an entire  		instrument or its major domains; there is little published documentation of the  		strength of some other potential tools; and in other cases (such as the  		financial information needed understand demand for services), greater detail is  		required in this evaluation than in most previous studies. Such problems  		complicate the task of selection from existing instruments, and in some  		instances require reformatting or developing new questions.</p>
<p> The particular operational constraints imposed by the national  		demonstration make additional demands. The dual function of the  		instruments--data collection for research, and client assessment for care  		planning--create certain needs. Data must be specific and pertinent for the  		needs of case managers, yet capable of aggregation for statistical analysis by  		researchers without losing important distinctions about client well-being in  		different spheres. Components should be sensitive to change over time; for  		program purposes it may be desirable that they be sensitive to small increments  		of change at the lower functioning end of the spectrum.</p>
<p> Another point to consider is that the instrument will be administered  		by channeling agency staff to clients and by trained interviewers to those  		persons assigned to the control group. To ensure comparability of data, the  		assessment instrument must rely on self-reported information from respondents  		rather than on observations and clinical or other subjective ratings and  		judgments. This somewhat limits a practitioner's assessment (which would  		normally integrate observation, interview, and the assessor's experience and  		intuition), and decreases the number of applicable existing instruments.  		Because the assessment will be administered by persons from various  		professional disciplines, paraprofessionals, and non-professionals (to the  		control group), it is critical that the language and procedures for assessment  		and scoring be simple and direct. Training procedures for both site workers and  		nonprofessional interviewers should be brief. Training and administration costs  		must be minimized. As noted earlier, assessments will be administered to a  		range of disability groups in a variety of settings. Depending on the eventual  		casemix of sites, it will be helpful to choose assessments that have already  		been used for both aged and non-aged populations. Special procedures for use  		with persons suffering major impairments to communication--sight, speech,  		hearing, disorientation should be contemplated; and because some impaired  		persons may be unable to respond to an interview-based assessment instrument,  		it should be designed so that essential information may be obtained from a  		knowledgeable informant (or "proxy") when necessary. </p>
<p> Despite substantial overlap between practitioner and research needs for  		client assessment data, there may be demand for "clinical" information not  		essential to the research design (detailed medical history, for example) and  		for "research" detail not necessarily important to case managers (specific  		individual expenditure data, for instance). To reduce burden and to encourage  		conscientious use of the assessment tool, all such items must be absolutely  		essential to either research or care planning, and not feasible or appropriate  		to collect in other ways.</p>
<p> The necessity of using a standardized approach across all sites may be  		perceived as limiting flexibility in the assessment process. Case managers and  		other practitioners may favor a less structured approach that would permit  		probing beyond, branching out from, or supplementing the questions asked in the  		standard instrument to complete the assessment of a particular individual. A  		channeling agency might wish to add certain questions to be asked of all its  		clients. The standard instrument must address those areas of concern common  		across sites and users. But attempting to integrate into the basic instrument  		site-specific or case-specific interests would raise other problems. It would  		result in a burdensome tool, detract from the consistency of the data across  		sites, raise obstacles to OMB clearance, and pose problems for implementation  		of the automated client tracking system. Our objective is to provide the  		standard core instrument. Individual sites and practitioners might add some  		items at the end of the assessment to suit special local concerns, subject to  		DHHS approval.</p>
<h3>E. Sources on Which This Draft Report is Based</h3>
<p> This preliminary report is the product of several months work by the  		evaluators and their consultants. An extensive literature review on client  		assessment and the aged was conducted, relying on major anthologies and primary  		studies of major instruments and issues. Instrument review was done of those  		multidimensional tools that approximated the general criteria described here,  		as well as scores of more limited scales that tapped a specific dimension  		particularly well. Background reports on the assessment of each of the  		principal domains were prepared by consultants, comparing available tools  		against our general criteria. Experts in the field--both authors and  		users--were contacted and they suggested conceptual issues and operational  		solutions concerning widely-used scales and approaches. Representatives of some  		existing channeling-type agencies and service providers were also interviewed  		regarding these issues; and copies of assessment tools designed for similar  		program purposes were collected and reviewed. Over the past 25 years, a  		formidable number of relevant assessment tools have been developed. Through  		continuous refinement of the concepts, approaches, and basic scales, a rich  		data base has been created, on which we can draw.</p>
<p> Based on these sources, a rough draft report was prepared, and  		distributed for review to a broad cross-section of researchers, HHS staff, the  		national technical assistance and survey contractors, and a panel of  		practitioners experienced in assessment of the aged and functionally impaired.  		The results are summarized in this draft.</p>
<p> The chapters that follow reflect tentative findings and recommended  		directions resulting from out initial investigation. This draft report:</p>
<ul><li>states the purposes of the client assessment instrument;</li>
<li>identifies conceptual approaches and dimensions of functioning;</li>
<li>recommends criteria for selection of instrument components;</li>
<li>delineates methodological and operational constraints;</li>
<li>considers pros and cons of available representative approaches;  		  and</li>
<li>proposes the directions to be taken.</li>
</ul><p>It is intended to provide the states and demonstration sites, the  		government, the technical assistance contractor, the national survey  		contractor, consultants, and other interested parties with an opportunity for  		early review and comment. These comments will help guide further analysis, the  		process of instrument development, and the content of the final report.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. PHYSICAL HEALTH</a></h2>
<h3>A. Rationale</h3>
<p> It is obvious that assessment of well-being should include measurement  		of physical health. The issue is not whether to consider physical health but  		rather which aspects of physical health status should be included. There are a  		number of ways to categorize physical health status. A recent annotated  		bibliography of health status assessments (Freeburg, Lave, Lave and Leinhardt,  		1979) groups them into eight categories:</p>
<ul><li>Self-perceived health status </li>
<li>Physician-rated health status </li>
<li>Symptoms, conditions, or illnesses</li>
<li>Disability incapacitation, restriction </li>
<li>Chronic illness and disability </li>
<li>Acute illness and disability</li>
<li>Composite measures</li>
<li>Specific symptoms or diseases.</li>
</ul><p> Because diagnosis may provide little information about capacity (Jones  		et al. 1974; Lawton, Ward and Yaffe, 1968), the emphasis in long term care is  		properly on functional ability or impairment. This emphasis is reflected in the  		National Minimum Data Set for Long Term Care (U.S. National Committee on Vital  		and Health Statistics, 1979) which recommends that information be collected on  		vision, hearing and communication impairment, ability to perform physical  		activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, and  		diagnoses. With the exception of diagnoses, all these reflect concern with the  		impact of illness, rather than illness per se. In the next chapter we consider  		ability to perform activities of daily living. It is appropriate to consider  		this separately because impairments of such ability may reflect mental as well  		as physical health conditions. In this chapter, we consider other aspects of  		physical health--impairment of vision, hearing and communication, diagnoses,  		other physical conditions, treatments; and self-perceived health status. We  		recommend inclusion of physical conditions generally, and treatments rather  		than diagnoses only (as in the National Minimum Data Set), because care  		planning requires consideration of conditions whether or not they have been  		diagnosed or treated. Practitioners need to understand the medical conditions  		that people face. They need to determine whether there are any conditions that  		are not being treated, what conditions are responsible for an individual's  		impairment, and whether a medical condition makes certain services  		inappropriate.</p>
<p> Turning to research data needs, information on medical condition is an  		important control variable. Holding functional status constant, treatment and  		control group members could differ with respect to medical conditions in  		important ways, either as a result of sampling error or of randomization  		failure. Moreover, by providing clients with needed services, channeling may  		improve their physical condition and medical conditions may be alleviated.</p>
<p> We recommend including a measure of self-perceived health status  		because subjective measures of health status may be important intervening  		factors in the utilization of health care services. Moreover, perceived health  		status is an aspect of overall life satisfaction (Campbell, Converse, and  		Rogers, 1976; Andrews and Withey, 1976), and it is reasonable to hypothesize  		that by supplying needed services channeling may affect self-perceived health  		status. Consequently, self-perceived health status provides an outcome variable  		for the analysis.</p>
<p> Another set of health status measures involves days of restricted  		activity (i.e., days in the hospital, days in various institutions, and days at  		home in bed). These are critical outcome variables for the evaluation of the  		channeling project. However, because major measures of activity restriction  		(those involving hospitalization and institutionalization) involve the use of  		health services, we consider them in <a href="#chapVII">Chapter VII</a>,  		"Service Utilization."<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup>  		Self-report data on service utilization will be supplemented by data from  		provider records. The procedures for extracting data from provider records are  		discussed in <a href="#chapVII">Chapter VII</a>.</p>
<p> It is also noteworthy that although measures of restricted activity are  		considered with other services in this report, such need not be the case in the  		instrument. From the perspective of question logic and flow, it may be  		desirable to include questions on hospitalization and institutionalization in  		the physical health module.</p>
<h3>B. Measures of Physical Health</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Medical Conditions</i></b></p>
<p> The major self-report multidimensional assessment instruments use  		similar procedures to assess medical conditions or diagnoses. All utilize an  		inventory or checklist format; they differ in the conditions that are  		specifically listed, and in the language used to describe the conditions. There  		is considerable variation in the lengths of the lists and, consequently, in the  		conditions that are specified. The OARS<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> checklist, for example, contains 26 specific  		conditions, while the Havens and Thompson (1971) checklist contains 14.  		Checklists do not necessarily have to be lengthy to meet the, needs of  		practitioners in care planning. The SAAF, an instrument specifically designed  		for care planning, includes eleven (11) specific items in the medical  		conditions checklist. All self-report instruments use lay language rather than  		medical terms to describe medical conditions. For instance, the term "cancer"  		would be used rather than "neoplasm." However, even in lay language there are  		differences in the level of detail across instruments. For instance, the SAAF  		checklist includes "skin problems," while the OARS checklist includes "skin  		disorders such as pressure sores, leg ulcers or severe burns."</p>
<p> The National Minimum Data Set for Long Term Care recommends that  		information on diagnoses be collected in terms of the major International  		Classification of Diseases (ICD) categories. One advantage of using the ICD  		categories is that it ensures that all diagnoses are covered. However, although  		some assessment instruments (e.g., PACE II) use IQ categories to record  		information on diagnoses, no existing self-report instrument does.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p> <a href="#exhibitII.1">Exhibit II.1</a> presents the medical conditions  		checklists from OARS and SAAF and the ICD codes from the National Minimum Data  		Set. Together these illustrate the issues involved in the development of a  		checklist. The OARS checklist also includes information on the level of  		disability associated with each condition.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p> We suggest that a checklist of medical conditions be developed which  		uses lay language and which can be coded using ICD categories as recommended by  		the National Minimum Data Set on Long Term Care.</p>
<p><b><i>2. Treatment</i></b></p>
<p> The approach to dealing with treatment varies across self-report  		instruments. Information on type of medication is very often included, although  		there are some instruments (e.g., PGC-MAI) that do not consider  		medication.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Some  		instruments (e.g., OARS) use checklists of medications and ask specifically  		about the use of each medication listed. Other instruments (e.g., COMPASS,  		SAAF) rely on open-ended questions. Dosage and frequency may or may not be  		obtained.</p>
<p> Detailed knowledge about medications including type, dosage and  		frequency are quite important in care planning. There is much a practioner can  		learn from medications. For example, the client's diagnosed illnesses and  		complaints can be compared to his (her) list of medications to evaluate whether  		any medical problems are not being treated, the mix or medicines can suggest  		that the medication regime should be reviewed by a physician, and possible side  		effects (such as disorientation) of specific medications can be evaluated. A  		limited amount of information on medications is also useful for the research  		purposes of this project. The number of medications provides a good indicator  		of poor physical health and consequently, a good control variable.</p>
<p> Given the substantial differences in the level of detail required by  		practitioners and researchers, we, recommend that the item on medications be an  		open-ended question such as, "Do you regularly take any medicines? What do you  		take?" The responses would be checked off on a pre-coded list and optional  		space would be provided for practitioners to add information on dosage and  		frequency for channeling clients. The latter information would not be collected  		for control group members and would not be entered in the client tracking  		system.</p>
<p> Other treatments besides medications can be quite important in care  		planning. For example, practitioners need to know about intravenous and tube  		feedings, irrigations and dressings, supportive devices and prostheses and  		special diets. We recommend that a checklist on prostheses be added to the  		instrument. The checklist need not be lengthy but should specifically cover the  		most widely used aids. Optional space would be provided for practitioners to  		note further information about prostheses such as the circumstances of use and  		the brand. We also recommend items on whether the respondent is on a special  		diet and whether s/he is receiving any other treatment. Space would be provided  		for practitioners to note the type of diet or treatment if they wish to do so  		for care planning purposes.</p>
<p><b><i>3. Self-Perceived Health Status</i></b></p>
<p> Existing multidimensional assessment instruments differ in their  		consideration of subjective health status. Many include a single item on  		overall perception of current health. If another item is included, it is likely  		to be a question comparing current health status to past health status,  		although the time frame varies across instruments (one year, three years, five  		years). The OARS and PGC-MAI devote three and four items, respectively, to  		self-perceived health status. These are very similar except for the addition in  		the PGC-MAI of an item comparing one's health status to that of others of the  		same age. (<a href="#exhibitII.2">Exhibit II.2</a> represents the module from  		PGC-MAX.)</p>
<p> Single-item indicators of self-perceived health status would allow case  		managers to identify people with health problems that have not been identified  		by inventorying diagnosis and other medical conditions. However, for research  		purposes a single-item indicator will be less reliable than a scale. Given the  		use of self-perceived health-status as an outcome measure, we recommend the use  		of a scale of several items. The PGC-MAI item comparing one's health to that of  		others makes it an attractive choice. As discussed above, physical health  		status is an important control variable in the research. In this regard we are  		especially concerned with the severity of illness. Self-perceived health  		status, in general, and especially health status compared with others of the  		same age may be a useful indicator of the severity of illness.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>4. Other Issues in Physical Health</i></b></p>
<p> In addition to the inventory of diagnoses and medical conditions, we  		recommend that separate questions be asked on impairment of vision and hearing,  		and problems with nutrition, teeth or dentures, feet and skin cars. We also  		recommend that data on difficulty in communication be collected, using assessor  		observation.</p>
<p> The purpose of these questions is to help practitioners identify  		individuals with health problems that might not be captured in the other  		questions on physical health. Some individuals may view problems in these areas  		as the result of aging and not associate them with a need for medical care. We  		have selected problem areas that are common to the elderly. A further comment  		about nutrition is in order. We believe it is important to assess nutrition  		because better nutrition may be an important mechanism through which channeling  		affects the physical health of its clients.</p>
<p> Because the chief purpose of these questions is to identify problem  		areas for further follow-up as practitioners judge necessary, we propose to  		limit the number of questions to one or two for each problem area. Poor  		example, we might ask whether the person had problems with his (her) teeth or  		dentures and when s/he last visited a dentist.</p>
<h3>C. Summary of Recommendations</h3>
<p> We recommend an inventory of diagnoses and medical conditions that is  		phrased in lay language but that can be coded using the major International  		Classification of Disease categories. A checklist format would be used. Turning  		to treatment, we recommend the questions on medications be open-ended, with  		pre-coded responses and an optional space for practitioners to enter  		information on dosage and frequency. In addition, we recommend a short  		checklist of prostheses and supportive devices and individual items on special  		diets and other treatments. Self-perceived health status is important for  		research purposes because it may affect utilization of services and may be  		affected by participation in channeling. We recommend that it be measured using  		the PGC-MAI battery of four items.</p>
<p> Finally, we recommend the inclusion of one or two questions on several  		health problems common in the elderly, but that may not be identified in the  		inventory of diagnoses and medical conditions. These include questions on  		impairment of vision, hearing and communciation (collected by observation),  		problems with nutrition, teeth or dentures, feet and skin care.</p>

<h3>A. Rationale</h3>
<p> Among all the aspects of well-being to be considered in the assessment  		instrument, the ability to perform activities of daily living is, perhaps, the  		most crucial. These abilities reflect both physical and mental health status  		(Katz, Downs, Cash and Gratz, 1970; Fillenbaum, 1975; Kuriansky and Gurland,  		1976).<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> Further, because  		they focus on what a person can and cannot do, measures of activities of daily  		living (ADL) are critical to care planning. As major outcome variables for the  		analysis of the impact of the demonstration on individuals, they are also  		central to the research.</p>
<p> The majority of ADL scales are intended for use in institutional  		settings and, in particular, in rehabilitation settings. Consequently, they  		tend to focus on the minutiae of behavior and on distinguishing among  		relatively severe levels of impairment. Examples of these scales are the  		Barthel (Mahoney and Barthel, 1965) and that used by Moskowitz and McCann  		(1957). Although such scales are appropriate in institutional settings, where  		impairment may be severe, they are insufficient for community settings because  		many of the disabled living in a community are less impaired. A scale for  		community use mast discriminate among less severe levels of  		impairment.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> In  		addition, most ADL scales consider only the ability to perform personal  		self-maintenance tasks, such as bathing and eating. However, the disabled  		living in a community may be able to perform personal self-maintenance tasks,  		but unable to function independently without assistance in household management  		tasks. Thus, while ability to perform these personal self-maintenance tasks is  		crucial, for community-resident elderly it is also necessary to consider other  		tasks, such as meal preparation and housekeeping, which bear on the ability to  		live independently. Lawton and Brody (1969) labeled these tasks instrumental  		activities of daily living (IADL) and developed separate scales for ADL and  		IADL.</p>
<h3>B. Activities of Daily Living</h3>
<p> The most widely used self-report measures of physical ADL are  		modifications of the scales of Katz et al. (1963) and of Lawton and Brody  		(1969) and Lawton (1971). The Katz scale is based on the empirical observation  		that elderly patients pass through three stages of recovery of independence:  		first in feeding and continence, second in transferring and toileting and third  		in dressing and bathing. Lawton and Brody added walking, wheeling, and grooming  		to the Katz tasks and eliminated transferring. Other modifications have added  		going outside and climbing stairs.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup><a href="#tableIII.1">Table III.1</a>  		indicates the tasks considered in selected physical ADL scales and in the  		National Minimum Data Set for Long Term Care (U.S. National Committee on Vital  		and Health Statistics, 1979). Because the scales have borrowed heavily from  		each other, it is not surprising that there is considerable overlap among the  		tasks they consider. Some of the differences may be attributed to differences  		in the populations for which they were designed. For example, PACE II, which  		includes wheeling, is intended for the institutionalized.</p>
<p> Gurland (1980) argues that the six Katz activities are sufficient to  		measure ADL because other tasks were tested, and eliminated, in the development  		of the Katz scale. However, the National Minimum Data Set for Long Term Care  		recommends the inclusion of walking and ambulation out of doors in addition to  		the six Katz tasks. Except for the Katz scale, all the instruments in  		<a href="#tableIII.1">Table III.1</a> consider walking and some aspect of  		mobility. However, several (PGC-MAI, OARS, SAAF, Manitoba) do not include  		toileting, which is included in the Katz scale. The physical demands involved  		in toileting (transferring to toilet, adjusting clothes, cleaning oneself) seem  		to be largely covered in other activities (for example, in transferring,  		dressing and grooming). This approach has the advantage of eliminating a  		potentially embarrassing question.</p>
<p> Physical ADL scales also differ in their treatment of various forms of  		assistance. Some differentiate mechanical aid and human assistance, others  		group the need for assistance from a device and human assistance, and still  		others treat performance with a mechanical device as unaided performance. We  		recommend that the two forms of assistance be distinguished. The distinction  		between mechanical assistance and human assistance is important from the  		clinical perspective of care planning. Moreover, the National Minimum Data Set  		an Long Term Care recommends treating performance with mechanical devices as  		unaided performance. If the two types of assistance are differentiated, it will  		be possible to collapse the unaided and mechanical assistance  		categories.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Most of the existing ADL scales that differentiate between human and  		mechanical assistance are not self-report scales. The ADL scale of SAAF is an  		exception; it distinguishes between the need for a helper and other limitations  		such as using mechanical aids and the inability to perform a task in a  		reasonable amount of time. The ADL scale of the instrument used in the South  		Carolina Community Long Term Care project also distinguishes between mechanical  		and human assistance. However, it is a lengthy battery and is not entirely  		self-report. <a href="#tableIII.2">Table III.2</a> indicates the treatment of  		mechanical and human assistance in selected self-report ADL scales.</p>
<p> Another difference among the physical ADL scales involves the  		distinction between current performance and potential performance of tasks. Two  		types of potential performance can be distinguished--<b>prognosis</b>, that is,  		likely performance given change in capacity over time and <b>current  		capacity</b>, that is, performance that would currently be possible, given  		opportunity and desire. Institutional rules often proscribe activities for  		which an individual has the capacity. Rules in nursing homes against  		unsupervised bathing are the classic example. (The institutional setting also  		limits the opportunity to perform many instrumental activities of daily living.  		This is considered in the next section.)</p>
<p> Professional judgment is required to assess prognosis and such  		judgments are difficult to make at best. Because the control group will not be  		assessed by practitioners, we cannot collect information in the standardized  		core assessment instrument on potential capacity given change over time. (We  		could provide practitioners with the option to record treatment group members'  		potential capacity.) However, we will ask about current capacity, that is, ask  		clients what personal self-maintenance tasks they can do without assistance or  		if institutional rules permitted.</p>
<p> Existing self-report ADL scales differ in their treatment of current  		performance and capacity. As <a href="#tableIII.2">Table III.2</a> indicates,  		some clearly distinguish between current performance and capacity. Others ask  		only about current performance, that is, about the tasks one <b>does</b>  		perform. Still others mix current performance and capacity by asking about the  		tasks one <b>can</b> perform.</p>
<p> <a href="#exhibitIII.1">Exhibit III.1</a> presents the Katz, OARS, and  		SAAF scales as examples of various approaches to measuring activities of daily  		living.</p>
<p> Turning now to the psychometric properties of ADL scales, the fact that  		the Katz scale was patterned on the empirical process of rehabilitation in  		elderly patients is evidence for its construct validity. Moreover, the Katz  		Index of ADL forms a Guttman scale that has been shown to be highly  		reproducible (Katz et al., 1963; Sherwood et al., 1977). The Lawton scale was  		found to form a Guttman scale when administered to an institutional sample  		(Lawton and Brady [1969]); however, this was not the case for a large sample of  		community residents (Fillenbaum, 1975). Among the self-report instruments, high  		criterion validity has also been demonstrated for an assessor rating of ADL and  		IADL based on the OARS' scales; self-care capacity as rated by physical  		therapists correlated 0.83 with the OARS rating scale (Fillenbaum and Symer,  		forthcoming). Scores on a similar PGC-MAI rating scale have been shown to be  		significantly higher for persons living in the community than for persons  		receiving in-home services or on the waiting lists for institutions, indicating  		that it has predictive validity. (Moss, Fulcomer and Kleban, 1978). Because the  		items for the principal ADL scales overlap so extensively, this body of  		evidence indicates that the ADL tasks do provide valid measures of functional  		capacity.</p>
<p> Again considering the self-report scales, levels of reliability that  		are adequate or better are reported for both the PGC-MAI and OARS rating  		scales. (Fillenbaum, 1975; Lawton et al., no date). We find no information on  		the reliability of the ADL measures used in the SAAF, the self-report form of  		the Katz scale used in COMPASS, or the California or South Carolina  		instruments. All of these have been used with community-resident elderly.</p>
<h3>C. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living</h3>
<p> As <a href="#tableIII.3">Table III.3</a> indicates, a common core of  		seven IADL tasks are included in most instruments used in community settings.  		These tasks include the abilities to:</p>
<ul><li>use the telephone</li>
<li>travel out of walking distance shop</li>
<li>prepare meals do housework</li>
<li>take medications</li>
<li>manage personal finances.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, many instruments distinguish between laundry and other  		housework. A few include other tasks; in particular, handyman and work and  		carrying out the rubbish or getting the mail.</p>
<p> The National Minimum Data Set on Long Term Care lists the following as  		adaptive tasks: taking care of personal possessions, securing personal items;  		handling money; and using the telephone. Securing personal items would be  		covered by the core IADL item on shopping, and taking care of personal  		possessions, by the housework item. The other two National Minimum Data Set  		adaptive tasks are directly addressed by core IADL items.</p>
<p> The tasks involved in instrumental activities of daily living are more  		complex than those involved in physical activities of daily living. They are  		likely to be more sensitive than ADL items to variations in mental health and  		in motivation and opportunity. As a result, the problem of differences between  		actual and potential performance discussed above for AOL are pervasive for  		IADL. In the first place, measuring ability to perform household activities is  		problematic in institutional settings because residents have only very limited  		opportunities to perform such tasks.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> Second, in community settings, current  		performance and capacity to perform may vary because of motivation or, for  		household tasks, differentiation of roles by sex.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Given lack of opportunity or desire, the  		method of choice would be to design empirical tests of ability to perform  		various household tasks. This is the approach taken in the Performance  		Activities of Daily Living Scale (PADL) by Kuriansky and Gurland (1976).  		However, for the National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation we must rely  		almost entirely on self-report data and such empirical tests are not feasible.  		If an individual does not currently perform a task, for whatever reason, the  		only means we have of collecting information about potential capacity is to ask  		about his (her) perception of that capacity.</p>
<p> Instruments in use in community settings vary in their treatment of  		current performance and capacity for IADL. As <a href="#tableIII.4">Table  		III.4</a> indicates, some consider current performance only and others, current  		capacity only. The latter procedure is used in the OARS IADL battery and in the  		most recent version of the PGC-MAI (Lawton et al., no date). The original  		version of the PGC-MAI distinguished between actual performance and current  		capacity. If individuals did not perform an activity, they were asked whether  		they could do so. For some tasks, a question was also included on the reasons a  		client did not perform that task. A somewhat different technique is used in  		COMPASS. A person is asked whether s/he <b>can</b> perform a task and then  		whether s/he receives any help, thus collecting information on both current  		capacity and performance.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="#exhibitIII.2"> Exhibit III.2</a> presents the IADL scales from  		OARS and the original PGC-MAI. They are presented as examples of different  		treatments of current performance and capacity.</p>
<p>The core IADL items clearly have high face validity as measures of  		ability to function independently in the community. Moreover, Lawton and Brody  		(1969) report evidence of validity for their original IADL scale, which  		contained seven "core" items listed above plus laundry, but which was not  		self-report. They found that IADL scale scores were moderately related to other  		measures of functional capacity. Beyond this initial work, there is evidence  		for the validity of the OARS and PGC-MAI assessor ratings based on combined ADL  		and IADL scales. (See the discussion in the previous section of this chapter.)  		Little evidence has been reported on the psychometric properties of the variant  		IADL scales used in other instruments. In some cases, evidence has been  		reported for entire instruments but not for individual scales.</p>
<h3>D. Recommendations</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Physical Activities of Daily Living</i></b></p>
<p> We recommend that the six tasks of the Katz scale--bathing, dressing,  		toileting, transfer, continence and feeding--<b>and</b> walking be included in  		the ADL battery in the client assessment instrument. We recommend these items  		because they are included in the National Minimum Data Set for Long Term Care  		and because the validity of the Katz scale is well established. In addition to  		these items we would add an item on grooming. With the addition of grooming a  		subset of the ADL tasks in the client assessment instrument would be identical  		to the tasks considered in scales known to be reliable in self-report  		instruments with community-resident elderly.</p>
<p> We recommend that the client assessment instrument differentiate  		between mechanical and human assistance for physical ADL. This distinction is  		fundamental to care planning in the demonstration because individuals who need  		only mechanical assistance may bb better able to function independently.  		Moreover, the ability to perform activities of daily living is one of the most  		important outcome measures for the research. It is extremely important that  		this scale be sensitive to changes in functional ability. Existing self-report  		scales for which reliability and validity data are available do not  		differentiate between mechanical and human assistance: therefore, it will be  		necessary to revise the answer coding categories. Because the administration of  		these scales involves assessor coding of a client's answers,<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> revising the precoded answer  		categories should have little or no effect upon validity or reliability.</p>
<p> As we cannot collect valid self-report data on prognosis, we recommend  		that the instrument focus on the ADL tasks the client actually performs and  		those for which s/he currently has the capacity. Both are necessary for care  		planning and for research involving comparisons across setting.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> However, because practitioners  		will also need to form judgments about an individual's prognosis with respect  		to ADL tasks, we can provide a place for these judgments to be recorded on the  		clinical assessment tool.</p>
<p> No existing self-report ADL meets the four criteria of task coverage,  		distinction between mechanical and human assistance, consideration of current  		performance and capacity, and known reliability and validity. Perhaps SAAF  		comes the closest. However, although its ADL tasks overlap with those of other  		scales known to be valid, no evidence is yet available on the psychometric  		properties of the SAAF scale per se.</p>
<p><b><i>2. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living</i></b></p>
<p> Because almost all IADL scales consider the same basic set of tasks and  		because this basic set encompasses the recommendation on adaptive tasks of the  		National Minimum Data. Set on Long Term Care, the major issue in the choice of  		scales is the treatment of actual performance and current capacity. We  		recommend that current performance and capacity be distinguished. The rationale  		for this recommendation is twofold. First, a clear distinction between actual  		performance and current capacity is important to care planning. Practitioners  		need to understand what clients are currently doing as well as what they  		perceive themselves able to do. Second, to evaluate the impact of the  		demonstration, we must compare the capacity of treatment and control group  		members. Because community services will not be available to control group  		members through the demonstration, they are more likely to be institutionalized  		than treatment group members. Because of the limited opportunities within an  		institution, a measure of performance alone is inadequate for comparison of  		functional capacity across setting.</p>
<p> Several existing self-report IADL scales consider both current  		performance and current capacity and include the basic core of IADL tasks. The  		approach that we recommend is to ask current capacity and then ask whether  		someone also is currently performing the task, for the client or whether s/he  		does it her/himself. One advantage of this approach is that it combines in a  		single section the information needed for care planning for household  		maintenance tasks.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p> A research advantage of this approach is that an identical set of  		questions on current capacity is asked of all clients regardless of their sex  		or the setting in which they reside.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="chapIV" id="chapIV">IV. MENTAL FUNCTIONING</a></h2>
<h3>A. Rationale</h3>
<p> Mental health is an important component of overall well-being and  		functional status. Mental functioning is included in the 1948 World Health  		Organization definition of health, is a component of most existing  		multidimensional functional assessment instruments and is included in the  		National Minimum Data Set for Long Term Care (U.S. Committee On Vital and  		Health Statistics, 1979). Although nearly everyone would agree that mental  		functioning is significant, there are many different perspectives on how mental  		functioning is best conceptualized and, hence, measured.</p>
<h3>B. The Concept of Mental Health</h3>
<p> One issue in conceptualizing mental health is the distinction between  		<b>assessment of mental functioning</b> (i.e., the extent to which cognitive or  		affective impairments impede role performance and subjective life quality) and  		<b>psychiatric diagnosis</b>. While diagnosis may reflect etiology better than  		assessment of functioning, there is considerable evidence that functional  		status is more predictive of role performance, subjective life quality, social  		relationships, and service utilization. Also relevant for the purposes at hand,  		short batteries of questions administered by trained, but nonprofessional  		interviewers are better able to tap mental functioning than to meet complex  		diagnostic criteria for the identification of specific psychiatric disorders.  		The appropriate emphasis for the National Long Term Care Demonstration  		Evaluation, therefore, is assessment of mental functioning rather than  		psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p> Given that mental functioning is the appropriate focus, it is still  		necessary to define its conceptual boundaries. One relevant issue is scope: may  		mental illness/mental health be viewed as a continuum ranging from impairment  		to superior or optimal functioning? Most available empirical evidence suggests  		this is not the case. Bradburn (1969), for example, has demonstrated that  		negative and positive affect may be distinct and independent dimensions rather  		than opposite ends of a single continuum. Similarly, cognitive and affective  		aspects of mental functioning are not on a single dimension.</p>
<p> Mental functioning must be clearly distinguished from other functional  		dimensions, in particular from social functioning and physical health. Mental  		functioning and social functioning can be conceptually and empirically  		distinguished so long as affective evaluations of social functioning are  		clearly and exclusively phrased in terms of social relationships. The potential  		overlap between mental functioning and physical health reflects the fact that  		psychological problems often are manifested and experienced as somatic  		complaints (see, for example, Langner and Michael, 1963). The same symptoms  		(for instance, headaches, weight loss, nausea) may represent either physical or  		mental problems or an intertwining of the two. Although a substantial research  		tradition suggests that these psychosomatic symptoms can be effectively  		distinguished from physical problems, there is also considerable evidence that  		physical problems are frequently misdiagnosed as psychological disorders.  		Special care must be taken when using symptom scales; but if appropriately  		used, mental functioning can be conceptually and empirically distinguished,  		with some confidence, from physical functioning.</p>
<h3>C. Aspects of Mental Health</h3>
<p> Four specific aspects of mental functioning appear most frequently in  		the literature, and are candidates for inclusion in the assessment  		instrument.</p>
<ol><li>cognitive or organic function </li>
<li>disturbance of mood or affect </li>
<li>psychological well-being </li>
<li>behavior problems.</li>
</ol><p>All are recommended in the National Minimum Data Set for Long Term  		Care.</p>
<p> Cognitive function is particularly important in evaluating the mental  		functioning of older people, for whom rates of organic impairment are the  		highest in the population. It typically is manifested by disorientation, short-  		or long-term memory loss, and reduced or lost ability to perform cognitive  		tasks (for example, simple arithmetic). Disturbance of mood involves such  		common affective disorders or dysfunction as depression and anxiety, which are  		typically measured by multi-item symptom checklists. Psychological well-being  		refers to reports of positive mental functioning and is typically manifested in  		terms of morale, life satisfaction, or similar constructs. Behavior problems  		refer to behaviors judged to be unsuitable or disruptive to normal patterns of  		action and assumed to reflect psychological problems, for example disrobing,  		exposing oneself, screaming, physical abuse, hoarding and stealing, wandering  		off, hallucinating, hostility, expressions of paranoia, among others.</p>
<p> For the purposes of the National Long Term Care Demonstration  		Evaluation, we recommend that three aspects of mental functioning be assessed  		directly: cognitive function, disturbance of mood, and psychological  		well-being. Assessment of behavior problems is much more problematic for our  		purposes. First, because such behaviors are distinct, it is necessary to ask  		specific questions about each. Yet because each is relatively infrequent, items  		related to any one behavior would apply to only a very small fraction of the  		population being assessed. Second, we must rely on self-report data but the  		quality of self-report data on many of these behaviors is open to serious  		question.</p>
<h3>D. Measuring Cognitive Functioning</h3>
<p> The available brief screening instruments to measure basic cognitive  		abilities contain very similar items, their differences generally reflect the  		expected level of impairment in the individual being assessed.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> Some are self-report and some  		rely on ratings by those in contact with the subject. Among the self-report  		instruments the Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ), developed by Kahn, Goldfarb  		et al. (1960) and the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) are by  		far the most widely used. <a href="#exhibitIV.1">Exhibit IV.1</a> presents  		these scales.</p>
<p> The MSQ consists of ten objective items for which there are clearly  		correct and incorrect answers. These items tap fundamental aspects of short-  		and long-term memory and orientation. Scoring is straightforward in that the  		number of incorrect answers is simply summed to yield a total score. The MSQ  		has been used in hundreds of studies, ranging from clinical diagnostic trials  		to surveys of entire populations. The reliability and validity of the MSQ are  		well documented (see Gurland, 1980).<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> The MSQ includes items on the names of the  		current and past U.S. presidents to tap awareness of current events and memory  		for more distant events. Although the latter questions occur in a number of  		mental status tests, some suggest that these items are irrelevant to many  		elderly individuals, especially to those residing in institutions.</p>
<p> The SPMSQ, developed by Pfeiffer (1975; Duke-OARS, 1978) is a  		modification of the MSQ. It, too, contains ten objective items that are simply  		summed. Four items are exactly the same in the two instruments, three items are  		essentially the same, and three items differ. Scoring procedures for the SPMSQ  		differ depending on the race and educational level of the respondent. In  		addition to items on orientation and memory from the MSQ, the SPMSQ considers  		remote memory (mother's maiden name) and mathematical ability. The SPMSQ is  		somewhat more difficult than the MSQ; for example, the subject must know day,  		month, and year to score any points on date or birthdate. Despite its greater  		difficulty, the SPMSQ generates a full range of scores even among the  		institutionalized.</p>
<p> Both the MSQ and the SPMSQ appear to be adequate measures of organic  		functioning--both are brief, easily administered and scored, and  		psychometrically adequate. Two recent studies--a comprehensive review of  		assessment measures by Gurland (1980) and an empirical study comparing the MSQ  		and SPMSQ (particularly the discriminability of the two measures) reported by  		Tillenbaum (1980)--conclude that the two instruments are equally sound.  		However, for use in the National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation, we  		recommend the MSQ. The chief disadvantage of the SPMSQ is that mother's maiden  		name would not normally be available to assessors, preventing them from readily  		validating responses to this item and deriving a score for the scale.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> Use of the MSQ <b>does</b>  		require that assessors know the respondent's birthdate. To ensure that it is  		available for all respondents, we recommend that this information be included  		in the screening instrument and supplied to the assessor.</p>
<p> In some instruments (e.g., PGC-MAI, Havens and Thompson, 1971) the  		items of the MSQ are dispersed to a greater or lesser degree. The avowed  		purpose of this is to make the scale seem less test-like and intrusive. We  		recommend that the MSQ not be dispersed. While there is anecdotal evidence that  		interviewers (who are not practitioners) prefer to administer a dispersed  		version,<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup>  		practitioners with whom we discussed this issue agreed that from the standpoint  		of establishing trust in a relationship with a client, it was far better to  		identify the scale as a test that provides important information, and ask the  		respondent's cooperation in completing it.</p>
<p> We also recommend that the MSQ be placed well into the body of the  		instrument and administered after rapport has been established between the  		respondent and the assessor. We do not recommend its use as a screen because a  		poor score on the MSQ does not necessarily imply that an individual is unable  		to answer most or all of the questions. For example, someone who suffers from  		disorientation with respect to time or place, may still be able to answer  		questions about his/her attitudes and feelings. When a respondent seems  		confused, we prefer to have assessors attempt the interview, concentrating on  		the questions that cannot be appropriately addressed to a proxy respondent.  		This approach is respectful of the individual and has the advantage of limiting  		missing data to the maximum possible extent. The fact that an interviewer  		viewed certain responses as unreliable could be indicated in the  		instrument.</p>
<h3>E. Measuring Psychological Well-Being</h3>
<p> Various terms are used to describe a positive constellation of  		attitudes toward oneself and one's relationship with the external world. These  		include happiness, morale, life satisfaction, contentment, personal adjustment,  		and subjective well-being. Although these terms have slightly different  		connotations, there have been few attempts to specify the theoretical domains  		of the concepts involved. Neugarten, Havighurst, and Tobin (1961) is an  		exception; these authors attempted to specify the theoretical domains of life  		satisfaction. They hypothesized that the essential aspects of a positive mental  		state were mood, tone, zest, congruence, resolution, and  		self-concept.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup> Lawton  		(1977) differentiated twelve domains within well-being. These are:</p>
<ol><li> life satisfaction</li>
<li> happiness </li>
<li> mood</li>
<li> age-related morale </li>
<li> continuity of self </li>
<li> positive self-concept</li>
<li> intrapsychic symptoms</li>
<li> psychophysiological and somatic symptoms </li>
<li> self-rated health</li>
<li> satisfaction with the status quo</li>
<li> attitudes</li>
<li> loneliness.</li>
</ol><p>As these lists of hypothesized domains within well-being suggest that  		measures of psychological well-being can be criticized as diffuse amalgamations  		of several concepts.</p>
<p> Serious attention has been paid to the psychometric properties of two  		measures of psychological well-being widely used with the elderly. These are  		the Life Satisfaction Index A (LSIA) (Neugarten, Havighurst, and Tobin, 1961)  		and the Philadelphia Geriatric Center (PGC) Morale Scale (Lawton,  		1972).<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> The Life  		Satisfaction Index was designed to be "relatively independent of level of  		social activity and participation." (Neugarten, Havighurst, and Tobin, 1961).  		This is advantageous because social functioning is also to be measured in the  		National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation and non-overlapping measures  		of these two domains are desirable. However, two recent reviewers of measures  		of subjective well-being (Sauer and Warland, in press; and Kane and Kane, in  		press), question whether reliability or validity has been adequately  		established for the LSIA.</p>
<p> The PGC Morale Scale has been subjected to factor analysis using a  		number of samples. The original scale (Lawton 1972) contained 22 items and six  		factors. overall test-retest reliabilities for two samples were 0.75 and 0.80,  		although the reliabilities for some of the factors were considerably lower.  		Further factor analysis using three independent samples by Morris and Sherwood  		(1975) and Lawton (1975) identified three scales (measuring agitation, attitude  		toward own aging, and lonely dissatisfaction) in shorter 15- and 17-item  		scales. However, Gilford (1980) was unable to replicate these three factors  		with a sample of elderly more frail than the earlier samples.</p>
<p> Both the LSIA and the PGC Morale scale contain items which refer  		specifically to the age of the respondent. For example, the PGC Morale Scale  		includes the items "I am as happy now as when I was younger" and "As you get  		older, you are less useful," and the LSIA includes "I feel old and tired," and  		"I feel my age, but it doesn't bother me." Because impaired individuals under  		65 are eligible for the National Long Term Care Demonstration, the  		appropriateness of such age-related items may be questioned. However, both  		scales have been successfully administered to younger age groups. In fact, a  		shortened form of the Life Satisfaction Index (LSIZ), which included  		age-related items, was administered to a national sample of persons 18 years of  		age and older (Harris, 1975).</p>
<p> Upon reviewing all this evidence, there is little reason to favor  		either the LSIA or the PGC-Morale Scale over the other as the best measure of  		overall life satisfaction. Two factors lead us to recommend the LSIA. First, we  		are seeking an overall measure of psychological well-being. Lawton (1977) has  		argued that the LSIA is preferred when interest is in a single general measure,  		and the PGC Morale Scale preferred when interest centers on separate dimensions  		of morale. Second, the 17-item version of the PGC-Morale scale and the morale  		scale used in the PGC-MAI contain items that involve loneliness, that is, a  		subjective evaluation of social functioning.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> For purposes of the research, we would  		prefer that the measures of mental and social functioning be as distinct as  		possible.</p>
<h3>F. Measuring Disturbance of Mood</h3>
<p> Lawton (1977) has defined mood as "time-limited happiness or  		unhappiness." Mood represents a somewhat longer time period than an emotion,  		but a shorter period than "temperament" or "personality." Nor does mood have  		the implication of generality of the latter two terms. This is related to the  		distinction between a "trait" and a "state." A trait measure is concerned with  		a condition that is stable for a considerable period of time, whereas a state  		measure is concerned with an immediate emotion (Levitt and Lubin, 1975). For  		the research purpose of measuring the impact of channeling, it is not  		appropriate to measure personality traits. These are unlikely to be affected by  		the experiment.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> Nor  		is it appropriate to consider fleeting emotions because these do not provide  		information about the life quality of an individual. Our measures of mood  		should address an intermediate time period.</p>
<p> As Salzman et al., (1972) point out, because mood is a private  		experience, it can be reported accurately only by a cooperative subject. Among  		the elderly, cooperation is more likely if the scale is brief, clearly stated,  		and relevant to the respondent's circumstances.</p>
<p> Although there are a number of inventories to measure mood states,  		depression, and anxiety, many are lengthy or difficult to administer and not  		appropriate for studies of elderly patients (Salzman et al., 1972). The  		self-report mood scales most widely used with the elderly are the Zung  		Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and the depression  		items from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. <a href="#exhibitIV.3">Exhibit  		IV.3</a> presents these scales.</p>
<p> As originally proposed, the Zung and Beck scales are keyed quite  		closely to the somatic symptoms of depression, while the Hopkins places minimal  		emphasis on clinical symptoms. Because we wish, for research purposes, to  		distinguish between physical and mental health, the inclusion of somatic items  		is a disadvantage of the Zung scale and the Beck scale as originally proposed.  		However, the shortened form of the Beck, developed by Sherwood and her  		collegues (Sherwood et al., 1977) does not contain somatic items.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p> A difficulty with the Hopkins scale is that it includes an item on loss  		of sexual energy. There is little information on whether loss of sexual libido  		is associated with depression among the elderly (Kane and Kane, in press).  		Moreover, this item may be problematic for the institutionalized elderly, who  		often have restricted opportunity for sexual experience. There seems to be no  		information on the properties of the Hopkins scale when this item is excluded.  		In addition, the Hopkins includes a measure on loneliness, so that it would  		overlap with affective assessment of social functioning as we define it in  		<a href="#chapV">Chapter V</a>.</p>
<p> As originally suggested, the Beck scale was difficult to administer and  		likely to be fatiguing for the elderly. However, Sherwood and her colleagues  		have suggested seven-item and three-item short forms (Sherwood et al., 1977),  		and Gallagher (1979) has suggested simplified wording for oral  		administration.</p>
<p> Given the criteria of lack of overlap with other domains,  		appropriateness to an elderly population, and ease of administration and  		brevity, we conclude that the three-item form of the Beck scale using  		simplified wording is most appropriate for the purposes of the National Long  		Term Care Demonstration Evaluation.</p>
<p> Up to this point, we have been considering measures of depression. We  		also recommend that a measure of anxiety be included in the client assessment  		instrument. A major goal of the demonstration is to meet individuals' needs for  		services; it seems reasonable that they will be less anxious as a result of  		having those needs met. There are several anxiety scales to chose from, or one  		might select the anxiety items from a more general measure such as the Hopkins  		Symptom Checklist or the Langner 22-item scale (1962). One attractive  		alternative is the anxiety scale developed by the Rand Corporation for the  		Health Insurance Study (HIS). To illustrate the types of items in an anxiety  		scale, we present the Rand HIS anxiety scale in <a href="#exhibitIV.4">Exhibit  		IV.4</a>. There are two major advantages of this scale. First, its psychometric  		properties have been studied and it has adequate reliability and validity.  		Second it was developed in conjunction with a depression scale and the items in  		the two scales are empirically distinct (Brook et al., 1979; Ware, 1979). A  		disadvantage of the Rand anxiety scale is that it has been used with the adult  		population including some elderly, but not with the very old or frail. In  		addition, the Rand scale was designed as a self-administered battery. Because  		the answer categories are lengthy, altering it for oral administration would be  		difficult.</p>
<p> A specific recommendation on an anxiety measure must await further  		review of existing measures. Among the criteria to be used in the selection of  		a scale would be ease of administration and brevity.</p>
<h3>G. Measuring Problems Manifested in Interpersonal  		Relationships</h3>
<p> Most scales to measure behavior problems (disrobing/exposing oneself,  		screaming, and so forth) require the ratings of observers who are familiar with  		the individuals' typical behaviors. While practitioners in the National Long  		Term Care Demonstration Evaluation will often be able to question a client's  		caregiver, this will not be the case for the interviewers of the control group  		members. Consequently, rating scales on behavior problems are inappropriate for  		the standardized client assessment instrument.</p>
<p> As Lawton and Kleban (1979) point out, there is no good self-report  		instrument that efficiently detects serious behavior problems. They suggest  		that it may be necessary to leave determination of behavior problems to  		clinical procedures. Because of the number of separate problems involved, many  		questions would be needed to tap them in a self-report instrument. Moreover, it  		is likely that some respondents would be alienated by the content of these  		questions.</p>
<p> Although we do not recommend an attempt to capture serious behavior  		problems within the client assessment instrument, it would be possible to ask  		assessors to note, on the basis of their observation during the interview,  		whether the respondent was dirty, odorous, poorly groomed or untidily dressed.  		Because these observations do not involve clinical judgment, it is appropriate  		for these data to be recorded for the control group. Problems such as those  		with cleanliness and grooming may strain interpersonal relationships and be  		important factors in the decisions of families to seek institutionalization. We  		recommend that such data be collected.</p>
<h3>H. Stressful Life Events</h3>
<p> Stressful life events are often associated with declines in emotional,  		social, or physical functioning. In some instances they may trigger such  		declines, in others the events reflect a combination of deteriorating health or  		circumstances or aggravate pre-existing conditions. Whatever the causal  		relationships, such events clearly represent an important risk factor that  		should be identified both for research and care planning purposes. At the  		extreme, stressful events such as the death of a spouse can trigger a chain of  		circumstances that leads to institutionalization or death. The association of  		such events with changes in service needs also makes them of interest from a  		research perspective.</p>
<p> We recommend that an inventory of recent stressful life events be  		included in the client assessment instrument. Respondents would be asked  		whether any of to events listed had happened to them in the past year. In the  		interest of brevity, we recommend that the checklist focus on events that can  		be particularly stressful including:</p>
<ul><li>death of spouse</li>
<li>major injury or illness</li>
<li>death of close family member or friend </li>
<li>divorce or separation </li>
<li>relocation or retirement.</li>
</ul><h3>I. Recommendations</h3>
<p> We recommend that the client assessment instrument include measures of  		three aspects of mental functioning: cognitive functioning, psychological  		well-being, and disturbance of mood. The latter would involve measures of  		depression and anxiety. We do not recommend the inclusion of measures of  		serious behavior problems--the other aspect of mental functioning frequently  		considered in the literature. The quality of self-reported information on these  		behaviors is open to serious question and numerous items are required to  		address the variety of possible problems. Nevertheless, assessors can observe a  		limited number of less serious behavior problems which may strain interpersonal  		relations and be a factor in decisions to seek institutionalization.</p>
<p> As a measure of cognitive functioning, we recommend the MSQ. It is  		reliable and valid, brief, and easily administered. We do not recommend that it  		be dispersed, but rather placed well into the body of the instrument so that it  		is administered after rapport has been established between the respondent and  		the assessor.</p>
<p> There is little reason to favor either the LSIA or the PGC Morale Scale  		as a measure of psychological well-being. We recommend the LSIA because we are  		seeking a global measure of psychological well-being, and it is the more  		general of the too. Moreover, in the forms used by Lawton, the PGC Morale Scale  		contains items on loneliness that overlap with subjective assessment of social  		functioning, a separate domain of well-being that we prefer to distinguish.</p>
<p> We recommend the three-item form of the Beck Depression Inventory as a  		measure of depression. It does not contain any items on somatic complaints that  		could result in confounding of the domains for physical and mental health.  		Although the original version of the Beck was difficult to administer, it has  		been simplified for oral administration. We recommend that a measure of anxiety  		be included in the client assessment instrument; however, further review is  		required before a specific recommendation can be made. The criteria to be used  		in selecting an anxiety scale include brevity and ease of administration.</p>
<p> Although this may not necessarily be the case, recent stressful life  		events are frequently associated with emotional problems. In any event,  		knowledge of such events are critical to care planning and should be quite  		useful in the research. We propose that major stressful life events be  		inventoried, using a checklist format.</p>
<p> Finally, although not discussed in this report, we are considering  		recommending that the instrument include measures of coping and sense of  		security about the future. We are interested in coping styles because they may  		be important in decisions about service utilization. We are interested in sense  		of security about the future because it seems reasonable to hypothesize that by  		supplying needed service, channeling will relieve concern about future welfare.  		However, from the perspectives of both theory and measurement, the state of the  		art is much less well advanced for these variables than for the other aspects  		of mental health considered in this chapter. Consequently, without further  		review we cannot recommend the inclusion of measures of coping and security  		about the future.</p>

<h3>A. The Importance of Social Health</h3>
<p> There is no consensus regarding the importance of including a social  		functioning dimension on multidimensional functional assessment  		instruments--let alone consensus about the form such a module might take.  		Although the majority of multidimensional assessment instruments currently  		available do include such questions (e.g., OARS, PGC-MAI, COMPASS), some do not  		include social functioning items (e.g., Reynolds et al., 1974) or include only  		one or two relevant items, with those items being insufficient for  		consideration as a separate dimension (e.g., PACE II). Most notably, perhaps,  		the task force that developed the National Minimum Data Set for Long-Term Care  		failed to recommend inclusion of social functioning items (U.S. National  		Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, 1979).</p>
<p> Given this lack of consensus, it is prudent to consider briefly the  		rationale for including a social functioning dimension in assessment  		instruments. There are several reasons. First, it is by now clear that  		meaningful and satisfying social interaction is a major component of the  		quality of life for most older people (see, Lemon et al., 1972). Second, social  		support networks contribute many tangible services to impaired older persons.  		They provide a high proportion of all care (Comptroller General, 1977), often  		serving as the critical factor permitting an impaired older person to remain in  		the community (Lowenthal, 1964, Lowenthal and Robinson, 1976), and, in general,  		reduce the burden upon publicly provided services. Third, there is considerable  		evidence that social functioning, especially social support, is related to the  		utilization of service programs by older adults (see, for example, Sussman,  		1976). In the language of health service researchers, social support is an  		"enabling factor" that contributes to service utilization patterns, independent  		of service need. Fourth, existing studies suggest that social functioning is  		significantly related to (but conceptually and empirically distinct from) other  		dimensions of functional status (see, for example, Brook at al., 1979;  		Duke-OARS, 1978; Moss et al., 1978). However, measures of mental health do not  		capture social health intentionally or directly. Finally, service programs  		often influence dimensions of functioning other than those which they are  		specifically designed to affect. Some health services, for example, undoubtedly  		facilitate social functioning; others may unwittingly hinder it. If we are to  		identify and evaluate the total impact of service programs, multidimensional  		assessment, including assessment of social functioning, is merited.</p>
<h3>B. Aspects of Social Functioning</h3>
<p> Social functioning is a multidimensional concept and traditionally has  		been conceptualized and measured in a multidimensional manner. As Donald at al.  		(1978) note, most measures of social functioning emerge from one of two  		research traditions. The first tradition focuses specifically upon social  		functioning, excluding notions of functional status in a broader sense. The  		second tradition focuses upon social functioning as one component of functional  		status more broadly defined. For our purposes, the second tradition is more  		relevant.</p>
<p> Because research investigators in the first tradition are not concerned  		with other areas of functioning, they need not and typically have not worried  		about maintaining conceptual and empirical distinctions between social  		functioning and other functional dimensions. For example, many of these  		instruments have measured social functioning in terms of the capacity to meet  		role obligations and engage in preferred activities. This emphasis on capacity  		is difficult to separate from the content of many instruments that measure  		ability to perform activities of daily living. Thus, different dimensions of  		well-being may be confounded. In addition, investigators developing and using  		measures exclusively focused on social functioning often have had the luxury of  		measuring social functioning in considerable depth, with the need to collect  		few additional data. Consequently, the specific measures of social functioning  		tend to be long and conceptually complex. Blazer (1980), for example, has  		recently conceptualized social support as including nine dimensions and  		developed an eighty-item questionnaire to measure them.</p>
<p> For the purposes of this project, it is important that the measure of  		social functioning be conceptually and empirically distinct from other  		functional domains and that the battery of questions be brief. For these  		reasons, previous research in which social functioning is measured in the  		context of a multidimensional functional asessment instrument is more  		useful.</p>
<p> Three aspects of social functioning frequently appear in the relevant  		literature. Although these three aspects are conceptually distinct, they often  		are not measured as separate dimensions. The first, and most commonly used  		aspect of social functioning is <b>social interaction</b> or <b>social  		participation</b>. This concept is typically viewed as an objective indicator  		of social functioning and measured in terms of the frequency of interpersonal  		contacts and participation in social groups. It is generally assumed that more  		social interaction is better than less. Nonetheless, we are aware of no  		empirical demonstration that shows the relationship between social interaction  		and an outcome measure to be essentially linear, with increased interaction  		consistently related to a more positive outcome. Nor is there empirical  		evidence of a threshold or cut-point that discriminates "impaired" from  		"unimpaired" social interaction levels. Because social functioning is heavily  		value laden, it is essential to discriminate socially valued behavior patterns  		from factors <b>empirically</b> related to functional status.</p>
<p> Although there are a number of conceptual problems with measures of the  		frequency of interaction, it is important to note that this measure does  		identify those who are socially isolated. Isolation is a major risk factor  		related to institutionalization and a critical factor in care planning.</p>
<p> The second aspect of social interaction receiving widespread attention  		is <b>social support</b> which typically is defined as the availability of  		significant others who provide both tangible services and emotional  		sustenance--or would do so in times of need. Again, the literature is  		contradictory on the issue of how much social support is enough. Some authors  		argue that the greater the density and extensivity of the social support  		network, the better (e.g., Blazer, 1980). Other investigators claim that "one  		versus none" is the critical issue.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p> A third, and less common, aspect of social functioning is the  		individual's <b>affective or qualitative assessment</b> of his/her social  		functioning. The importance of this aspect of social functioning is clear when  		one considers that the quantity of social interaction is not the same as its  		quality. Most instruments considering affective assessment measure such  		perceptions as satisfaction with amount of social interaction, satisfaction  		with quality of interaction, and feelings of loneliness. Items related to  		qualitative assessment of social functioning, especially with respect to  		loneliness, are sometimes included in measures of affective mental health,  		although it is possible to distinguish affective assessment of social health  		from mental health by ensuring that item content focuses on social  		relationships. It is important to note in this regard that being alone does not  		imply that one is lonely and that loneliness is not necessarily emotionally  		debilitating.</p>
<p> We recommend that these three aspects of social functioning--social  		interaction, social support, and affective assessment of social functioning--be  		included in the client assessment instrument.</p>
<p> In addition to the three aspects of social functioning discussed above,  		some measures of social health also include measures of activities, typically  		involving checklists of leisure time activities. From a theoretical standpoint,  		such measures are problematic for several reasons. First, although some of the  		activities involved are social activities, others are not, and the rationale  		for considering them in the context of social behavior is suspect. In fact,  		Lawton separates activities (which he terms effectance) from social behavior  		(Lawton, 1972; Lawton and Kleban, 1979). Second, measurement in this area is  		almost totally undeveloped.</p>
<p> One obvious problem is that the number of possible activities is very  		large and only a small proportion can be included in a list. Finally, there has  		been little or no theoretical progress made toward understanding the values and  		sources of satisfaction associated with different activities.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> Such understanding would inform  		the development of a list of basic activities. Because of these conceptual and  		measurement problems, we do not plan to include an objective level measure as  		an outcome variable for the research.<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup> On the other band, clinicians may often find  		it useful to have information on dissatisfaction with current activity level  		and we recommend that an item be included to identify those individuals.</p>
<h3>C. Social Functioning and the Purposes of the  		Project</h3>
<p> For the purposes of the National Long Term Care Demonstration  		Evaluation, social support is far more significant than the other two aspects  		of social support that we recommend be included. One of the major issues in the  		research is the effect of channeling on the informal provision of services.  		With publicly provided services available, a family might tend to reduce the  		level of assistance it provides in favor of public services. On the other hand,  		public services might provide the support a family needs to maintain an elderly  		member in the community; without such services the burden upon the family might  		be so great that it would be forced to choose institutionalization.</p>
<p> In <a href="#chapVII">Chapter VII</a> we consider the services that  		family and friends are currently providing. The quantity of assistance and the  		relationship of the caregiver to the elderly individual will be collected on a  		service-specific basis for a large number of services. In addition to this  		service-specific data, we recommend in <a href="#chapVII">Chapter VII</a> that  		some information be collected from the elderly respondent on the  		characteristics of the three persons <b>currently</b> providing the most  		informal care. We recommend that this caregiver-specific information include  		the geographical proximity, sex, family structure, and employment status of the  		caregiver. This information will help us to characterize the other  		responsibilities of the caregiver and evaluate--the burden associated with  		providing informal services.</p>
<p> In <a href="#chapVII">Chapter VII</a> we consider services  		<b>currently</b> provided by family and friends; in the present chapter, we  		consider <b>potential</b> assistance from these sources, including both  		tangible service and emotional support.</p>
<p> Beyond social support, measures of the other-aspects of social  		functioning are important to the demonstration as well. Affective perception of  		one's social functioning is an important measure of quality of life and an  		outcome measure for the research. Both Campbell, Converse, and Rogers (1976)  		and Andrews and Withey (1976) find that there is a substantial relationship  		between overall life satisfaction and satisfaction with relationships with  		family and friends. Moreover, practitioners will want to identify those  		individuals with little social interaction and those who are dissatisfied with  		their level of social interaction so that increased social interaction can be  		provided as part of the care plan if that seems appropriate.</p>
<h3>D. Measuring Social Functioning</h3>
<p> The choice of a scale or set of subscales to measure social functioning  		depends to a large extent on the time within the interview to be devoted to  		social health. Quite detailed and specific measures of social interaction and  		affective assessment of that interaction are available in instruments which use  		a social network approach. For example, the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for  		the Aged (HRCA) Social Interaction Inventory (Sherwood et al., 1977) considers  		social interaction with friends, children, siblings, grandchildren and other  		relatives, and affective assessment of that interaction. A short form of the  		HRCA inventory (sea <a href="#exhibitV.1">Exhibit V.1</a>) has been developed  		which collapses some of the questions and does not consider siblings and  		grandchildren separately. The Adult Isolation Index (Tee and Granick [Bennett],  		1960; Weinstock and Bennett, 1971; Bennett, 1973a, 1973b) uses a similar  		general approach. Patterns of isolation (past and present) are tapped in terms  		of different types of social contact (for example, children, siblings,  		organizations). One variation of this scale has been incorporated into CARE  		(Garland et al., 1977). In some instruments differential weights are  		arbitrarily assigned to various types of social contact. This is the procedure  		for the Cummings and Henry (1961) Lifespace measure, and it is followed by  		Ravens and Thompson (1976). The latter instrument is presented in  		<a href="#exhibitV.1">Exhibit V.1</a>.</p>
<p> The PGC-MAI takes a somewhat different approach. Respondents are asked  		to name relatives (besides those living with them) with whom they feel close.  		Questions on frequency of interaction are asked for each of those named. In  		addition, two general questions on affective assessment of social functioning  		are included in a morale scale.</p>
<p> Yet another approach to assessing functional health is exemplified by  		OARS (see <a href="#exhibitV.1">Exhibit V.1</a>) and <b>Health Care Needs of  		the Elderly and Chronically Disabled</b> by Branch and Fowler (1975). This  		approach uses general questions on social interaction and affective assessment  		of interaction rather than repeating similar questions for different groups or  		named individuals.</p>
<p> Despite the similarity in the approaches used in some instruments,  		there is much diversity within the instruments themselves. Lawton and Kleban  		(1979) suggest that researchers have tended to create new instruments in this  		area because of dissatisfaction with existing ones, but their efforts have not  		resulted in much improvement. Typically, they resort to analysis of single-item  		indicators. What is more, Lawton and Kleban (1979) argue that the current state  		of the art in the measurement of social functioning is "totally chaotic".</p>
<p> Given the many demands on the client assessment instrument, and the  		limited time available for its administration, these difficulties in  		measurement suggest that the scale chosen to access social participation and  		affective assessment of social functioning should be brief. Because the issue  		of social support is so important in the demonstration, we do not recommend  		that the number of items tapping this aspect of social functioning also be  		minimized.</p>
<p> Among the brief scales on social participation and affective assessment  		of social functioning, those of the OARS are by far the most widely used. Data  		are available on the reliability and validity of the OARS social battery items.  		The validity data consist of comparisons of social battery scores with the  		independent evaluations of seven clinicians (psychiatrists and social workers).  		There are no significant differences between the questionnaire scores and  		clinicians' rating (Fillenbaum and Symer, in press). However, internal  		consistency reliability for the social participation and affective assessment  		scales was only marginally adequate, 0.66 and 0.70, respectively (Comptroller  		General, 1977). In these circumstances it would be desirable, for research  		purposes, to add a limited number of items to these subscales to increase their  		reliability.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> One  		attractive potential addition to the affective assessment subscale is the item  		in Branch and Fowler (1975) on satisfaction with frequency of contact with a  		confidante.</p>
<p> Turning to the measurement of potential social support, three types of  		information are important.</p>
<p> First, whether the respondent is married and with whom s/he lives.  		There is no need to collect fine detail on the exact relationship of other  		individuals in the household. Rather, we recommend coding usual living  		arrangements in the manner recommended in the National Minimum Data Set for  		Long Term Care, with the exception that the codes pertaining to other relatives  		be expanded to consider whether an individual lives with his (her) spouse,  		children, or parents. Thus, we recommend the following codes for usual living  		arrangements:</p>
<ul><li>living alone</li>
<li>living in a household with spouse only</li>
<li>living in a household with spouse and children</li>
<li>living in a household with spouse and other relatives</li>
<li>living in a household with children</li>
<li>living in a household with other relatives</li>
<li>living in a household with spouse and parents</li>
<li>living in a household with parents</li>
<li>living in a household with non-relatives</li>
<li>living in group quarters other than a health-related facility.</li>
</ul><p> Second, because children are likely to be a primary source of potential  		support, the number of children, if any, should be ascertained as well as the  		number living close enough to the respondent to provide assistance.</p>
<p> Third, friends, neighbors and other relatives may also be a source of  		assistance.</p>
<p> We recommend that respondents be asked whether there is anyone other  		than their children who could be called on for assistance and, if so, the  		relationship of these individuals to the respondent. We are aware that this  		approach may result in defensive responses. However, this information should be  		a useful addition to that on children.</p>
<h3>E. Recommendations</h3>
<p> We recommend that three aspects of social functioning be measured in  		the client assessment instruments social participation, social support, and  		affective assessment of social functioning. Of these, social support is the  		most important because a major issue in the National Long-Term Care  		Demonstration Evaluation is the impact of channeling on the provision of  		assistance by family and friends. Furthermore, information on social support  		networks is quite important in care planning. Affective assessment of social  		functioning is important because it is associated with life quality and is an  		outcome measure the research. Practitioners will also be interested in  		identifying individuals who have little social participation or who are  		dissatisfied with their social functioning, so that these needs can be taken  		into account in care planning.</p>
<p> We recommend that the three basic types of information related to  		social support be collected: first, information on marital status and household  		structures second, information on total number of children and number of  		children in close geographical proximity; third, information on the  		relationship of other individuals the respondent indicates would be willing to  		provide assistance, if necessary.</p>
<p> We recommend that very brief scales be used to assess social  		participation and affective assessment of social functioning. Detailed  		information about these areas is unnecessary for purposes of this project.  		Recommendations on specific scales for this aspect of social functioning must  		await further review.</p>

<h3>A. Rationale</h3>
<p>It is important to consider the physical environment in an assessment of  		functioning because, as Lawton (1970) pointed out, different environments make  		different demands upon the competencies of individuals. For example, the fact  		that the living and sleeping areas of a home are on different floors would pose  		no problem for most people, but would be a serious impediment for someone who  		had difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Practitioners must consider  		environmental demands in assessing community-based care and to determine the  		need for modifying the environment to overcome architectural barriers to  		independent functioning.</p>
<p>The interaction of a person with his (her) environment extends beyond  		physical competency to include the congruence of an individual's preferences  		and expectations with the demands of the environment. This concept of  		person-environment fit (to use the phrase of Kahana (1974]),<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup> is important to practitioners  		concerned with care planning that involves a move to a different setting or  		efforts to help individuals overcome problems with their environments. Measures  		of the physical environment are important to researchers in the National Long  		Term Care Demonstration Evaluation because, as Lawton and Nahemov (1973) and  		Carp (1977) argue, the physical environment is an important aspect of quality  		of life. This is confirmed by the empirical work of Campbell, Converse and  		Rogers (1976) and Andrews and Withey (1976) who found moderate correlations  		between measures of several aspects of the physical environment (housing,  		community, security from crime) and a global measure of life satisfaction.  		Given that individual expectations and preferences about physical environments  		can differ greatly, subjective measures of the environment (that is,  		self-perceptions) are at least as relevant, if not more relevant than objective  		measures. The social aspects of living arrangements (marital status, people in  		household) were considered in <a href="#chapV">Chapter V</a>. The physical  		aspects of living arrangements are considered in this chapter.</p>
<h3>B. Measuring the Physical Environment</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Issues in Measuring the Physical Environment</i></b></p>
<p>There are two major issues that bear on the selection or design of a  		measure of the physical environment for the National Long Term Care  		Demonstration Evaluation: the state of the art in theory and measurement, and  		the lack of measures applicable to more than one setting.</p>
<p>The state of the art in the theory and measurement of the physical  		environment is not far advanced. After reviewing instrumentation on the  		adjustment of the elderly to their environments, Windley (in press) concludes  		that most of the methodologies are too narrowly focused and bound to a single  		discipline and that no consensus has developed on a theoretical framework for  		inquiry. There is substantial question about which aspects of the physical  		environment are important and the validity of measures to capture them.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the instruments concerned with the physical  		environments of the elderly are setting-specific. It is very difficult to make  		measures relevant to more than one setting. Yet, as Anderson and Patten (in  		press) point out, optimal measures for evaluating alternate approaches to long  		term care would be applicable in multiple settings, so that the same measures  		could be used without bias. This issue is important in the National Long Term  		Care Demonstration Evaluation because the analysis of the impact of channeling  		fundamentally involves comparison of treatment and control group members.  		Because channeling services will not be available to control group members, it  		is hypothesized that they are more likely to be institutionalized than are  		treatment group members. To the extent that measures of the physical  		environment are not setting-free, differences that are artifacts of measurement  		may be confounded with differences between treatment and control group members  		that reflect the impact of channeling.</p>
<h3>C. Measures of the Physical Environment</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Existing Instruments</i></b></p>
<p>Most measures of the physical environments of the elderly are  		setting-specific and are concerned with the psychosocial and/or physical  		environments of institutional and group living settings. These range from  		measures of adaptation to nursing homes (e.g., McCaffree and Harkins, 1976) to  		checklists of architectural features (e.g., Moos, 1979).</p>
<p>A few instruments focus upon the physical environments of the elderly  		living in the community. Much of this work has been done by Lawton and his  		colleagues at the Philadephia Geriatric Center. The PGC-MAI considers  		architectural barriers (stairs), sense of personal security, convenience, the  		structural quality of the living unit, satisfaction with various aspects of the  		living unit, and satisfaction with neighbors and the neighborhood. A subset of  		these items forms three subscales: a subjective housing index, a subjective  		neighborhood index, and a personal security index (Moss, Fulcomer, and Kelban,  		1978). In addition, the PGC-MAI contains a short inventory; which may be  		completed by observation, on the facilities and amenities of the environment.  		(<a href="#exhibitVI.1">Exhibit VI.1</a> presents the PGC-MAI battery on the  		physical environment). CARE uses an approach to the physical environment in  		community settings similar to the PGC-MAI. It contains indices on  		dissatisfaction with the neighborhood, fear of crime and housing problems.  		Havens and Thompson (1971) take a somewhat different approach. They focus upon  		the adequacy of physical facilities, and satisfaction with specific aspects of  		the dwelling. There are also some interesting items on privacy (availability of  		a room to oneself, a place to store belongings, secure places to keep  		valuables), and an overall question on convenience.</p>
<p>There has been a limited amount of work on setting-free measures of the  		physical environment. A few instruments provide alternate wording for  		institutional and community-settings. For example, SAAF provides alternate  		wordings in a question to identify problems in the physical environment. It  		asks whether any of the following present a problem:</p>
<ul><li>a having to climb stairs;</li>
<li>bad neighbors (bad roommate in an institution);</li>
<li>upkeep of the building (room or ward in an institution);</li>
<li>getting to shopping;</li>
<li>getting to a doctor or clinic;</li>
<li>feeling safe in the neighborhood.</li>
</ul><p>Whether these alternate wordings measure comparable concepts is not  		clear. No evidence on the psychometric properties of the SAAF has yet been  		reported. Nevertheless, the SAAF does suggest aspects of the physical  		environment for which setting-free measures may be feasible.</p>
<p>Coulton (1979) has recently began to develop a setting-free instrument  		concerned with person-environment fit. While some of the subscales in Coulton's  		work are inappropriate in a consideration of the <b>physical</b> environment,  		other items deal with privacy and peace and quiet. This work is in its early  		stages and as yet no information is available on the reliability and validity  		of the scale or subscales.</p>
<p><b><i>2. The Physical Environment and Quality of Life</i></b></p>
<p>Some of the items included in all the instruments discussed above have  		consensual validity. Surely an adequate environment meets some minimal levels  		of safety (both structurally and with respect to crime) and of comfort. But it  		is difficult to validate which aspects of the environment are important to the  		quality of life of the elderly. We know little about the relative values that  		the elderly place on dimensions of their environments (Windley, in press). For  		example, Lawton (1980) asked a panel of elderly in a community setting to rank  		various aspects of the environment that they might look for in choosing a new  		home. For data collected after a one-year interval, the rankings were quite  		different from that of the previous year. Because CARE contains items similar  		to the MAI, these results on rankings cast doubt on the validity of both the  		MAI and CARE indices on the physical environment and on the Manitoba items on  		satisfaction with aspects of the environment. Other evidence also suggests  		difficulties with the validity of scales on the physical environment. Lawton et  		al., (no date) report that compared to other indices in the PGC-MAI, agreement  		was poor between interviewer ratings of the physical environment and the  		environmental indices from the MAI. In addition, the internal consistency  		reliability (alpha) of the MAI 3-item sense of personal security scale was not  		high (0.57).</p>
<p>Lawton and his colleagues have recently developed shorter forms of the  		PGC-MAI using multiple regression analysis to select those items from each  		domain sub scale of the full PGC-MAI that were important in predicting the full  		length summary score (Lawton et al., no date). Excluding sense of personal  		security, this analysis indicates that five items contain almost as much  		information on perceived quality of the environment as 24 items in the  		full-length PGC-MAI. The five items concern overall satisfaction with the  		living unit and its state of repair, noise, privacy, satisfaction with the  		neighborhood and neighbors, and convenience of the housing unit for visiting  		friends.</p>
<p>Despite high overlap of the information (in short and full length forms)  		on overall quality of the physical environment, for purposes of the research we  		must be concerned with the psychometric properties of the subscales as well.  		Satisfaction with the physical environment (satisfaction with housing,  		satisfaction with neighborhood, sense of security) may be affected differently  		by channeling. For example, short of relocation it might be very difficult to  		alter clients' perceptions of their neighborhoods, but relatively easier to  		improve the state of repair of their homes. Given variation across subscales in  		the potential impact of channeling, it is important to include enough items  		from each sub scale to ensure a reliable measure. A limited number of items may  		need to be added to the PGC-MAI short form to produce reliable subscales. One  		alternative is to use the scales of the mid-length PGC-MAI, which contains a  		total of thirteen items across the three subscales. We plan to pursue further  		the issue of the reliability of the subscales of PGC-MAI before making a final  		recommendation.</p>
<p>Some items in the short and mid-length forms of the PGC-MAI seem to be  		setting-free. For example the items on noise and privacy should be applicable  		across setting. Other items may be apparently made setting-free with relatively  		minor changes, following the approach used in SAAF. For example, instead of  		house/apartment one may ask about room or ward. Although it seems reasonable  		that minor wording changes for institutions will yield generally comparable  		data, we have no evidence that this is, in fact, the case. Somewhat more  		problematic are the items on satisfaction with the neighborhood. Depending on  		the type of institution, some individuals may have little or no contact with  		the neighborhood in which the institution is located. The questions about the  		neighborhood may take on a different meaning under these circumstances.</p>
<p><b><i>3. Architectural Barriers and Objective Characteristics of the  		Environment</i></b></p>
<p>From the perspective of care planning, it is important to identify  		architectural barriers to functioning. We recommend that these include stairs  		inside the dwelling, stairs outside the dwelling, and whether the sleeping  		areas and bathrooms are on different floors from the living areas. Most of the  		time it will be possible to code this information by observation. Respondents  		need be asked about these items only when it is not obvious.</p>
<p>We also recommend that an item on proximity to public transportation be  		included. Access to public transportation may be related to service  		utilization. Consequently, it is important from both care planning and research  		perspectives.</p>
<p>As a supplement to the information on the individuals' perception of the  		physical environment, it may also be useful to ask the assessor to categorize  		the state of repair of the dwelling and furnishings. If these are so  		dilapidated that they represent a hazard, practitioners will want to take this  		into account.</p>
<p>We have not recommended a checklist of facilities (toilet, telephone,  		refrigerator, stove) and amenities (television, radio) in the home. Such a list  		was included in the PGC-MAI, but has been eliminated due to lack of variation  		in samples from Philadelphia. The Philadelphia experience suggests that there  		will be little variation in the urban sites. If rural sites feel this  		information is important, it could be added on a site-specific basis. In any  		event, these data could usually be obtained through interviewer  		observation.</p>
<p>We recommend that consideration of physical aspects of living  		arrangements include the type of architecture of the dwelling, whether the  		person lives in a private household, an institution or in another group living  		arrangement, and the type of institution or group living arrangement.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup> The architecture of the  		dwelling (single family home, walk-up apartment, high-rise apartment and so on)  		may be related to the presence of architectual barriers and to sense of  		security in one's<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup>  		home and neighborhood. Type of institution or group living arrangement is an  		important outcome variable because we will want to analyze the impact of  		channeling by the level of care as well as on whether institutionalization  		occurs at all.</p>
<p>Assessor observation can be used to collect information on type of  		housing. Information on type of institution can be ascertained separately so  		that the interviewer need only record the name of the institution. The  		advantage of this procedure is that it eliminates the need to ask respondents  		to distinguish between various types of health-related facilities and other  		group quarters. This could sometimes present a problem. For example, it might  		be easy for respondents to confuse board and care homes with boarding homes  		that had no formal provisions for care. More importantly, respondents will  		sometimes be unable to distinguish levels of care within health-related  		facilitites. For example, some might not be able to differentiate skilled  		pursing facilities from intermediate care facilities, even if the question  		identified the distinguishing characteristics of the two.</p>
<h3>D. Recommendations</h3>
<p>Because subjective perceptions of the physical environment are important  		to overall quality of life and because channeling may have a different impact  		on various aspects of satisfaction with the environment, we recommend that the  		instrument include measures of satisfaction with residence, satisfaction with  		neighborhood, and sense of security from crime. Short scales to measure these  		aspects of satisfaction are available in the PGC-MAI, and we recommend that  		they be included in the client assessment instrument.</p>
<p>Practitioners must evaluate the demands of the physical environment as  		they relate to the compentencies of the client. Therefore, we recommend that  		items be included on architectural barriers, specifically on stairs (inside and  		out) and whether living areas, sleeping areas and bathrooms are on different  		floors. These data could usually be obtained through observation. We also  		recommend an objective item on access to public transportation, and assessor  		evaluation of the state of repairs of the dwelling and furnishings.</p>
<p>In regard to the physical aspects of living arrangements, we recommend  		that questions be included on the physical characteristics of the dwelling,  		whether it is a private household, institution, or group living arrangement,  		and the type of institution or group living arrangement. It should be possible  		to obtain these data without questioning the client.</p>

<h3><a name="chapVII.A" id="chapVII.A">A. Rationale</a></h3>
<p>The primary purpose of channeling is to provide appropriate services to  		the functionally impaired so that institutionalization can be avoided when  		possible, independent living in the community can be continued, the quality of  		clients' lives maintained or enhanced, and the cost of care controlled. Given  		this purpose, identifying individual service needs and maintaining an inventory  		of services provided are central to the channeling process and to research  		interests. With respect to the client assessment, the needs of researchers and  		practitioners. for data on services overlap, but differ in some respects.</p>
<p>The basic operational purpose of the assessment instrument is to  		facilitate the comprehensive assessment of clients as a foundation for service  		planning and monitoring. Part of the information required for the service  		planning process includes which services are being received, the quantity of  		and setting for these services, the identity of the service providers (both  		formal and informal), the perceived need for additional assistance and the  		potential sources of assistance. In <a href="#chapIV">Chapter IV</a>, in the  		context of social functioning, we discussed the collection of information on  		potential social support from family or friends. Here we consider data  		collection on service use, including services received from family or  		friends.</p>
<p>The National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation is designed to  		analyze service utilization and the factors associated with it, trade-offs  		among alternative services, and the differential costs of the services received  		by treatment and control group members. The analyses of service utilization and  		of service costs involve data collection seldom required or made by  		practitioners, or at least that have a much lower priority from the perspective  		of service planners. Researchers especially need to know the costs of services  		but practitioners do not need cost data to develop a care plan. Research and  		practitioner data needs also differ with respect to time frame. In general,  		practitioners are less concerned with service use over time; their focus is  		appropriately on current use, although they may wish to compare current service  		use to what has been typical for the client over the last few years or months.  		This applies both to acute and to long term care services.</p>
<p>To summarize, operational and research needs require that data be  		collected on:</p>
<ul><li>the type, quantity and setting for services used over time</li>
<li>the identity of service providers</li>
<li>the costs of services</li>
<li>the perceived need for additional services.</li>
</ul><p>It is important to note that not all of these data need be collected in  		the client assessment instrument. We will return to this point after  		considering the development of a taxonomy of services.</p>
<h3>B. A Conceptual Framework for Services</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Issues in Developing a Conceptual Framework</i></b></p>
<p>The same service may be provided in private homes or in institutions and  		by individuals with very different credentials. Performance of a service may be  		an act of love or friendship or part of a provider's job. In the latter case,  		the provider may be the employee of an organization or someone in private  		practice. Services may be provided individually or as part of a "package." A  		charge may or may not be involved, and charges, when they occur, may be for an  		entire service package and may not be itemized. Furthermore, charges for some  		services, but not for others, are eligible for reimbursement under various  		public programs. Thus, in general, the concept of service is closely linked  		with the setting in which the service is received, the identity of the provider  		and the billing organization.</p>
<p>These linkages complicate the task of developing a uniform list of  		services for the National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation. In order to  		evaluate the success of the demonstration in providing alternatives to  		institutionalization and fostering care by family and friends, measures of  		service utilization must be free of setting and of provider credentials. In  		addition, because cost data are to be collected from providers, it must be  		possible to relate services to billing organizations. What is required,  		therefore, rather than a simple list of services, is the development of a  		conceptual framework that relates services, settings, providers, and billing  		organizations. From this conceptual framework one may develop various "lists"  		of services for different operational and research purposes.</p>
<p>Our development of a conceptual framework begins with generic  		definitions of services, that is, definitions that are comparable across  		settings and providers. Such generic definitions are essential for the  		comparison of formally and informally provided services and of services  		received by those in community and institutional settings. Unless the questions  		in the client assessment instrument about overall service are setting-free and  		provider-free, the amount of service provided informally by family and friends  		is quite likely to be inaccurately estimated. Nursing care is a good example of  		this. Some nursing tasks are often performed by family members. If nursing  		services were defined only by the credentials of the provider, this source of  		care would be overlooked entirely. Using generic definitions does not  		necessarily require asking people directly about individual services. Given a  		conceptual framework that relates typical service "packages" to institutional  		settings, in some cases me need only determine the type of institution. For  		example, skilled nursing care, personal care and meal services are presumed to  		be part of a skilled nursing home's basic package of services.  		<a href="#tableVII.1">Table VII.1</a>, which is adapted from Scanlon,  		DiFederico, and Stassen (1979), illustrates the types of generic services  		provided in several different types of institutions. It is important to note  		that the services within a typical service package will not be utilized to the  		same extent by all individuals in a given institution.</p>
<p>In addition to serving the research need for data on services that are  		comparable across setting and provider, generic service definitions may also be  		operationally useful. They may facilitate consideration of alternative  		approaches to the provision of a given service. In particular, they may  		encourage care planners to pay greater attention to informal sources of  		care.</p>
<p> Given a set of generic definitions within a conceptual framework one  		may then develop different groupings of services for different purposes. For  		example, for the collection of individual-specific service quantity and charge  		data from providers, one would group services that are billed together. Such a  		list might include medical services provided by hospital employees as one item  		and medical services provided in the hospital by a private practitioner (and  		billed separately) as another. A related issue for the collection of  		information on service cost is whether individuals are charged at all for a  		given type of service or whether the program is funded through public funds or  		contributions. As part of the research, a survey of community service providers  		is planned. This survey will include information on whether an agency charges  		individuals for its services.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> When there are no charges, costs will be  		investigated through a limited number of case studies that use the accounting  		records of providers to arrive at estimates of the costs of services.</p>
<p><b><i>2. The Process of Developing a Conceptual Framework</i></b></p>
<p> The first step in developing a set of generic service definitions was  		to compile a comprehensive list of services. To do so, we drew upon two types  		of sources: (1) lists of services published for administrative purposes and (2)  		items on services covered in functional assessment instruments. In addition to  		reviewing administrative lists and existing instrumentation, we carefully  		reviewed the lists of services in the National Minimum Data Set for Long Term  		Care (U.S. National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, 1979). Principal  		among the lists examined are those published by Commerce Clearinghouse, the  		National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and the Health Care Financing  		Administration. We also examined the lists of services in the demonstration  		site proposals from the states. In reviewing these sources, particular  		attention was paid to the services eligible for reimbursement under Titles  		XVIII, XIX, and XX.</p>
<p> A number of existing assessment instruments collect some information an  		those providing assistance with personal care and household management tasks.  		This can range from asking the identity of the provider for one task to (in a  		few instruments) collecting substantial information for several tasks. Havens  		and Thompson (1971) is an example of an instrument that collects a substantial  		amount of information an assistance. The data in this instrument include the  		relationship of the informal service provider to the client, the identity of  		formal service providers, the amount and frequency of assistance, and the  		perceived heed for additional assistance. Looking beyond personal care and  		household management tasks, few instruments inventory service use, although a  		number include questions on use of selected medical services such as items on  		hospitalizations or nursing home residence.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup> Of the major instruments, OARS has the most  		comprehensive service inventory. Moreover, a set of generic service definitions  		was developed in conjunction with the OARS.</p>
<p><a href="#tableVII.2"> Table VII.2</a> lists the most recent version of  		the generic services list developed by this process. The definition for each  		service is given in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>. <a href="#tableVII.3">Table VII.3</a> presents the conceptual framework for this  		list of services; for each service, it indicates the settings in which the  		service may be provided and the types of providers. The final column of  		<a href="#tableVII.3">Table VII.3</a> indicates services that may be provided  		informally. The potential for informal provision of services is of particular  		concern with respect to the client assessment instrument because questions must  		be worded to prevent informal services from being overlooked.</p>
<h3>C. Service Utilization Data in the Client Assessment  		Instrument</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Alternative Data Collection Strategies</i></b></p>
<p>As noted in <a href="#chapVII.A">Section A</a>, all the data on services  		required by the research need not be gathered by the client assessment  		instrument. In particular, we plan to limit the data collected from individuals  		to charges for services. Provider records and possibly third party payer  		records will be the source for much of these data. It is important to note that  		the procedures to be used in collecting data from these records are still under  		development and must be pretested final decisions are made about their  		feasibility. The implication of this is that treatment of service data within  		the client assessment instrument is subject to change.</p>
<p>The strategy of collecting service and cost data from sources other than  		individuals has numerous advantages. Difficulties of recall are avoided and the  		burden on respondents is much reduced. Furthermore, individuals may simply not  		know some of the information needed for research purposes. For example, if  		Medicare or Medicaid is billed directed for a service, individuals may have no  		knowledge of the charges involved. However, because of the expense, the  		research budget permits data to be extracted from provider records only in a  		subset of sites. In the other sites, data on quantity of services must be  		collected by the client assessment instrument.</p>
<p>The basic questions to be asked in all sites would include whether a  		client has received a service, the quantity of services received, the perceived  		need for additional services and the identity of the service provider(s). In  		those sites in which data will be collected from provider records, we would  		also include questions about out-of-pocket costs associated with the services.  		Using the information on provider identity collected from the respondents,  		information on total charges would be collected from provider or third party  		payor records. Together, the out-of-pocket, and provider record data (possibly  		supplemented by third party payor data), should provide comprehensive data on  		the costs of services and who pays for them. The data on service use from the  		provider and third party records would provide a validity check for the other  		data collected from respondents.</p>
<p> The recall period for service data in the client assessment instrument  		must be brief. The quality of information on services that are not received  		regularly and on out-of-pocket costs, in particular, is likely to decay very  		rapidly unless diaries or similar devices are used to record services and costs  		as they occur. We have not proposed such diaries for several reasons. First,  		keeping diaries would impose a substantial burden on impaired individuals who  		need assistance to function independently. Second, a number of these  		individuals will not handle their own financial affairs. In these cases, it  		would be difficult and expensive to locate the appropriate proxies and persuade  		them to keep diaries. Third, to foster use of the diary by a substantial  		portion of the sample, it would be necessary to contact respondents often,  		preferably by telephone or in-person. This frequent contact would be very  		expensive yet could not be expected to ensure faithful diary use.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Given the decision to eschew diaries and rely on unaided recall, the  		recall period must be brief. However, if the period is too brief, many  		respondents will not yet have received a bill for the services and will be  		unable to estimate what out-of-pocket costs may be involved beyond the costs  		covered by Medicare, Medicaid or public programs. We tentatively recommend a  		recall period of two to three months for out-of-pocket cost data. This is the  		recall period in the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey  		(NMCUES), which also collected data on out-of-pocket costs for medical  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p> There are four advantages to the data collection strategy described  		above. First, because the same questions using exactly the same recall period  		will be asked in all sites, a basic data set on service utilization will be  		generated that is directly comparable across all sites, whether or not provider  		records are collected there. Second, potentially inaccurate self-report data on  		charges for services are avoided by collecting this information from provider  		and third party payor records. Only out-of-pocket cost data, available from no  		other source, are collected from individual respondents. Third, the strategy  		eliminates respondent burden associated with diary use. Fourth, it will allow  		us to verify respondent reports on service use, because utilization and charge  		data will be collected from provider records.</p>
<p> A disadvantage of the strategy is that it does not permit construction  		of a data set with continuous data on service use. Rather, we will have a  		series of "snapshots" of service use and charges for the two to three months  		preceding the interview.</p>
<p><b><i>2. Informal Delivery of Services</i></b></p>
<p> If a respondent identifies an organization as a provider, one can  		assume that the services are formally provided. However, if a respondent names  		an individual, further questions or probes will be required to determine  		whether this person is acting in a formal or informal capacity. We define  		informal services as those which are regularly provided, which do not  		constitute part of a provider's job, and which are not part of an organized  		volunteer activity. By regularly provided we mean that the caregiver makes a  		practice of performing the service or services. Someone who makes a practice of  		performing various activities as needed would be classified as an informal  		service provider, even though any particular service might be performed  		sporadically.</p>
<p> For each service delivered informally we will also collect, information  		on the identity of the caregiver and his (her) relationship to the respondent.  		Questions on the quantity of informal services will refer to the two to last  		three months to maintain a consistent time frame for all service data.</p>
<p> In addition to questions for each service, we recommend that further  		information be collected on the characteristics of caregivers. At the end of  		the services section, respondents will be questioned about the characteristics  		of up to three informal caregivers. (If more than three informal caregivers are  		named, respondents will be asked which three provided the most care.)  		Caregiver-specific rather than service specific questions are appropriate  		because the same informal caregiver may often provide more than one service,  		and the questions we wish to ask relate to the general characteristics of the  		provider, not to the specific service. In <a href="#chapV">Chapter V</a>, we  		presented the information we recommend be collected on the characteristics of  		informal caregivers. These include sex, employment status, and relationship.  		Relationship will be ascertained for informal caregivers providing any service,  		not just the three providing the most care.</p>
<p><b><i>3. Service-Specific Instrumentation</i></b></p>
<p> Up to this point in this chapter, we have been discussing our general  		approach to the collection of service data. This approach represents the  		maximum amount of data that would be collected on utilization of service. For  		many of the services listed in <a href="#tableVII.2">Table VII.2</a>, much less  		data would be collected.</p>
<p> In <a href="#tableVII.2">Table VII.2</a> we have attempted to provide a  		comprehensive list of services. Some of those listed there will be used by the  		target population only rarely, or are minor services for which costs are  		minimal (whether or not an individual is charged). We recommend that such  		services be excluded from consideration in the client assessment instrument.  		Referring to <a href="#tableVII.2">Table VII.2</a>, these services are:</p>
<ul><li>vocational rehabilitation </li>
<li>nutrition services</li>
<li>reading and letter writing</li>
<li>employment placement</li>
<li>sheltered employment</li>
<li>speech and hearing therapy</li>
<li>administrative, legal and protective assistance</li>
</ul><p> Another group of services for which a less extensive set of questions  		will be asked are those which cannot be provided informally. For each generic  		service, <a href="#tableVII.3">Table VII.3</a> indicates whether it can be  		provided informally. Most of the services that cannot be performed by a family  		member are medical services that require specialized knowledge and extensive  		gaining and licensing. Several other services listed in <a href="#tableVII.3">Table VII.3</a> as possible informal services require  		training and may be performed only rarely by family members or friends.</p>
<p> Services also differ with respect to whether individuals are charged  		for them. For example, some services such as telephone reassurance and friendly  		visiting are provided without charge. Of the other services listed in  		<a href="#tableVII.3">Table VII.3</a> the following commonly do not involve  		charges to individuals:</p>
<ul><li>advocacy, ombudsman services</li>
<li>emergency services (non-medical)</li>
<li>telephone reassurance and checking </li>
<li>sheltered employment</li>
<li>information and referral</li>
<li>services planning, coordination and follow-up</li>
<li>outreach.</li>
</ul><p>The number of services listed in <a href="#tableVII.3">Table VII.3</a>  		suggests that the services module will be lengthy, even though some of the  		services listed will not be considered in the instrument and not all items will  		be appropriate for the remaining services. However, it is important to note in  		conjunction with the burden of the services module, that any given individual  		will have received only a limited number of services and thus only a subset of  		the questions will be applicable to him or her.</p>
<h3>D. Recommendations</h3>
<p> Our tentative recommended approach to the data collection on service  		utilization and costs involves a mixed strategy of data collection from  		individuals when they are the best source, and from providers and possibly  		third party payor records when they are the best source. Data on provider  		charges and third party payor payments, would be collected from provider  		records in a subset of sites. Out-of-pocket costs would be collected from  		respondents in these same sites. Service utilization data (including quantity  		of services, perceived need for services, and the identity of the service  		provider) would be collected from respondents. In provider records sites, the  		data on service utilization could be validated against data on service use  		obtained from those records. In addition, information an the characteristics of  		informal providers would be collected in a separate section, following the  		services items.</p>
<p>Because of recall difficulties, a short time frame of two to three  		months is tentatively recommended for data collected from respondents. To  		ensure a comparable set of basic data across sites, this recall period would  		apply to all sites, whether or not provider records extracts were being made  		there. It would also apply both to formal and informal services. </p>

<h3>A. Rationale</h3>
<p> The National Long Term Care Demonstration Evaluation is designed to  		address four major issues: (1) the process by which channeling is implemented,  		(2) the impact of channeling on the use of long term care services, (3) the  		impact of channeling on the cost, for the government and for society as a  		whole, of long term care services, and (4) the impact of channeling on  		individual clients. The data on financial resources discussed in this chapter  		are directly relevant to the investigation of the last three issues.</p>
<p> Information on financial resources (income, assets, insurance coverage,  		and program eligibility and participation) is central to the analysis of the  		effect of channeling on the utilization of long term care services. Of  		particular interest to policy makers is the effect of channeling on entry into  		institutions. To analyze the decision to seek institutional care, information  		on financial resources and program eligibility is critical because these  		factors play a major role in choosing a care setting. For example, the high  		cost of institutional care often makes it unavailable to anyone without  		substantial financial resources or Medicaid eligibility. Individuals of  		moderate means often spend down their resources to become eligible for  		Medicaid. In addition, sufficient income to purchase amenities may be an  		important consideration in the decision to remain in the community.</p>
<p> A principal issue in the analysis of the effects of channeling on the  		costs of long term care services is the comprehensive comparison of the cost of  		community-based versus institutional care. It is important to stress the need  		for comprehensiveness in the cost comparisons because this has been a major  		flaw in previous studies. There are several types of goods and services (the  		most obvious of which are food and shelter) subsumed within the basic costs of  		institutional care. In addition, some goods and services such as  		transportation) required no function in a community setting are not required  		(or are required to a much lesser extent) in an institution. To develop a  		comprehensive comparison of the costs of community-based and institutional  		care, we must take differential expenditures for such goods and services into  		account.</p>
<p> To determine the coat of channeling, we must be concerned with its  		impact on the cost of income transfer programs as well as on programs that  		directly provide long term care. Different types of assistance are available to  		those living in the community and to those in institutions. For example,  		persons residing in public institutions may receive reduced SSI benefits and in  		many states may not be eligible for supplemental SSI payments (U.S. Congress,  		1974). Determination of the cost of channeling requires information on the  		amount of income assistance received from various transfer programs; overall  		income data is not sufficient for our purposes.</p>
<p> Finally, economic well-being and perceived economic well-being are  		clearly important to quality of life. Both objective and subjective measures of  		well-being may be affected by the demonstration directly through systematic  		assessment of financial need and coordination of eligibility determination or  		more generally through provision of needed services at no cost or at reduced  		cost. In particular, channeling may affect the burden of out-of-pocket costs  		for medical and long term care expenses.</p>
<p> Up to this point, we have focused on the research needs for collecting  		data on financial resources. Practitioners also require such information. To  		develop a care plan, a practitioner needs to understand what financial  		resources an individual has to help meet his (her) needs. This includes  		eligibility for public programs as well as income, assets, and insurance  		coverage. A practitioner will also want to identify a person whose resources  		are limited, but who is not currently enrolled in one or more public programs  		so that an eligibility determination can be made.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. Income, Assets, and Expenditures</h3>
<p><b><i>1. Financial Resources</i></b></p>
<p> Short of obtaining access to records, the most accurate way to collect  		data on income is to ask an individual whether s/he receives various types of  		income, and, if so, the amount received. This approach helps ensure that no  		sources of income are neglected and results in more accurate data. Because  		accurate information on total income and on transfer program income is  		important to the research, this is the approach we recommend.</p>
<p> Existing multidimensional assessment instruments vary substantially in  		their consideration of financial resources, with some including only one or two  		questions on the topic. Perhaps the most comprehensive considerations of income  		are found in OARS and COMPASS. Both provide checklists of various types of  		income and the amount of each type received. However, the OARS checklist is  		much more comprehensive. It includes earnings, social security, pensions,  		various types of transfer income, income from assets, and regular contributions  		from relatives. Information on pensions is important because in conjunction  		with information on assets and program eligibility, it can be used to estimate  		future income. OARS also includes information on in-kind income; whether  		someone else contributes food or housing is ascertained, but not the value of  		this in-kind income.</p>
<p> Insurance coverage is an especially important resource in the context  		of long term care. Many multidimensional assessment instruments collect  		information on insurance coverage under Medicare (Plans A and B), Medicaid, and  		private insurance (for hospitalization and doctor bills). We recommend that  		insurance coverage be included in the client assessment instrument.</p>
<p> Assets receive much less consideration than income in existing  		multidimensional functional assessment instruments. Using a categorical  		question, OARS asks about the worth of owner-occupied housing. A question is  		also included on whether there is a mortgage against the home, but not the  		amount owed.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup> COMPASS  		asks about the value of savings accounts but not of owner-occupied housing or  		other types of assets. The value of one's assets can be quite important in  		choice of care setting. To analyze this decision, it is necessary to consider  		liquid and non-liquid assets separately. Non-liquid assets may be difficult to  		convert to cash and may be associated with considerable expense, (for example,  		taxes and maintenance expanses on real estate).<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup> In order to ensure that some types of assets  		are not overlooked, we recommend that questions be asked about specific types  		of assets and that aggregate measures of liquid and non-liquid assets be  		calculated from the interview data. Because our purpose in gathering asset data  		is to characterize the general level of wealth in liquid and non-liquid assets,  		detailed information about specific assets is unnecessary.</p>
<p> Because the value of owner-occupied housing is a major portion of the  		net worth of many elderly, it is important to obtain relatively more accurate  		information on this item than on other types of assets. We recommend that those  		who own their home be asked its market value and the amount of debt on the  		property, including the amount owed on mortgages or home improvement loans and  		back taxes. This is the approach taken in the Longitudinal Retirement History  		Survey of the Social Security Administration. In addition to the value of  		owner-occupied housing, we recommend that items be included an the value of  		checking and savings accounts, savings bonds, certificates of deposit, stocks  		and bonds, and other real estate, estates and trusts.</p>
<p>Questions on income and assets are sensitive; same respondents view them  		as intrusive and refuse to answer. We have administered batteries of items on  		income and assets far more extensive than these recommended here. It is our  		experience that the elderly who manage their own financial affairs are no more  		likely to refuse such questions than the general population. However, some  		elderly individuals simply have no knowledge of their financial affairs. We  		expect this for a substantial minority of the elderly in the demonstration. As  		discussed in <a href="#chapI">Chapter I</a>, proxy respondents will be  		interviewed when clients are unable to answer.</p>
<p><b><i>2. Measures of Expenditures</i></b></p>
<p> The optimal means of measuring expenditures is to use a diary or other  		memory aid, or, failing that, detailed questions on the different types of  		expenditures. For example, to ascertain expenditures on food, the Consumer  		Expenditure Survey includes items on the frequency of grocery shopping, the  		usual amount of purchase, the amount spent specifically for food, shopping for  		food at places other than grocery stores, the frequency of such shopping, the  		usual amount spent, usual monthly expenses for meals in restaurants, and,  		finally, the approximate value of meals received as a part of pay. Obviously,  		the need for brevity in the client assessment instrument severely constrains  		the extent to which we can ask such detailed items. Rather, we recommend that  		regular or average expenditures be obtained for general categories of goods and  		services, but that the questions be worded to remind the respondent to include  		various types of expenses for that general category.</p>
<p> With the exception of mortgage payments or rents, few multidimensional  		assessment instruments collect information on expenditures. Havens and Thompson  		(1971), COMPASS, and TRIAGE are three instruments that do consider.  		expenditures. Of these, TRIAGE collects the most comprehensive data; it  		includes items on regular or average expenses for housing, household operation,  		food, utilities, transportation, clothing, leisure activities, life insurance  		and health insurance, among others. We recommend the general approach of asking  		average expenditures, varying the period over which the average is obtained  		according to the expense. For example, rent might be asked on a monthly basis  		and food expenditures on a weekly basis.</p>
<p> For the research purpose of comparing the costs of institutionalized  		and community-based care and estimating the demand for certain types of  		services, not all of the types of expenditures considered in the TRIAGE  		instrument need be itemized here. We recommend that estimates of regular or  		average expenses be obtained for:</p>
<ul><li>housing</li>
<li>utilities</li>
<li>household operations (maintenance and supplies)</li>
<li>food</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>personal services</li>
<li>medical costs</li>
<li>health insurance premiums</li>
<li>all other insurance premiums</li>
<li>all other expenses.</li>
</ul><p><b><i>3. Subjective Measures of Economic Well-Being</i></b></p>
<p> Subjective perceptions of economic well-being are important to overall  		life satisfaction. Both Campbell, Converse and Rogers (1976) and Andrews and  		Withey (1976) found concern with standard of living to be one of the specific  		items most highly correlated with global well-being.</p>
<p> The elderly use various standards to evaluate the adequacy of their  		financial resources, including comparison of their current and pre-retirement  		income, and the adequacy of their resources to meet current and long-term  		expenses (Peterson, 1969; Chen, 1974). Clearly, objective measures of income  		and assets do not capture the subjective significance of financial  		resources.</p>
<p> We recommend that the client assessment instrument include a measure of  		perceived adequacy of financial resources. This would serve as one measure of  		the effect of the demonstration on quality of life. In addition, the perception  		of the adequacy of financial resources may be useful in the analysis  		investigating decisions about institutionalization, especially because the  		objective information about net worth that can be collected in the client  		assessment instrument will necessarily be limited. Finally, information on the  		perception of the adequacy of financial resources would also help practitioners  		identify individuals who should receive eligibility determinations for public  		transfer programs.</p>
<p> Existing multidimensional assessment instruments vary substantially in  		their consideration of subjective economic well-being. Some include no  		information on financial resources (objective or subjective); others include a  		single item on the perceived adequacy of resources to meet current needs. A few  		include multiple items evaluating different aspects of satisfaction with  		financial resources. Given the inclusion of subjective economic well-being as  		an outcome variable for the research, reliance on a single item is  		inappropriate.</p>
<p><a href="#exhibitVIII.1"> Exhibit VIII.1</a> presents the subjective  		economic well-being questions from Havens and Thompson (1971) and OARS, two  		instruments that devote considerable attention to the issue. The OARS items  		concentrate on the adequacy of resources for current needs, future needs, and  		emergencies--issues of particular concern in long term care. We concur with  		Lawton and Kleban (1979) that the OARS items cover perceived economic  		well-being particularly well and recommend that they be included in the client  		assessment instrument.</p>
<h3>C. Recommendations</h3>
<p> We recommend the collection of data on the amount of income received  		from various sources including earnings, social security, pensions, various  		types of transfer income, income from assets, and regular contributions from  		relatives. In addition, we recommend the collection of data on general level of  		liquid and non-liquid assets including the approximate equity value of  		owner-occupied housing, and the value of checking and savings accounts, savings  		bonds, certificates of deposit, stocks and bonds, other real estate, and  		estates and trusts.</p>
<p> Turning to expenditure data, we recommend the collection of recall  		information on usual expenses for housing (including utilities and  		maintenance), food, transportation, medical costs, personal services,  		insurance, and all other expenses. These would be asked as general categories  		because the need for brevity precludes specific detailed items in each  		category.</p>
<p> We recommend that the client assessment instrument include a measure of  		subjective well-being; that used in OARS.</p>
<p> In conclusion, we should like to emphasize that previous surveys such  		as the Longitudinal Retirement Survey of the Social Security Administration  		have successfully collected detailed financial information from the elderly.  		Moreover, data have been collected in various assessment instruments at the  		same level of detail as we are recommending.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="chapIX" id="chapIX"> IX. BASIC DESCRIPTION INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p> We recommend that the following basic descriptive data be included in  		the client assessment instrument:</p>
<ul><li>name</li>
<li>sex </li>
<li>birthdate </li>
<li>race</li>
<li>ethnicity</li>
<li>primary language, if other than English</li>
<li>marital status</li>
<li>family or household structure</li>
<li>income</li>
<li>wealth </li>
<li>education</li>
<li>usual occupation </li>
<li>retirement/employment status</li>
<li>type of community (urban/rural)</li>
<li>type of housing</li>
<li>type of institution.</li>
</ul><p> Information on sex, birthdate, race, ethnicity and marital status are  		of obvious importance. These are the demographic items included in the National  		Minimum Data Set on Long Term Care (U.S. National Committee on Vital and Health  		Statistics, 1979). We would add type of community, education, and usual  		occupation because these variables (along with others) may be related to  		service use. All the other data items have been discussed in earlier chapters;  		they are listed here for the sake of completeness.</p>
<p> Some basic descriptive information items need not be asked but may  		simply be observed and recorded by the assessor, for example, sex, race, type  		of community, type of housing, and type of institution.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup> Moreover, many items of basic descriptive  		information need be asked only once--at the baseline assessment--because they  		represent fixed characteristics. These items include sex, birthdate, race,  		ethnicity, primary language, education, and occupation.</p>
<p> It was somewhat arbitrarily decided, for purposes of this report, to  		discuss basic descriptive information here. In fact, however, these data items  		can and do relate to more than one area of functioning. Because we are not  		recommending assessor-completed rating scales to summarize different domains of  		functioning, we need not be concerned that question placement will confound  		domains. Although confounding across domains <b>is</b> an issue for certain  		scales, this does not apply to basic descriptive data. <b>Instrument  		placement</b> of items related to different areas of functioning will be  		determined by considerations of logic of question order, flow, and ease of  		administration.</p>

<p><a name="note4" id="note4">The</a> measures developed by the Rand Corporation  			 for their Health Insurance Study (Stewart et al., 1978; Ware et al., 1978) also  			 associate medical conditions with resulting disability.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note22" id="note22">Another</a> potential measure of positive affect  			 are the positive items from the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale.

<li>
<p><a name="note30" id="note30">The</a> phrase person-environment fit is associated  			 with the work of Kahana, but concern with the same issues is reflected in  			 earlier work; in particular, that of Bennett and Nahemov (1965) and Lawton  			 (1970).</p>

<p><a name="note31" id="note31">For</a> simplicity, we have differentiated here  			 between private households, institutions, and group living arrangements. In  			 terms of services provided, degree of control over residents, social  			 psychological setting and other characteristics, institutions and group living  			 arrangements can be viewed as falling along a continuum.

<li>
<p><a name="note34" id="note34">Service</a> use inventories are properly not the  			 approach in the needs assessments instruments such as those of Havens and  			 Thompson (1971, 1976) and Branch and Fowler (1975). As Havens (forthcoming)  			 points out, the services utilized by an individual do not necessarily represent  			 either the services that person needs or what a community's service resources  			 are. Unmet needs may exist, community resources may go unused, services may be  			 provided to persons without special needs, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note35" id="note35">The</a> current Medicare Survey involves diaries of  			 medical costs and a monthly telephone survey of <b>unimpaired</b> elderly  			 respondents.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note36" id="note36">Although</a> originally designed to be two months,  			 the reference period in NMCUES averaged thirteen weeks. There is no evidence of  			 decreased quality across individuals with shorter or longer reference periods  			 (Gail Wilensky, Research Triangle Institute, personal communication, January  			 1981). Before a final decision is made on the length of the recall period, we  			 plan to pursue this issue further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note37" id="note37">Because</a> of differences across states and  			 programs, eligibility probably cannot be determined by the standard client  			 assessment instrument. However, much of the information required for such a  			 determination will be available from the instrument.</p>

<li>
<p><a name="note38" id="note38">Some</a> respondents may take into account the  			 amount owed on the mortgage when they respond to the item on the worth of their  			 home. However, it seems more likely that they will report the market  			 value.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note40" id="note40">As</a> discussed in <a href="#chapVI">Chapter  			 VI</a>, the assessor would record the name of the institution. Information on  			 its characteristics would be ascertained separately.</p>
