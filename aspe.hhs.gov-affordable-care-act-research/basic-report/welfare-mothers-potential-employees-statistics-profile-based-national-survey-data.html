<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3>THE CHANGING CHARACTER OF THE AID TO FAMILIES WITH  		DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM</h3>
<p>The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was  		inaugurated in the Social Security Act of 1935 in order to help widows remain  		in the home to raise their children. In the intervening half-century, numerous  		social and demographic changes have combined to alter the nature of the  		program, and the characteristics of AFDC recipients have changed dramatically.  		Widows now comprise only a small minority of AFDC recipients, with only 1.8  		percent of the children receiving AFDC being eligible because their fathers  		have died. Today, 52 percent have unmarried parents, and another 35 percent  		have divorced or separated parents. Thus, never-married mothers and divorced  		and separated mothers now constitute 85 percent of all recipients (Family  		Support Administration, 1990).</p>
<p>In addition, as the proportion of mothers who are employed has risen  		dramatically, the premise of a program designed to help some mothers stay home  		to raise their children at the taxpayer's expense, while other mothers juggle  		home and family, has come under scrutiny and attack. The law that was passed,  		the Family Support Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-45), represents a compromise  		6etween several viewpoints and marks a major change in the philosophy  		underlying the provision of welfare assistance to poor families with children  		in the United States.</p>
<h3>PROVISIONS OF THE FAMILY SUPPORT ACT</h3>
<p>The Family Support Act makes numerous changes in the AFDC program and in  		the Child Support Enforcement program. The intent of these changes is that  		public assistance should be a means for helping parents move from welfare  		dependency to self-sufficiency, rather than a source of long-term support for  		indigent families. Self-sufficiency is to be attained through the paid  		employment of welfare parents, including those with young children, and through  		the establishment and enforcement of the child support obligations of absent  		parents.</p>
<p>The law creates a new program of education, training, and  		employment-related services for AFDC recipients, The Job Opportunities and  		Basic Skills Training program, or JOBS. It extends Medicaid coverage and  		underwrites the cost of child care for one year for families that stop  		receiving AFDC because of increased earnings. The law bolsters the Child  		Support Enforcement program by requiring automatic withholding of child support  		from the wages of absent parents, use of state guidelines in making child  		support awards, and increases in the establishment of paternity. The law also  		compels all states to provide AFDC to low-income, two-parent families in which  		the principal wage earner is unemployed.</p>
<p>One component of the Family Support legislation requires an evaluation  		of the impact of the JOBS program. These evaluations are being funded by the  		Family Support Administration and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  		(DDHS). The evaluation contract was awarded to the Manpower Demonstration  		Research Corporation (MDRC), which has overall charge of designing and  		implementing the study. Child Trends is assisting MDRC by designing a related  		study of the impact of the JOBS program on the children and families of AFDC  		mothers.</p>
<h3>A STATISTICAL PROFILE OF AFDC MOTHERS</h3>
<p>Both to inform this impact evaluation and to assist state and federal  		policy makers who are currently working to implement the complex provisions of  		the Family Support Act, Child Trends has conducted a related project to  		describe the characteristics of the AFDC population, using several different  		national survey data bases. This report focuses on the characteristics of  		welfare mothers that relate to their capabilities for entering and remaining in  		the paid labor force. A related report (Zill, Moore, Wolpow, &amp; Stief, 1991)  		describes the life circumstances and development of children in welfare  		families. This project is funded by the Foundation for Child Development and  		the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, DHHS.</p>
<p>Some characteristics of the welfare recipients are known on the basis of  		reports issued regularly by the Family Support Administration based on the AFDC  		Quality Control System (House Ways and Means Committee, 1990). Some insights  		have been gained from vivid word-portraits drawn by skilled journalists, based  		on their intimate knowledge of a small number of individuals and families  		(Sheehan, 1975; Auletta, 1982). Our knowledge has also been enhanced by  		analyses conducted by researchers across the country (e.g., Furstenberg et al.,  		1987; Duncan and Hoffman, 1990; Jencks and Edin, 1990a &amp; b). However,  		inadequate use has been made of information on welfare clients that is  		available in nationally representative survey data bases. Government  		publications provide only a limited number of cross- tabulations on restricted  		sets of demographic variables, while academic researchers almost never make  		description the central focus of their research.</p>
<p>Opinions about the characteristics of AFDC recipients are common. Some  		hold that welfare mothers lack motivation and have negative attitudes about  		work. This perspective suggests that individuals are selected into welfare  		because of negative personal characteristics. Others argue that welfare  		recipients are victims of poverty, discrimination, poor economic opportunities,  		and a lack of work experience. This perspective frequently concludes that  		welfare recipients need education, job training, and supportive services.  		Although these are usually seen as opposing perspectives, it is possible that  		both views have some truth. We believe that the results presented here show  		AFDC recipients to be a disadvantaged yet a varied group. The heterogeneity of  		the welfare population has received increasing recognition over the past  		decade; but the ways in which AFDC recipients differ from and are similar to  		mothers who are not recipients, and the implications of the differences and  		similarities for welfare-to-work programs have received little systematic  		attention.</p>
<p>To fill this gap, Child Trends has conducted descriptive analyses  		comparing AFDC recipients with other women on a wide variety of  		characteristics, including their educational attainment, aptitude or  		achievement level, vocational training, employment experience, attitudes about  		employment, physical or emotional disabilities, alcohol and drug abuse,  		depression, and self-esteem. Comparison groups included: all mothers with  		children under 18; women in families below the poverty line that have not  		received welfare in the past year (poor, non-welfare mothers); women in  		families at or above the official poverty line (non-poor mothers); and women  		who have not (yet) had children (non-mothers).</p>
<p>The sources of the-survey data employed in these comparisons were: the  		National Integrated Quality Control System (QCS); the National Longitudinal  		Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth (NLSY); the March 1988 Current  		Population Survey (CPS); the 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child  		Health (NHIS-CH); and the National Survey of Children (NSC). These data bases  		are described in an <a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#append">appendix</a> to this report.</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>A MAJORITY OF WELFARE FAMILIES BEGAN WITH A TEEN  		BIRTH</h3>
<p>As recognized for some time (Moore, 1978 a &amp; b), a majority of  		welfare families are initiated by a birth to a teenager. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table2">Table 2</a>.)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Fifty-nine percent of women who received AFDC payments in 1988 were  			 19 or younger at the birth of their first child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, 25 percent of non-poor mothers were teenagers when they  			 gave birth for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 13 percent of AFDC mothers were more than 23 years old when  			 they had their first child, whereas 41 percent of non-poor mothers were 24 or  			 older at their first birth. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>A history of teen childbearing is also common among poor women with  		children who are not currently dependent on welfare.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Fifty-one percent of women with children who were below the poverty  			 line but had not received AFDC in 1988 had had their first child when they were  			 19 or younger.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is not a random subset of young women who became mothers as  		teenagers. Although teenage sexual activity is widespread, the adolescent girls  		who go on to bear children are apt to be those who score low on achievement  		tests, are failing in school, may also have poorer relationships with their  		parents, and engage in other forms of problematic behavior (Abrahamse,  		Morrison, &amp; Waite, 1988a &amp; b; Elster, Ketterlinus, &amp; Lamb, 1990;  		Elliott &amp; Morse, 1989; Rosenbaum &amp; Kandel, 1990; Moore &amp; Snyder,  		1990). They are also more likely to be from minority ethnic groups and from  		disadvantaged backgrounds (NCHS, 1990).</p>
<h3>MORE THAN HALF OF ALL WELFARE CHILDREN WERE BORN OUTSIDE  		OF MARRIAGE</h3>
<p>A history of unmarried childbearing is an increasingly common  		characteristics of welfare families.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>For 52 percent of all children who got AFDC payments in 1988, the  			 basis for eligibility was that there was no marriage tie between the mother and  			 father of the child. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifteen years earlier, in 1973, the same was true of less than a  			 third of AFDC children (House Ways and Means Committee, 1990, p. 579).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Unmarried childbearing is less common among poor families that are not  		welfare dependent, and much less common among non-poor families with children.  		(<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table2">Table 2</a>.)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Whereas half of all women who got AFDC payments during 1988 reported  			 that they had never been married to the biological father of their child, the  			 same was true of only 17 percent of poor mothers who had not received AFDC  			 during the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less than 5 percent of non-poor mothers had never been married to  			 the father of their child.<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is debate as to whether birth outside of marriage constitutes a  		risk factor for a child's development and wellbeing. There can be little doubt,  		though, that unmarried childbearing increases a family's risk of welfare  		dependence (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1989). This is especially true when the  		mother is a teenager (Adams, 1990).</p>
<h3>MORE THAN A THIRD OF WELFARE CHILDREN ARE DEPENDENT  		BECAUSE OF THE BREAKUP OF THEIR PARENTS' MARRIAGE</h3>
<p>Marital disruption is another major cause of welfare receipt. Although  		children of divorce represent a shrinking portion of the population receiving  		AFDC, they still make up more than a third of the total caseload  		nationwide.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>For 35 percent of children who got AFDC payments in 1988, the basis  			 for eligibility was the separation or divorce of the parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifteen years earlier, nearly half of all AFDC dependents were  			 children of separation or divorce (House Ways and Means Committee, 1990, p.  			 579).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Early childbearing is also implicated in this path to welfare receipt  		because couples who marry young are more prone than older couples to separate  		or divorce (Bumpass &amp; Sweet, 1972; Cherlin, 1981, p. 18). Once separated,  		young single parents are less likely than older parents to have the education,  		work experience, and earning power to support children without the help of a  		partner, relatives, or the government.</p>
<h3>MOST WELFARE PARENTS ARE YOUNG, BUT FEW ARE STILL  		TEENAGERS</h3>
<p>Given the association between early childbearing and welfare dependence,  		and given that many parents leave the rolls as they get older, it is not  		surprising that most welfare mothers are relatively young. Poor mothers who do  		not receive AFDC in a given year also tend to be on the young side, but not as  		much so. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Of the 3.2 million women who received AFDC payments during an  			 average month in fiscal year 1987, 1.8 million or 57 percent were under 30  			 years of age. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table1">Table 1</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About one million AFDC mothers, or 32 percent, were in their  			 thirties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another 360,000, or 11 percent, were 40 or older.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Although the majority of welfare mothers <b>began</b> their childbearing  		as teenagers, relatively few are teenagers at a given point in time.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Only about 200,000, or 6 percent, of the women receiving AFDC in  			 fiscal year 1987 were currently under 20, and only 1 percent were under age  			 18.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>About 1 in 5 AFDC mothers has a youngest child who is 9 or older. About  		two-thirds of the women on AFDC have at least one child age 5 or younger. Until  		now these women have been exempt from work and training requirements. The  		Family Support Act has changed this by mandating education, training, or job  		search for mothers whose youngest child is aged 3-5. Given widespread interest  		in the consequences of this momentous change, children aged 3-5 will be the  		primary focus of the study of the impact of JOBS on children. About 750,000  		women fall into this newly-eligible category.</p>
<h3>A MAJORITY OF WELFARE MOTHERS ARE BLACK OR HISPANIC</h3>
<p>In fiscal year 1988, more than half of AFDC mothers were black or  		Hispanic, with 40 percent being black and 16 percent Hispanic. About 39 percent  		of AFDC mothers were non-Hispanic whites (Family Support Administration,  		1990).</p>
<h3>MOST WELFARE MOTHERS HAVE SMALL FAMILIES</h3>
<p>It is relatively rare for AFDC mothers to have very large families  		nowadays (Family Support Administration, 1990).</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In FY 1988, 43 percent of AFDC families had only one child, and  			 another 31 percent had two children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 10 percent had 4 or more children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>EDUCATION LEVELS OF WELFARE MOTHERS ARE HIGHER THAN  		GENERALLY BELIEVED, BUT STILL COMPARATIVELY LOW</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that most welfare mothers began bearing children as  		teenagers, more than half have either finished high school or obtained a  		general equivalency certificate (GED). The exact proportion with a high school  		education or more varies somewhat across surveys,<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> but is consistently found to be over 50  		percent. In the 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health  		(NHIS-CH), for example, it was determined that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Among AFDC mothers with children under 18, 57 percent had completed  			 high school or more. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table2">Table 2</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly 15 percent, or about one in 7, had some college-level  			 training.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The results reflect the general increase in educational attainment in  		the U.S., especially among blacks (U.S. House of Representatives, 1989, p.  		62).</p>
<p>Although the educational attainments of AFDC recipients are greater than  		generally believed, and higher than they were in the past, they are still  		substantially lower than those of other U.S. women. For example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In 1988, 88 percent of non-poor women with children had completed  			 high school or more, and 44 percent had at least some college  			 education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty percent of non-poor mothers were college graduates, compared  			 to less than 2 percent of AFDC mothers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The educational attainments of welfare mothers are about the same as  		those of poor women with children who are not currently dependent on AFDC. The  		1988 NHIS-CH found, for example, that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Nearly 59 percent of poor, non-AFDC mothers had completed high  			 school, but only 15 percent had some college training.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>At Least Forty Percent Are In Need of More Schooling</i></b></p>
<p>How many welfare mothers are in need of education in order to become  		"employable"? If we assume that a high school diploma or its equivalent is the  		minimum academic credential that most employers look for, then at least 40  		percent of welfare mothers need additional schooling.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Nearly a third of AFDC mothers have had one or more years of high  			 school, but have not obtained a diploma or GED certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 10 percent more have had only a grade-school education and  			 may thus require several years of schooling in order to complete high school or  			 obtain an equivalency certificate.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These conclusions need several qualifications. First, the proportion of  		AFDC mothers who are in need of education could well be higher if we used  		demonstrated mastery of basic skills, rather than possession of high school  		credentials, as an employability criterion. Considerable numbers of American  		students graduate from high school without being able to write coherently or  		solve arithmetic word problems, as community college English and math  		instructors will attest. Moreover, as shown below, AFDC mothers tend to score  		quite low on tests of academic skills.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the women who have only a grade school  		education are recent immigrants from Latin American or Asian countries where  		educational opportunities are more limited than they are in the U.S. Hence, the  		years of schooling attained by these women may not be a good index of their  		academic potential, or of the skills and knowledge they have picked up outside  		the classroom. Some of them may be able to qualify for a diploma or GED  		certificate relatively rapidly.</p>
<p>A final point is that there are many jobs for which a high school  		education is not really required, even though employers may demand it as a  		screening device. These jobs tend to be low-paying ones that offer few fringe  		benefits, however.</p>
<h3>THE PERFORMANCE OF WELFARE MOTHERS ON TESTS OF VERBAL  		AND MATH SKILLS IS WELL BELOW AVERAGE</h3>
<p>Whereas the average educational attainment of welfare mothers is higher  		than generally believed, their scores on tests of verbal and mathematical  		skills are distressingly low.</p>
<p>In 1980, a nationally representative sample of young women who were  		respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth was tested on the  		Armed Forces Qualification Test, a set of vocabulary, reading comprehension,  		and math tests of the kind that are found in most general scholastic aptitude  		batteries or college admissions tests. Those who would go on to receive welfare  		assistance scored significantly below other young women. Specifically, when the  		test scores were combined and scaled as done for IQ scores, with an overall  		mean set at 100 and an overall standard deviation of 15, then:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Young women who were welfare mothers in 1987, when they were aged  			 22-30, had a mean test score of 86, nearly one full standard deviation below  			 the mean for all women. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table4">Table 4</a>.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, the mean for non-poor mothers in the same age range was  			 99, slightly below the overall mean.<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> Women who had not (yet) had children in 1987  			 tended to be above average, with a mean score of 104.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers in families below the poverty line that had not received  			 AFDC during the year had the same average score as the AFDC mothers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Nearly Half Score Below The Eighteenth Percentile</i></b></p>
<p>There is a good deal of variation in test performance within the  		population of AFDC mothers. In the national study, the standard deviation of  		their test scores was 15, the same as the overall standard deviation. However,  		nearly half of the future AFDC mothers had scores below the 18th  		percentile<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> for all  		women, and only between a fifth and a quarter had average or above average  		scores.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Forty-nine percent of the AFDC mothers had test scores that were  			 below 85, i.e., more than one standard deviation below the overall  			 mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less than one-quarter of the AFDC mothers achieved scores of 100  			 (the overall mean) or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The test scores of AFDC mothers are such that most would not qualify  			 for entrance into the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Low Test Scores Characterize Welfare Mothers In All Major Ethnic  		Groups</i></b></p>
<p>Welfare and poverty status are associated with low test scores among  		black, Hispanic, and white women. However, both verbal and mathematical test  		scores are generally lower for blacks and Hispanics than for non-minority  		individuals, with a mean score of 79 for black AFDC mothers, 80 for Hispanic  		AFDC mothers, and 93 for white AFDC mothers.</p>
<p>Because of concerns about cultural bias in cognitive tests, alternative  		standard scores were computed that used as reference points the means and  		standard deviations for women in the appropriate racial or ethnic group. The  		revised scores show that white AFDC mothers are more deviant from the white  		mean than black or Hispanic mothers are from their respective means.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In terms of test scores standardized within each ethnic group, black  			 AFDC mothers had a mean score of 93, Hispanic mothers had a mean score of 91,  			 and white AFDC mothers had a mean score of 88.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These within-group differences are at least partly due to the fact that  		a smaller proportion of white women (4 percent) than of Hispanic women (12  		percent) or black women (20 percent) were receiving AFDC payments in the  		reference year.</p>
<p><b><i>Achievement Test Scores of Welfare Mothers Overlap Most with Those  		of Women Working at Blue Collar Occupations</i></b></p>
<p>Welfare mothers score lower on tests of verbal and mathematical skills  		than women who hold jobs in any of the major occupational categories. The  		average cognitive achievement scores for women varies according to the  		occupational class of the jobs they hold. The mean scores range from 91 for  		manual operatives and 95 for household workers and crafts and construction  		workers up to 105 for management and administrative workers and 108 for holders  		of professional and technical positions.<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table5">Table 5</a>.)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The average aptitude or achievement test score of welfare mothers is  			 significantly below the mean of even the lowest of the occupational  			 classes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As might be expected, however, there is a good deal of overlap between  		the distribution of test scores achieved by welfare mothers and the range of  		scores for women in some occupations. The degree of overlap depends on the  		specific occupational class. For example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The proportion of AFDC mothers who had test scores that fell within  			 or above the central range<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> for women who worked as manual operatives was  			 69 percent. For service occupations, it was 60 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, 45 percent of AFDC mothers had scores that were within  			 or above the range for women who worked at clerical and secretarial jobs, and  			 only 29 percent were within the range for professional and technical  			 occupations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These proportions may be thought of as the proportion of AFDC mothers  		who "qualify" for a given type of job, based on their combined verbal and  		mathematical test scores. Interestingly, whereas sizable numbers of welfare  		mothers have some employment experience (see below), very few have held the  		kinds of blue collar jobs for which they seem most "suited" (using test scores  		as the sole criterion of suitability).</p>
<h3>MOST WOMEN WITH PRESCHOOL CHILDREN ARE IN THE LABOR  		FORCE, BUT MOST WELFARE MOTHERS ARE NOT</h3>
<p>One of the changes introduced by the Family Support Act is the  		requirement that welfare mothers with children as young as 3 years participate  		in job search or educational activities. Some critics have argued that it would  		be better to let women with children this young remain at home with their  		children. On this point, the national survey data show that it is not  		out-of-the-ordinary for women with preschool-aged children to be in the labor  		force nowadays. Indeed, a majority of these women are working outside the  		home.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In March 1988, 59 percent of all women with children aged 35, and 65  			 percent of non-poor mothers, were working or looking for work. Thirty-eight  			 percent of all women with children in this age range were working full-time, as  			 were 45 percent of non-poor mothers. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table6">Table 6</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, 29 percent of welfare mothers with children aged 3-5  			 were working or looking for work, and only 8 percent were employed  			 full-time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, demanding that welfare mothers with young children get a job or  		take part in vocational training can in some sense be viewed as moving them  		into the mainstream. Given the low pay scales of the jobs for which most  		welfare mothers are qualified; however, even full-time work is not likely to  		raise their families above the poverty threshold. In any event, it is certainly  		legitimate to ask whether it is preferable from the child's perspective to have  		the mother at home or working at a low-wage job, and also to raise questions  		about the quality of the substitute care that the child will receive when the  		mother is working or in training.</p>
<h3>MOST WELFARE MOTHERS HAVE HAD LITTLE WORK  		EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p>As would be expected, most welfare mothers are not currently employed,  		or at least most report that they are not working. National surveys find that  		between one-fifth and one-quarter of all women who have received AFDC payments  		during the past year are employed at the time of the survey, and 10-12 percent  		more say they are looking for work. Thus, a third or more are in the labor  		force at any given time. Even more report having done some paid work or  		searching for work over the course of a year.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>More than 43 percent of U.S. women who received AFDC payments in  			 1987 also did some paid work (34 percent) or looked for work (9 percent) during  			 that year. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table7">Table 7</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less than 20 percent did any full-time work, though, and only 4  			 percent reported working full-time throughout the year.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Given the low monthly amounts paid by AFDC in most states, some analysts  		believe that many welfare mothers must be working on the side" or  		engaging in other remunerative activities, be they legal or illegal, just to  		make ends meet. In a recent study by Kathryn Edin of Northwestern University,  		the income and expenditures of 25 welfare families in a single Midwestern city  		were studied in depth (Jencks &amp; Edin, 1990a &amp; b). The findings suggest  		that unreported employment and illegal earnings are indeed widespread, though  		one should be cautious about generalizing from this small study to the welfare  		population as a whole.</p>
<p>The NLSY used traditional survey methods, but re-contacted respondents  		annually over a decade. It found that the majority of women aged 22-30 who  		received welfare payments in 1987 reported some work experience over the  		previous five years, but not much. The mean number of weeks worked by the  		welfare mothers was 59 out of a possible 260 weeks. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table8">Table  		8</a>.)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>About 57 percent of the welfare mothers in the NLSY had worked less  			 than a year in the last five years, and 27 percent had not worked at all during  			 that period. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, 20 percent of the welfare mothers had worked for  			 the equivalent of 2 years or more during the previous half-decade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By comparison, 43 percent of poor, non-AFDC mothers had worked 2  			 years or more, as had 71 percent of the non-poor mothers, and 90 percent of the  			 non-mothers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>One in Six Has Had Vocational Training</i></b></p>
<p>Among the mothers receiving AFDC in the NLSY data base, about one in six  		-- 17 percent -- reported getting vocational training during one or more of the  		preceding five years. This compares with 11 percent of poor, non-AFDC mothers,  		4 percent of non-poor mothers, and 5 percent of women aged 22-30 who were not  		yet mothers. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table8">Table 8</a>.)</p>
<h3>ONE-THIRD OF WELFARE MOTHERS HAVE NEGATIVE VIEWS ABOUT  		MOTHERS WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME</h3>
<p>How do welfare mothers feel about the prospect of working for pay  		outside the home? When AFDC mothers are asked whether they agree or disagree  		with statements such as: "A woman's place is in the home;" or "A working wife  		feels more useful;" or "Women are happier in traditional roles;" a majority  		come down on the side of the traditional homemaker role. Only about a third  		seem to have strongly negative feelings about working, however.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Among women aged 22-30 who received AFDC payments in 1987, 32  			 percent held negative attitudes about women with children being employed  			 outside the home, and another 29 percent had views that leaned toward the  			 traditional orientation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About a fifth of the AFDC mothers had attitudes that were clearly  			 favorable to the possibility of mothers working, with another 19 percent  			 leaning in that direction. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table9">Table 9</a>.)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Poor, non-AFDC mothers show a similar distribution of attitudes, even  		though, as a group, they are more likely to be employed regularly or to have  		been so in the recent past. The majority of non-poor women who have become  		mothers in their twenties also endorse or lean toward endorsing the homemaker  		role, though less so than welfare or non-welfare poor mothers. The majority of  		women in their twenties who are not yet mothers endorse or lean towards  		acceptance of maternal employment and other non-traditional roles for  		women.</p>
<p>In sum, although the evidence regarding sex role attitudes indicates  		that a substantial minority of welfare mothers have reservations about paid  		employment, two-thirds seem at least open is considering the possibility.</p>
<h3>WHEN THEY DO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME/ WELFARE MOTHERS TEND  		TO BE EMPLOYED IN SERVICE JOBS</h3>
<p>When they do enter the labor force, the kinds of jobs welfare mothers  		work at tend to be largely in the service sector, meaning jobs such as counter  		workers in fast food chains, janitorial workers, and the like. Many of these  		jobs have low salary levels and minimal fringe benefits. Sales and clerical  		jobs are the second- and third-most common types of jobs at which welfare  		mothers work, and light factory work ranks fourth in frequency.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In 1988, among women who received AFDC at some point during the last  			 year, and who were employed during the previous two weeks, 41 percent worked at  			 service occupations. By contrast, only 13 percent of employed non-poor mothers  			 worked at service jobs. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table10">Table 10</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly 16 percent of the AFDC mothers worked at sales jobs, and 15  			 percent at clerical and administrative support occupations. The fraction  			 working at sales jobs was somewhat higher than the proportion among non-poor  			 mothers -- 11 percent, whereas the fraction working at clerical jobs was only  			 about half that among non-poor mothers -- 29 percent.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Not surprisingly, given their relatively low levels of educational  		attainment and academic skills, welfare mothers are much less likely than  		non-poor mothers to be working in managerial and executive positions, and at  		professional and technical jobs. Less than one in ten employed AFDC mothers  		works at one of these higher-level white-collar jobs. Also not startling is the  		finding that AFDC mothers are more likely than non-poor mothers to be working  		as unskilled helpers and laborers, and as private household service workers.  		However, some may find it surprising that so few welfare mothers work at these  		kinds of jobs.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Only 4 percent of the employed AFDC mothers surveyed in 1988  			 reported working as helpers and laborers, and less than 3 percent reported  			 working as cleaning ladies, baby sitters, or other household service  			 workers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is possible, of course, that much of this type of work is done  		off the books," and hence is not reported to survey interviewers.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy are the small numbers of AFDC mothers who work at the  		kinds of blue-collar jobs that tend to be better paying and are more likely to  		offer significant employee benefits. These include skilled production work,  		craft and repair jobs, and truck-driving and transportation occupations. These  		are, of course, "non-traditional" jobs for women and are not common among  		employed mothers in general.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Only two percent of employed AFDC mothers surveyed in 1988 worked in  			 precision production, craft and repair occupations, and less than  			 one-and-a-half percent worked in transportation and material moving.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Poor, Non-AFDC Mothers Are More Likely To Work In Factory Jobs and  		Farming</i></b></p>
<p>The occupational profile for employed mothers who now receive or have  		recently received AFDC (as of the survey date) is quite similar to that for  		employed poor mothers who have not received AFDC within the last year. One  		noteworthy difference is that poor non-AFDC mothers are more likely to be  		working in factory jobs, and somewhat less likely than AFDC mothers to be  		working in service jobs and low-level sales and clerical positions. Non-AFDC  		poor mothers are also more likely to be in farming and outdoor occupations,  		reflecting the more rural character of the non-AFDC poor population.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Just over 15 percent of employed poor, non-AFDC mothers surveyed in  			 1988 were working as machine operators and assemblers, compared to 9 percent of  			 AFDC mothers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly 3 percent of employed poor, non-AFDC mothers were working in  			 farming, forestry, and fishing occupations, compared with less than one percent  			 of AFDC mothers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>ALMOST HALF OF WELFARE MOTHERS ARE LONG-TERM RECIPIENTS  		</h3>
<p>Although the majority of women who get any AFDC benefits do so for only  		a limited time, nearly half receive benefits over extended periods.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Among women aged 22-30 in 1987 who had gotten welfare at some point  			 during the 12 months preceding the survey date, 46 percent qualified as  			 long-term recipients. That is, they had received AFDC during more than three of  			 the preceding five years. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table8">Table 8</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-third of the women who got AFDC at some point during the  			 preceding 12 months had received benefits for between a year and three years,  			 and about a fifth more had received benefits for a year or less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the currently poor mothers who were not on welfare during  			 1987, 31 percent had received AFDC for some period during the previous five  			 years. The same was true of 10 percent of mothers who were not in poverty  			 during 1987. A total of 13 percent of all U.S. women aged 22-30 had received  			 welfare for some time during the preceding five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term recipients made up about one-third of all women who had  			 received welfare at any time in the last five years.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As might be expected, the characteristics of long-term welfare  		recipients are quite different than those of women who receive welfare for  		relatively short periods of time. The differences are described in a later  		section of this report.</p>
<h3>NEARLY ONE-FIFTH OF THE WOMEN RECEIVING AFDC HAS A  		HEALTH LIMITATION</h3>
<p>There are at least two contrasting reasons why mothers who receive  		welfare assistance might be expected to be in somewhat worse health than  		mothers in middle-income families. One is that low-education, low-income women  		live in circumstances that put them at greater risk of illness or injury than  		women in more affluent families. Women from disadvantaged backgrounds are also  		more apt than middle-class women to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as  		smoking. At the same time, they are less likely than middle-class women to get  		high-quality medical care.</p>
<p>A different line of reasoning is that women with pre-existing chronic  		disorders -- physical or psychological -- might be more prone to be on welfare  		because their conditions interfere with steady employment and career  		advancement. The conditions would have to be ones that are relatively ambiguous  		or not especially severe, though, because having a clear-cut, medically  		determined physical or mental impairment can qualify the woman for Supplemental  		Security Income (SSI). These benefits are a good deal more generous than those  		received under the AFDC program (U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, 1990, pp.  		669-702).</p>
<p>Analyses of earlier national data from the Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (Adler, 1988) gave evidence that AFDC mothers do have a  		relatively high prevalence of health problems, especially back conditions. In  		line with the earlier findings, data from the 1988 National Health Interview  		Survey show that welfare mothers are significantly less likely than other  		mothers to be in top physical condition and more likely to have a health  		condition that limits their employment possibilities.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>AFDC mothers surveyed in 1988 were about half as likely as non-poor  			 mothers to rate themselves in "excellent" health -- 21 percent to 38 percent.  			 The AFDC mothers were four times as likely -- 20 percent versus 5 percent -- to  			 rate their health as "fair or poor.<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table11">Table 11</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFDC mothers were more than twice as prone as non-poor mothers -- 18  			 percent to 7 percent -- to report having a condition that made it difficult for  			 them to work at certain kinds of jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFDC mothers were nearly twice as likely as non-poor mothers -- 20  			 percent versus 11 percent -- to have spent 8 or more days laid up in bed in the  			 last 12 months due to illness or injury.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The health status of welfare mothers is quite similar to that of poor  		mothers who have not received AFDC recently. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Among poor non-AFDC mothers surveyed in 1988, 17 percent were in  			 fair or poor health; 15 percent had a health-related activity limitation; and  			 17 percent had 8 or more bed-disability days in the previous 12  			 months.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Despite the higher prevalence of health problems among welfare mothers,  		it is worth noting that four out of five welfare mothers are in good health,  		with no obvious medical conditions that would constrain their ability to work  		at household chores or paid jobs.</p>
<h3>ONE IN FOUR WELFARE MOTHERS REPORTS ALCOHOL-RELATED  		PROBLEMS </h3>
<p>There has been a good deal of speculation about possible links between  		welfare dependency and alcohol or drug abuse, but there is a dearth of reliable  		evidence about the extent of substance abuse in the welfare population.  		Regrettably, the major household survey on substance use and abuse, sponsored  		by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is not informative because it  		does not include questions that would permit the identification of AFDC  		recipients. Although there is some information on self-reported alcohol  		problems and drug abuse among welfare mothers in the NLSY data base, the  		questions are limited in scope. Moreover, under-reporting of drug use is always  		an issue in self-report surveys (Mensch &amp; Kandel, 1988). Thus, the NLSY  		evidence has to be treated as suggestive, but not definitive.</p>
<p>What the NLSY data show is that alcohol-related problems were reported  		by more than a quarter of women aged 22-30 who received AFDC payments in 1987.  		The reports dated from 1985, which was when the series of questions about  		drinking and drug use was asked. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table12">Table 12</a>.)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The proportion of AFDC mothers reporting one or more alcohol-related  			 problems -- 26 percent -- was twice the proportion reported by non-poor mothers  			 -- 12 percent -- and significantly higher than the proportion among poor  			 mothers who had not received AFDC -- 16 percent. However, the frequency of  			 alcohol-related problems among AFDC mothers was not greatly different from that  			 found among non-mothers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>An alcohol-related problem was defined as an affirmative response to the  		following type of question: "Has drinking ever interfered with your work on a  		job?"; and, "During the past year, have you awakened the next day not being  		able to remember things you had done while drinking?".</p>
<p>Questions in the NLSY about drug use were less detailed than those about  		drinking. There was, however, an item about the age at which the respondent  		first used marijuana and another about the age at first use of other illicit  		drugs. The findings suggest that AFDC mothers are slightly more likely than  		other mothers to have first used marijuana in adolescence and less likely to  		have never used it, but the differences are not statistically significant.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Nearly half of AFDC mothers aged 22-30 in 1987 -- versus 42 percent  			 of non-poor mothers -- had first used marijuana as teenagers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirty-five percent of AFDC mothers -- as opposed to 43 percent of  			 non-poor mothers -- said they had never used marijuana.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The marijuana use of poor, non-AFDC mothers was similar to that of the  		non-poor mothers, whereas non-mothers were relatively high in early marijuana  		use, like the AFDC mothers.</p>
<p>As with marijuana, mothers receiving AFDC and non-mothers tended to  		report earlier use and greater overall use than non-poor mothers of other  		illicit drugs. Differences were slight, although, in this case, statistically  		significant.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Nearly one-quarter of the mothers who received AFDC assistance  			 reported using other illicit drugs before the age of 21; 73 percent said they  			 had never used such drugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nineteen percent of non-poor mothers had used other drugs before age  			 21; 78 percent said they never used such drugs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, the available evidence from national surveys suggests that  		problems stemming from alcohol and drug use may be somewhat more frequent among  		AFDC recipients than among other poor women and non-poor women with children.  		The differences do not seem substantial, though. It is important to stress the  		limitations of the available data and the fact that these data were collected  		before the height of the "crack" epidemic. Clearly, more thorough and  		up-to-date data on this topic are needed.</p>
<h3>MOTHERS WHO RECEIVE AFDC ARE PRONE TO DEPRESSION</h3>
<p>There is reason to believe that AFDC mothers are more prone to mental  		health problems, especially depression, than are non-poor women with children.  		Obviously, this could affect their chances of finding and keeping paid  		employment. In the first wave of the National Survey of Children, mothers with  		children aged 6-11 were asked: "How often do you have days when you feel sad  		and blue?".</p>
<ul><li>
<p>One-third of single mothers on AFDC reported feeling this way  			 "fairly" or "very often." By contrast, only 8 percent of married mothers not on  			 AFDC reported such frequent feelings of depression.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Although only a single question was used to assess maternal depression  		in the National Survey of Children, the findings are supported by several local  		studies that used longer scales and obtained similar results. The local studies  		include two evaluations of innovative welfare-to-work programs, the "New  		Chance" project (Polit, Quint, &amp; Riccio, 1988; Polit, 1990, personal  		communication), and the Minority Female Single Parent Demonstration program  		(Maynard, Kisker, &amp; Kerachsky, 1990; Maynard, 1990, personal  		communication), as well as the "Family Independence Study," a survey of AFDC  		mothers and two comparison groups in the State of Washington (Weeks <b>et</b>  		<b>al</b>, 1990).</p>
<p>In the Washington State study, for example, a 10-item scale developed by  		Pearlin (Pearlin, Lieberman, Menaghan, &amp; Mullan, 1981) was used to measure  		depression. Of women in the study who were receiving public assistance, 13  		percent had extremely high scores<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> on the scale. That proportion was four times  		higher than the proportion with high depression scores among non-poor women,  		and about 50 percent higher than the equivalent proportion among low-income  		women who were not receiving public assistance (Weeks <b>et</b> <b>al</b>,  		1990, Chapter 5, p. 5).</p>
<p>What is not yet clear is how many AFDC recipients have mental health  		problems severe enough to require clinical treatment, or anti-depressant  		medication, and how many would be helped by constructive changes in their life  		circumstances. Relevant to the latter issue is the finding from the Family  		independence Study that there was less depression among welfare mothers who  		worked in the previous year than among those who did not. However, the reason  		for this association is not known. In addition, a number of studies have found  		depression to be more frequent among low-income women who are divorced or  		never-married than among those who are married (Zill, 1978; Belle, 1982).</p>
<h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF LONG-TERM WELFARE RECIPIENTS</h3>
<p>Long-term welfare dependency is a source of particular concern to policy  		makers and the public (Bane and Ellwood, 1986, 1983). Those who remain on  		welfare over long periods account for a high proportion of all welfare costs  		and undermine the support or the program as a temporary help for parents in  		times of need. For this reason, the Family Support Act has identified long-term  		recipients as a focal group to receive help in becoming economically  		independent. Long-term recipients are defined in the FSA as persons who have  		received AFDC in three of the last five years. What are the characteristics of  		this group with whom service providers will be attempting to work?</p>
<p>For these analyses of respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of  		Youth (NLSY), a long-term welfare recipient was a woman aged 22-30 in 1987 who  		was a mother and who received AFDC payments for three or more of the previous  		five years. The characteristics of these women are compared with: mothers who  		had received welfare during the previous five years but who received payments  		only during one or two years; mothers who were in poverty at the time of the  		1987 survey but who never received welfare during the previous five years;  		mothers who were not in poverty at the time of the 1987 survey and who never  		received welfare during the previous five years; and women of the same age  		range who were not mothers as of 1987.</p>
<p>Making these distinctions reveals that these groups are strikingly  		different in a variety of ways.</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Recipients Are More Likely to Have Been Teen  		Mothers</i></b></p>
<p>There is a clear association between early childbearing and long-term  		welfare recipiency. Forty-three percent of the women who are long-term  		recipients were age 17 or younger when their first child was born, compared  		with just a quarter of shorter-term recipients and poor non-recipients. Only  		one in ten non-poor mothers was as young as 17 when her first child was  		born.</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Recipients A-re Apt to Be Black or Hispanic</i></b></p>
<p>A third of black women in their twenties report that they have received  		AFDC during the previous five years, half of them for three years or longer. A  		fifth of Hispanic women in their twenties have received AFDC, a bit less than  		half for three years or more. On the other hand, only one in ten women who are  		neither African-American nor Hispanic received AFDC during the previous five  		years, and only 2 percent received AFDC as long as three of the previous five  		years.</p>
<p><b><i>Most Long-Term Recipients Have Not Completed High  		School</i></b></p>
<p>As one would expect, educational attainment and welfare history are  		strongly associated. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table13">Table 13</a>). Among women who are  		long-term welfare recipients, 43 percent lack any type of high school  		certificate. However, a third do hold a diploma and another 13 percent have a  		GED, while 12 percent have completed more than twelve years of schooling. The  		proportion lacking a regular high school diploma falls from 56 percent among  		long-term recipients, to 44 percent among both shorter-term recipients and poor  		non-recipients, to 19 percent among mothers who were not poor, to 7 percent  		among women in their twenties who are not mothers.</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Recipients Have Larger Families</i></b></p>
<p>Large families can increase poverty both by making labor force  		participation more difficult for mothers and by increasing the demands for  		support, thereby increasing the proportion who are poor at any given income  		level. Long-term welfare recipients studied in the NLSY are not only more often  		poorly educated, they are more likely to have large families. One in ten have  		four or more children, though they are only in their twenties. Three in ten  		have three or more children, as do two in ten shorter-term recipients, and one  		in ten non-poor mothers. However, poor mothers who have never been on AFDC also  		have relatively large families, with three in ten having three or more  		children. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table14">Table 14</a>.)</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Recipients Are Less Likely to Have a Man in the House  		</i></b></p>
<p>Differences in the proportions having a spouse or father-figure in the  		home are due in part to the fact that AFDC is primarily a program for  		non-married mothers. They also clearly reflect the contributions of a male  		earner in helping families to escape poverty. Among long-term welfare  		recipients, a father, spouse or partner is present in a third of the  		households. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table15">Table 15</a>.) This is not a trivial proportion  		and suggests that we need to know more about the characteristics of these men,  		such as their education, health, ability, and work experience. Other family  		types are more likely, though, to have a father spouse or partner present,  		increasing from 53 percent among the shorter-term welfare recipients, to 60  		percent among poor families that never received welfare, to 90 percent among  		non-poor families.</p>
<p><b><i>The Cognitive Achievement Test Scores of Long-Term Recipients Are  		Striking Low</i></b></p>
<p>When the distribution of women's scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying  		Test (AFQT) taken in 1980 by participants in the National Longitudinal Survey  		of Youth was examined, the disadvantage of the long-term welfare recipients was  		quite striking. On a scale with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15,  		the mean score of the long-term recipients was 84, whereas that of the  		shorter-term recipients was 89. Only 13 percent of the long-term recipients  		attained scores that were above average, compared with 28 percent of the  		shorter-term recipients, 23 percent of the poor non-recipients, 54 percent of  		the non-poor mothers, and 67 percent of the non-mothers. In fact, 56 percent of  		the long-term welfare recipients scored below one standard deviation under the  		mean, a very-low score obtained by only 17 percent of the entire sample of NLSY  		women. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table16">Table 16</a>.)</p>
<p><b><i>The Work Histories of Long-Term Recipients Are Relatively  		Sporadic</i></b></p>
<p>In the case of virtually all measures of work, training and transfer  		receipt, the long-term AFDC recipient stands out as having received more  		benefits and worked less during the previous five years. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table17">Table 17</a>.) Long-term welfare recipients were much more  		likely to have received more than $10,000 in welfare benefits during the  		previous three years than other groups. This is not surprising, given the  		definition of the groups; but the magnitude of the difference is striking.  		Virtually half of the long-term recipients obtained more than $10,000 in  		benefits, while only a handful of persons in any of the other groups received  		that much.</p>
<p>One might anticipate that long-term recipients have a weaker work  		history. The magnitude of the differences is quite dramatic however, with 58  		percent of long-term recipients recording no weeks worked during the previous  		year. A third of the mothers in the shorter-term receipt group and a third of  		the poor mothers who never received AFDC reported zero weeks worked in the  		previous year as well, compared with less than a quarter of the non-poor  		mothers. As one might expect, nearly all of the non-mothers were employed at  		least a week.</p>
<p>To examine employment from another perspective, the proportion who  		worked 41 or more weeks during the previous year was also tabulated.  		Three-quarters of non-mothers and half of non-poor mothers maintained this  		extensive an attachment to the labor force, as did three in ten poor mothers  		who never received AFDC and a third of those who ever received AFDC. However,  		only 16 percent of the long-term recipients worked as many as 41 weeks.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of the long-term recipients never reported paid  		employment during any of the previous five NLSY interviews, while only one in  		ten indicated that they had worked in two or more of the previous five years.  		In fact, 61 percent indicated that they were out of the labor force during more  		than half of the previous year. In all of the measures of labor force  		attachment, non-mothers show the greatest attachment, followed by a substantial  		commitment among non-poor mothers. Poor mothers who have received AFDC but are  		not long-term recipients are generally pretty similar to poor women who have  		never received AFDC in terms of their own labor force attachment.</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Recipients Cite Child Care, Illness, and Inability To  		Find Work As Reasons for Not Working</i></b></p>
<p>When the reasons given by women for not looking for work during a period  		out of the labor force in the previous year are summarized, no one single  		reason stands out. Personal and miscellaneous reasons account for about a third  		of all reasons. The frequency of this type of "reason" does not vary across  		welfare/income groups. What does vary is the reason, "Didn't want to work,"  		provided by <b>fewer</b> long-term recipients than any other group. On the  		other hand, long-term recipients are more likely to cite illness, child care  		problems, school attendance, and an inability to find work as reasons that they  		were not seeking employment. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table18">Table 18</a>.)</p>
<p><i><b>Nearly One in Ten Long-Term Recipient Has a Health Limitation  		</b></i></p>
<p>Among all women in their twenties, only about one in 20 has a health  		limitation that prevents work or limits either the amount or kind of work that  		the woman is able to do. Women who have received welfare are more likely to  		have a condition that prevents work altogether than other mothers or  		non-mothers. Among poor mothers, though, they are not more likely to report  		that they are limited in the amount or kind of work that they can do, nor are  		they less likely to report that they have no health limitation of any kind. The  		difference lies in the higher proportion who have a condition that prevents  		work. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table19">Table 19</a>.)</p>
<p><b><i>The Sex-Role Attitudes of Long-Term Recipients Are Similar to  		Those of Other Mothers</i></b></p>
<p>One variable that clearly divides the women according to whether or not  		they are mothers is the measure of sex role attitudes. Not quite a third of the  		mothers hold traditional attitudes irrespective of their welfare or poverty  		status, compared with just 17 percent of the non-mothers. Whether these  		attitudes explain women's decisions to become mothers or reflect their  		experiences as mothers, students, and employees cannot be ascertained from  		these data. However, it is relevant to note that the greater transfer receipt  		and lesser labor force attachment of long-term recipients is unlikely to be due  		to their attitudes, since similar proportions of mothers who are not long-term  		recipients hold traditional sex role attitudes. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table17">Table  		17</a>.)</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Recipients Have Lower Self-Esteem</i></b></p>
<p>On the other hand, long-term welfare recipients are more likely to have  		low self-esteem. That is, they are more likely to agree with statements such  		as, "I certainly feel useless at times" and "I feel I do not have much to be  		proud of." However, the proportions of mothers with low self-esteem are nearly  		as high among poor mothers and mothers who have ever received AFDC. Non-poor  		mothers and non-mothers are substantially less likely to feel negatively about  		themselves than are long-term recipients, with only 29 and 24 percent  		respectively being low in self-esteem. (<a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#table17">Table 17</a>.)  		Again, whether the low self-esteem of long-term AFDC recipients results from  		their dependency upon public support or contributes to their inability to  		become independent cannot be ascertained from these data.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>When women who receive welfare benefits are compared with other women,  		both poor and not poor, in national sample surveys, it becomes clear that  		welfare mothers are different from non-poor mothers in a number of ways. At the  		same time, the data show that there is considerable diversity within the  		welfare population. In particular, long-term welfare recipients differ in  		important respects from short-term recipients. On the other hand, in many ways  		welfare recipients are quite similar to poor women who do not receive welfare.  		These findings have significant implications for the Family Support Act and  		other efforts to reduce family poverty and welfare dependency.</p>
<h3>MOTHERS WHO RECEIVE AFDC ARE DIFFERENT FROM NON-POOR  		MOTHERS</h3>
<p>Women who receive welfare benefits differ in a number of personal  		attributes and background characteristics from women in families that are not  		below the official poverty line. On the average, welfare mothers have less  		education, less work experience, more limited kinds of job experience, and more  		negative attitudes toward mothers working outside the home than non-poor  		mothers do. They have less self-confidence and less sense of control over their  		own destinies. Also, welfare mothers are more likely to have a physical  		condition that limits their ability to work regularly and reliably.</p>
<p>Welfare mothers score substantially lower on the kinds of verbal and  		mathematical tests that are usually taken to measure intellectual achievement  		or scholastic aptitude. With an average score of 86 relative to a population  		mean of 100, welfare mothers are nearly a full standard deviation below  		non-poor mothers, whose mean cognitive achievement score is close to that of  		women in general. Nearly half of all welfare mothers score at or below the 18th  		percentile of the distribution of achievement scores, and most would not be  		accepted as recruits in the U.S. Armed Forces. The finding of substantially  		lower achievement or aptitude levels holds true of welfare mothers within each  		of the major ethnic groups: blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>Certainly, there is notable variability within the population of welfare  		mothers; however, within each race/ethnicity group, economic misfortune is far  		more likely to strike those in the lowest segments of the distribution of  		talent or schooling than those with average or above-average skills and  		educational attainments. School failure or a lack of educational opportunity  		seem, therefore, like critical factors in the genesis of economic  		dependency.</p>
<h3>THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DIVERSITY IN THE WELFARE  		POPULATION</h3>
<p>Although welfare recipients are different from more affluent women on  		average, the statistical comparisons also show that there is considerable  		diversity within the population of welfare mothers. Based on the NLSY sample of  		women aged 22-30, for example, nearly a quarter of welfare mothers have  		cognitive achievement scores that are average or above average. Another 30  		percent have test scores that are below average, but within one standard  		deviation of the mean. The same source reveals that 20 percent of welfare  		mothers have worked for 2 years or more during the last half-decade. On the  		other hand, more than a quarter have not worked at all in the last five years.  		This diversity suggests that programs aimed at getting women off welfare and  		into the labor force on a permanent basis are not likely to have uniform  		effects over all segments of the dependent population. The implications for the  		"JOBS" program and similar efforts are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<h3>LONG-TERM RECIPIENTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM SHORT-TERM  		RECIPIENTS</h3>
<p>Women who receive welfare for extended periods of time have different  		characteristics than those who are on welfare for limited time-periods only.  		The long-term recipients (defined as those who receive welfare for 3 or more  		years in a 5-year period) have lower cognitive achievement scores, less  		education, and somewhat lower self-esteem than short-term recipients. Not  		surprisingly, the long-term recipients are less likely to have engaged in paid  		employment for extended time-periods, and more likely not to have worked at all  		in the recent past.</p>
<p>On the other hand, long- and short-term recipients do not differ  		significantly in their attitudes about maternal employment or in their  		likelihood of having health conditions that limit employment. Also, even  		short-term welfare recipients are substantially worse off than non-poor mothers  		in terms of academic achievement, years of schooling, self-esteem, and history  		of stable employment.</p>
<h3>WELFARE MOTHERS ARE NOT GREATLY DIFFERENT FROM POOR  		MOTHERS WHO ARE NOT ON WELFARE</h3>
<p>Whereas welfare mothers differ markedly from mothers whose families are  		not below the official poverty line, they are not very different in personal  		attributes or background characteristics from poor mothers who are not  		receiving welfare. For example, the average achievement score of mothers below  		the poverty line who have <b>not</b> gotten any AFDC in the last 12 months is  		identical to that of poor mothers who have received welfare during that period.  		Furthermore, both groups show relatively low levels of self-esteem and fairly  		traditional (i.e., negative) attitudes about the desirability of women with  		young children working outside the home.</p>
<p>The two groups do differ in their likelihood of being married and the  		extent of their participation in the labor force. Compared to welfare mothers,  		non-welfare poor mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely to be currently  		married and one-and-a-half times more likely to have ever married. Also,  		non-welfare poor mothers ages 22-30 are twice as likely as welfare mothers in  		the same age range to have worked for two years or more during the last five  		years. However, more than a third of non-welfare poor mothers have worked for  		less than a year in the last five. In addition, more than 3-0 percent of poor  		women who have not gotten welfare in the last 12 months have received AFDC at  		some point in the last five years.</p>
<p>When short-term welfare recipients are compared with poor mothers who  		have not received AFDC at all in the previous five years, the two groups appear  		quite similar on most of the study dimensions, including recent work history.  		By contrast, long-term welfare recipients are worse off than the non-AFDC poor  		mothers on most measures of "human capital" and employment history.</p>
<p>The similarities between the welfare and non-welfare poor call into  		question arguments that welfare dependence is primarily the result of a learned  		set of negative attitudes and behaviors. (This conclusion must be tempered,  		however, by the limited range of measures on which the two groups can be  		compared using national survey data. It may be that there are important  		differences in depression or work-related attitudes, for example, that are not  		adequately tapped by the existing data.)</p>
<p>The lack of strong differences between poor mothers on welfare and poor  		non-welfare mothers also illustrates the point that even substantial increases  		in the labor force participation of welfare mothers will not necessarily bring  		these mothers out of poverty.</p>
<h3>WHEN THEY ENTER THE LABOR FORCE, WELFARE MOTHERS WORK IN  		A NARROW RANGE OF OCCUPATIONS</h3>
<p>One other significant finding of the survey comparisons is that, when  		they do work, mothers who receive welfare assistance tend to be employed in a  		limited range of occupations. These are largely in the service sector, in  		low-level sales and clerical jobs, and light factory work. Very few AFDC  		mothers work in higher-caliber, blue-collar occupations, such as skilled  		production work, craft and repair jobs, or teamster positions, that might offer  		better wages and more favorable employee benefit packages than the kinds of  		vocations in which they are now employed. This is also true for poor women who  		are not on AFDC.</p>
<h3>IMPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>The findings summarized above have a number of implications for the  		Family Support Act and other attempts to encourage dependent adults to become  		gainfully employed and economically self-sufficient. For example, the  		relatively low educational attainments and academic skill levels that were  		found to be typical of welfare mothers would seem to imply that the Family  		Support Act's emphasis on skill building or "human capital development" is well  		justified. What the data do not indicate is how successful the educational  		efforts that will be supported by the JOBS program can be at boosting the  		earning power of AFDC mothers.</p>
<p>To the extent that the low test scores of welfare mothers reflect not  		just deficiencies in their education and training but limitations in their  		ability to learn, the data may point to rather pessimistic conclusions about  		the eventual payoff of training efforts. There is little doubt that the  		academic skills of many welfare mothers could be improved by measurable amounts  		through high-quality adult education. This may enhance their parenting  		abilities and improve their productivity, but it is not clear that it will be  		sufficient to raise the potential wage rates of some or perhaps even many to  		levels that would keep their families out of poverty. Many welfare mothers have  		a long way to go to become "college material," yet college-level training is a  		prerequisite for most "good jobs" in today's economy, particularly for jobs in  		white-collar occupations. If the welfare mother goes to work at a job paying at  		or near minimum-wage levels, she is not going to earn enough on her own, even  		if she works full-time, year-round, to keep her family out of poverty.</p>
<p>Thus, the test score data add fuel to concerns that the JOBS program may  		succeed only in converting the welfare poor into the working poor. These  		concerns are reinforced by the survey comparisons showing many similarities  		between non-AFDC poor mothers and welfare mothers. The non-AFDC mothers have  		worked significantly more than the welfare mothers, yet they remain in poverty.  		Moving many women from welfare poor to working poor may seem like good news for  		taxpayers; but it may not portend major positive changes in the lives of the  		women themselves, or in the life prospects of their children. On the other  		hand, if education and training activities are successful in bringing women  		into steady employment at good wages, both taxpayers and families would  		benefit.</p>
<p><b><i>JOBS Is Likely To Benefit Some Welfare Mothers More Than  		Others</i></b></p>
<p>The diversity in skills, educational attainment, and employment  		experience that is found within the welfare population makes it likely that  		JOBS and similar programs will have much more of an impact on some groups of  		welfare mothers than on others. Specifically, when welfare recipients are  		arrayed along a dimension such as academic skills, educational attainment, or  		work experience, it seems probable that work-to-welfare programs will have  		their greatest effects on the lives of those women who are in the second  		quartile of the distribution.</p>
<p>Women in the top quartile of the distribution possess average to  		above-average skills and seem quite job ready. Most of them have  		already had a good deal of employment experience and are likely to find stable  		employment eventually, with or without a program to encourage and assist them.  		It is possible, of course, that some local programs will concentrate on these  		low-risk women in order to meet participation quotas or make it appear that  		much good is being accomplished. But if program participants in the highest  		quartile were compared with a similar group of controls who were not subject to  		the program, a good bet is that many of the controls would also be found to be  		moving from welfare to stable employment; i.e., little specific impact of the  		program would be observed (Gueron, Pauly, &amp; Lougy, 1990).</p>
<p>In the bottom half of the welfare distribution, skill levels are  		extremely low, employment experience is meager, and feelings of helplessness  		and hopelessness are commonplace. The challenge of getting many of these women  		into stable employment that will bring families out of poverty is daunting  		indeed. Evaluation studies by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation  		(MDRC) and others on earlier welfare-to-work programs have found that it is  		difficult to make significant improvements in the incomes of participants or to  		produce large reductions in the dependency of this large segment of the welfare  		population.</p>
<p>By contrast, in the second quartile of the distribution, skills are  		below average, but not extremely low. Employment experience is more common, if  		sporadic. Feelings of paralyzing depression and self-doubt are not as  		prevalent. It is here, the MDRC studies have found, that real, albeit modest,  		effects of welfare-to-work programs are likely to be observed. It is also  		important to realize that the JOBS program has a heavier educational component  		than the programs of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Focusing on this segment of the population might still be seen as  		"creaming," given that the clear intent of the Family Support Act is to try to  		assist the long-term welfare-dependent. But if training and job-search programs  		can assist significant numbers of these women to find and keep stable jobs,  		that is hardly an achievement whose importance should be minimized.</p>
<p><b><i>JOBS Should Broaden Vocational Options and Attend to  		Non-Educational Needs of Welfare Recipients</i></b></p>
<p>There are two additional implications for welfare-to-work programs that  		emerge from the survey data on welfare mothers. One is that such programs need  		to broaden the range of vocational options that low-income women consider and  		do more to prepare and place their clients in non-traditional jobs for females,  		such as truck- or bus-driving, skilled production work, or craft and repair  		occupations.</p>
<p>The second is that welfare-to-work programs must attend to the  		non-educational needs of that portion of the welfare population who have other  		kinds of problems that undermine their employability. This means arranging for  		medical care and rehabilitation for chronic physical conditions, counseling and  		medication, where appropriate, for emotional problems, and treatment programs  		for substance abuse, for those individuals who need help. By insuring that  		those welfare mothers who need them get services such as these, the JOBS  		program would enable more of the dependent population to leave the welfare  		rolls for gainful employment.</p>

<h3>The National Integrated Quality Control System</h3>
<p>Data on the basic demographic characteristics of AFDC parents and  		children in each state and the U.S. as a whole are available from the National  		Integrated Quality Control System (NIQCS). The NIQCS is based on an annual  		random sample of some 67,000 recipient households drawn from the welfare case  		records of each state, with state samples varying in size from 300 to 2,700  		cases (Family Support Administration, 1989). It is conducted by the office of  		Family Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to  		enable states to identify errors in determination of AFDC eligibility and  		amount of payment. Information obtained includes the age, sex, race and  		Hispanic origin of each adult and child in the household; the reason for the  		child's eligibility for AFDC; the length of time on assistance; the receipt of  		other assistance, such as food stamps, rent subsidies, and child support; the  		employment status of each adult in the household, including whether employed  		fulltime or part-time; registration in work programs, and if exempt from these  		programs, the principal reason for being exempt; amounts of family income by  		source; income disregards; and countable assets.</p>
<p>The NIQCS data have important gaps. Information on parent educational  		attainment is virtually useless because of extensive missing data. Furthermore,  		in states that do not now have the AFDC-Unemployed Parent program, the NIQCS  		tells nothing about the characteristics of two-parent families that will become  		eligible for the program under the new law.</p>
<h3>The National Longitudinal Survey of Labor-Market  		Experience of Youth</h3>
<p>Comprising a nationally representative sample of men and women 14 to 21  		years of age as of January 1, 1979, the respondents to the National  		Longitudinal Survey of Labor-Market Experience of Youth (NLSY) have been  		interviewed every year since 1979. The survey is sponsored by the Bureau of  		Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, with supplementary information  		sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institute of Child  		Health and Human Development. It is designed by the Center for Human Resource  		Research (CHRR) at The Ohio State University, and is conducted by the National  		Opinion Research Center (NORC), Chicago, Illinois. The purposes behind the  		collection of the data includes replication of labor-market-experience  		questions asked of an earlier cohort, as well as evaluation of the expanded  		employment and training programs for youth established in 1977. In addition,  		the NLSY data base contains detailed data on vocational training, labor force  		experience, and characteristics of current employment. The young people have  		also been asked if they have any health conditions that would limit the kind or  		amount of work they could do and, if so, when the limitation began. Extensive  		information on educational attainment, fertility-related behavior, marital  		history, and other relevant topics has also been gathered.</p>
<p>The respondents have been administered the Armed Services Vocational  		Aptitude Test Battery (ASVAB), the cognitive test battery used to select and  		classify applicants for military service in the enlisted ranks. The tests were  		given in 1980, when the respondents were 15-23 years of age. The respondents  		have been re-contacted annually after that, so that it was possible to tell,  		seven years later, in 1987, which women were and were not receiving welfare  		benefits, and to compare the earlier test scores of the welfare recipients with  		those of the other women in the national sample.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) is a subset of the ASVAB. The  		AFQT composite score is made up of word knowledge, paragraph comprehension  		arithmetic reasoning, and numerical operations subtest scores.<sup><font><a href="welfare-mothers-potential-employees-statistics-profile-based-national-survey-data.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> This set of subtests is similar  		to those that make up most general intelligence batteries and college  		admissions tests, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The Defense  		Department considers the AFQT score to be an indicator of the potential  		recruit's general problem-solving capacity or trainability. Candidates who fall  		below a specific cutoff are not accepted into the Armed Forces except under  		unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the scale scores used by the Defense Department are not  		widely familiar, the scores obtained by the NLSY respondents on the AFQT were  		converted to an IQ-type scale. This was done by changing the raw scores into  		deviation scores, using the mean and standard deviation for all NLSY women, and  		then into standard scores with an overall mean of 100 and an overall standard  		deviation of 15.</p>
<p>The overlap between the test scores of welfare mothers and those of  		female job-holders was determined by comparing the converted AFQT scores of  		AFDC mothers with the scores of women in the NLSY sample who were currently  		employed or had recent employment experience in each type of occupation.</p>
<p>The NLSY files have some limitations as a source of data on the  		employability of AFDC parents. Although the overall sample included 5,369 women  		as of 1987 (85% of the original cohort of 6,283 women), and Blacks, Hispanics,  		and disadvantaged whites were oversampled, the number of women who receive AFDC  		in a given year amounts to only 597 cases. (If those who have ever received  		AFDC are included, the sample is of course larger.) This limits the number of  		stable subgroup estimates that can be made, and means that such subgroup  		estimates will have relatively large standard errors. The NLSY, as well as the  		CPS and the NHIS, are known to undercount the number of AFDC recipients because  		of under-reporting by those who are on the welfare rolls for only short periods  		of time.</p>
<p>Information on drug and alcohol use and abuse is available in the NLSY  		files, but it has not been collected regularly. Moreover, there is evidence of  		systematic underreporting of drug use by some groups (Mensch &amp; Kandel,  		1988). There are comparatively few questions on work-related attitudes, and  		those were asked only in early waves of the study, casting doubts on their  		relevance to adult employment patterns.</p>
<p>Another drawback is that the sample covers only a specific cohort,  		namely those who were 14-21 as of January 1, 1979. If earlier or later cohorts  		of welfare parents are markedly different from those in this cohort, it would  		limit the generalizability of conclusions drawn from this data set.</p>
<p><b>1986 Mother-Child Supplement</b>. In 1986, a series of child-related  		questions were asked of a subsample of the NLSY women consisting of those who  		had children. The unweighted number of children in this subsample who were  		actually assessed was 4,971 (completion rate = 95%); the number of mothers was  		3,053. Of the children interviewed, roughly one quarter were in families  		receiving AFDC payments. Interview items included an assessment of the quality  		of the home environment, as well as tests of the child's intellectual  		development.</p>
<p>The primary limitation of this subsample is that it is not nationally  		representative of children in general -- only of children born by 1986 to women  		who themselves were 21 to 28 years of age as of January 1 of that year. Because  		the mothers were young, the sample includes an over-representation of  		disadvantaged children.</p>
<h3>The Current Population Survey</h3>
<p>The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a nationally representative  		survey of some 70,0000 households, of which about 56,500 are actually  		interviewed (response rate = 81%). Conducted monthly by the Bureau of the  		Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the survey is designed to provide  		estimates of employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the general  		labor force, the population as a whole, and various subgroups of the  		population. It contains data on the number of people in the household, region  		of country, urban/rural residency, and educational attainment.</p>
<p><b>The March Supplement</b>. The March income and demographic supplement  		contains questions regarding employment and income for the past calendar year  		whereas the monthly core survey only gathers information on activity in the  		previous week. The supplement also gathers detailed data on AFDC payments,  		receipt of food stamps and/or school lunches, child support payments, health  		insurance coverage, marital status, type of household, migration, work history,  		and disability status of AFDC parents and the characteristics of two-parent  		families that could become eligible for assistance under the mandated AFDC-UP  		program.</p>
<p>An additional 2,500 Hispanic households are added to the March  		Supplement. The 1988 March Supplement included 43,030 children under the age of  		18, and 1,628 AFDC parents.</p>
<p>The CPS sample does not allow for state-level statistics the way the  		NIQCS does, although by combining data from two or three years of  		surveys, state-level estimates for the 10-12 largest states can be made using  		CPS data. Public assistance income figures may be underreported in the March  		supplement (Zill and Peterson, 1989).</p>
<h3>The National Health Interview Survey</h3>
<p>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is intended to provide a  		continuing picture of the health status of the U.S. population based on  		people's reports of their own health-related experiences and attributes (Zill  		and Peterson, 1989). This survey, which is designed by the National Center for  		Health Statistics and conducted by the Bureau of the Census, covers the  		incidence of illness and injuries, chronic conditions, the extent of  		disability, utilization of health care services, and other related topics. The  		number of AFDC parents in the 1988 National Health Interview Survey sample is  		1,752. This survey does not have ability test scores, but it does have data on  		the educational attainment, current employment, health and disability  		characteristics, marital history, fertility history, and current household  		composition of AFDC parents.</p>
<p>The National Health Interview Survey lacks extensive work history  		information, but it has detailed health and medical care data, a relatively  		large sample of AFDC parents, and a high response rate.</p>
<p><b>1988 Child Health Supplement</b>. This part of the survey 1989, pp.  		225-227) (National Center for Health Statistics, 1989, pp. 225-227) collected  		data in an integrated fashion on the health, education, and care arrangements  		of children, including those whose mothers were currently unemployed or not in  		the labor force. The parent of one child, chosen at random from households  		containing children under 18, was interviewed. The Child Health Supplement  		(Zill and Schoenborn, 1990) has the advantages of being an in-person rather  		than a telephone survey, with a large sample (17,110 children) and a high  		completion rate (91%), containing a rich body of accompanying information on  		family characteristics, including receipt of AFDC, and the child's health and  		development.</p>
