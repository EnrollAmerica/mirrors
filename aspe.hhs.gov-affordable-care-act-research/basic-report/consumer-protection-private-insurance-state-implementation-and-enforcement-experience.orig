<hr /><p><b><a name="INTO" id="INTO">I. INTRODUCTION </a></b></p>
<p>Policymakers have the unenviable task of reining in managed care  		strategies that might prevent enrollees from getting care when they need it  		while not undermining the health plan communitys ability to contain  		health care costs. The U.S. Congress and the Clinton Administration have been  		debating health plan consumer protections for the private health insurance  		market that could help consumers who are most vulnerable. This federal debate  		follows almost a decade of activity by state policymakers in this area. </p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  		(OASPE) has requested a study of state implementation of the following consumer  		protections specifically for the most seriously and chronically ill patients:  		</p>
<ul><li>access to emergency services </li>
<li>network adequacy </li>
<li>continuity of care </li>
<li>standing referral, and </li>
<li>access to out-of-network specialists. </li>
</ul><p>These protections are sought by people with AIDS, cancer, diabetes,  		heart disease, and other serious or chronic conditions, who require consistent  		access to a variety of health care services and whose care can be very costly.  		Consumer advocates seek broad rights that give individuals greater access to  		services that they need and that can be readily and strongly enforced. Health  		insurers that seek to manage the cost of care of such expensive conditions also  		are very concerned about these protections. They have sought to maintain broad  		discretion over decisions about access to services and to have standards that  		they believe are operationally feasible. States have sought to balance these  		interests in implementing patient protections. They have done so operating  		under significant constraints, including statutory language that is sometimes  		vague and ambiguous, lack of resources, and lack of data. State regulators also  		have struggled with challenges inherent to these protections. Crafting general  		rules to suit diverse individual situations has proven very difficult. So has  		been foreseeing all the ways in which these new protections might interact with  		existing laws and evolving markets. Educating consumers, health plans and  		providers also has been a challenge. </p>
<p>Federal regulators will face these and other challenges if national  		consumer protections are adopted. The states implementation experience yields  		important lessons about what kinds of things have and have not worked. Federal  		policy makers are fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from this  		experience and may benefit from it. </p>
<p>This report discusses the experience of four states  Colorado,  		Maryland, Minnesota, and New York  that have enacted continuity of care,  		standing referral, access to specialists, network adequacy and emergency  		service provisions. </p>
<p><u><b>Methodology </b></u></p>
<p>Secondary sources were used to identify states that have enacted a  		comprehensive range of health plan consumer protections. We specifically looked  		at states that had enacted continuity of care, standing referral, access to  		specialists, access to emergency services, and network adequacy provisions.  		</p>
<p><i> Emergency service</i> standards require health plans to pay  		for emergency care when patients reasonably seek such services. The standards  		apply for emergency care obtained in or out of the health plans network.  		There are several components to state laws establishing these protections  		including the prudent layperson standard. Under this standard, health plans are  		required to pay for emergency care provided to enrollees who reasonably believe  		that they need immediate medical care because of their symptoms. </p>
<p><i> Network adequacy</i> standards are designed to make sure that  		health plans have an adequate network of providers to care for their enrollees.  		These standards often focus on the types and number of primary care and  		specialty providers, the distance which enrollees have to travel to see their  		providers, and hours of operation. </p>
<p><i> Continuity of care</i> refers to rules enabling a patient who  		is in a course of ongoing treatment to continue receiving care from a physician  		or other provider who is not in the plan network. The need for care continuity  		may arise because the physician leaves the managed care plans network or  		because the patient changes managed care plans. In either case, continuity of  		care is protected for a limited time  intended to permit a reasonable  		transition to care provided by a physician who is in the plan network. </p>
<p> Enrollees who need ongoing specialty care may seek a <i>standing  		referral</i> to a specialist. A standing referral authorizes care for a longer  		period of time (up to an entire course of treatment) for patients with a  		serious or ongoing condition. By contrast, for less serious or short-term care  		needs, health plans typically require a separate referral each time a patient  		needs to see a specialist. We also explored states with a related law that  		authorizes the use of specialists to provide primary care services. </p>
<p><i> Access to specialists</i> provisions provide access to  		specialists including those who do not participate in the network of the  		enrollees health plan (out-of-network specialists). Because of our  		interest in provisions that most affect the seriously and chronically ill we  		did not explore issues related to direct access to obstetricians and  		gynecologists or other specific types of providers. </p>
<p>After identifying a subset of states that have these provisions, we  		researched the laws to determine when they were enacted and what approach was  		used. The four study states were selected primarily because they had several  		years of experience implementing most, if not all, of these provisions.  		Research protocols were developed to help determine these states experience in  		this area. Telephone interviews were conducted with health and insurance  		department regulators and other state officials, health plan representatives  		and consumer advocates in these states. Interviews were conducted on a  		background basis. As a result, interviewee remarks are not  		attributed to a specific person. The authors have made every attempt to assure  		that the information in this report is accurate as of the date of publication.  		</p>
<p><u><b>Structure of Report </b></u></p>
<p>This report examines Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and New Yorks  		experience implementing and enforcing continuity of care, standing referral,  		access to specialist, network adequacy and emergency service standards. In  		Chapter II we discuss the implementation challenges associated with each of  		these consumer protections. In Chapter III, we review implementation issues  		applicable across the consumer protections including the approaches regulators  		use to provide guidance. In Chapter IV, we review how regulators monitor and  		enforce implementation of these health plan consumer protections. Chapter V  		provides a discussion of lessons for federal policymakers based on these  		states experiences. </p>
<p><b><a name="II" id="II">II. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES  		</a></b></p>
<p>Each of these consumer protections presents their own implementation  		challenges. In some cases, these challenges are prompted by vague and ambiguous  		statutory language coupled with broad health plan discretion. At other times  		challenges arise because these consumer protections apply to such widely  		varying situations that it is difficult for regulators to provide definitive  		guidance applicable to each circumstance. In this section, we discuss some of  		the key challenges implementing each of these consumer protections and some of  		the approaches used by states to address them. </p>
<p><b><u>1. Emergency Services </u></b></p>
<p>Emergency service standards require health plans to pay for emergency  		care when patients reasonably seek such services. The standards apply for care  		obtained in or out of the health plans network. The emergency care access  		laws enacted by the four study states are reasonably similar. A discussion of  		some significant issues that have arisen in implementing these laws follows.  		</p>
<p><b>Definitional/interpretive issues </b></p>
<p><i>Prudent Layperson Standard</i>: State laws vary in their definition  		of prudent layperson  the standard under which emergency care  		sought by patients must be covered by health plans. The term prudent  		layperson leaves a great deal of room for interpretation. Therefore, an  		early question for this part of the study probed how states have defined this  		term. We assumed that a precise or absolute definition would be very difficult  		to develop, given the many factors that might be considered in determining  		whether a lay consumer was prudent. Consider the following example: </p>
<table><tr><td>Mary and Kevin present to the emergency room with  			 their newborn who is crying continuously.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Scenario 1: The baby has no fever or any other symptoms.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Scenario 2: The baby has a fever of 101 degrees.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Scenario 3: The baby has a fever of 104 degrees.</td>
</tr></table><p>Under which scenario would Mary and Kevins trip to the emergency  		room be considered prudent? Beyond the clinical symptoms, other contextual  		analysis could matter. Are Mary and Kevin new parents? Did they first try to  		call their pediatrician? Is it midday or the middle of the night? Is there  		other relevant history  perhaps they lost an infant previously to sudden  		illness  that should be considered? The fact-specific nature of this  		analysis poses implementation problems. </p>
<p>As it turned out, none of the study states have issued further, up front  		guidance on how to interpret the prudent layperson standard. In practice,  		health plans have been left discretion to apply this standard to their  		enrollees, subject to appeal and review by state regulators. Consequently, one  		plan might pay Mary and Kevins claim under the first scenario, while  		another might deny the claim under the first but pay it under the second or  		third. </p>
<p>Health plans have not always exercised their discretion well, as a  		sample of external appeals cases in Maryland illustrates. These include a man  		with chest pain radiating down his left shoulder and arm, a patient with back  		pain so severe she could neither sit nor stand, and a 61-year-old woman who had  		a clothes dryer dropped on her foot. These patients sought care in the  		emergency room. Maryland managed care plans denied all three of these emergency  		room claims for not meeting a prudent layperson standard. All three denials  		were subsequently overturned on external review. </p>
<p>In fact, across all Maryland health plans, the high overturn rate of  		emergency care denials suggests that further guidance on how to interpret the  		prudent layperson standard may be needed. According to an April 2000 report  		issued by the Maryland Insurance Administration, 65% of grievances to health  		plans involving emergency care were overturned or modified by health plans; 87%  		of emergency room denials taken to the Health Education and Advocacy Unit of  		the state's Attorney General's office were overturned or modified; 100% of  		external appeals of emergency room care (i.e., the three cases discussed above)  		were overturned by the MIA.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p> By compiling these appeals decisions and reporting on them annually,  		Maryland is making it possible for such guidance to be discerned from the body  		of case law that accumulates. </p>
<p><b>Claims Forms and Recordkeeping </b></p>
<p>An investigation by Maryland regulators into emergency room denials  		uncovered a problem not anticipated when the states prudent layperson law  		was first implemented. The MIA reviewed over 800 cases involving denial of  		payment for valid emergency services and found these denials were not abusive,  		but rather attributable to incomplete data reporting. Hospitals were using  		uniform claim forms, such as the HCFA(now known as CMS) 1500 and UB92, which report data on final  		diagnoses and the services provided. These forms did not have places to report  		information on presenting symptoms and other circumstances necessary to  		evaluate the prudent layperson standard. Consequently Maryland hospitals now  		often attach appropriate pages from the medical record when they think the  		final diagnosis might give rise to questions about the validity of the  		emergency room visit. Plans may also seek additional information when  		necessary. Minnesota has gone a step further and requires health plans to seek  		information about presenting symptoms and other circumstances before an  		emergency services claim can be denied. Colorado recently fined a health plan  		for, among other violations, having a policy that encouraged the denial of  		emergency services without conducting an investigation of the circumstances  		under which the care was received. </p>
<p><b>Prior Authorization and Post-Notification </b></p>
<p>Most of the study states do not permit health plans to require enrollees  		to seek prior authorization before receiving emergency services.  		Minnesotas law does allow a prior authorization requirement but both  		regulators and health plan representatives note that most plans in the state  		choose not to do so. Health plans have, however, developed administrative  		requirements that require the enrollee to contact them within a certain time  		period  such as 48 hours - after receiving emergency room services.  		Health plans note that this requirement helps ensure that the primary care  		provider is aware of the emergency services provided to the enrollee and  		facilitates the plan-provider relationship. Out of concern that some health  		plans were imposing on enrollees a 24-hour notification requirement, Minnesota  		established a 48-hour standard in its statute. The states law clarifies  		that HMOs must make exceptions to this requirement when the enrollee is not  		physically or mentally able to give notice within 48 hours and the care would  		have been covered if the enrollee had met this notice requirement. Colorado law  		requires a similar exception. </p>
<p><b>Payment Issues</b> </p>
<p>There has been some question about how plans must respond to claims  		where ambulance services deliver enrollees to out-of-network facilities. Health  		plans may differ in how they pay for ambulance transport to and services  		provided by an out-of-network emergency room in the service area. In Colorado,  		HMOs are required to notify enrollees in brochures, contracts, policy manuals  		and printed materials distributed to enrollees about their option to use 911  		services and prohibited them from discouraging enrollees from using 911  		services or denying reimbursement for medical or transportation services.  		Regulators highlighted an example of a health plan practice that might  		discourage enrollees discovered during a market conduct exam. The health plan  		charged a higher co-payment for emergency services received from a non-network  		provider than that applied to in-network services. Because an enrollee may not  		have a choice of where the ambulance transports her, the agency concluded that  		the plan's policy might discourage her from using 911 services. In Colorado,  		HMOs must reimburse for emergency services obtained as a result of ambulance  		transport if the enrollee believes he needs immediate medical care to prevent  		death or serious impairment to his health. </p>
<p><b>Notice to Enrollees </b></p>
<p>Consumer education about this protection involves inherent challenges.  		Getting the general public to focus on this protection in advance of an  		emergency that may never arise also is difficult. And emergencies, when they do  		occur, may not present effective teaching opportunities. </p>
<p>Health plan member handbooks and other member materials are one  		important place to locate information for consumers. Some health plans have  		developed useful educational materials for enrollees with examples illustrating  		when emergency care might be sought prudently. Most people interviewed for this  		study, however, pointed out that very few people actually read these handbooks  		and are very unlikely to do so in an emergency. Some health plans have also  		adopted a pay and educate approach, advising their enrollees why an  		inappropriate emergency admission will be covered in the first instance but not  		in the future. Brochures published by regulatory agencies and consumer  		organizations may also include language to further explain the prudent  		layperson standard. </p>
<p><b><u>2. Network Adequacy </u></b></p>
<p>Network adequacy is a core reform in most state managed care reform  		laws. Several issues emerge as noteworthy from the implementation experience in  		the four study states. </p>
<p><b>Definitional/Interpretive Issues </b></p>
<p>State network adequacy laws also vary to a great extent in the  		requirements they set for health plans and their definition of what constitutes  		an adequate provider network. Of the study states, Colorado and Maryland  		statutes are very vague while New York and Minnesota laws are more prescriptive  		and detailed. Minnesota, for example, includes specific maximum travel and  		distance times in their definition of network adequacy. A network is adequate  		if all enrollees have access to a primary care physician within 30 miles or a  		30-minute drive, and access to specialty care within 60 miles/60 minutes. In  		New York, health plan networks must meet time and distance and standards and  		afford enrollees a choice of 3 primary care physicians. </p>
<p>None of the study states have published additional regulatory guidance  		on how to interpret their statutory definition of network adequacy. Where  		additional guidance is necessary, it appears to be offered on a case-by-case  		basis. </p>
<p><b>Rural Exceptions Process </b></p>
<p>Regulators we interviewed had different opinions on the advisability of  		setting more detailed standards. Regulators in Colorado, for example, noted the  		sharp differences between health care markets in Denver and more rural areas of  		the state and the difficulty of applying an absolute standard for adequacy  		across all areas. They observed that patients in rural counties might not  		object to driving an hour to get care, while Denver residents might consider  		this a serious access problem. As a result, they urged flexibility and common  		sense in considering community expectations and the practical availability of  		physicians in determining adequacy on an area-by-area basis. Minnesota  		regulators also use a waiver process to exempt health plans from that  		states more prescriptive network adequacy standards in rural and other  		health manpower shortage areas. </p>
<p>Colorado also has established a special task force on rural access  		issues to monitor developments in these market areas and gather advice on the  		most appropriate regulatory responses. The Insurance Commissioner convened this  		task force to represent points of view from all key stakeholders. Its high  		level membership includes CEOs of prominent insurance carriers, presidents of  		the state hospital and medical associations, and representatives from  		employers, consumers, and insurance agents. The task force also advises the  		Commissioner on small group health insurance market issues. The most  		significant policy recommendations emanating from the task force to date have  		involved small group market issues, though it has recommended some  		administrative changes to ease paperwork burdens on health plans in rural  		areas. The task force continues to meet to consider issues and make  		recommendation for the next legislative session in 2001. </p>
<p><b>Unintended Consequences</b> </p>
<p>One regulator expressed concern over an unintended use of the network  		adequacy requirement in her state. Doctors in one area appear to have tried to  		use the states network adequacy law to strengthen their leverage with a  		managed care plan and negotiate for more favorable contracting terms. The  		regulator worried that this could result in unintended premium increases in  		rural areas, where managed care plans can be difficult to establish in the  		first place. </p>
<p><b>Documenting Network Adequacy</b> </p>
<p>Relating to the issue of network adequacy is the requirement that health  		plans make available to enrollees provider directories that are accurate and up  		to date. For a network to be adequate, providers must not only have contracted  		with a plan, they must be willing to take plan enrollees and enrollees must be  		able to find them. Two of the study states have spent significant  		implementation activity relating to provider directories. The state of Maryland  		has conducted investigations into the accuracy of health plan provider  		directories. Serious deficiencies have resulted in the Commissioner issuing  		corrective orders and fines. New York regulatory staff survey plans by posing  		as enrollees or prospective enrollees asking for a copy of the directory. They  		also call names in the directories at random to see whether these providers  		are, indeed, contracting with the health plan and accepting enrollees as new  		patients. Problems encountered through such surveys are brought to the  		attention of health plans and must be corrected to avoid further sanctions. In  		New York, consumer advocates published the results of their investigation on  		the adequacy of a plans provider network and the accuracy of the provider  		directory. This experience suggests that consumer organizations may serve as a  		useful resource for regulators. However, most of the organizations with whom we  		spoke cited lack of resources as a barrier to effective data collection  		efforts.</p>
<p><b><u>3. Continuity of Care </u></b></p>
<p>This protection enables a patient who is in a course of ongoing  		treatment to continue receiving care from a physician or other provider who is  		no longer in the plan network. The need for care continuity may arise because  		the physician leaves the managed care plans network. Of the study states,  		two  Minnesota and New York  also extend this protection when the  		patient changes managed care plans. </p>
<p><b>Definitional/Interpretation Issues </b></p>
<p>Beyond the statutory language, there is little in the way of state  		regulations or other forms of written guidance that defines further who is  		eligible for continuity of care and under what circumstances. In most cases,  		though, the state's statutory language is quite specific. Although narrow,  		Maryland's protection, until recently, only enabled enrollees to receive  		continuity of care when their primary care provider terminates from the  		network.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Similarly, Colorado enrollees are  		eligible only when the health plan has failed to provide sufficient  		notification.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In New York and Minnesota patient characteristics are key in determining  		eligibility for continuity of care but these states differ in the level of  		clarity they provide. New York's law applies to patients who are in an ongoing  		course of treatment or pregnant women in the second or third trimester, when  		the provider is terminating from the network. Minnesota's law, on the other  		hand, extends the right to those with "special needs" while leaving it to the  		health plans to define the term. Consumer advocates sought to have a more  		specific definition included in legislation but did not prevail. Interestingly,  		regulators, consumer advocates and health plans have been working together to  		create a more explicit statutory definition because lack of such detail has  		permitted broader health plan discretion in setting eligibility than many think  		is appropriate. The difficulty in understanding the scope of eligibility for  		Minnesotas protections absent clearer statutory language or regulatory  		guidance can be illustrated by the following example: </p>
<div class="bordered-text">Sam Hunter, a resident of Minnesota, learned four months ago that  			 he has diabetes and needs ongoing care for his condition. His family, however,  			 is unclear whether his diabetic conditions meets the standard of special  			 medical needs because he is not in an acute phase of his condition. Sam argues  			 that he has special needs requiring ongoing care an individual without a  			 chronic condition does not have. However, after researching his current status,  			 the health plan applies the law based on an evaluation of Sam's acute needs and  			 denies his request for care continuity. Thi is not to say that another health  			 plan in Minnesota might not approved Sam's rquest for care continuity because  			 he is learning how to manage his diabetes.
<p>In New York, Sam's protections are somewhat different. Because  			 Sam is in an ongoing course of treatment and learning how to manage his  			 diabetes, the health plan has approved his request for care continuity from the  			 terminating provider for up to 90-days. Consistent with New York law, the  			 provider has agreed to accept the plan's reimbursement level as payment in full  			 and adhere to the plan's quality assurance requirements and other policies and  			 procedures.</p>

<p>A clear understanding about who should be notified about care continuity  		and how they should be identified is an important component to making this  		protection work. However, lack of clarity about when enrollees are even  		eligible, such as in Minnesota, makes notice more difficult. While termination  		of a provider from a network is an obvious prompt that enrollee notification is  		needed, how health plans identify the enrollees to notify is a key question. In  		Colorado network providers are supposed to give health plans a list of patients  		they are seeing on a regular basis when leaving the network. However, a health  		plan representative commented that they often do not do so. Absent an effective  		system for identifying those eligible for care continuity, enrollees may fall  		through the cracks and only learn about their right to care continuity if they  		take the initiative and complain about an interruption in care. </p>
<p>While providers generally are not required by law to help notify their  		patients about their termination from the plan, they logically could play a key  		role in making this protection real. Even so, none of the study states  		explicitly enlist the use of the primary care providers and specialists to  		notify their patients when they are leaving the health plan. Notably, Maryland  		is the only state that requires plans to notify primary care providers about  		the termination of specialty referral service providers, though regulators are  		aware of no legal or contractual obligation on primary care providers to pass  		this information along to patients. Provider involvement in determining who  		should receive notification can be particularly important in cases that are  		hard for health plans to identify. While health plans may easily access a list  		of patients who are on a primary care provider's panel, health plans report  		that it may be more difficult for them to identify patients who are in an  		ongoing course of care with a specialist. </p>
<p><b><u>4. Standing Referral </u></b></p>
<p>Standing referrals allows enrollees with a serious or chronic condition  		who need ongoing specialty care to be seen by a specialist for a longer period  		of time (up to an entire course of treatment). This protection negates the need  		to get multiple referrals to the same specialist for a continuous course of  		treatment  a source of considerable frustration for enrollees with  		chronic conditions. </p>
<p><b>Definitional/Interpretation issues </b></p>
<p>In practice, each of the study states' laws applies to varying degrees  		to individuals who are chronically ill. As with continuity of care, there is  		some lack of clarity and guidance in exactly who is eligible for this  		protection. The lack of clarity on what circumstances make one eligible for a  		standing referral has proven problematic particularly in Minnesota for reasons  		similar to those discussed in the previous section on continuity of care. As a  		regulator and consumer advocate commented, while eligibility for a standing  		referral for a pregnancy is generally clear, other eligibility criteria are  		not. For instance, an incident in Minnesota highlighted that it was not clear  		to all health plans that an individual with HIV/AIDS had a medical condition  		that warranted a standing referral to a specialist with expertise in treating  		that medical condition. Several interviewees noted that letting health plans  		set their own policies on when someone is eligible for standing referral has  		not worked well in that state. In contrast, Maryland and New York laws indicate  		the population the law is trying to reach - enrollees whose medical condition  		requires ongoing specialized care. </p>
<p>The primary care physician in consultation with the specialist and  		enrollee decides whether a standing referral is warranted and develops the  		treatment plan in Maryland. New York health plans, on the other hand, are part  		of the team determining whether a standing referral is issued and developing  		the treatment plan for the standing referral. In Colorado, the health plan  		becomes involved only if the standing referral is for more than one year.  		Although the statute does not explicitly define a process in Minnesota, one  		health plan representative noted that the decision whether to issue a standing  		referral is typically delegated to the primary care physician. In each of the  		study states, health plans have the authority to deny a request for a standing  		referral. As with other denials, this can be challenged through the appeals  		process. </p>
<p>Another important issue with respect to this provision has been what  		providers can see enrollees under a standing referral. To limit the breadth of  		this provision's application, health plans have generally taken a strong  		position that the law should not require health plans to issue a standing  		referral to providers other than physicians. The laws in the study states do  		not require health plans to issue standing referrals to practitioners other  		than physicians although health plans may permit standing referrals to other  		practitioners on a case-by-case basis. In Minnesota regulators interceded to  		facilitate broader use of standing referrals. In that state, practitioners such  		as chiropractors and some mental health professionals expressed concern that  		primary care physicians were routinely not referring patients to them in favor  		of physicians. After sitting down with plan representatives, primary care  		physicians and specialists, regulators were able to facilitate a discussion  		that they believe has resulted in broader referral use. The states law,  		however, does not require that the plans do so and the plans cooperation  		may be designed to minimize the desire by others for such legislation. </p>
<p>A related reform is the ability of enrollees to use specialists to  		provide primary care services in Minnesota and New York. Under this protection  		the specialist and primary care physician agree that the specialist will manage  		all care related to the applicable condition. In New York, for example, an  		individual with HIV/AIDS is highly likely to have an infectious disease  		specialist serve as his primary care physician (PCP). In Minnesota, this  		protection is available to enrollees who are eligible for a standing referral  		while in New York the enrollee is eligible for this protection when he has a  		life- threatening or degenerative and disabling disease or condition requiring  		specialized care over a prolonged period of time. As with standing referrals,  		health plans in New York can be directly involved in determining whether a  		specialist provide primary care services. </p>
<p><b><u>5. Access to Specialists </u></b></p>
<p>Access to specialists laws require coverage for enrollees who seek  		specialized care out- of-network under certain circumstances. Access to  		out-of-network specialists is made when the health plan does not have a  		specialist appropriate for the enrollee's medical needs within its network. New  		Yorks law specifically includes provisions that apply to decisions to  		refer enrollees to specialty centers of excellence. </p>
<p><b>Definitional/Interpretation Issues </b></p>
<p>By nature, this protection tends to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis  		and is a difficult topic on which to establish guidance and monitor. As with  		other consumer protections, regulators and health plans rely on experience to  		develop an understanding of the type of situations that result in access to  		specialists, including out-of-network specialists. Of particular concern is  		that enrollees have access to specialists with expertise and experience  		treating their medical condition. This concern is most notable when the health  		plan refers the enrollee to an in-network specialist but the enrollee thinks  		that an out-of-network specialist has more experience performing a particular  		service or procedure or prefers to see a different qualified specialist. A look  		at George, who requires a knee replacement, illustrates the interests at stake:  		</p>
<div class="bordered-text">Georges health plan has approved a referral for him to  			 receive treatment from an in- network specialist, Dr. Anderson, who is  			 board-certified in orthopedic surgery and has treated 30 patients with knee  			 injuries similar to Georges over the past five years. George has learned  			 that Dr. Carter, who is not part of the plans network, has significantly  			 more experience and a strong reputation for successfully treating this form of  			 injury. George had requested a referral to see him. The health plan has denied  			 his request to see an out-of-network specialist because it believes that it has  			 a qualified specialist within its network. </div>
<p>The study states laws do not give enrollees a choice of  		specialists. They are referred to specialists chosen by the primary care  		physician and health plan. This scenario highlights the difficult balancing act  		managed care forces between cost containment and patient satisfaction. To  		facilitate its responsibility to contain costs, the health plan has preserved  		its authority to determine whether it has an adequate specialist within its  		network and where the enrollee should be referred. Health plans are required to  		refer enrollees out-of-network when they do not have an appropriate specialist  		in their network. However, they are not required or likely to do so on the  		basis that the enrollee wishes to see a different or more experienced  		specialist when the in-network specialist has adequate expertise and  		experience. Regulators may intervene, however, if the enrollee and provider  		seek their aid and can demonstrate that the in-network provider has inadequate  		experience in the particular area. </p>
<p><b>Notice to Enrollees </b></p>
<p>In all of the study states, this protection must be spelled out in  		health plan documents. As with the continuity of care and standing referral  		provisions, educating referring physicians is important since they would be  		most likely to inform enrollees that they have access to a specialist. The  		effectiveness of this protection is limited when the referring physician does  		not have up-to-date information about what specialists are in the network.  		Absent such information, enrollees may be referred to a specialist only to find  		that the physician is no longer a part of the network. Maryland seeks to  		address this issue by requiring health plans to inform primary care physicians  		when a specialist is terminated from the network. </p>
<p><b>Unanticipated Consequences </b></p>
<p>A dilemma in Colorado highlights the complexity of this area of the law.  		As in the other study states, when a health plan does not have in its network  		an appropriate provider for the enrollees medical needs, it must refer  		the enrollee to an out-of-network provider.. Colorado law requires the plan to  		hold the enrollee harmless when he is referred to an out-of-network provider  		because an in-network provider is not available. In areas where there is a lack  		of specialists, if the provider refuses to accept the plans rate, the  		health plan ends up paying the specialists billed charges to avoid the  		enrollee being balance billed. Colorado health plans argue that this scenario  		raises costs and premiums particular in rural areas. Regulators point out that  		this scenario can have licensure and solvency implications for the health plans  		because state law places a cap on the plans indemnification commitments.  		If the plan exceeds these standards its solvency and/or its license to operate  		could be in jeopardy.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Another important consideration is the interaction between this law and  		other existing requirements  specifically, requirements that managed care  		plans offer a point-of- service (POS) option. Arguably, enrollees have  		unlimited access to out-of-network specialists if they are in a  		point-of-service plan. However, patient protection provisions usually include a  		prohibition on balance billing, while POS plans generally do not protect  		enrollees from balance billing when they go out of network. Depending on the  		balance billing amount, out of network access may not be a true choice for POS  		plan enrollees. In Maryland, at least one health plan has been informed by the  		insurance administration that the access to out-of-network specialist provision  		applies to all enrollees regardless of whether they have selected the POS  		option. Consequently, enrollees are not subject to balance billing when the  		plan does not have a specialist in its network appropriate for the  		enrollees needs. </p>
<p><b><a name="III" id="III">III. OTHER CROSS-CUTTING IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES  		</a></b></p>
<p>Regardless of the consumer protection, regulators, health plans and  		consumer advocates expressed consistent overarching themes about implementation  		challenges. These challenges relate to education, regulatory guidance and  		input, and coordination between regulatory agencies. Interviewees pursue a  		range of strategies to educate consumers about these protections from agency  		brochures and health plan materials to press releases, websites and public  		seminars but have found conducting an adequate consumer education campaign to  		be a challenging task. Albeit a smaller emphasis, education initiatives are  		also focused on health plans, providers and agents. Regulators also use  		multiple strategies to provide guidance on how these laws are interpreted. For  		a variety of reasons, they do not rely very much on regulations as might be  		expected but rely significantly on less formal communications to address issues  		as they arise. Irrespective of the strategy, the importance of ongoing  		communication to receive input from consumer advocates and regulated entities  		and to coordinate the activities of regulatory agencies about the  		implementation of these laws cannot be underestimated. In this section, we will  		focus on the challenges confronted in these areas. </p>
<p><b>Education of Health Plan Members, Staff and Network Providers  		</b></p>
<p>All of our interviewees acknowledged both the importance of and the  		significant difficulties they face educating consumers about these protections  		although some Colorado interviewees believe that they have made some headway in  		this area. Several factors present barriers to consumer knowledge. First,  		consumers are rarely directly involved in the development of these laws. They  		may become vaguely informed about them while skimming a newspaper article or  		listening to the evening news. But, they do not have an incentive to make sure  		they understand what the law means to them. Second, consumers rarely read the  		materials provided them by the health plan although they may read them when  		they become ill. Third, when they do read them, they may find the information  		difficult to understand. This problem is not limited to consumers who have a  		low literacy level. Consumers with high general literacy also struggle with the  		technical nature of the information. Fourth, consumers who are sick enough to  		need to use many of these protections may find their capacity to understand or  		act on the information is diminished. As a Minnesota health plan representative  		noted, it is the worse time for consumers to begin to read and try to  		understand these materials. Fifth, regulators feel that they need greater  		resources to conduct an adequate education initiative. </p>
<p><i>Consumer Education</i>: Regulators education process largely  		consists of disseminating agency brochures and newsletters through a variety of  		public (e.g. libraries) and private settings (e.g. employers and  		physicians offices), issuing press releases and presenting to community  		organizations. The New York Attorney Generals Office Health Care Bureau  		hosted a series of public hearings and seminars across the state  some of  		which were televised. Agencies also prepare press releases and public service  		announcements as well as post information on their website. A Maryland consumer  		representative cautioned against relying too heavily on the internet to  		disseminate information because many consumers do not have access to or do not  		use it. Nevertheless, others noted that this medium is effective in  		disseminating information broadly, cheaply and quickly and should be part of an  		overall public education strategy. </p>
<p>Health plans have a legally defined role in the consumer education  		process. They must notify enrollees about these protections primarily through  		the member handbook. Health plans may be required to send notices directly to  		enrollees about a health plan consumer protection. Among the consumer  		protections we explore in this study, a requirement that enrollees receive a  		letter informing them of their rights is most applicable to the continuity of  		care provision. Plans may also be required to provide information to members or  		prospective members on request. </p>
<p>Colorado has worked especially hard at consumer education through other  		avenues. The state Division of Insurance has published several consumer  		brochures and staff engage in active consumer outreach through consumer and  		patient organizations, civic groups and others. Brochures are distributed  		through these groups and staff often attend meetings and speak at other public  		functions. Colorado also relies on a division newsletter  The  		Regulator  whose audience includes agents to educate the public on  		their health insurance rights. </p>
<p>Regulators and health plans agreed that enrollees in general were not  		informed about these protections. Nevertheless, several thought that the small  		numbers of enrollees who use the system frequently were well informed. Consumer  		groups who work with the chronically ill, on the other hand, stressed  		unanimously that consumers were poorly informed about these protections and  		that a coordinated and systemic education effort, including a consumer  		assistance infrastructure, was critical in this area. Similar to the efforts  		undertaken by regulators, these organizations develop brochures and conduct  		seminars for their constituency. Where available they also post information on  		their website. The efforts of consumer organizations are, however, limited,  		uncoordinated and hampered by a lack of resources. </p>
<p><i>Provider Education</i>: Enrollees in need of continuity of care, a  		standing referral or access to a specialist often find out about those options  		and how to take advantage of them from their providers. Outreach to physicians  		is limited although several regulators and consumer advocates noted that they  		would like greater resources to do more. Because many of the new laws were  		initiated by or were developed with the significant involvement of the state  		medical society, regulator and health plan interviewees often assumed that  		physicians received educational information from their medical society. They  		also thought that media reports were an important source of information for  		providers. Health plans send notices, newsletters, and manuals to the providers  		in their networks. In addition, some regulators mentioned that they conducted  		presentations at medical association conferences. While recognizing the  		provider communitys importance in this education effort, regulators in  		several of the study states cautioned that financial incentives to reduce  		enrollee use of services and the antipathy some providers have towards managed  		care cuts against relying on them too heavily to inform enrollees about their  		rights. </p>
<p><i>Health Plan Education</i>: There was more activity to educate  		consumers than health plans or providers, at the outset, about what these laws  		mean. Regulators assume that health plans are aware of and familiar with  		recently enacted laws. They do prepare letters and bulletins that apprise  		health plans of any relevant changes in the law. The New York Department of  		Health, for instance, disseminated a bulletin outlining extensively  		requirements under the new patient protection statute. The states have not,  		however, developed a structured education initiative to facilitate health plan  		understanding of the meaning of these laws prior to implementation. This may in  		large part be a function of resources but also may be due to a need to learn  		about what the law means in practice and what issues actually will require  		further guidance through the health plans application of it to varying  		circumstances. </p>
<p>The extent to which plan staff understand these health plan consumer  		protections can make a significant difference in the implementation of these  		protections. Lack of knowledge on the part of plan staff can result in  		misinformation to enrollees or prospective enrollees and violations of the law.  		Consumer advocates and the Attorney General's office expressed concern in  		studies on health plan information disclosure that some New York health plans  		were providing inaccurate information to enrollees. These reports contributed  		to the significant effort by the state Department of Health to ensure that the  		information in member handbooks and other materials were correct and disclosed  		to the public. </p>
<p>To educate their staff, particularly member service representatives,  		about consumer protections, health plans engage in a number of activities. They  		prepare bulletins and other written materials that are distributed to staff.  		They also conduct in-service training. Staff from the plans compliance  		division attend customer service staff meetings to talk about the laws and  		prepare scripts for member services staff to use when talking with consumers.  		Further, industry associations prepare materials for use by their health plans  		and provide training sessions for health plan staff as well. One health plan  		representative noted that these education efforts need to be continuous because  		of the significant turnover among member service staff. Despite these efforts,  		consumer advocates consistently criticized the lack of knowledge of plan member  		services staff about these laws. New York regulators note that the performance  		of member service staff has improved over time. In that state, health plans are  		surveyed through focused telephone calls on a regular basis to assess, in part,  		the accuracy of the information provided to enrollees by member services staff.  		</p>
<p><b>Forms of Regulatory Guidance </b></p>
<p><i>Regulations</i>: The states have made limited use of the formal  		rulemaking process to provide regulatory guidance on these and other  		implementation challenges. Colorado and Minnesota are the only study states  		that issued rules for some of these provisions.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The Minnesota Department of Health amended existing rules to bring them  		into compliance with the states health plan consumer protection statute.  		These rules have, in part, been used to strengthen the effect of their  		standards. Although the states law still permits prior authorization of  		emergency care, by requiring health plans to pend claims  not deny them  		 until they have adequate information to make a decision under the  		reasonable layperson standard, Minnesota regulators believe their law is  		strengthened while at the same time allowing health plans some operational  		flexibility. All of the study states, however, have largely relied on less  		formal means to communicate agency interpretation for these protections. The  		sparse use of rules can be partially explained by resource considerations,  		political culture and desire for flexibility. </p>
<p>The resources available to an agency play into the level of priority  		given to drafting regulations. If a state agency determines that the language  		is self-implementing and does not require further clarification it will not  		automatically draft a regulation in response to a new statute. As one regulator  		noted, the more specific the statutory language, the less need for regulations.  		Since the drafting process requires more time and staff resources than are  		available, regulators often rely on other ways to issue guidance on an  		as-needed basis (see below). In New York, which has undergone a well-  		publicized regulatory streamlining initiative, efforts were made to draft the  		statute in sufficient detail in order to avoid the development of rules. </p>
<p>Regulators cautioned that developing prescriptive rules sometimes limits  		flexibility to address market dynamics. In Colorado, for instance, regulators  		originally intended to develop rules on network adequacy but ultimately decided  		not to do so. Of particular concern was the lack of flexibility rules may allow  		in determining the adequacy of a network in the states largely rural  		geography. We noted that where states developed regulations, most of the rules  		did not noticeably expand upon the statutory language nor were they detailed  		and specific. One regulator explained that when the agency drafts rules that  		are very prescriptive health plan attorneys argue that the rules should be read  		narrowly and literally. The plan uses the omission as a defense, arguing that  		the otherwise specific rule would have included the issue, had it applied. </p>
<p>Consumer representatives in the study states differed in whether they  		thought the sparse use of formal rules significantly hindered implementation.  		In two study states, they believed that a lack of rules and insufficient review  		of plan procedures hindered implementation and education efforts. In another  		state, however, a consumer advocate thought that regulations took too long to  		develop and that resources could be better used by an insurance commissioner to  		actively monitor and enforce the law. That consumer representative favored  		informal guidance. This strategy, however, presupposes a consistently proactive  		insurance commissioner which is unlikely to be the case given the turnover in  		and the varying personalities appointed or elected to that position. </p>
<p><i>Other Forms of Guidance</i>: Written guidance is often provided in  		the form of an advisory bulletin, letter, or article in a newsletter. These  		documents summarize laws that are soon to go into effect, provide reminders of  		certain requirements or respond to questions posed by health plans or others. A  		bulletin recently issued by the Colorado Division of Insurance on an issue  		related to these consumer protections serves as an example. The bulletin was  		drafted in response to the DOI becoming aware that some health plans were  		retroactively denying coverage for services they had previously authorized. The  		bulletin highlighted the statutory requirement and emphasized examples of  		circumstances that would constitute a violation of the law. This bulletin makes  		clear that a health plan cannot approve a referral to a specialist for a  		particular treatment, for example, and then retrospectively deny coverage for  		the service, once it has been delivered, because the health plan realizes that  		the treatment was not a covered benefit. </p>
<p>Traditional agency activities are a principal mechanism through which  		agencies provide regulatory guidance. Besides answering specific implementation  		questions, responses to consumer complaints are viewed by regulators as a  		useful opportunity to educate health plans about whether they have  		appropriately implemented a certain provision of the law. Additionally, plans  		develop an understanding of agency interpretation of a provision through verbal  		and written feedback from targeted agency audits of their operations and  		comprehensive market conduct examinations. New York regulators, for instance,  		are noticing fewer denials based on the prudent layperson standard. They  		believe this is so because they are requiring health plans to modify inadequate  		internal guidelines and change inappropriate denial decisions as a result of  		complaints to the Department of Health and the state Attorney General's Health  		Care Bureau. The Minnesota Department of Health also notes that it has  		witnessed a steady decline in complaints related to emergency services since  		the promulgation of regulations in 1994. Between 1993, before the rule went  		into effect, and 1995, the number of complaints the agency received from HMO  		members decreased from 66 to 30. In 1997, when the rule was codified in  		statute, the agency received 16 complaints and by the end of 1999, the agency  		received only 14 complaints. A partial explanation may be a practice by some  		health plans to approve almost all emergency service claims as a matter of  		practice in response to the media backlash for emergency service denials. </p>
<p><b>Input Into the Development of Regulatory Guidance </b></p>
<p>In all of the study states, interviewees emphasized the importance of  		involving interested parties in the development of rules and other guidance.  		Communication with health plans and consumers about their respective  		interpretations of the law prior to implementation was identified as an  		important strategy for effective implementation. A New York regulator thought  		that the state could have avoided some implementation challenges if the agency  		had met with health plan and consumer representatives soon after enactment of  		the patient protection statute to iron out differences in their interpretation  		of the law and to communicate the agencys interpretation. Colorado has  		recently tried a new approach to increase external input into the regulatory  		process. It does so by meeting with health plans, providers and consumer groups  		before drafting rules. While the agency meets separately with each of these  		groups, the minutes of each meeting are shared with all participants. To the  		extent that they can, agency officials incorporate the suggestions made at  		these meetings. The meetings provide an opportunity for plans and consumer  		groups to buy-in to the regulations and to inform regulators about operational  		or policy issues of which they may not be aware. </p>
<p>Health plan representatives and consumer advocates also emphasized the  		important role they can play on an ongoing basis informing regulators about the  		operational implications of proposed standards, implementation problems and  		gaps in statutory language. </p>
<p><b>Coordination Among and Communication with Multiple State Agencies  		</b></p>
<p>The study states illustrate well that differing state agencies can be  		involved in overseeing the implementation of these health plan standards. In  		all of the states we interviewed there is joint jurisdiction between the  		insurance and health departments. Moreover, the states are not consistent in  		the basis on which this responsibility is divided. In Maryland, as in many  		other states, for instance, responsibility is divided based on the area or  		function while in Minnesota responsibility is divided based on type of health  		plan. The Maryland Insurance Administration has responsibility for the  		contractual and financial aspects of HMO operations (as well as appeals of  		denied claims based on medical necessity) while the Department of Health and  		Mental Hygiene oversees network adequacy and all other quality of care issues.  		In Minnesota, the Department of Health has responsibility for HMOs and the  		Department of Commerce has responsibility for indemnity and Blue Cross Blue  		Shield plans. In some states, such as Maryland and New York, the Attorney  		Generals office may also be actively involved. </p>
<p>Each of the study states has found that structured communication  		strategies are necessary to keep one another informed during the implementation  		and enforcement process. In Minnesota, the Department of Health and Department  		of Commerce speak regularly to coordinate consistent responses on issues. When  		staff in one agency becomes aware of an implementation problem, they contact  		their counterpart in the other agency to coordinate their response. In New  		York, staff from key agencies meet monthly and otherwise talk by phone and  		email. The meetings are more frequent in the earlier stages of the  		implementation process. </p>
<p><b><a name="IV" id="IV">IV. THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS </a></b></p>
<p>State regulators efforts to ensure compliance with these standards  		is largely driven by complaints that they receive from consumers, advocates,  		agents and providers. Complaints information is supplemented by violations  		discovered through periodic audits of specific areas of health plan operations  		(such as emergency claims denials) and comprehensive market conduct  		examinations. Regulators monitor implementation through the prior review of  		contracts and network adequacy plans. To a lesser extent, they do so when  		approving plan policies and procedures or collecting data from health plans.  		Very few of these monitoring activities end in formal enforcement actions such  		as orders and fines. Violations of state law are more likely to be resolved  		with health plans through informal intervention before regulators finalize a  		legal enforcement proceeding. In this section, we review the ways in which  		regulators become aware of violations of the law, highlight some of the  		violations that have prompted state enforcement actions and discuss how state  		regulators responded to them. </p>
<p><b><u>Monitoring of Health Plan Market Conduct </u></b></p>
<p><b>Complaints to Regulatory Agencies </b></p>
<p>Our interviews indicated that a pattern of complaints from plan members  		and providers typically triggers a compliance investigation by regulators.  		While one complaint could trigger an investigation into plan policies and  		practices in some states such as New York, 10-20 complaints of a similar nature  		about a specific health plan in a short period of time are more likely to do  		so. On noticing such a pattern, regulators will contact the health plan to seek  		an explanation and require the health plan to report back to the agency on how  		it will rectify the problem. </p>
<p>Regulators noted that agents and providers have been a repeated source  		of information about potential health plan violations as well. </p>
<p><b>Targeted Audits </b></p>
<p>Regulators in each of the study states noted that multiple complaints or  		other indications that a plan may not be complying with the law may also lead  		to more extensive investigations into specific aspects of the operations of one  		or all health plans in their state. In Colorado these examinations, called desk  		audits, may be used when the Division of Insurance identifies a systemic  		problem within one or more health plans. The agency asks the plan to pull and  		review the files on all related situations, rectify the problem and prove to  		the agency that it has done so. If the plan has not made proper modifications,  		the agency may proceed with enforcement actions. Information from the desk  		audit is forwarded to the agencys market conduct examiners so they can  		look closely at this area when conducting their review of health plan  		operations. Through a desk audit of one Colorado managed care plan, for  		example, regulators discovered systematic violation of the states prudent  		layperson standard for paying emergency room claims. </p>
<p>For the most part, these targeted audits are conducted following a  		pattern of complaints. The New York Department of Health, however, has taken  		the targeted audit concept one step further. In addition to activities to  		assess health plan practice during the annual survey, such as the selection of  		a random sample of complaints cases to determine whether the plan responded  		accurately and timely, the agency also conducts ongoing focused surveys of plan  		activity that are unrelated to complaints and violations. For example, its  		staff calls health plan member service lines to ask them questions and assess  		their responsiveness. They also conduct semi-annual provider directory calls to  		a random sample of the physicians on the plans list. During these calls,  		they inquire whether the provider participates in the plan and is taking any  		new patients. Also, provider directories are reviewed to ensure that all  		required information is included. </p>
<p>In addition to investigations about specific health plan activities, the  		monitoring process could prompt an agency to develop rules, advisory bulletins  		or other forms of guidance. The letter sent to New York health plans in  		response to assessments that plans were not in compliance with disclosure laws  		about these and other health plan consumer protections is an example. </p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Surveys or Market Conduct Examinations </b></p>
<p>Every state performs periodic market conduct examinations of health  		plans.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> During market conduct examinations,  		regulators undertake detailed review of plan documents such as contracts,  		procedures, complaint logs and provider directories. Regulators may also try to  		delve into plan practice by surveying providers or enrollees. In each of the  		study states, market conduct examiners review the status of corrective action  		plans developed in response to desk audits and targeted investigations  		conducted by the agency. The agency assesses the health plan for the expenses  		associated with the market conduct examination. The Colorado Division of  		Insurance posts market conduct examination reports and orders on its website.  		</p>
<p>The primary mechanisms which prompt an investigation depends on  		consumers understanding that their rights have been violated and making a  		complaint or regulators discovering violations through periodic market conduct  		examinations. To a lesser extent, regulators use different types of strategies  		that require plans to submit information to them and that can yield valuable  		information. </p>
<p><b>Filings of Plans, Policies and Procedures </b></p>
<p>Filings of plan contracts, policies, and provider networks provide an  		opportunity for regulators to assess how well health plans are implementing  		these health plan consumer protections. However, with the exception of New York  		and limited filing requirements in Maryland, the laws in the study states do  		not require health plans to submit information to regulators on their policies  		and procedures for many health plan consumer protections. Regulators in  		Maryland and Minnesota also review revisions to plan contracts to ensure that  		they are in compliance with the law. Absent prior review or approval authority,  		the regulatory agency first sees a policy when it is responding to a complaint  		or conducting a market conduct examination. </p>
<p>Health plans are usually required to submit information on their  		provider network. In Colorado, for instance, access plans must be filed when  		the health plan applies for a license. The filing must be updated annually and  		when any material changes have been made. Minnesota HMOs have to notify the  		Department of Health within 10 days after any provider termination so that the  		agency has an opportunity to determine whether it will have any effect on the  		adequacy of the plans network. </p>
<p><b>Health Plan Data Collection </b></p>
<p>Of the study states, only the New York Department of Health asks health  		plans to keep and collect data on requests for and denials of these access  		provisions. Other state agencies may collect data from health plans related to  		complaints and appeals. The information, however, is not categorized in a way  		that enables them to track the use of each of these protections.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Although regulators from the Minnesota Department of  		Commerce and Maryland Insurance Administration noted that their agency can and  		has added categories to its database when agency staff notice a pattern  		developing. </p>
<p><b><u>Regulatory Responses to Violations </u></b></p>
<p>While regulators and health plans note that overall compliance with  		these provisions is good, there are some instances where plans have failed to  		implement these laws properly. With the exception of Minnesota, we noted  		consistent mention in the study states of violations related to emergency  		services. Examples of violations that interviewees discussed or we noted  		involved inappropriate denials of emergency services based on the prudent  		layperson standard, improperly requiring enrollees to obtain prior notification  		for emergency services and failing to provide 24-hour access to emergency  		physician services. Other violations noted include failing to inform enrollees  		about their rights to continuity of care, standing referrals and emergency  		services or to honor referrals to specialists. It is difficult to tell,  		however, the extent to which plans are not in compliance with these laws for  		two reasons. First, as mentioned above, regulators do not necessarily record  		complaints by consumer protection. While states are more likely to have data on  		complaints regarding denials for emergency services, the category may not  		specify what the particular problem was with respect to the emergency service.  		Second, not all agencies maintain comprehensive data on the violations they  		have resolved informally. Consequently, while regulators have internal  		knowledge from their day-to-day interaction with plans that help them  		understand what problems exist with implementation, data documenting the extent  		of the problem may be limited. </p>
<p>Interviews indicate that, with a few exceptions, regulators handle most  		violations on a case-by-case basis and usually do not pursue formal enforcement  		actions  those resulting in an order sometimes accompanied by a fine.  		Particularly when regulators are investigating complaints, the agencys  		intervention can encourage a quick, informal resolution to the problem.  		Maryland has some data that illustrates this point. In 1999 the MIA  		investigated 200 complaints involving a plans adverse decision. Of the  		200, 109 of the complaints were resolved when the health plan reversed its  		decision during the agencys investigation. Notably, the health plans  		reversed their decision in 16 of the 21 emergency service complaints before the  		MIA concluded its investigation. The agency noted that plans often do so when  		they obtain additional information from the provider or enrollee.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> In Maryland, as in many other states, it is far more  		likely that an order and a fine will be imposed directly when a health plan  		exceeds the target error rate threshold (5-7 percent) during its market conduct  		examination. </p>
<p>While most of the agencies noted that they rely on informal intervention  		to respond to most violations, Colorado and New York illustrate the broad range  		of approaches to enforcement that states can use. In Colorado, the Division of  		Insurance works to resolve the problem with the health plan before it initiates  		any stage of the formal enforcement process. If the plan does not correct the  		problem, the agency will initiate an enforcement proceeding and may fine the  		plan. To address one Colorado health plans systematic violation of the  		states prudent layperson standard, for instance, the Division of  		Insurance engaged in a desk audit of its emergency services processes and  		claims. The health plan was denying coverage for emergency services based on  		examinations instead of on the prudent layperson standard. The agency worked  		with the plan for approximately six- months to modify their internal system for  		evaluating emergency service claims. The investigation closely approached but  		did not conclude in any formal enforcement action. </p>
<p>In contrast, the New York Department of Health begins the process at the  		outset when it discovers a violation by issuing a statement of deficiency.  		Plans are provided an opportunity to develop and implement a corrective action  		plan, however, before the agency initiates a process for fines. If the  		corrective action plan is implemented adequately the agency may waive the fine.  		The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene follows a similar process.  		</p>
<p>The regulators enforcement authority is a powerful tool and has  		been used by the study states to enforce compliance with various consumer  		protections in a relatively few instances. Orders and fines serve several  		purposes but are primarily used to ensure that health plans change their  		practices and come into compliance with the law. An order and a $25,000  		penalty, the maximum permitted the health commissioner, was applied to one  		Minnesota health plan in February 2000 for violations of continuity of care and  		standing referral laws. The case involved the termination of a Minnesota clinic  		from a health plans provider network. Upon termination, seventeen  		HIV/AIDS enrollees of the health plans SeniorCare plan disenrolled from  		the health plan and joined the states high-risk pool. The health plan  		states that it did not encourage these enrollees to terminate their membership.  		However, an enrollee claimed and the agency concluded that a health plan member  		service representative provided inadequate information about the  		enrollees eligibility for continuity of care or a standing referral to a  		provider qualified to treat his medical condition. The health plan contends  		that this staff representative was inexperienced and provided incomplete  		information to the enrollee. As a result, the agency required the health plan  		to: </p>
<ol type="1"><li>make a $25,000 contribution to a charity or charities approved by the  		  agency in lieu of the administrative penalty, </li>
<li>ensure that all similarly situated enrollees receiving services from  		  the terminated provider receive written information about standing referrals,  		  continuity of care and providers with expertise treating HIV/AIDS; </li>
<li>allow these enrollees to receive a standing referral, upon their  		  request, to network providers with experience and expertise in this area; </li>
<li>allow any enrollee who disenrolled to reenroll with the health plan;  		  and </li>
<li>clearly inform its staff and providers that HIV/AIDS qualifies for a  		  standing referral. </li>
</ol><p>However, fines do not always accompany orders. In Maryland, the  		insurance commissioner can levy fines up to $125,000 per violation unless a  		statute or regulation specifies otherwise and has used this discretion  		assertively in a range of circumstances.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>  		Nevertheless, in some instances, the agency may only require the health plan to  		pay for the service denied. When the Maryland Insurance Administration entered  		an order against three health plans in 1999 because they had wrongly denied  		payment under the prudent layperson standard, for instance, the agency required  		the health plan to pay for the services but did not impose a fine. Another  		order in which the agency required the plan to pay for the enrollees  		emergency room visit involved an instance where the plan had not provided the  		enrollee with 24-hour access to a physician. There are other circumstances when  		an agency may waive a fine. When a law is very new, or when the plan has small  		enrollment and/or may be in poor financial condition. </p>
<p>Similarly, the Minnesota Department of Health issued a cease and desist  		order when a health plan refused to honor an authorized referral. Under the  		agencys rules a referral is defined as a written authorization that  		specifies the number, frequency and duration of the services to be covered as a  		benefit and the provider to which the enrollee was being referred. The plan  		subsequently realized that the services for which the referral was provided  		were not covered benefits under the plan contract and refused to pay for the  		services. The agency agreed that the contract did not include the benefit but  		insisted that under agency regulation authorization of a referral confers a  		benefit that may not otherwise be available under the contract. The  		Commissioner of Health required the plan to pay for the services authorized  		under the referral. Under the order, the Commissioner also required the plan to  		change internal policy language that gave plans authority to disapprove  		authorized referrals under certain situations and pay any claims it had denied  		since the law went into effect for services that had been received pursuant to  		an approved referral. In both the Maryland and Minnesota examples, the  		regulators focused on making the enrollee whole and changing plan practice as  		opposed to imposing a financial penalty. </p>
<p>While fines are not always used, regulators say that there are  		circumstances that almost always result in a fine. Fines are frequently used  		when the patient is in imminent harm or the situation is egregious. Fines are  		also frequently used when the agency determines that the plan is out of  		compliance with a range of rules or the violation represents a business pattern  		or practice. A recent Colorado Division of Insurance enforcement action  		illustrates this point. Through a market conduct examination, the agency  		uncovered, among other violations, a pattern of more than 38 infractions in an  		HMO's policy forms. These violations ranged from inaccurate definitions of  		emergency services to unacceptable utilization review procedures. The HMO was  		fined $77,250. Further, the commissioner ordered the health plan to audit its  		denied claims to determine if the policy violations have resulted in  		far-reaching inappropriate claim denials. </p>
<p>When a health plan failed to follow the statutory procedures governing  		adverse decisions in the external review of an emergency services appeal by an  		individual plan member, the MIA fined the plan $5,000. Maryland regulators  		noted that when the review organization for external appeals cases states it  		was obvious that the treatment was medically necessary, a fine also always  		accompanies those orders. In some instances, the MIA may require a plan to  		apply a portion of its fine to support consumer education activities in  		coordination with the agency. </p>
<p>Enforcement actions are limited to violations related to enrollees of  		health plans under state jurisdiction. The MIA, for instance, found that of the  		1063 complaints regarding medical necessity denials it received in 1999, 220  		involved enrollees covered by the Department of Labor, Office of Personnel  		Management (OPM) or Medicare. The study states do not have the authority to  		assist enrollees of self-funded health plans covered by the Employee Retirement  		Income Security Act or other federally funded programs such as OPM or Medicare.  		The Minnesota Department of Commerce may lend informal assistance to ERISA  		enrollees since it licenses third-party administrators (TPA) and has  		relationships with TPA staff. Otherwise, the agencies refer enrollees of  		self-funded plans to the U.S. Department of Labor and other enrollees to the  		appropriate federal or state agency. </p>
<p><b><a name="V" id="V">V. LESSONS FOR FEDERAL POLICYMAKERS </a></b></p>
<p>The federal government is fortunate to have the opportunity to learn  		from the states' experience implementing and enforcing these and other consumer  		protections. Not only does the state experience provide a range of approaches  		that federal regulators can consider when deciding how to implement these laws.  		The states also provide potential solutions to implementation challenges that  		have worked and insight into practices federal regulators may want to avoid  		because they have not worked well at the state level. In this section, we  		discuss overall lessons and policy recommendations as well as those associated  		with specific consumer protections. These recommendations are based on our  		study of only these four state's implementation and enforcement experience.  		</p>
<p><b><i>1. Guidance on how to interpret and apply laws is important but  		difficult to convey. </i></b></p>
<p>Very little guidance on these consumer protections was provided through  		regulations. As previously discussed, the sparse use of regulations could be  		explained by a number of reasons. In some cases agencies viewed the statutory  		language to be clear and self- implementing, decided that limited resources  		would be better spent on monitoring and enforcement, or sought to reserve  		flexibility. </p>
<p>While they did not develop rules, most states have used other ways to  		provide needed guidance informally and on an ongoing basis. Our interviews  		indicate that advisory bulletins are a favored alternative vehicle for  		communicating information in response to concerns about widespread violations  		or misunderstandings about the law. These documents are similar to the  		operational policy letters distributed by the Health Care Financing  		Administration for the Medicare and Medicaid programs or the bulletins  		published to provide guidance on the Health Insurance Portability and  		Accountability Act. Another example of federal approaches to guidance that  		serve as alternatives to the rulemaking process is the advisory bulletins  		produced by the U.S. Department of Labor Pension and Welfare Benefits  		Administration. While they do not have the force and effect of law, each of  		these documents carry significant weight with the entities to which they apply  		as well as courts. </p>
<p>While the study states did not rely heavily on rules to provide such  		guidance for a number of reasons, this aspect of their approach may not provide  		a useful model for the federal government. First, the states experience  		with these provisions was dependent on how the statutory language was drafted.  		The way in which Congress drafts these provisions may result in different needs  		for regulatory guidance. Second, the federal government may have a larger  		number of health plans to which it must provide guidance arguing for a much  		more formal communication process. Third, the federal government will have the  		additional responsibility of providing guidance to state regulators who may be  		partially dependent on federal decision-making before they can confidently  		perform their responsibilities. Fourth, federal regulators may be faced with  		the additional challenge of overseeing the implementation of federal standards  		that differ, in actual language or interpretation, from that already applied at  		the state level. Formal rules may be the only way to foster adequately more  		consistent implementation of federal standards across the states. </p>
<p>Even so, these consumer protections are very difficult to address  		through prescriptive rules. Over time, however, a tracking of the interpretive  		guidance provided on a case-by- case basis can help identify circumstances  		where illustrative guidance through bulletins or as examples in regulations  		might be helpful to all health plans, providers and consumer advocates. It can  		also serve as a source of information on inconsistencies in implementation and  		new issues that need to be addressed. </p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in providing guidance on these protections,  		responsiveness on an ongoing basis from federal regulators can be extremely  		helpful to state regulators and health plans during implementation. We should  		note, however, that one health plan representative strongly cautioned against  		the issuance of evolving standards that require health plans to make repeated  		internal systems changes over time. As he put it, Do the regulations once  		and then leave them alone for a while. Continued alterations to  		regulatory standards even those that are minimal, he noted, can increase costs  		to health plans because of changes that need to be made to internal systems and  		materials disseminated to enrollees. It can also result in confusion for those  		enrollees. </p>
<p>Further, flexibility is important as well. As markets and health plan  		structures evolve, medical practice and patient needs change, regulators need  		to the ability to be responsive to these changes. Flexible network adequacy  		standards, for example, are critical to accommodate the unique circumstances  		health plans may confront in a rural area. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Track the issues regulators are handling through informal  		communications with health plans to assess the full range of implementation  		challenges which could be addressed through some form of written regulatory  		guidance. </p>
<p>Where prescriptive and specific regulatory guidelines are  		inappropriate or undesirable, consider using illustrative guidance through  		examples in regulations, bulletins and newsletters that reach a broad audience.  		For example, an agency could review the complaints or actions resulting in  		enforcement and communicate its interpretation of how some or all of them  		should be handled by the health plan on a periodic basis. </p>
<p>Post regulations, bulletins, newsletters, market conduct  		examination reports and enforcement actions on the agency website to help  		educate health plans and others about the law. An example of this approach can  		be found on the Colorado Division of Insurance's website. The Maryland  		Insurance Administration has also begun a similar approach with its website.  		</p>
<p>Receive input from interested parties such as health plan  		representatives, consumer advocates and providers prior to implementation to  		identify early misunderstandings in interpretation of the new law and solutions  		to resolving those misunderstandings as well as to communicate agency  		interpretation that will be applied during the implementation process. </p>
<p>Be mindful of the impact of repeated changes in regulatory  		guidance, even minor, on health plan and state agency operations, particularly  		when those changes will require the plan or agency to make significant internal  		systems changes or the consumer to learn a different process or standard for  		accessing services. </p>
<p>To the extent the statute allows, avoid broad health plan  		discretion in establishing the population of enrollees eligible for a consumer  		protection. </p>
<p><i><b> 2. Resources for implementation and enforcement are essential.  		</b></i></p>
<p>Regulators have received a continued increase in responsibility without  		commensurate increase in funding. This results in very real resource  		constraints that affect the scope of implementation and enforcement activities.  		Most regulators noted that they absorbed the responsibility for overseeing the  		implementation of these additional consumer protections by reallocating staff  		and/or increasing the workload of existing staff members and could benefit from  		additional resources for market conduct examinations. The Maryland Insurance  		Administration did create a position titled Managed Care Compliance Coordinator  		in response to increased managed care regulation in that state. This person is  		responsible for coordinating the agencys targeted enforcement and market  		conduct activities in the managed care area. </p>
<p>In general, agency resources have been used to plan for implementation,  		conduct oversight (draft rules of bulletins, review policies, coordinate with  		other agencies, communicate with industry and consumer representatives, etc.),  		create or revise educational materials, and answer questions and requests for  		information about these laws. Without adequate resources, there are limits to  		what implementation and enforcement activities can be performed. Should  		Congress enact health plan consumer protections, effective implementation and  		enforcement by the federal government will require additional resources at the  		central and regional offices to provide regulatory guidance, provide staff  		training and public education, and respond to public inquiries. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Administrative resources are needed for the following key  		activities: </p>
<ul><li>Rulemaking and policy guidance </li>
<li>Public education </li>
<li>Oversight </li>
<li>Data collection and analysis </li>
<li>Public assistance </li>
<li>Interagency coordination and liaison activities </li>
<li>Enforcement </li>
</ul><p>Assess the resources available and needed to perform adequately  		the full range of implementation and enforcement activities at both the central  		and regional offices level. </p>
<p>Earmark funds from enforcement actions to supplement funds  		available for public education, monitoring and enforcement. </p>
<p><i><b> 3. A proactive monitoring role is critical but needs to be varied  		and take into account the nature of the consumer protection at issue.  		</b></i></p>
<p>Regulatory guidance and enforcement activities are frequently prompted  		by complaints made to regulators. Since regulators cannot (and would not want  		to) physically monitor every decision health plans make, complaints to state  		agencies are a very important and logical source of information about plan  		compliance. A pattern of complaints, or even one complaint, can trigger an  		investigation into health plan practices. Yet there are real limitations to  		reliance on complaint data for monitoring. First, consumers are generally not  		aware that they have a protection that has been violated. While they may be  		distressed, they are unlikely to complain to health plans or regulators.  		Second, regulators receive very few of the complaints that are made to health  		plans.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> Third, although a critical monitoring  		tool, market conduct examinations of health plan complaint data typically  		occurs periodically. Fourth, the data collected by regulators are generally not  		categorized according to these consumer protections. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, effective monitoring strategies beyond complaints differ  		depending on the type of provision and pose their own unique challenges: </p>
<p>Some of these protections are more straightforward to monitor  		through means other than complaints because they leave a paper trail that can  		be reviewed in the targeted examinations that regulators conduct. For example,  		violations of the prudent layperson standard can be assessed through a review  		of internal guidelines and emergency claim denials. Reviewing access plans and  		checking the accuracy of provider directories can often bring to light  		violations of the network adequacy standard. Rules governing the plans  		disclosure of information about these protections to enrollees are relatively  		straightforward to monitor. As in New York, regulators can determine whether  		health plans are responsive to requests for information by calling plans at  		random. And they can evaluate the content of plan materials by reading them.  		However, this monitoring approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive  		requiring resources sufficient to train agency staff and conduct effective  		reviews. These are resources not all state agencies may have available. </p>
<p>Not all consumer protection provisions generate a readily  		accessible paper trail. This poses a challenge to effective monitoring.  		Regulators are unlikely to be able to tell whether a plan has denied a request  		for a standing referral by reviewing a claim for example. These types of  		provisions call for a different monitoring approach. New Yorks  		requirement that health plans collect data on requests and denials for these  		provisions serves as a useful example. For data to be reliable, however, there  		needs to be consistency across health plans in how the standards are applied  		and how the plans collect the data. Federal and state regulators may need to  		work with health plans for several years before these objectives are achieved  		and data are especially useful. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Encourage collection of data by health plans and state regulatory  		agencies that measures, in a consistent manner, the number of complaints  		related to these consumer protections as well as the number of requests and  		denials for these consumer protections. </p>
<p>Supplement comprehensive market conduct examinations with targeted  		audits of health plan policy and practice with respect to these consumer  		protections as is done by the study states. Consider, however, to the extent  		resources permit, conducting targeted audits in areas not identified through a  		pattern of complaints as well. </p>
<p>Work collaboratively with knowledgeable consumer advocates on  		initiatives that assess how their constituencies are faring under these  		protections. </p>
<p><i><b>4. Consumer awareness and understanding is low. </b></i></p>
<p>Many of the monitoring strategies previously discussed presume that  		enrollees know that these rights exist but almost all interviewees stated that  		consumers are ill informed about these protections. From their experiences with  		the Medicare and Medicaid programs, federal regulators are quite familiar with  		the enormous challenges associated with educating consumers about their health  		insurance rights and responsibilities. Some of the lessons learned in those  		contexts may be applicable to this one. </p>
<p>Consumer education should be pursued through multiple and redundant  		strategies. Colorados experience demonstrates the importance of  		commitment from the head of the agency to consumer education. Colorado  		interviewees believe that the tone set by the previous and current commissioner  		in this area has helped make inroads into improving consumers knowledge  		about these protections. The commitment is demonstrated in the form of devoting  		staff resources to creating and participating in education initiatives as well  		as developing and disseminating appropriate materials. The New York Department  		of Health has gone to great pains to ensure that enrollees are informed about  		consumer protections in member handbooks and receive accurate information in  		notices and on request. A consumer representative acknowledged that because of  		this effort enrollees have a better chance of getting the information that they  		need from their health plan and a better chance that that information is  		accurate although there is still much room for improvement. While it is vital  		that the member materials contain accurate information, however, this effort  		needs to be part of a much broader educational strategy given the general  		belief that most plan members do not read their handbook or other plan  		materials. </p>
<p>When developing a broad education strategy federal regulators need to  		include outreach to providers and agents. These are two groups who enrollees  		rely on to learn about the options available when they have a problem.  		Effective training of health plan staff is another critical component necessary  		to curtail misinformation and confusion for consumers. To be effective, the  		education strategy should begin early and be redundant and ongoing. </p>
<p>Many states are exploring the use of consumer assistance initiatives  		such as ombudsman programs to not only assist consumers in handling complaints  		against health plans but in educating them about their rights. Further, the  		attorney generals offices in Maryland and New York have established health care  		bureaus to help consumers with their complaints. Even so, consumer advocates  		and others, including the New York Attorney General's office, have advocated  		for an adequately funded statewide Managed Care Consumer Assistance Program  		(MCCAP) to provide additional assistance to consumers. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Monitor member materials for completeness and accuracy. Where  		possible encourage that member materials include useful and appropriate  		illustrative examples of what constitutes a prudent layperson standard, when to  		seek a standing referral, etc. </p>
<p>Work closely with health plan associations to educate their  		members about the meaning and interpretation of the law and encourage health  		plans to conduct ongoing training. Require them to demonstrate competence by  		key staff (in member services, utilization review, claims payment) regarding  		patient protections. </p>
<p>Work closely with hospital, medical and nursing associations as  		part of a coordinated strategy to educate their members about the meaning and  		interpretation of the law before and during implementation. </p>
<p>Work with patient organizations to target patient education  		efforts about protections likely to be especially relevant to people with  		certain chronic conditions. </p>
<p>Conduct a broad consumer education strategy that is redundant and  		ongoing. </p>
<p>Encourage the development of consumer ombudsman programs whose  		mission includes ongoing public education. </p>
<p><i><b>5. Rules and processes should be as consumer friendly as  		practicable. </b></i></p>
<p>Because consumers have a low level of awareness and usually need these  		protections when they are sick and vulnerable, rules that facilitate easy  		access to these protections is important. Exceptions for people who fail to  		meet certain plan requirements because they are seriously ill should be  		considered. Colorado and Minnesota law, for instance, creates an exception from  		health plan rules that require enrollees to notify them within a certain period  		of time after receiving emergency services. Health plans must waive this rule  		for enrollees who cannot meet that deadline due to their medical condition.  		</p>
<p>Making the process for obtaining assistance from regulators consumer  		friendly may also be helpful. Many state agencies typically require enrollees  		to register their complaints in writing. However, an agency may also facilitate  		this process by taking information over the phone and sending the form to the  		enrollee for signature, abandoning that requirement altogether or making  		exceptions in certain circumstances. The involvement of multiple agencies in  		regulating this area creates confusion as to where an enrollee should turn for  		assistance. Clarity in what agency they should call in their health plan  		materials and agency brochures is important. Further, enrollees can be deterred  		from seeking regulatory assistance when they are not offered a toll-free  		telephone number. One state regulator noted that she noticed this problem when  		the COBRA law was first enacted. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Encourage the development of ombudsman programs. Even if consumer  		education efforts are well funded and very successful, the complexity of health  		insurance will continue to overwhelm many individuals, especially when they are  		sick, and even if they are well informed of their rights and responsibilities.  		An adequately staffed and trained ombudsman program can provide one-on-one  		assistance to people who need help resolving problems or navigating the health  		insurance system. </p>
<p>Require health plans to create appropriate exceptions from  		requirements enrollees cannot comply with because of their mental or physical  		health status. </p>
<p>Make exceptions to agency rules that present barriers to seeking  		agency assistance such as submission of written complaints (without  		accompanying agency assistance). </p>
<p>Clarify in all relevant agency and health plan materials the  		telephone numbers enrollees can call or websites enrollees can access for  		assistance. </p>
<p>Provide toll-free telephone numbers for enrollees to call. </p>
<p><i><b>6. Be mindful of interactive effects. </b></i></p>
<p>How the legislation is drafted may affect the availability of some  		potential sources of information for monitoring. The external review process,  		for instance, can be used to monitor implementation. However, how eligibility  		standards are defined can have implications for external review. In all of the  		protections discussed in this report, enrollees in each of the states can use  		the health plans internal process to appeal an applicable plan decision.  		In at least one instance, however, external review may not be available. In  		Maryland, a plans decision to deny a request for continuity of care is  		not subject to the external review process because external review in that  		state is limited to medical necessity decisions and eligibility for care  		continuity is not related to the patients medical needs. Enrollees can  		still seek assistance, however, from other MIA complaints staff. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>If state or federal laws limit external review to medical  		necessity decisions, clarify that other decisions with clinical implications,  		such as continuity of care, would be subject to the external review process.  		</p>
<p>Monitor federal administrative simplification efforts to ensure  		the development of standardized forms and data forms that are consistent with  		data needs for the implementation of patient protections. </p>
<p><i><b>7. Enforcement is key. </b></i></p>
<p>Regulatory authority to monitor implementation and impose orders and  		fines when violations are discovered is a necessary and powerful tool for  		encouraging effective implementation. Regulators believe, and plan  		representatives concur, that health plans have strong incentives to avoid  		orders and fines. In addition to the expense of paying the fine, enforcement  		actions accompanied by a press release bring media attention to the plans  		violation. Further, in states such as Colorado and Maryland, enforcement  		actions are published in the agency newsletter. Fines are reported to the  		National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA), an industry accreditation  		agency, as well as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. </p>
<p>Orders and fines imposed by one state can subject health plans to closer  		scrutiny in other states. The applicable regulatory agencies in the other  		states in which the health plan is licensed must be notified about these  		enforcement actions and may start looking at the health plans activities  		in their state as well. A Minnesota regulator shared an example of how this can  		affect health plans. His state became aware that South Dakota was investigating  		a potential violation by a plan that also operated in Minnesota. This knowledge  		contributed to a decision by Minnesota regulators to investigate that plan as  		well. As a result of their investigation the plan was fined. These state's  		investigations prompted, at least in part, two other states to take a closer  		look at that plans activities resulting in additional fines for that plan  		from those states. Further, as the regulator also noted health plans also have  		incentives to comply in order to avoid further and more stringent legislation  		in the future. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Use enforcement authority  to alter violative health plan  		policies and practices, ensure appropriate coverage for health care services  		and educate health plans about how to come into compliance. </p>
<p>Impose fines automatically when external reviewers note that it  		was obvious that a service was medically necessary. </p>
<p>Encourage consumer advocates and providers to share concerns about  		implementation. State regulators who were responsive to reports and data  		gathered by consumer advocates and providers and conducted a balanced  		assessment of the potential problems, were able to address areas where plans  		were in violation or facing unanticipated implementation challenges. </p>
<p>Publicize orders and fines on websites and newsletters . </p>
<p>A system of inter-agency/interstate notification of enforcement  		actions will alert other regulators to problems that may arise in their  		jurisdiction and support more consistent application of rules. </p>
<p><i><b> 8. Coordination between regulatory offices minimizes  		inconsistency in interpretation and implementation. </b></i></p>
<p>This area of managed care law is often regulated by multiple agencies at  		the state level and may involve multiple agencies at the federal level as well.  		Fragmented authority, while unlikely to change, poses barriers particularly  		when there are unstructured lines of communication about how to handle  		implementation and enforcement issues. If Congress enacts health plan consumer  		protections, in many states federal regulators will interact with staff from  		more than one state agency to implement the federal law. Mechanisms to enhance  		communication between federal regulators and the range of relevant state  		officials would be useful. Periodic meetings with state health and insurance  		department officials at both the national and regional levels may help with  		coordination. Frequently, issues are discussed at the national level during  		meetings of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  		However, one regulator noted that not all of the information discussed at the  		NAIC trickles down to the state agency staff level. Additionally, not all of  		the relevant agencies participate in that organizations deliberations. A  		broadly disseminated, periodic publication dealing with a range of  		federal-state regulatory issues might help reach a broader audience of state  		officials. Through these mechanisms, federal officials can develop  		relationships and encourage state regulators to share the implementation issues  		that they are confronting. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>Create mechanisms to communicate regularly with relevant state  		agency officials about implementation challenges such as through regional  		policy coordination meetings or other venues. </p>
<p>Create mechanisms such as newsletters and websites that can inform  		a wide range of relevant individuals such as complaints staff, external review  		staff and market conduct investigators, about policy issues applicable to the  		implementation of these and other provisions. </p>
<p>Establish a process for agencies to share information about  		complaints so that patterns can be assessed for patterns that may suggest  		implementation problems. </p>
<p><i><b>9. Consistency in application of these laws - if that is the  		federal goal - will be difficult to accomplish in the short term. </b></i></p>
<p>It is unclear whether a federal patient protection law would largely  		preempt state law, serve as floor, or coexist with state law. Regardless, the  		existing framework in the states will impact the application of any federal law  		that Congress enacts. </p>
<p>States apply their laws to different types of health plans.  		Consequently, some health plans may have established internal systems in place  		while others will be starting from scratch to integrate these standards into  		their internal operations. It will take time for those health plans that have  		not had to comply with these standards to establish systems to do so. Further,  		it will take time for plans subject to these laws to adapt to any different  		interpretations accompanying federal standards. </p>
<p>Given the differences among the states, consistent application to  		federal law, while a goal, may not be practical in the short-term. Where  		federal law becomes the state standard, it will take some time for health plans  		to revise materials, make administrative changes to internal systems and  		educate their staff. It will also take time for health plans and state  		regulators to change the way state regulators and health plans are use to  		interpreting the meaning of these laws to conform to federal law. One state  		regulator noted that ideally the states should have at least one year after  		promulgation of federal regulations to work with their legislators and health  		plans to bring the state into compliance with the new law. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p>To the extent the statute permits, allow sufficient time for state  		regulators and health plans to make the proper adjustments to their laws,  		policies, publications and other materials. </p>
<p>Establish formal structures for federal and state regulators to  		communicate and interact regularly  periodic conference calls and  		meetings); establish contacts for information and problem-solving  so  		that greater consistency in application can be gained over time. </p>
<p><i><b>10. The states' experience with specific consumer protections  		provides insight into how to avoid or respond to potential implementation  		challenges. </b></i></p>
<p>The implementation challenges confronted at the state level offer a  		number lessons for federal policymakers about how they might head off some of  		the problems confronted at the state level. Federal regulators may want to  		consider some of the following recommendations drawn from these states'  		experience implementing each of the consumer protections. </p>
<p><u>Policy Recommendations: </u></p>
<p><i>Emergency services: </i></p>
<p>Ensure that claims forms are updated to reflect accurately the  		information health plans need to make decisions appropriately. </p>
<p>Explicitly require health plans to conduct a reasonable  		investigation into presenting symptoms before denying claims for emergency  		services. </p>
<p>Establish the minimum time period health plans can require  		enrollees to notify them by after receiving emergency services and require an  		exception for enrollees who cannot meet the post-notification requirement due  		to their health condition. </p>
<p>Prohibit health plans from discouraging use of 911 services when  		enrollees are experiencing an emergency. </p>
<p><i>Network Adequacy:</i></p>
<p>Reserve flexibility for assessing the adequacy of a health plan's  		network in rural and other health manpower shortage areas on a case-by-case  		basis. </p>
<p>Evaluate provider directories on an ongoing basis to ensure that  		they reflect accurately the providers who are part of the health plans' network  		and who are accepting patients. The Internet may be one practical tool for  		updating directories on a real-time basis. </p>
<p>Require health plans to collect data on requests for  		out-of-network access. Compiling case findings of external appeals on  		out-of-network denials also will yield data on the application of this  		provision. </p>
<p><i>Continuity of Care: </i></p>
<p>Spell out process for identifying who needs to be notified. </p>
<p>Solicit the involvement of providers in the identification and  		notification process. </p>
<p>Require health plans to collect data on requests for standing  		referrals. </p>
<p><i>Standing Referrals and Access to Specialists: </i></p>
<p>Require health plans to notify primary care physicians when a  		specialist is no longer with the plan's network. </p>
<p>Prohibit retrospective denials for pre-authorized treatments,  		including those received as part of a standing or single referral to a  		specialist, except in cases such as fraud, misrepresentation or nonpayment of  		premiums. </p>
<p>Clarify how referrals made to out-of-network specialists because  		the health plan lacked an appropriate provider to treat the enrollee's medical  		condition are handled when the enrollee is a member of a point-of-service plan.  		</p>
<hr /><p><sup><a name="1" id="1">1</a></sup> Maryland Insurance Administrations  		Report on the Healthcare Appeals and Grievance Law 20, 27, 32 April 2000)  		[hereinafter referred to as MIA Report]. See also page HB3 in Appendix G. It is  		interesting to note that not all health plans report grievances in this area  		while others report significant numbers.</p>
<p><sup><a name="2" id="2">2</a></sup> The Maryland legislature recently enacted a  		law, effective October 1, 2000, that extends continuity of care protections  		when any provider terminates from a health benefit plans provider panel,  		not just primary care physicians.</p>
<p><sup><a name="3" id="3">3</a></sup> As is true in other states, Colorado also  		has a separate continuity-of-coverage requirement that protects individuals who  		lose health coverage while they are an inpatient in a hospital or other  		facility. Under this protection, the health plan must continue to pay for  		inpatient care for such individuals until they are discharged from the  		facility. This protection does not apply to individuals who lose coverage  		because of their own failure to pay premiums. </p>
<p><sup><a name="4" id="4">4</a></sup> Colorados Task Force on small group  		and rural access issues may make further recommendations relating to this  		protection.</p>
<p><sup><a name="5" id="5">5</a></sup> Although not the subject of this report,  		most of the study states have developed regulations implementing related laws  		governing utilization review and/or external review.</p>
<p><sup><a name="6" id="6">6</a></sup> During these examinations, regulators  		review the health plans procedures to ensure that they comply with  		relevant laws. State agencies vary in the frequency of these exams ranging from  		once a year to once every five years. The New York Department of Health, for  		instance, reviews HMOs annually for quality and access. In Minnesota, the  		Departments of Health and Insurance perform market conduct examinations every  		two to three years. The Maryland Insurance Administration conducts market  		conduct examinations of domestic health plans every five years but may do so  		more frequently if the agency is concerned that a health plan is having a  		problem with compliance. </p>
