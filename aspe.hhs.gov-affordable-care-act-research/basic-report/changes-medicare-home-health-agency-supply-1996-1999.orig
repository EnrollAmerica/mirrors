<p>Closure of many Medicare home health agencies (HHAs) following  		implementation of the interim payment system (IPS) mandated by the Balanced  		Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 was a concern of policy makers, stakeholders, and  		advocacy groups. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) (1999) found that  		over the 18 months that followed implementation of the IPS in October 1997, 760  		HHAs closed, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and only 45 HHAs entered the  		market nationwide. The Office of Inspector General (IOG) (2000) reported that  		the number of Medicare-certified HHAs decreased by 25 percent overall from 1997  		to 1999.</p>
<p>Past studies of changes in the supply of Medicare HHAs after IPS  		implementation have employed data from the Medicare Online Survey,  		Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) system to analyze (GAO 1999; OIG  		2000).OSCAR system data are helpful in identifying agencies that either no  		longer participate at all in the Medicare program or which have merged with  		another Medicare-certified HHA. However, they do not contain information on a  		less obvious way that HHA supply can be reduced, namely, by active  		HHAs shrinking their geographic service areas. That is, rather than  		discontinuing all service to Medicare beneficiaries, an agency may opt to only  		discontinue service in a portion of its geographic service area, for example,  		by the closure of one or more of its branches or subunits. In addition, because  		the provider surveys entered into OSCAR are conducted in up to18 month  		intervals, counts of certified agencies for any particular year may be  		inaccurate because of lags in reporting.</p>
<p>This paper expands upon previous research addressing the question of how  		supply of Medicare HHAs changed after implementation of the IPS in two  		important ways. First, Medicare HHA claims activity is used together with  		Medicare certification status from the OSCAR system to determine the Medicare  		service activity status of HHAs. Second, changes in the supply of Medicare home  		health care (HHC) is more broadly defined by considering not only agency  		closings, but also agencies that changed their geographic service areas  		following implementation of the IPS. Descriptive analyses provide some new  		insight about the magnitude of both of these sources of Medicare HHC supply  		change following implementation of the IPS. Multivariate analyses provide a  		deeper understanding of how HHAs responses to the IPS varied with respect  		to characteristics of agencies and the geographic markets they served.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">II. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>Beginning in the late 1980s, spending on Medicares home health  		benefit grew rapidly. Between 1988 and 1997, spending increased an average of  		28.2 percent annually, from $1.9 billion to $17.8 billion (GAO 1999; Health  		Care Financing Administration 1998). This growth has been attributed primarily  		to a loosening of eligibility and coverage criteria in 1989 in response to a  		class action suit involving inconsistent interpretations of these criteria by  		Medicare fiscal intermediaries (Bishop, Kerwin &amp; Wollack 1999; McCall,  		Komisar, Petersons &amp; Moore 2001; GAO 1998), as well as some states  		Medicare maximization policies that took advantage of more liberal Medicare  		guidelines to cover some of the costs associated with long-term care (LTC) for  		beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (GAO 1998).</p>
<p>The BBA of 1997 required the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA,  		now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hereafter referred to as  		CMS) to replace its cost-based reimbursement systems to prospective payment  		systems (PPS) in many settings, including hospital outpatient departments,  		skilled nursing facilities, HHAs, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and LTC  		hospitals (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2000). The reimbursement  		changes of the BBA were intended to slow spending growth and provide incentives  		to providers in these settings to deliver care more efficiently. For HHAs, the  		BBA sought to impose limits on spending per beneficiary and per visit (National  		Health Policy Forum 1999).</p>
<p>Recognizing that the development of a PPS for HHAs would take  		considerable time, CMS created an IPS to affect a more immediate slowing of  		expenditure growth. CMS began phasing in the IPS as early as October 1997  		depending upon an HHAs cost reporting year, with original expectations  		that the PPS would be fully implemented by October 1999 (later delayed until  		October 1, 2000). Under the IPS, HHAs continued to be reimbursed according to  		their costs, but these costs were subject to two cost limits in the aggregate:  		an area-specific per-visit ceiling that was more stringent than pre-IPS  		reimbursement, and an annual maximum HHA payment limit that considered the  		total number of beneficiaries served using an annual maximum per-beneficiary  		amount. </p>
<p>A dramatic contraction in Medicare home health expenditures was observed  		following implementation of the IPS. Whereas Medicare expenditures per home  		health fee-for-service user increased by an average annual rate of about 22  		percent from 1992-1997, they decreased by an average annual rate of about -27  		percent between fiscal years 1997 and 1999 (MedPAC 2000). According to McCall,  		Kosimar, Petersons &amp; Moore (2001), total spending decreased over 50 percent  		(from around $16.4 billion to around $7.8 billion), total per-beneficiary  		spending decreased 50 percent (from around $500 to around $248), and annual  		per-user spending decreased 37 percent (from around $4,969 to around $3,110).  		Likewise, the total number of visits per-user decreased around 41 percent.  		Payments per-visit increased over this period by 7 percent (from around $63.00  		to around $67.40). </p>
<p>In their 1998 report, the GAO described the impact of the IPS in terms  		of agency closures. In sum, the GAO (1998) indicated that there were more HHAs  		in August 1998 than there were in October 1996, and that recent closures were  		dwarfed by longer-run industry growth. Since the implementation of the IPS in  		October 1997 through June 1998, 554 HHAs closed voluntarily nationwide, with an  		additional 206 closing involuntarily due primarily to a failure to meet minimum  		quality or financial standards. During the same period, only 45 HHAs entered  		the market nationwide. An OIG (2000) report indicated that the number of HHAs  		decreased by 25 percent overall from 1997 to 1999.</p>
<p>For the three years prior to the implementation of the IPS, an annual  		average of 285 HHAs closed voluntarily and 62 closed involuntarily (during the  		same three-year period, an average of 1,227 HHAs opened each year). Half of  		these closures were concentrated in four states; California, Louisiana,  		Oklahoma and Texas. Moreover, HHAs that closed voluntarily were more likely to  		be smaller (treating an average of 166 beneficiaries compared with 385  		beneficiaries for HHAs that remained open) and provided more treatments per  		beneficiary (averaging over 90 visits per beneficiary compared to about 65 for  		HHAs that remained open). These factors may suggest that less efficient HHAs  		were less able to accommodate the changes to their reimbursement (GAO 1998),  		but much in the literature suggests that providers that focus on meeting the  		needs of more complex, higher cost beneficiaries are more likely to be  		negatively impacted by the reimbursement limits and blended rates of the IPS  		(GAO 1998; National Health Policy Forum 1999; Bishop, Kerwin &amp; Wallack  		1999).</p>
<p>An important distinction between <i>agency</i> closures and agency  		<i>branch</i> closures is made in the GAO (1998) report. Under Medicare rules,  		HHA branches are not considered independent providers. Rather, they are part  		and parcel of the parent agency. As such, branches do not receive unique  		provider certification, are not individually surveyed or certified for Medicare  		compliance, and are not required to file a unique Medicare cost report. In  		general, it was often financially advantageous for a branch to operate under a  		parent agency that had more attractive reimbursement as a result of their urban  		locale and higher wage index, while the branch provided services in an area  		with a lower wage index. This distinction was reiterated after reports from the  		home health industry about agency closures were substantially higher than those  		calculated by the GAO.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">III. DATA AND METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>Multiple data sources were employed in the study. Medicare HHC claims  		data for the calendar years 1996 and 1999 were used to determine the activity  		status of HHAs and to delineate their geographic service areas. The year 1996  		is the latest full calendar year preceding implementation of the IPS on October  		1, 1997. The year 1999 was the most recent full calendar year of claims data  		available at the start of the study. It precedes the implementation of the  		Medicare HHC PPS that occurred in October 2000. Medicare Provider of Service  		(POS) files for 1996 and 1999, derived from the OSCAR system, contained  		information on Medicare certification status and several organizational  		attributes of agencies. Medicare Denominator file (MDF) data from 1996 were  		aggregated to produce measures of the total Medicare beneficiary population  		residing in geographic health service market areas (HSMAs). Finally,  		county-level data from the 2000 Area Resource File (ARF) on hospitals and  		nursing homes were used to specify various indicators reflecting the supply of  		LTC services for the multivariate analysis.</p>
<h3>Components of Medicare HHA Supply Changes</h3>
<p>Although complete market exit and market entry by HHAs via changes in  		Medicare certification status clearly represent changes in Medicare HHA  		provider supply, these are not the only ways in which Medicare HHA supply  		changes can occur. While still retaining their Medicare certification, some  		HHAs may decrease Medicare HHA supply by contracting their geographic service  		area and visit volume, perhaps through the closure of branches or subunits.  		Other certified HHAs may increase Medicare HHA supply by adding staff to serve  		additional beneficiaries in an expanded geographic service area. </p>
<p>Medicare HHA supply changes, as reflected by increased or decreased  		visit capacity, can also occur in the absence of agency closures or any changes  		in HHAs' geographic service areas. However, there is an important fundamental  		geographic basis underlying policy concerns about the many HHA closures that  		followed implementation of the IPS. When Medicare HHA supply reductions occur  		via agency closure (or geographic service area contraction), the potential  		adverse impacts on beneficiary access are spatially concentrated in geographic  		areas where service is discontinued. Given the geographic basis of HHC service  		delivery, travel costs naturally limit the geographic extent of HHA service  		areas, which in turn, may limit the number of agencies able to expand service  		to affected areas. Potential access problems may be of particular concern in  		places where Medicare beneficiaries are served by a handful of HHAs. If the  		Medicare HHA supply reductions that followed the IPS resulted from proportional  		reductions in staffing and service capacity among all Medicare-certified HHAs,  		it is doubtful that there would be a similar level of policy concern about  		potential access problems. </p>
<p>In this study Medicare HHA supply changes are broadly defined to  		encompass not only market exits and entries, but also significant changes in  		agencies geographic service areas. When an HHA fully exits the Medicare  		home health market, the agency discontinues service to <i>all</i> Medicare  		beneficiaries in the service area it previously served. Similarly, when an HHA  		is a new market entrant, service is initiated to <i>all</i> Medicare  		beneficiaries in the new geographic service area where the agency willingly  		provides visits. Under this line of reasoning, HHAs which exhibit significant  		contractions or expansions of their geographic service areas can be viewed as  		<i>partial market exits or partial market entries</i> in the sense that service  		is discontinued to or added for some, but not all beneficiaries. </p>
<h3>Requirements for Active Medicare Service</h3>
<p>Measuring HHA supply changes in ways other than Medicare certification  		status requires consideration of what level of service to Medicare  		beneficiaries is necessary for an HHA to be actively serving Medicare  		beneficiaries. Although a reliable measure of Medicare certification would  		certainly seem to be a necessary condition for active Medicare service, it may  		not be sufficient for practical measurement of HHA supply changes. National  		Medicare HHA claims data for 1996 and 1999 reveal that a small but significant  		number of Medicare-certified HHAs actually serve very few Medicare  		beneficiaries annually. For example, 559 HHAs, amounting to 5.7 percent of the  		9,806 HHAs with at least one Medicare visit claim in 1996, served ten or fewer  		different beneficiaries in 1996. The market behavior of HHAs serving so few  		patients is unlikely to have much practical significance for measuring HHA  		supply change. As part of the changes in Medicare participation rules made in  		1997 designed to screen out problem providers, agencies were required to serve  		at least ten patients before seeking Medicare certification (GAO 1999). While  		these rules could be used as a basis for defining active Medicare service,  		there are practical difficulties in measuring geographic service area changes  		for HHAs serving so few beneficiaries. As any assumed minimum beneficiary  		threshold will be arbitrary, active service to Medicare beneficiaries is  		conservatively defined in this study to be the provision of visits to more than  		20 different beneficiaries annually. There were 958 HHAs, which accounted for  		0.22 percent of total Medicare HHA visits in 1996, considered to be inactive in  		1996 under this definition. Among these 958 HHAs, 208 of them were certified  		but also inactive in 1999, and 434 of them were no longer Medicare-certified in  		1999. There were also 211 HHAs that obtained Medicare certification after 1996  		but did not meet the minimum beneficiary service threshold in 1999. These  		latter 853 HHAs that did not actively serve Medicare beneficiaries in either  		1996 and/or 1999 under the assumed threshold were excluded from the study,  		leaving 10,034 HHAs that met the active Medicare service requirement in 1996  		and/or 1999. </p>
<h3>Classification of Medicare HHA Supply Changes</h3>
<p>A methodology was developed to classify HHAs that actively served  		Medicare beneficiaries in at least one of the years 1996 or 1999 into one of  		six mutually exclusive categories: </p>
<ol><li><b><i>HHA market exit</i></b>: This category includes HHAs that  		  actively served more than 20 beneficiaries in 1996 with <i>no Medicare  		  claims</i> in 1999. </li>
<li><b><i>HHA service area contraction</i></b>: This category includes:  		  (1) HHAs that actively served more than 20 beneficiaries in both 1996 and 1999  		  and contracted their geographic service area between 1996 and 1999; and (2)  		  HHAs with Medicare claims in both 1996 and 1999 that actively served more than  		  20 beneficiaries only in 1996.</li>
<li><b><i>HHA service area expansion</i></b>: This category includes: (1)  		  HHAs that actively served more than 20 beneficiaries in both 1996 and 1999 and  		  expanded their geographic service area between 1996 and 1999; and (2) HHAs with  		  Medicare claims in both 1996 and 1999 that actively served more than 20  		  beneficiaries only in 1999. </li>
<li><b><i>HHA service area change</i></b>: This category includes HHAs  		  that actively served more than 20 beneficiaries in both 1996 and 1999 whose  		  geographic service area changed between 1996 and 1996 due to both discontinued  		  service in some areas and expansion of service to others.</li>
<li><b><i>HHA service area stable</i></b>: This category includes HHAs  		  that actively served more than 20 beneficiaries in both 1996 and 1999 whose  		  geographic service area was relatively stable between 1996 and 1999.</li>
<li><b><i>HHA new market entrant</i></b>: This category includes HHAs  		  that actively served 20 or more beneficiaries in 1999 with <i>no Medicare  		  claims</i> in 1996.</li>
</ol><p>A summary of the methodology employed to classify HHA geographic service  		area changes as expanding, contracting, stable, or changed, is contained in the  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix</a>. </p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> contains information about the  		distribution of 10,034 HHAs that actively served Medicare beneficiaries in  		either 1996 or 1999 or both years among the six Medicare HHA supply change  		categories defined above. The relatively conservative criteria used to classify  		HHAs as expanding or contracting their service areas have produced a set of HHA  		classifications exhibiting a high degree of face validity. Among HHAs  		classified as contracting their service areas, about 36.3 percent of total  		beneficiaries served in 1996 lived in zip codes that were subsequently dropped  		from these HHAs geographic service areas. Only 3.2 percent of  		beneficiaries served in 1999 by HHAs in this group lived in zip codes that were  		newly served in 1999. A reciprocal pattern to this one is found for HHAs  		classified as expanding their geographic service areas. Whereas only 2.5  		percent of beneficiaries served by these HHAs in 1996 lived in zip codes that  		were later dropped from an HHAs service area, 39.2 percent of  		beneficiaries served in 1999 lived in zip codes that were not previously served  		by these HHAs in 1996. Among HHAs classified as having stable geographic  		service areas, only 3.2 percent of beneficiaries served in 1996 and 4.1 percent  		of beneficiaries served in 1999 lived in zip codes that were dropped and added  		to these HHAs service areas between 1996 and 1999, respectively. A  		relatively small number of HHAs, accounting for only 3.7 percent of active HHAs  		in 1996, could not be classified as either expanding or contracting their  		service areas under the classification criteria employed. As expected, a  		relatively high percentage of beneficiaries served by these HHAs in 1996 and  		1999, respectively, lived in zip codes that were dropped (18.5 percent) or  		added between 1996 and 1999.</p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> also contains information about distance  		traveled to beneficiaries served by HHAs in 1996 and 1999. Mean distance  		traveled to beneficiaries in their service areas among HHAs that contracted  		their service areas declined by about three miles between 1996 and 1999,  		presumably as a consequence of a tendency to discontinue service in more  		distant than closer zip codes.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> On the other hand, the mean distance traveled  		to beneficiaries in their service areas among HHAs that expanded their service  		areas increased by about 4.3 miles, presumably as a consequence of a tendency  		to add service in more distant than closer zip codes. In stark contrast to  		these two groups of HHAs, there was very little if any change in mean travel  		distance to beneficiaries in the service areas of HHAs with stable geographic  		service areas. </p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows similar differences among categories  		in the data on changes in staffing levels for registered nurses (RNs) and  		certified nurse aides (CNAs). The decrease in mean RN and CNA staffing among  		HHAs with stable service areas reflects broader overall trends of supply  		contraction in the HHA industry following the IPS. Nevertheless, the data  		suggest that on average HHAs that were classified as contracting their service  		areas exhibited larger percentage decreases in staffing, particularly for RNs.  		The mean staffing level changes among HHAs classified as expanding their  		geographic service areas are sharply different from all other categories of  		HHAs. On average HHAs that expanded their service areas exhibited RN and CNA  		staffing levels in 1999 that were 83 percent and 23 percent <i>higher</i> than  		those in 1996, respectively. Overall these supporting data also suggest of a  		high degree of construct validity in the HHA response classifications. </p>
<h3>Variable Specification</h3>
<p>Multivariate analyses were performed to identify agency and market area  		attributes associated with the categorization of HHA supply changes described  		above. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> contains a summary of definitions for all  		specified independent variables. Here we discuss the rationale for  		specification of these variables and their expected relationships with the  		outcome variable, or the likelihood that HHAs responded to the IPS through  		market exit, service area expansion, service area contraction, or a changed  		service area, relative to maintaining a stable geographic service area. Given  		our premise that the motivations for service area contraction and expansion are  		similar to the more extreme respective responses of market exit and entry,  		generally it is expected that most independent variables should have the same  		directional influence on these two outcomes. Weaker relationships are expected  		for service area contraction outcome relative to market exit, however.  		Expectations about the signs of variables with respect to the outcome of  		changed service areas are uncertain given the mixed nature of this form of  		supply response.</p>
<p><b><i>Agency Attributes</i></b></p>
<p>Dummy variables were specified for variables measuring the ownership  		status, organizational setting, and organizational structure of HHAs. GAO  		(1999) found that for-profit HHAs were disproportionately over-represented  		among market exits relative to government and voluntary not-for-profit  		agencies. In addition to a dummy variable distinguishing proprietary HHAs a  		separate dummy variable was specified for HHAs with government control.  		Voluntary not-for-profit control served as the reference class. Given the  		broader service missions that are likely to influence the behavior of  		not-for-profit agencies, for-profit HHAs are expected to be more likely than  		their voluntary not-for-profit counterparts to exit and to contract their  		service areas, and less likely to expand their service areas. As government  		HHAs may be less dependent on Medicare revenue than are voluntary  		not-for-profit agencies, government HHAs are expected to be less likely to exit  		and contract their service areas than not-for-profit HHAs. </p>
<p>Expectations about differences service area expansion among HHAs with  		different control status are uncertain. To the extent that many service area  		expansions reflect an agency responding to service demands of beneficiaries in  		places affected by closures and/or service area contractions, government HHAs  		may be less likely than voluntary not-for-profit agencies to fill those needs  		given their service missions. A dummy variable was specified to distinguish  		HHAs based in hospitals or nursing facilities from freestanding agencies. Such  		facility-based agencies should be less dependent on Medicare HHC revenues than  		freestanding agencies since they also receive patient revenue for institutional  		care. More modest market responses are expected for facility-based agencies  		(i.e., less likely to contract or expand their service areas, and to exit) than  		freestanding agencies. </p>
<p>A count variable was specified as the number of subunits and/or branches  		operated by an agency in 1996 to distinguish HHAs whose market response to the  		IPS may have been influenced by changes in Medicare participation rules in  		1997. GAO (1999) noted that prior to 1997 it was common for a parent HHA to set  		up branches or semi-autonomous subunits for delivery of services. While a  		parent HHA may maintain some administrative control over a subunit, subunits  		are required to independently meet Medicare certification requirements and are  		supposed to serve patients in a different geographic area than the parent  		organization. On the other hand branches are not autonomous organizations and  		are not required to independently meet certification requirements from the  		parent organization. Changes in Medicare participation rules implemented in  		1997 clarified the rules that branches had to be located sufficiently close to  		the parent organization (about ½-1 hour driving time) so that the parent  		organization could effectively manage the operation and service delivery  		without independent Medicare certification (GAO 1999). As a consequence of  		these changes in Medicare participation rules, HHAs operating subunits and/or  		branches in 1996 are expected to be more likely than their counterparts without  		such an organizational structure to exit and contract their geographic service  		areas. The expected effect of subunits and branches on service area expansion  		is uncertain. While Medicare participation rule changes might be expected to  		have a negative effect on service area expansion, the infrastructure of closed  		branches may facilitate an agencys ability to expand its service area  		under its parent agency. </p>
<p>GAO (1999) found that HHAs with less than five years of Medicare program  		tenure were disproportionately over-represented among closed agencies. As HHAs  		of longer Medicare program tenure should be more likely to have been able to  		achieve administrative and operational efficiencies compared to HHAs of shorter  		tenure, agencies with longer tenure should be less likely to contract their  		service area or exit the market. In addition, a separate dummy variable to  		distinguish agencies with Medicare certification dates after the start of the  		1994 fiscal year. In contrast to established agencies whose per-beneficiary  		payment limits under the IPS were largely based on their own historical program  		experience, per-beneficiary payment limits for HHAs without a full year of  		program experience in fiscal year 1994 were fully based on the national median  		for established agencies. If recent market entrants tend to have  		per-beneficiary costs lower than established HHAs nationally, they should be  		less likely to exit or contract their service area, and more likely to expand  		their service area than established HHAs. On the other hand, national limits  		based on established HHAs should adversely affect recent market entrants with  		higher per-beneficiary costs.</p>
<p>The remaining two agency variables represent attributes associated with  		Medicare service delivery. Total beneficiaries served in 1996 was specified as  		an indicator of the scale of Medicare service provision by the HHA. GAO (1999)  		found that smaller HHAs serving fewer Medicare beneficiaries were  		disproportionately over-represented among closed agencies. HHAs serving larger  		volumes of beneficiaries annually should be less constrained by per-beneficiary  		limits imposed by the IPS because per-beneficiary costs will be affected as  		much by a relatively small number of high cost patients. The expected effect of  		total beneficiaries served on the likelihood of service area expansion is  		uncertain. The IPS did not provide any positive incentives for expansion by  		larger HHAs. The last agency attribute, average visits per beneficiary served  		in 1996, was specified as an indicator of the intensity of visits provided by  		HHAs to patients. While it is not equivalent to an agencys  		per-beneficiary costs, it should be fairly highly correlated with it. Since an  		agencys per-beneficiary limit was partially based on its own historical  		cost experience and partially based on the median values of HHAs in its region,  		per-beneficiary limits imposed with the IPS were more stringent for HHAs with  		higher costs per beneficiary served. Accordingly, HHAs that provided more  		visits per beneficiary served in 1996 should be more likely to exit and  		contract their service areas, and less likely to expand their service areas.  		</p>
<p><b><i>Market Area Attributes</i></b></p>
<p>Two variables were specified as indicators of the level of Medicare HHC  		demand from residents of the market area of each HHA using the county-based  		HSMAs developed by Makuc, Haglund, Ingram, Kleinman &amp; Feldman (1991) as the  		geographic units.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Since  		Medicare beneficiaries aged 75 years and older exhibit much higher Medicare HHC  		utilization rates than younger beneficiaries, market area Medicare HHC demand  		attributes were measured with data on this subset of the aged Medicare  		population. The size of an HHAs Medicare HHC market was specified as the  		number of Medicare beneficiaries aged 75 years and older in the HSMAs within an  		HHAs service area in 1996. Since travel costs should impede the delivery  		of HHC visits to distant patients, a demand density variable was specified to  		distinguish rural and urban HSMAs. The density of Medicare HHC market demand  		was specified as Medicare beneficiaries aged 75 year or older in 1996 per  		square mile for HSMAs within an HHAs service area.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> In general, HHAs providing visits in market  		areas with greater Medicare HHC demand should be less likely to exit and  		contract their service areas, and more likely to expand their service areas.  		</p>
<p>The presence of other competitor HHAs serving beneficiaries in the same  		market area is likely to affect supply responses by individual agencies. A  		count of active HHAs with service areas within the HSMAs served by an HHA in  		1996 was specified as an indicator of competitive market structure and  		potential over-supply of Medicare HHC capacity. HHAs serving patients in market  		areas with more competitors should be more likely to exit or contract their  		service areas in response to the IPS than HHAs serving in market areas with  		lesser Medicare HHC supply. The effect of competitor agencies on the likelihood  		of expansion is uncertain. To the extent that more competitors reflects  		over-supply more than competition, having more competitor agencies should have  		a negative effect on the likelihood of service area expansion. An HHAs  		market share of total Medicare beneficiaries receiving visits in 1996 within  		the HSMA it serves was specified as an additional separate indicator of the  		HHAs competitive position <i>relative </i>to other agencies serving  		patients in the same market area. An HHA with a relatively small market share  		may behave differently than an otherwise similar one with a relatively large  		share in the same market area. HHAs with relatively larger market shares should  		be more able to maintain stable geographic service areas given their dominant  		market presence. On the other hand, the effect of a smaller market share on  		market response is less clear. While contraction by HHAs with smaller market  		shares may make them vulnerable to a greater risk of exit, such HHAs may also  		respond strategically by expanding service in areas where service was  		discontinued by other agencies.</p>
<p>To the extent that their service are substitutable for Medicare HHC  		visits, other sources of post-acute care (PAC) and LTC supply in an HHAs  		market area, such as nursing homes, chronic disease hospitals, and LTC  		hospitals may also influence individual HHA supply decisions. Two variables  		were specified as indicators of other sources of PAC and LTC supply: nursing  		home beds per resident beneficiary 75 years and older and the count of LTC and  		chronic disease hospitals in the HSMAs served by an HHA. HHAs serving patients  		in market areas with greater supplies of other PAC and LTC resources should be  		more likely to exit and contract their service area, and less likely to expand  		their service areas. </p>
<p>Finally, GAO (1999) found that closed HHAs were disproportionately  		over-represented in southwestern states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.  		Although a fairly large set of agency and market area variables were specified  		as factors likely to influence individual HHA supply decisions, some important  		factors may remain unspecified. Eight regional dummy variables corresponding to  		Census Divisions as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census were specified to  		capture unspecified residual influences associated with regional location.</p>
<h2><a name="result" id="result">IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS</a></h2>
<h3>Components of Change in Medicare Beneficiaries Served  		1996-1999</h3>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> contains information about changes in the  		volume of beneficiaries served for each category of HHAs, and gives some  		indication of the relative net contributions of market exits, service area  		contractions and expansions, and market entry to the 25 percent net national  		decline in Medicare beneficiaries served by active HHAs, a decline from  		3,994,963 beneficiaries served in 1996 to 2,995,812 served in 1999. HHAs that  		closed after 1996 served more than 558,000 beneficiaries in 1996 that they no  		longer served in 1999, a substantial amount relative to the net decrease of  		nearly one million Medicare beneficiaries served by HHAs in 1999 relative to  		1996. However, HHA exits are only one of several sources that contributed to  		this overall net decline. HHAs which significantly contracted their geographic  		service areas served more than 244,000 fewer beneficiaries overall in 1999  		relative to 1996. A little more than half of this net decrease was associated  		with discontinued service in the dropped portions of their 1996 geographic  		service areas. Note also that HHAs with stable geographic service areas served  		more than one-half million fewer beneficiaries in 1999 than 1996, an amount  		nearly as large as the volume of beneficiaries served by exiting HHAs. Finally,  		the data also show that a sizable minority of HHAs expanded Medicare HHA via  		expansion of their geographic service areas. HHAs expanding their geographic  		service areas served nearly 195,000 more beneficiaries in 1999 than 1996. While  		roughly three-fourths of this net increase was attributable to service in  		expanded portions of their geographic service areas, there was also a net  		increase of nearly 56,000 beneficiaries served in portions of their service  		areas that were already served in 1996. It is also notable that the net  		increase in beneficiaries served by HHAs expanding their geographic service  		areas was actually larger than the nearly 132,000 beneficiaries served by new  		market entrant HHAs in 1999. </p>
<p>Previous studies have focused nearly exclusively on the high number of  		agency closures that occurred after implementation of the IPS (GAO 1999; OIG  		2000). However, decomposing the overall change in the volume of Medicare  		beneficiaries served between 1996 and 1999 into multiple sources suggests a  		more complex picture of HHA supply response to the IPS than has been commonly  		portrayed in other studies. While more modest than that associated with  		closures and new market entry, the supply changes associated service area  		contractions and expansions by active HHAs were not trivial by any means. Our  		multivariate analysis results impart some additional insight about the factors  		influencing individual HHA supply decisions after implementation of the IPS.  		</p>
<h3>Multivariate Analysis Results</h3>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> contains empirical results from a  		multinomial logit model that was fitted on the supply decisions of 9,061 active  		HHAs in 1996. Odds ratio transformations of the estimated parameters are  		reported to facilitate interpretation of the results. Since five alternative  		supply decision outcomes were specified, there are four sets of estimated  		coefficients for each independent variable specified in the model. Each of the  		four odds ratio estimates is interpreted with respect to the common reference  		outcome of stable service area. Conventional tests of  		multicollinearity and other sensitivity analyses of the model specification  		suggested that the estimated model parameters were robust.</p>
<p><b><i>Agency Attributes</i></b></p>
<p>Most of the ownership status and organizational variables were  		significantly associated with HHAs supply decisions with signs consistent  		with expectations. For-profit HHAs were more likely to have contracted their  		service area (OR=1.85), changed their service area (OR=2.31, or exited the  		market (OR=1.60) than to have maintained a stable geographic service area  		relative to otherwise similar voluntary not-for-profit agencies. The odds of  		market exit over a stable service area were about 60 percent higher among  		for-profit agencies relative to their not-for-profit counterparts. While  		government-owned HHAs were also less likely to close than voluntary  		not-for-profit agencies (OR=0.46), in contrast to for-profit HHAs, the odds of  		service area expansion over a stable market area were about 59 percent lower  		among government-owned HHAs relative to voluntary not-for-profits.  		Facility-based agencies were very unlikely to exhibit changes of any type in  		their service areas. For example, the estimated parameters suggest that odds of  		contracting and expanding their service areas rather than maintaining a stable  		service area were about 56 percent and 63 percent lower, respectively, among  		facility-based HHAs relative to their freestanding agency counterparts. </p>
<p>HHAs with geographically dispersed organizational structures with  		branches and/or subunits in 1996 were more likely to either have contracted  		(OR=1.18) or changed (1.09) their service area, or to close altogether  		(OR=1.12), than their counterparts without branches or subunits. The odds of  		service area contraction were particularly high among HHAs with multiple  		branches and/or subunits. For example, the expected odds of service area  		contraction over a stable service area are suggested to increase by about 18  		percent for each additional branch and/or subunit of the parent organization in  		1996. </p>
<p>The effects of Medicare program tenure on HHA supply response were  		varied. Very recent market entrant HHAs were both more likely to close  		(OR=1.56) and to expand (OR=2.49) their service areas than agencies that were  		Medicare-certified before October 1993. For, example, the odds of expanding  		rather than maintaining a stable service area between 1996 and 1999 were about  		2.5 times higher among very recent market entrants relative to otherwise  		similar HHAs with longer Medicare program tenures. This was contrary to  		expectations, and may reflect pressure on upstart HHAs to offset the  		arguably higher costs associated with initiating their business and avoid a  		likely large financial loss via exiting the market right away. Aside from these  		recent market entrant effects, additional years of Medicare program tenure were  		generally associated with decreased odds of both service area contraction and  		expansion, but not market exit. For each additional year of certification, the  		odds of both service area contraction and expansion over a stable service area  		are decreased by about 2 percent. </p>
<p>HHAs serving greater volumes of Medicare beneficiaries in 1996 were more  		likely to maintain stable service areas than smaller agencies. The odds of an  		HHA contracting or changing its service area, or closing altogether over  		maintaining a stable service area are suggested to decrease by roughly 3-5  		percent for each 100 additional beneficiaries served in 1996. Agencies serving  		larger volumes of Medicare beneficiaries were also much less likely to expand  		their service areas. The odds of service area expansion over maintaining a  		stable service area are suggested to decrease by almost 12 percent for each 100  		additional beneficiaries served in 1996.</p>
<p>Finally, the per-beneficiary limits imposed on HHAs under the IPS appear  		to have influenced HHA supply decisions in the manner expected. HHAs with more  		visit intensive practice styles were at greater risk of closure and service  		area contraction, and were less likely to expand their service area, than  		agencies providing fewer average visits per beneficiary in 1996. The odds of  		service area contraction and closure over maintaining a stable service area are  		both suggested to increase by roughly 2 percent, and the odds of service area  		expansion to decrease by almost 5 percent for every ten visits higher was an  		agencys average annual visits per beneficiary served in 1996. </p>
<p><b><i>Market Area Attributes</i></b></p>
<p>HHA supply decisions following the IPS appear to have been modestly  		influenced by the size and density of Medicare market HHC demand. An HHAs  		odds of service area contraction and closure over maintaining a stable service  		area decreased by almost 2 percent for each additional 10,000 Medicare  		beneficiaries residing in their HSMA. The risks of contraction and closure were  		unrelated to the spatial density of Medicare service demand. However, the  		expected odds of an HHA expanding over maintaining a stable service area are  		suggested to have increased by nearly 8 percent for each additional 100  		Medicare beneficiaries aged 75 years or more per square mile in their HSMA.  		</p>
<p>An HHAs risks of closure and service area changes of all types  		were all influenced not only by the market presence of competitor HHAs in their  		HSMA, but also by their relative competitive standing as reflected by their  		market share of beneficiaries served. The estimated parameters for the variable  		active Medicare HHAs suggest that the odds of an HHA contracting its service  		area, expanding it, or closing altogether, over maintaining a stable service  		area roughly increased between 3-5 percent for each ten HHAs serving  		beneficiaries in the same HSMA in 1996. A uniform pattern of odds ratios less  		than one for the beneficiary market share variable suggests that HHAs serving  		greater market shares of Medicare beneficiaries in 1996 were most likely to  		maintain a stable geographic service area over the next three years. For  		example, the odds of service area contraction, expansion, or closure over  		maintaining a stable service area, are estimated to be about 5-8 percent lower  		for each additional percentage point higher was an agencys 1996 share of  		Medicare beneficiaries served in their market area. Interestingly, the results  		suggest that the odds of service area expansion, service area contraction, and  		closure outcomes are all similarly influenced by changes in factors reflecting  		aspects of market competition. While one can only speculate without further  		analysis, this finding could be the result of some agencies expanding their  		service areas to meet the needs of beneficiaries previously served by agencies  		that contracted their service areas or closed. </p>
<p>Mixed empirical results were found regarding the influence of the supply  		of other PAC and LTC resources on HHA supply decisions. Consistent with  		expectations, HHAs in market areas with more LTC and chronic disease hospitals  		are suggested to be at greater risk of closure (OR=1.26) and a changed service  		area (OR=1.39) than otherwise similar agencies in market areas with fewer  		facilities. In contrast, HHAs in market areas with greater nursing home bed  		supply are suggested to have lower odds of contracting their service areas  		(OR=0.97). </p>
<p>Lastly, several census division regional dummy variables were  		significant suggesting there were some regional factors beyond those specified  		in the model that influenced HHA supply decisions. The expected odds of closure  		over a stable service are suggested to be more than two times higher among HHAs  		located in either the Mountain or Pacific census divisions relative to  		otherwise similar agencies in the New England census division. Given the large  		magnitude of these regional differences, it is interesting that the closure  		outcome dummy variable corresponding to the West South Central division  		(containing Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas) was insignificant. In  		light of earlier GAO (1999) findings that the bulk of HHA closures occurred in  		Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. On the other hand HHAs located in the South  		Atlantic (OR=1.73), East South Central (2.83), and West South Central (OR=1.85)  		census divisions were much more likely to expand their service area relative to  		otherwise similar agencies in the New England census division. This would  		suggest that the most important factors associated with closures in those  		states have been specified in the multinomial logit model.</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">V. DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>In this study we have employed Medicare HHC claims data and a broader  		definition of HHA supply changes than simply closure to investigate factors  		associated with HHA supply response to implementation of the IPS in 1997.  		Similar to past research, our empirical investigation of HHA supply changes  		following the IPS portrays an HHA industry with serious declines in supply. In  		contrast to earlier studies, however, our analyses indicate that the surge of  		HHA closures between 1997 and 1999 that have received so much attention do not  		fully reflect the magnitude of HHA supply response to the IPS. An examination  		of changes in geographic patterns of service to Medicare beneficiaries among  		HHAs actively serving Medicare beneficiaries in the years following the IPS  		reveals substantial dynamics in local HHA supply that rival the magnitude of  		supply changes associated with agency closures. Given the relative magnitudes  		of HHA supply changes associated with geographic service area contraction and  		expansion found in this study, further analysis is warranted regarding the  		spatial distribution of these service area changes to better understand their  		potential impacts on access. </p>
<p>It is important to assess the degree to which HHA supply reductions  		associated with service area contraction occurred in the same or different  		market areas as closures. If HHA service area contractions largely occurred in  		the same geographic market areas as closures, agency closures may understate  		the potential for access problems. On the other hand, if HHA service area  		contraction largely occurred in different geographic markets from markets with  		high agency closures, potential beneficiary access problems may be more  		difficult to identify by simple comparisons of rates of change in Medicare HHC  		utilization changes in markets with and without high prevalence of agency  		closures. Similarly, it is important to assess the degree to which the  		geographic distribution of HHA service area expansions and new HHA market  		entrants coincided so as to have offsetting effects on potential access  		problems. </p>
<p>General findings from our multivariate empirical analysis of individual  		HHA supply decisions suggest that the geographic distributions of HHA service  		area contractions and closures may coincide. This analysis suggests that HHA  		service area contractions were largely associated with the same factors as  		agency closures. HHAs that closed or contracted their service areas both tended  		to freestanding, for-profit agencies, with subunits or branches, with  		relatively fewer years of Medicare program tenure. The per-beneficiary limits  		imposed by the IPS were more likely to adversely affect agencies that served  		smaller volumes of beneficiaries with relatively higher costs per beneficiary.  		Agencies that closed or contracted their geographic service areas both  		generally served fewer Medicare beneficiaries but provided more visits per  		beneficiary served than other HHAs that maintained or expanded their geographic  		service areas after the IPS. Finally, HHAs that closed or contracted their  		service areas both tended to serve relatively small shares of the total volume  		of Medicare beneficiaries served in more competitive geographic markets served  		by many other agencies. </p>
<p>Our multivariate empirical findings hint that the geographic  		distribution of HHA service area expansions may also coincide with those of  		closures and service area contractions. HHAs that expanded their service areas  		tended to be smaller, freestanding agencies under voluntary not-for-profit  		ownership, that acquired Medicare-certified within a couple of years of IPS  		implementation. Similar to HHAs which contracted their service areas or closed,  		HHAs that expanded their service areas tended to serve relatively small market  		shares of beneficiaries in more competitive geographic market areas served by  		many other HHAs. They differed from contracting and closed agencies, however,  		in that they were likely to have been constrained by per-beneficiary cost  		limits since on average, they provided relatively fewer visits per beneficiary  		served in 1996. The overall pattern of empirical results suggests that many of  		these HHAs may have expanded their service area in places previously served by  		HHAs that contracted supply. </p>
<p>This study has produced a more comprehensive picture of the magnitude  		and complexity of changes in HHA supply that occurred following implementation  		of the IPS. The insights it has added about various sources of supply response,  		and the factors contributing to the HHA supply decisions suggest that observed  		reductions in HHA supply reflected rational market decisions by agencies  		responding to very significant changes in the payment system. While our study  		findings are richer than earlier studies, they similarly suggest that the HHA  		supply reductions following the IPS more likely reflect the loss of marginal  		agencies in geographic markets with an abundance of supply in 1996.</p>
<h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A. METHODOLOGY FOR CLASSIFYING HHA SERVICE  		AREA CHANGES</a></h2>
<h3>Geographic Service Area Delineation</h3>
<p>Geographic service areas were first delineated for each active HHA in  		1996 and 1999 using an iterative approach commonly employed for the delineation  		of hospital service areas where zip codes accounting for the most patients are  		sequentially added one at a time to the service area, each time adding fewer  		patients, until some threshold percentage of patients served is reached  		(Garnick., Luft, Robinson, &amp; Tetreault 1987; Goody 1993; Slifkin, Ricketts,  		&amp; Howard 1996). Only five-digit zip codes involving service to two or more  		beneficiaries by the HHA were used to delineate service areas. Preliminary  		analyses suggested that many zip codes where only one beneficiary was served  		reflected idiosyncratic situations, including for example, long-distance moves  		by beneficiaries during the year that are not reflected in the beneficiary  		residence zip code on Medicare claims data.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Employing a threshold percentage of 90  		percent, each HHA's geographic service area included either: (1) the zip codes  		with the greatest numbers of beneficiaries served that collectively accounted  		for 90 percent of all beneficiaries served over the year by the HHA; or (2) all  		zip codes involving visits to two or more beneficiaries if the 90 percent  		threshold was not met. The selected zip codes comprising the service areas of  		HHAs active in 1996 collectively accounted for 89.3 percent of all Medicare  		beneficiaries served by these same HHAs in 1996, with duplicated counts of  		beneficiaries who were served by more than one HHA during the year. </p>
<h3>Zip Codes Added or Dropped from HHA Service Areas</h3>
<p>For each HHA, zip codes comprising its service area in 1996 and 1999  		were then classified into one of three categories: (1) zip codes served in 1996  		but not 1999; (2) zip codes served in 1999 but not 1996; and (3) zip codes  		served in both 1996 and 1999. Zip codes involving visits to two or three  		beneficiaries in one of the years that were not served in the other year were  		counted as being served in both 1996 and 1999 to reduce the chances of their  		misclassification due to sampling variation.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Beneficiaries served in zip codes assigned to  		these three categories were aggregated to the HHA level to produce four summary  		totals of beneficiaries served: (1) beneficiaries served in 1996 of zip codes  		served by the HHA in both 1996 and 1999; (2) beneficiaries served in 1996 of  		zip codes no longer served by the HHA in 1999; (3) beneficiaries served in 1999  		of zip codes served by the HHA in both 1996 and 1999; and (4) beneficiaries  		served in 1999 of zip codes newly served by the HHA in 1999. </p>
<h3>Classification of HHA Service Area Changes</h3>
<p>Each of the 7,021 HHAs that actively served beneficiaries in both 1996  		and 1999 were then classified into categories of expanded, contracted, changed,  		or stable geographic service area between 1996 and 1999 based on the relative  		magnitudes of the four summary variables containing counts of beneficiaries  		served in dropped, added, and continuously served zip codes. Since most HHAs  		discontinued service to some zip codes in 1999 that were served in 1996 and/or  		added service to zip codes in 1999 that were not served in 1996, the general  		aim was to distinguish those HHAs with service area changes large enough to be  		of practical significance from other HHAs whose geographic service areas were  		relatively stable over time. </p>
<p>We first considered what level of beneficiary service contraction or  		expansion is necessary to have <i>practical </i>significance. Suppose that in  		1999 an HHA no longer served a subset of zip codes that accounted for 1 percent  		of total beneficiaries in 1996, and the HHA does not serve beneficiaries in any  		newly added zip codes in 1999. While this may technically be viewed as a  		service area contraction, it is unlikely to have much practical significance.  		Recognizing that any minimum threshold will be arbitrary, a minimum threshold  		percentage of 20 percent of total beneficiary service volume was chosen as a  		classification parameter. Under this assumed threshold three important subsets  		of HHAs were assigned to categories:</p>
<ul><li>First, an HHA that discontinued service in 1999 to beneficiaries of  		  some zip codes served in 1996, and that did not initiate service in 1999 to  		  beneficiaries of any zip codes that were not also served in 1996, can be  		  classified as having <i>contracted its service area</i> if service in the  		  dropped zip codes satisfy the 20 percent threshold.</li>
<li> Second, an HHA that continued to serve in 1999 beneficiaries of all  		  zip codes previously served in 1996, and that initiated service in 1999 to  		  beneficiaries of other zip codes, can be classified as having <i>expanded its  		  service area</i> if the added zip codes satisfy the assumed 20 percent  		  thresholds for 1996 and 1999.</li>
<li> Third, an HHA that discontinues service to some zip codes and/or  		  newly expands service to other zip codes can be classified as having a  		  <i>stable service area</i> if neither of the assumed 20 percent beneficiary  		  service thresholds for 1996 and 1999 is met. </li>
</ul><p>The assumed 20 percent beneficiary service threshold alone is not  		sufficient, however, to classify those HHAs that contracted or expanded their  		service areas vis-à-vis <i>both </i>discontinuing service to  		beneficiaries of some zip codes and initiating service to beneficiaries of  		other zip codes between 1996 and 1999. Here the <i>relative magnitudes of  		beneficiary service volume</i> in zip codes dropped and added must be  		considered. It seems reasonable to generally expect that HHAs contracting their  		service areas should have served <i>many more</i> beneficiaries in 1996 in the  		zip codes dropped from its service area than they later served in newly added  		zip codes in 1999. Likewise, HHAs expanding their service areas should serve  		<i>many more</i> beneficiaries in newly served zip codes in 1999 than they  		served in 1996 in zip codes dropped from its service area. </p>
<p>While any definition of <i>many more</i> will be arbitrary, <i>many  		more</i> was defined in this study to be <i>at least five times larger</i>.  		That is, to be classified as contracting its service area, an HHA must have  		served five times as many beneficiaries in 1996 in the zip codes dropped from  		its service area than it later served in 1999 in newly added zip codes.  		Similarly, classification of expanded service area required that beneficiaries  		in newly added zip codes outnumber those in dropped zip codes by a factor of  		five. All remaining HHAs that both dropped and added zip codes from their  		service areas that did not meet these relative service volume requirements were  		assigned to a residual category of HHAs with changed service areas.</p>
<p>Given that arbitrary assumptions were employed in the classification  		process, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the sensitivity of the  		initial assignments to marginal changes in the assumed classification  		parameters. The service area data of HHAs with parameter-sensitive  		classifications that served at least 500 beneficiaries annually were manually  		compared with the norms of HHAs comprising the shifted categories. As a  		consequence of these comparisons, 24 HHAs in the residual category of  		<i>changed service area</i> were reclassified. Ten of these HHAs were  		reassigned to the contracted service area category, with the remainder were  		reassigned to the <i>expanded service area </i>category.</p>
