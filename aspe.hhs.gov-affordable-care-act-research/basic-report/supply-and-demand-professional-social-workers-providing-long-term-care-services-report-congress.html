</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In fiscal year 2004, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and  		Education Appropriations Bill requested that the Department of Health and Human  		Services (HHS) assess the availability of professional social workers in  		long-term care settings. Specifically, the Bill directed HHS "to study and  		quantify the current and future supply and demand for professional social  		workers serving older adults across the continuum of long-term care services.  		The Department should report these findings to the Committee and furnish  		recommendations for addressing any identified future shortage areas, including  		cooperative strategies involving federal agencies, professional associations,  		and schools of social work." </p>
<p>This report is a product of work between the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in HHS, other federal agencies in HHS,  		and the Departments of Labor and Veterans Affairs (VA). Staff at these  		Departments assisted this effort by sharing information and data on social  		workers in long-term care settings and reviewing sections of the Report to  		Congress. </p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">II. OVERVIEW OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS</a></h2>
<p>The aging of the birth cohorts born between 1945 and 1965 (the "baby  		boom" cohorts) will be the most significant factor increasing the demand for  		long-term care and supportive services over the next half century. As shown in  		<a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>, the number of individuals who are age 65 and  		older is expected to more than double, increasing from 35 million in 2000 to  		over 86 million in 2050.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref1">1</a></font></sup>  		As a result, nearly 21% of the population will be age 65 and over by the middle  		of the century. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1" id="figure1"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/68471/SWsupplyF1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>While not all elderly persons will require long-term care services, age  		is a very strong predictor of the need for both acute health and long-term care  		services, and the number of persons aged 85 and over is projected to increase  		five-fold by 2050. If recent trends continue, experts predict that the number  		of persons requiring long-term care services (i.e., skilled nursing care,  		alternative residential care, or home and community-based care) could increase  		from approximately 8 million to 19 million in 2050.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref2">2</a>, <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref3">3</a></font></sup> This will  		no doubt increase demand for long-term care workers, in general, and for  		professional social workers specifically, because they provide critical  		services such as care coordination, case management, mental health services and  		supports, government program eligibility determination, care giving support and  		counseling. </p>
<h2><a name="psw" id="psw">III. DEFINITION OF A PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKER</a></h2>
<p>As noted earlier, the Senate Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations  		Bill requested that HHS assess the availability of professional social workers  		in long-term care settings. This report presents our estimates of the current  		and future number of professional social workers in long-term care settings,  		using a definition of professional social worker from the National Association  		of Social Workers (NASW)<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref4">4</a></font></sup>  		and the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). Specifically, NASW and CSWE  		define a <i>professional social worker</i> as one who has graduated from a CSWE  		accredited program with at least a bachelor's degree in social work.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#notea">a</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Bachelors of Social Work (BSW) programs prepare graduates for direct  		service positions such as case workers. Programs include courses in social work  		values and ethics, dealing with a culturally diverse clientele, at-risk  		populations, promotion of social and economic justice, human behavior and the  		social environment, social welfare policy and services, social work practice,  		social research methods, and field education. Accredited BSW programs require a  		minimum of 400 hours of supervised field experience.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Masters degree programs in Social Work (MSW) prepare graduates for work  		in their chosen field of concentration, including health and aging, and  		continue to develop the skills required to perform clinical assessments, manage  		large caseloads, and explore new ways of drawing upon social services to meet  		the needs of clients. MSW programs last two years if pursued on a full-time  		basis and include a minimum of 900 hours of supervised field instruction, or  		internship. Entry into a master's program does not require a bachelor's degree  		in social work, but most master's degree programs offer advanced standing  		(allowing for acceleration of the master's program) for those with a bachelor's  		degree from an accredited social work program.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="ltc" id="ltc">IV. DEFINITION OF LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>Long-term care is generally defined as the array of medical, social,  		personal care and related services designed to meet the needs of people living  		with chronic health problems that limit their ability to perform everyday  		activities. The need for long-term care services is frequently determined by  		one's need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and/or  		instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). ADLs refer to the basic  		self-care tasks of everyday life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting,  		and transferring.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref6">6</a></font></sup> IADLs  		refer to more complex tasks associated with independent life such as shopping,  		housekeeping, doing the laundry and money management. Long-term care may also  		be defined in terms of the settings associated with care  		delivery--institutional, residential, community or home--although what specific  		services or entities are included in each category may vary widely. For the  		purposes of this report, long-term care settings are comprised of nursing  		facilities, other residential care (e.g., assisted living, group or congregate  		living facilities), home health and selected community-based settings (e.g.,  		adult day health and multi-purpose senior centers as specified in the North  		American Industry Classification System or NAICS).<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#noteb">b</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="roles" id="roles">V. PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS AND THEIR ROLES IN  		LONG-TERM CARE SETTINGS</a></h2>
<p>Social workers who have completed specific course work and field work in  		aging (typically at the master's level) represents one of the fastest growing  		segments of the profession.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref7">7</a></font></sup> These workers address a broad array of problems  		uniquely facing elders and their families, including functional impairment,  		psychological problems or cognitive impairments, grief and loss, legal and  		ethical issues, and end of life concerns.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Social workers with a bachelor's degree in social work tend to be  		employed in long-term care settings at a higher rate than those with an MSW. A  		1995 survey of social work practitioners revealed that 1% of respondents with  		an MSW were employed in nursing homes or hospices and that 3.7% identified  		services to the aged as their primary practice area.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref8">8</a></font></sup> In contrast, respondents with a BSW indicated  		that 11.5% worked in a nursing facility or hospice setting and 16.5% identified  		services to the aged as their primary practice area.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref8">8</a></font></sup> Although there is no clear explanation for this  		differentiation in the literature, it is most likely related to the complex  		interplay of financing and reimbursement of social work services in general  		and/or the lack of a statutory distinction between BSW and MSW in fulfilling  		Medicare and Medicaid Conditions of Participation. In general, MSW-level social  		workers are specifically trained to provide counseling for complex problems,  		complete assessments, improve organizational functioning and perform other  		complex tasks that social workers with a BSW are not trained to do. </p>
<p>Social worker responsibilities vary widely, depending upon the setting,  		and their role(s) in that setting. Social workers seek to help people across  		the life span function better in their environments, identify and cope with  		problems and improve relationships with others.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref5">5</a>, <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref7">7</a></font></sup> Social workers may be  		distinguished from other "helping professionals," including nurses and  		psychologists, through their knowledge of community resources, their focus on  		client strengths (rather than pathology), skills in engaging the client and use  		of the person-in-environment (P-I-E) framework<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#notec">c</a></font></sup> for assessing and addressing psychosocial,  		psychological and social problems,<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref9">9</a></font></sup> and their pursuit of social change on behalf of  		vulnerable populations, such as long-term care residents. </p>
<p>According to standards promulgated by NASW in 2003,<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref10">10</a></font></sup> social workers in long-term care  		settings should focus on several key areas, including:</p>
<ul><li>the social and emotional impact of physical or mental illness or  		  disability,</li>
<li>the preservation and enhancement of physical and social  		  functioning,</li>
<li>the promotion of the conditions essential to ensure maximum benefits  		  from long-term health care services,</li>
<li>the prevention of physical and mental illness and increased  		  disability, and</li>
<li>the promotion and maintenance of physical and mental health and an  		  optimal quality of life. </li>
</ul><p>When bachelors and masters-level social workers are employed in the same  		long-term care setting, it has been reported that BSWs and MSWs typically have  		different, yet complementary responsibilities. Barth's 2001 study of BSW and  		MSW employment markets indicates that these workers rarely compete with one  		another for jobs.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref11">11</a></font></sup> For  		example, a social worker with a BSW in a nursing home might serve as a  		discharge planner for short-stay residents in a post-acute unit, while a social  		worker with a MSW might provide clinical supervision of the BSW as well as  		counseling and other behavioral interventions to long-stay residents and their  		families. </p>
<h2><a name="sources" id="sources">VI. SOURCES OF DATA USED IN DERIVING CURRENT AND  		FUTURE ESTIMATES</a></h2>
<p>There are several data sources that are useful for estimating the  		current and future demand for social workers in long-term care settings: </p>
<h3>A. National Industry-Occupation Employment Matrix</h3>
<p>The National Industry-Occupational Employment Matrix (OEM) is developed  		by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) within the Department of Labor as part  		of its ongoing Occupational Employment Projections Program. The purpose of the  		OEM is to determine current and future employment by occupation and industry.  		The most recent OEM contains employment projections for 725 occupations  		(including social work) in 284 industries (including long-term care settings  		such as home health agencies, nursing care facilities, residential care  		facilities, and community care for the elderly) for 2002 and 2012. </p>
<h3>B. Current Population Survey</h3>
<p>The CPS is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households conducted by the  		Bureau of the Census for BLS. The CPS is the primary source of information on  		the labor force characteristics of the U.S., including estimates of  		employment/unemployment released every month by BLS. The sample is selected to  		represent the civilian non-institutionalized population age 16 and older, and  		respondents are asked detailed socioeconomic questions such as employment  		status, occupation, industry, earnings, hours of work, and other demographic  		variables such as education. As a result, the CPS can be used to identify  		respondents that report that their occupation is social work and who are  		employed in long-term care settings. </p>
<h3>C. 1% Public Use Microdata Sample of the 2000  		Census</h3>
<p>The number of social workers in the U.S. can be estimated from the 1%  		Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the 2000 Census. The 2000 1% PUMS data  		contain records of the characteristics of people from a 1% sample of  		individuals and housing units from the 2000 Census. The data source for the  		PUMS files is the 2000 decennial census long-form questionnaire, which includes  		information on demographic, economic, and housing characteristics of the  		population. Variables such as occupation, industry (setting), and education are  		available and can be used to determine if a respondent is a social worker in a  		long-term care setting. </p>
<h3>D. NASW and CSWE Data</h3>
<p>Through funding provided by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment of  		the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, NASW created the  		Practice Research Network (PRN) in 2000. The PRN collects data from social work  		practitioners, and uses the data to develop best practices, inform policy, and  		improve service delivery. NASW has designed and conducted three practice-based  		research surveys (2000, 2002, and 2004) through the PRN. The surveys collect  		information on social workers' socioeconomic characteristics such as salary and  		education, clientele, and practice setting. CSWE collects data annually on the  		numbers of individuals enrolled in accredited social work programs as well as  		the number of, and enrollment in, programs that offer an aging specialization  		(or aging-related field placements). </p>
<h2><a name="current" id="current">VII. CURRENT ESTIMATES OF PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS  		IN LONG-TERM CARE SETTINGS</a></h2>
<p>The current BLS estimates and projections of social work employment do  		not include detail on level of education. However, in describing the education  		and training needed by most social workers to become fully qualified, BLS notes  		that, "While a bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement, a master's degree  		in social work or a related field has become the standard for many  		positions."<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref12">12</a></font></sup> For the  		purposes of this report, it was assumed that all BLS employment data on social  		workers refers to <i>professional</i> social workers. The total number of  		professional social workers in long-term care settings can therefore be  		estimated by summing the number of social workers across long-term care  		industries. </p>
<p>The CPS and the Census 1% PUMS data also do not identify social workers  		at the level of specificity corresponding to the Congressional request.  		However, a reasonable estimate of the number of professional social workers in  		long-term care settings can be constructed by identifying survey respondents  		who: (1) report their occupations as "social worker," (2) state that they have  		at least a bachelor's degree (although not necessarily a BSW), and (3) are  		employed in an industry associated with long-term care (i.e., a home health  		agency, nursing care facility, residential care facility, or community care for  		the elderly). </p>
<p>Estimates of the number of professional social workers from the 2002 BLS  		OEM, the 2004 CPS and the 2000 1% PUMS are presented in <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#figure2">Figure 2</a>. The numbers range from a low of 471,075 (2000 1%  		PUMS) to a high of 522,280 (2004 CPS), with the estimate from the 2002 OEM  		closer to the low end of the range. Focusing on professional social workers in  		long-term care settings yields a similarly narrow range of estimates--36,071 to  		44,156 (<a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#figure3">Figure 3</a>). The numbers likely vary due to  		differences in survey coverage, sampling variations, and differences in how a  		social worker is defined across the three data sources. </p>

<p>Although there is some variation, these estimates are fairly consistent  		with other sources. For example, the data presented here indicate that  		approximately 7.6% to 9.4% of all professional social workers are employed in  		long-term care settings. Data from a 1999 survey of 19 graduate programs found  		that just over 6% of graduates worked in the field of aging/gerontology (which  		includes a range of settings).<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref13">13</a></font></sup> A survey of NASW regular members completed  		during Summer 2000 found that 5% of respondents identified aging as their  		primary specialty area and the 2004 NASW PRN survey of licensed professional  		social workers (NASW members as well as non-members) indicated that 5% of  		respondents worked in a nursing facility, home health agency or hospice, with  		7.8% identifying aging as their primary specialty.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref14">14</a>, <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="future" id="future">VIII. PROJECTIONS OF THE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL  		WORKERS IN LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>Based on anticipated increases in demand for services and retirements of  		current practitioners, BLS predicts that total social work employment will  		increase from approximately 477,000 in 2002 to 604,000 by 2012.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref16">16</a></font></sup> The industries that are expected  		to experience the largest increases in social worker employment are ambulatory  		health care services (health practitioner offices, outpatient care centers and  		home health care services), social assistance (individual and family services  		agencies, community services, vocational rehabilitation and child day care  		services), and nursing and residential care facilities (nursing care  		facilities, residential care facilities and community care facilities for the  		elderly). </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure4" id="figure4"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/68471/SWsupplyF4.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>BLS estimates that the "expanding senior population" will drive growth  		in employment in home healthcare services, residential care (assisted living,  		senior living communities and nursing facilities) and hospices. The growth in  		these industries will affect employment of social workers as well as other  		occupations, most notably nursing and social and human service  		assistants.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref16">16</a></font></sup> As shown  		in <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#figure4">Figure 4</a>, the number of professional social workers  		employed in long-term care settings is projected by BLS in the Occupational  		Employment Matrix to increase from approximately 36,000 in 2002 to 55,000 in  		2012. </p>
<p>Assuming that the demand for professional social workers in long-term  		care is driven exclusively by growth in the older population and that all other  		factors influencing demand and supply of labor remain constant, the number of  		social workers can be projected for future years. For example, the current  		proportion of professional social workers in long-term care settings per 1,000  		persons age 65 and older in 2012 is 1.29 (55,189 divided by 42,863).  		Multiplying this proportion by projected increases in the elderly population  		from 2020 to 2050 results in an approximate doubling of the number of  		professional social workers in long-term care settings. Using an identical  		methodology--but basing the proportion on the estimate of professional social  		workers from the 2000 1% PUMS--yields a similar trend; by 2050, the number of  		professional social workers in long-term care settings is projected to increase  		by approximately 65,000 to 109,000. </p>
<h2><a name="factors" id="factors">IX. FACTORS INFLUENCING DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF SOCIAL  		WORKERS IN LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>There are numerous factors--not necessarily unique to social work--that  		are likely to impact future demand and supply, therefore making it difficult to  		assess the adequacy of supply relative to demand. </p>
<h3>A. Job Substitution</h3>
<p>The job growth attributable to the aging of the population that will  		occur in long-term care settings will likely be shared between social workers  		and several other occupations. Other professionals, such as registered nurses,  		and paraprofessionals (such as therapists, nurses aides, home health aides,  		personal care workers and other individuals calling themselves case workers or  		social workers) provide services and supports that may currently be considered  		under the purview of social work.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref12">12</a></font></sup> For example, both registered nurses and  		social workers can perform hospital discharge planning functions, act as case  		managers and (with appropriate training and licensure, if required) provide  		psychotherapy. Similarly, individuals holding a bachelor's degree in a human  		services field and social workers with a BSW deliver assessment and case  		management functions in many state and local departments of social services.  		</p>
<p>While the future demand for services cannot be precisely predicted, it  		is likely that there will be an increased need for professional and  		paraprofessional workers, including social workers, to meet the growing demand  		in long-term care services. Non-social work professionals and paraprofessionals  		may fulfill some portion of that demand. However, the degree to which other  		professional workers and paraprofessionals substitute for a professional social  		worker in a long-term care setting is difficult to predict because it is  		related to a number of factors. These factors include regulatory requirements,  		the ability of employers to hire professional social workers, proven efficacy  		of social work interventions relative to other professionals or  		paraprofessionals in long-term care settings, and shifts in social service  		delivery systems and financing systems for long-term care. </p>
<p>With regard to efficacy, Rizzo and Rowe reviewed the literature on  		social work practices among the elderly to identify the strength of available  		evidence on the effectiveness of social work interventions.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref17">17</a></font></sup> Using criteria of the  		evidence-based practice model, they concluded that the strongest evidence for  		social work effectiveness exists in health care facilities (i.e., hospitals).  		While there is some evidence of effectiveness in areas such as caregiving and  		geriatric evaluation, the literature does not clearly differentiate between  		social workers and other providers. Moreover, the available research does not  		differentiate between providers with different levels of social work education  		(MSW vs. BSW) and the others who do not have specific social work training. In  		short, while some evidence exists to support the positive impact of social work  		practices, there is less evidence to set apart social work as a distinct  		professional role across the long-term care continuum, which impacts demand for  		the discipline.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. Social Worker Training</h3>
<p>An important factor influencing the supply of professional social  		workers in long-term care is the ability to attract students into social work  		careers in long-term care settings. Research has shown that there are three  		major barriers to attracting social work students to aging fields/settings: (1)  		limited numbers of adequately trained faculty to influence students to choose  		field placements in long-term care (or oversee their long-term care field  		placement, (2) lack of institutional support for geriatric curricula,<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref19">19</a></font></sup> and (3) absence of financial  		support and/or incentives for students while in training. </p>
<p>Schools and Departments of Social Work have proportionately few  		full-time aging/gerontology social work trainees in field placements  		(practica), primarily due to lack of trainee funding for MSW students,  		particularly during second-year placements.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<blockquote><p><font>"Despite dramatic increases in the perceived need for  		  social workers trained to work with older adults, the availability of  		  government sponsored training programs has declined. With the exception of the  		  Veterans Administration Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Centers, no  		  significant national resource presently exists for supporting students  		  interested in aging. Historically, an important source of stipends was the  		  Administration on Aging (AoA), which distributed nearly $80 million between  		  1966 and 1984 to 185 colleges, community colleges, and universities to support  		  the development of aging curricula and training (Peterson, 1987). These funds  		  dramatically increased the numbers of students in aging, many of whom became  		  leaders in the field. A good example of the power of student stipends to  		  attract and train leaders in social work is the use of federal training money  		  under Title IV-E (of the Social Security Act), which is "re-professionalizing"  		  the child welfare system in many states and making graduate level social work  		  education available to many disadvantaged and minority students who might not  		  otherwise be able to attend graduate school."<sup><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref21">21</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Social work educators cite fiscal constraints of their respective  		universities as a major barrier to recruitment of faculty experts in aging and  		an obstacle to the development and offering of new courses.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref22">22</a></font></sup> Researchers have further found  		that when these barriers are creatively and competently addressed, student  		interest rises in social work careers working with older adults.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are approximately 10,000 social work educators across all program  		levels.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref24">24</a></font></sup> The Hartford  		Foundation Gerontological Faculty Scholars program has funded the training of  		53 individuals over the past 3 years; however, there may be a lack of adequate  		training resources specific to gerontological social work education. Forty-one  		percent of respondents to the 1994 Council of Geriatric Education Centers'  		survey cited fiscal constraints as a major barrier to the recruitment of social  		work faculty with expertise in aging and to the development and offering of new  		courses. The lack of curricula with a focus on gerontology has been most  		notable among social work programs at smaller colleges and universities, those  		in states with lower per capita income, and colleges that did not have any kind  		of multidisciplinary gerontology center.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The number of social work students in the aging specialty also has  		significant implications for the future long-term care social work workforce.  		Between 1996 and 2001, CSWE reported that the number of students enrolled in  		MSW programs dropped by 7.4% and the number of students that had selected an  		aging specialization declined by 15.8%.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#noted">d</a></font></sup> A 2005 report from a CSWE survey of social  		work programs (both BSW and MSW) in seven states that produce just over 11,000  		graduates in a year--California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio,  		Pennsylvania and Texas--found that an average of 5.9% of students  		(predominantly master's level) are in an aging concentration and that  		approximately one in ten students was in an aging field placement, including  		both BSW and MSW programs.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>While the social work programs in the states mentioned above do provide  		some gerontological training, the majority of BSW and MSW educational programs  		contain little or no gerontology content. For example, it is estimated that 80%  		of BSW students graduate without any specific course work in aging.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref21">21</a>, <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>C. Wages and Benefits</h3>
<p>Wages and benefits also directly influence occupational choices and  		supply. Practice-based research conducted by NASW showed that, in 1999, annual  		income among full-time social workers was lowest for those employed in nursing  		facilities and hospices.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref27">27</a></font></sup> Specifically, these workers reported median  		income of $38,500 compared to $51,110 for full-time work in child welfare  		agencies and $43,330 in schools. BLS also indicated that the mean annual salary  		in 2002 for social worker positions in nursing care facilities ranged from  		$30,040 to $33,460, among the lowest of any setting. Although the income  		differentials may be linked to reimbursement (e.g., social work services in  		most long-term care settings including hospice, home health and skilled nursing  		facilities are bundled into the prospective payment rates), the salary  		difference also results from use of non-professional social workers in nursing  		facilities such as social service designees.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>D. Changes in the Long-Term Care Environment</h3>
<p>In preparing projections of future social work employment, we assumed  		that the current long-term care environment would remain constant. However,  		there are changes underway that could influence how care is delivered and by  		whom. For example, as other forms of residential care and services have become  		more prevalent, "recent declines in rates of nursing home residence may reflect  		broader changes in the health care system affecting older Americans."<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref1">1</a></font></sup> Similarly, as the Baby Boom  		cohorts reach their sixth decade and beyond, there will be large increases in  		some very vulnerable sub-groups that may require more intensive services,  		specifically the oldest old, older women, elderly racial minorities and those  		living in or near poverty.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref29">29</a></font></sup> However, <i>a priori</i>, it is not possible  		to determine with any certainty how these changes may alter the demand for  		social workers in long-term care settings. </p>
<h2><a name="perspectives" id="perspectives">X. PERSPECTIVES OF STAKEHOLDERS</a></h2>
<p>HHS held a series of informal discussions focusing on the supply and  		demand for professional social workers in long-term care settings. The topics  		of these discussions included: (1) overall perspective on social workers in  		long-term care settings, (2) factors affecting the supply of, and demand for,  		professional social workers in long-term care, and (3) cooperative strategies  		between HHS, schools of social work and professional associations that could  		address the adequate supply of professional social workers in long-term care.  		Participants of these meetings were all professional social workers  		representing practitioners, faculty, federal partners, researchers, policy  		makers, and professional and provider associations. An overview of private and  		public sector initiatives to train social workers and faculty in gerontology  		that were identified by stakeholders appears as <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#append1">Appendix  		1</a>. A list of stakeholder discussion participants is attached as  		<a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#append2">Appendix 2</a>. </p>
<p>Stakeholders hypothesized that one hurdle to recruiting and training  		professional social workers--and other staff--into long-term care settings  		might be pervasive negative attitudes and stereotypes about aging and elders.  		For example, it was reported that students perceive that <b><i>all</i></b> work  		with the elderly involves caring for demented and bed bound clients, in  		unpleasant settings, and with all care leading to poor outcomes. Without  		meaningful exposure to the aging population through didactic or practicum  		experiences, it was reported that the majority of social work students complete  		their studies with no knowledge of the many programs and services available for  		elders and their families, or any understanding of the vast diversity in the  		aging population. However, the aging of our population dictates that most  		social workers will be working with elders (or their caregivers) at some point  		in their professional careers. </p>
<p>The other main themes that mentioned by all the stakeholder groups were  		as follows:</p>
<ul><li>While NASW and others have enumerated the wide variety of tasks that  		  social workers perform in long-term care settings and/or working with older  		  adults, there is little documentation about <i>how</i> social workers perform  		  these tasks or what social workers do that other professionals (or  		  para-professionals) do not. In addition, it is not clear how these tasks relate  		  to specific credentials or demonstrated mastery in specific long-term care  		  settings or working with specific sub-populations.</li>
<li>The perceived lack of financial incentives in the form of stipends,  		  loan forgiveness and wages is viewed as the most pronounced barrier to the  		  recruitment and retention of professional social workers into long-term care  		  careers.</li>
<li>Professional gerontological social workers in the not-for-profit and  		  public sectors are increasingly being challenged to prove their value to their  		  organizations. Stakeholders further reported that the movement toward filling  		  long-term care jobs with professional social workers is not consistently  		  occurring because the demonstrated cost-effectiveness or efficacy of social  		  work interventions in long-term care settings is not proven. </li>
</ul><h2><a name="limitations" id="limitations">XI. DATA LIMITATIONS AND METHODOLOGICAL  		ASSUMPTIONS</a></h2>
<p>Because there are no definitive data on professional social workers in  		long-term care in the U.S., the estimates presented in this report relied on  		multiple sources and an approach designed to approximate the definition of  		professional social worker from the NASW and CSWE. The accuracy of the  		estimates is therefore dependent on how well our "working" definition of  		professional social worker in long-term care corresponds to the NASW/CSWE  		definition, and the quality of the data. </p>
<p>In some cases, the estimates may be too high. For example, the Current  		Population Survey, 1% Census data, and other occupational surveys rely on  		self-reported information on occupation. Individuals with a bachelor's degree  		or higher may report that they are employed as a social worker, but may not  		have an actual BSW or MSW. In other cases, the estimates may be too low:  		individuals who meet the educational criteria for professional social worker,  		but whose primary job responsibilities involve management, supervision or  		administration, might not identify his/her occupation as social worker. The  		estimates may also understate the number of professional social workers serving  		the long-term care needs of the elderly because they work outside the  		industries identified in the surveys--home health agencies, nursing care  		facilities, residential care facilities, or community care for the elderly. For  		example, social workers that do discharge planning for elderly patients in  		hospitals or other ambulatory care settings are not included in the  		tabulations. However, despite these data limitations, the estimates are  		remarkably consistent with NASW survey data on the number of professional  		social workers employed in nursing facilities, home health agencies, and  		hospices. </p>
<p>The projections of the number of professional social workers in  		long-term care were based on the assumption that the demand for, and supply of,  		social workers in the future would be driven exclusively by growth in the older  		population. This is a strong assumption, and as discussed in <a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#factors">Section IX</a>, there are many factors--job substitution,  		changes in social worker training, changes in health care reimbursement  		policies that could in turn affect wages and benefits, and other changes in the  		long-term care infrastructure--that could influence future demand and supply.  		However, without any empirical evidence on the likely impact of these factors,  		some of which are no doubt countervailing, it is impossible to easily  		incorporate them into projections. The assumption that demand and supply is  		exclusively a function of the aging of the population was therefore a necessary  		simplifying assumption to begin modeling efforts. Future projections could  		incorporate greater complexity once additional data become available and we  		have a better understanding of the inter-related factors associated with the  		demand and supply of social workers in long-term care. </p>
<h2><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion">XII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</a></h2>
<ul><li>Using data from the most recent OEM, the 2004 CPS, and the 1% PUMS  		  from the 2000 Census, approximately 36,100 to 44,200 professional social  		  workers are currently employed in long-term care settings.</li>
<li>If the ratio of professional social workers to the population age 65  		  and older remains constant, approximately 110,000 professional social workers  		  will be needed in long-term care settings by 2050.</li>
<li>While their theoretical framework may be unique, social workers in  		  long-term care settings perform tasks, including assessment, psychosocial  		  support, active treatment, and case management that may also be performed by  		  other disciplines.</li>
<li>There are efforts underway to include additional aging-related  		  content into social work curriculum and to encourage professional social  		  workers to seek employment in long-term care settings. It is unclear at this  		  time whether or not these efforts will have a substantial impact on the future  		  supply of professional social workers in long-term care.</li>
<li>Because of the uncertainties noted above, it is difficult to  		  determine whether or not the current and future number of professional social  		  workers will be adequate to care for an increasingly older American population;  		  however, the likely increased demand for social work services will no doubt  		  provide a strong impetus for continued job growth in the future. </li>

<h3>A. Private-Sector Sponsored Activities</h3>
<p>In 1999, the <i>Hartford Foundation</i> launched a multi-year effort  		entitled "Strengthening Geriatric Social Work Initiative". The Initiative  		consisted of several elements including a Faculty Scholars program of research  		support to junior faculty, a Practicum Partnership Program (PPP) demonstrating  		various educational training models, and the Social Work Competencies Project  		and Clearinghouse at CSWE (SAGE-SW, 2002). In 2001 it added a Geriatric Social  		Work Pre-Doctoral Fellows program and the Geriatric Social Work Curriculum  		Enrichment program that has since funded some 80 BSW and MSW programs with  		specific gerontological content across the U.S. The PPP provided grants to six  		schools of social work to develop partnerships with consortia of field  		agencies. The aim of the initiative is to build consortia that provide  		excellent comprehensive gerontological training to MSW students. Nearly half of  		the MSW programs in the country expressed interest in this program; 11 received  		one-year planning grants, and six of these were selected for multiyear  		implementation grants. To date, over 300 students have graduated from these  		PPPs. Four months post-graduation, over 80% of these graduates report working  		with older adults.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref30">30</a>,  		<a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#ref31">31</a></font></sup> Over 24 million dollars have been expended  		from the John A. Hartford Foundation to launch this capacity-building  		investment. Hearst Foundation endowments of over $2,500,000 in geriatric social  		work education along with $30 million from other private sources have helped to  		reinforce this workforce development initiative. These private sector funds  		have shown that social work students do pursue careers in geriatric social work  		when incentives, training and educational supports are made available. </p>
<p>The <i>Atlantic Philanthropies</i> have funded over $5 million in grants  		to provide continuing education as well as policy and health services research  		with the goal of increasing the supply and improving the quality of care  		provided to older adults by social workers. It is part of a human capital  		development program targeted to enhancing the geriatric skills of doctors,  		nurses, social workers and direct care workers. The Atlantic Philanthropies  		work globally with the overall goal "To bring about lasting change that will  		improve the lives of disadvantaged and vulnerable." </p>
<p>The <i>Institute for Geriatric Social Work</i> (IGSW), located at Boston  		University School of Social Work, is dedicated to advancing social work  		practice with older adults and their families. Established through a five-year  		grant from the Atlantic Philanthropies, IGSW is committed to improving the  		quality of gerontological social work practice and to helping practicing social  		workers effectively address the challenges of our diverse and growing aging  		population. IGSW offers a range of free or inexpensive, convenient, and  		accessible training programs to practicing BSW or MSW social workers--the large  		majority of whom have received little or no training in aging. In 2004, IGSW  		will train over 6,000 practitioners in over 23 conferences and through a series  		of internet-based training courses. Also in 2004, IGSW is beginning a large  		randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a social work  		intervention in primary care, a project they believe will be the most important  		social work research project in the country. And, in 2005, IGSW will be making  		training grants available to community-based organizations serving the elderly.  		</p>
<p><i>NASW and the Center for Health Workforce Studies</i> at the  		University of Albany are analyzing the results of a national workforce study  		designed to obtain information about the education, job settings (including  		long-term care) and work activities of licensed social work professionals. "A  		Study of the Roles and Use of Licensed Social Workers in the United States" is  		examining issues related to the provision of social work services to older  		adults. The survey captured information that will increase understanding of the  		clinical practice of social workers currently involved in the delivery of  		direct care services. The project has received funding support from Atlantic  		Philanthropies and the John A. Hartford Foundations. </p>
<p>The <i>American Cancer Society</i> funds a number of grants to support  		training, research and career development in areas of specific interest to  		oncology social workers working in both acute and long-term care settings.  		These grants include stipends to social work students at the master's and  		doctoral levels, post-doctoral fellowships, research scholarships and faculty  		research training grants. Awards range from $12,000 for one-year to master's  		level students to as much as $400,000 per year for five years to research  		scholars. </p>
<h3>B. Public Sector Sponsored Activities</h3>
<p>Under <i>Title III-E of the Older Americans Act</i> as reauthorized in  		2000, the National Family Caregiver Support Program funded Care PRO, a  		collaboration between the American Society on Aging, the American Nurses  		Association, the American Occupational Therapy Association and NASW, to  		increase the skills and knowledge of professionals providing needed services to  		family caregivers. The primary goal of the program was to train a minimum of  		10,000 professionals from social work, occupational therapy and nursing  		professions in order to demonstrate increased competence in identifying the  		needs of family caregivers in their day-to-day practice. A total of $444,000  		was provided for the program, which started in 2002 and is scheduled to end in  		2005. </p>
<p>The <i>HRSA Bureau of Health Professionals</i> supports accredited  		health professions schools through its Geriatric Education Center (GEC) grants.  		Since 1985, 375,000 health professionals have received training in geriatrics  		through the GECs. GECs:</p>
<ul><li>Improve the training of health professionals in geriatrics, including  		  geriatric residencies, traineeships and fellowships.</li>
<li>Develop and disseminate curricula on the treatment of health problems  		  in elderly individuals.</li>
<li>Train and re-train faculty to provide instruction in geriatrics.</li>
<li>Support continuing education for health professionals who provide  		  geriatric care.</li>
<li>Provide clinical geriatrics training in nursing facilities, chronic  		  and acute care hospitals, ambulatory care centers and senior centers. </li>
</ul><p>Social workers are one of the most prominent disciplines trained in  		GECs. In FY2001 HRSA spent $7.6 million funding 36 GECs. That year alone, 5,545  		social workers received GEC grants; HRSA has funded grants to between 4,000 and  		5,000 social workers under the GEC grant program in each of the subsequent  		years. [<i>Note: HRSA has not committed funding to GECs beyond FY 2006.</i>]  		</p>
<p><i>Indian Health Service</i> (IHS) has a two-part scholarship program  		for health professionals, including clinical social workers, who must have a  		master's degree to practice. The preparatory program provides financial support  		to enrolled members of any federally recognized AI/AN tribe for up to two years  		of pre-professional training. The recipient of the preparatory scholarship has  		no obligation to serve. Additionally, the IHS provides up to four years of  		support during professional training for which the recipient incurs a service  		obligation. The IHS also offers a loan repayment program that is available to  		clinical social workers. </p>
<p>Enabling legislation mandates that the <i>Department of Veterans  		Affairs</i> (VA) assist in the training of health professionals for its own  		needs and those of the nation. Approximately 45,000 students and trainees in  		associated health education programs at the undergraduate, graduate and  		post-graduate levels, receive clinical experience at the VA facilities. The VA  		is affiliated with over 100 Graduate Schools of Social Work, and operates the  		largest and most comprehensive clinical training program for social work  		students--training approximately 600-700 students per year. Student funding  		support of $38.8 million is provided each year and includes 45 Geriatric  		Assessment Stipends of 500 hours each, 340 MSW student stipends at VA medical  		centers annually and 557 stipends for MSW programs at $4,112 each. Moreover,  		the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires that all applicants for the  		position of social worker must have an MSW from a school of social work  		accredited by the CSWE and be licensed or certified at the master's level to  		independently practice social work in a state.<sup><font><a href="supply-and-demand-professional-social-workers-providing-long-term-care-services-report-congress.html#notee">e</a></font></sup> In addition, VHA has developed a core  		competency requirement for its long-term care social workers, including an  		annual aging-related competency assessment every year in which each social  		worker must present a psychosocial assessment and participate in peer review of  		cases. </p>

<p><a name="notea" id="notea">Another</a> common term found in the literature is  			 <i>clinical social worker</i>; these represent a subset of professional social  			 workers that have obtained a master's degree and have completed at least two  			 years of supervised therapeutic social work practice. Employers may also  			 classify jobs as social work regardless of educational requirements; similarly,  			 individuals may self-report their occupation as social worker, again without  			 regard to educational achievement.</p>

<p><a name="noteb" id="noteb">The</a> NAICS has a five-digit classification  			 structure, with a sixth digit for national industries. With some important  			 exceptions, it provides a set of standard industry codes that describe the  			 industrial structure and composition of the United States.

<p><a name="notec" id="notec">Generally,</a> P-I-E refers to the core social work  			 practice of "starting from where the client is" (i.e., framing the therapeutic  			 relationship and viewing all issues from the client's perspective).
