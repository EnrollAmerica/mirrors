</dl><h2><a name="purpose" id="purpose">I. PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p>We, as Americans, are a nation of individuals and hard-won individual  		freedoms. But we are also a nation of families. Our Federal programs and  		policies reflect both the individual and family aspects of our lives. </p>
<p>Families serve many different roles. Families function as units of  		social interaction and provide economic support, child-rearing, caregiving,  		food, shelter, and health insurance. As a result, definitions of just exactly  		what constitutes a family are complex and depend in large part on the intent of  		the particular family policy or program under consideration.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to: (1) examine family definitions used in  		Federal programs, (2) look at how family definitions are used in some broad  		policy areas; and, (3) suggest improvements in how families can be defined for  		policy research.</p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">II. OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<h3>A. What Is A Family?</h3>
<p>A family is defined by the Census Bureau as a group of individuals who  		reside together and who are related to each other by blood, marriage, or  		adoption. Two concepts are involved--who do people live with (and whether or  		not they are related) and where do people live (in the community, in  		institutions, or on the street). As we shall see, depending on the intent of  		the program, Federal programmatic definitions of families encompass many  		variations of just exactly what constitutes a family, regarding both who people  		live with and where do they live. </p>
<p>Most people live in families--214.2 million or 86 percent according to  		the 1991 Current Population Survey (CPS). The average family size was 3.18  		persons.</p>
<p>Subfamilies are families within families. For example, while an adult  		daughter and her child would constitute a family in their own right if they  		lived alone, they would be considered a subfamily if they lived with her  		parents. </p>
<p>Family members do not all necessarily have to live together,  		particularly as the degree of relationship lessens. Many relatives live  		elsewhere, but nevertheless provide important aspects of family life, such as  		caregiving for the elderly (i.e. an adult daughter who does not live with her  		elderly mother but cares for her) or the provision of health insurance to  		dependent children by a non-custodial divorced parent. </p>
<p>A household consists of all persons who live together in the same  		dwelling unit. Typically, only one family lives in the same dwelling unit or  		household and the terms family and household are often interchanged. However, a  		household can consist of people unrelated to each other, but who share  		expenses, such as roommates or more than one family living together. In 1991,  		there were 34.2 million people, representing 13.8 percent of the population,  		who lived in non-family households. Many of these people (23.6 million or 9.5  		percent) lived alone. (Census Bureau, 1992) </p>
<p>Approximately 6.6 million Americans, according to unpublished data from  		the 1990 Census, did not live in families or households, but were either  		institutionalized or lived in group quarters. About 3.3 million Americans were  		institutionalized. This figure includes 1.1 million in correctional facilities,  		1.8 million in nursing homes and the remaining 450 thousand in other types of  		institutions. </p>
<p>Nearly 3.4 million people resided in group quarters, the majority of  		whom lived (1.9 million) who lived in college dormitories. Another 590 thousand  		lived in military quarters, 580 thousand lived in group homes, and the  		remaining 240 thousand lived in shelters or were visibly lived on the street.  		Even though these individuals do not live in families or households, they often  		have spouses, parents, and other family ties to the community and participate  		in Federal programs. (Census Bureau, unpublished) </p>
<h3>B. What Kinds of Families do Americans Live In?</h3>
<p>Family patterns have been changing for some time now. These changing  		compositions are the result of many demographic, social, and economic factors,  		including higher divorce rates, higher proportion of children born outside of  		wedlock, lower marriage rates, and increased longevity, particularly for older  		women. </p>
<p>Family composition also changes as people get older. Most children live  		with their parents (see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). In 1991, 72 percent  		lived with both parents, 22 percent lived with one parent--their mother, 3  		percent lived with one parent--their father, and the remaining 3 percent lived  		with neither parent. </p>

</tr></table><p>Young adults (aged 20-24) are in transition from living with their  		parents to forming their own families. (See <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>.)  		Most (56 percent) lived with relatives (usually their parents), 24 percent  		lived with a spouse, 15 percent lived with non-relatives, and 6 percent lived  		alone. In the middle years (aged 35-44), 70 percent lived with their spouse, 16  		percent lived with relatives (but not a spouse), 6 percent lived with  		non-relatives, and 9 percent lived alone. </p>
<p>The chances of widowhood increase considerably with advancing age. Among  		people aged 65-74, 64 percent live with a spouse, 10 percent live with other  		relatives, 2 percent live with non-relatives, and 25 percent live alone. For  		those aged 75 or over, only 39 percent live with their spouse, 17 percent live  		with other relatives, 3 percent live with non-relatives, and 41 percent live  		alone. (Census Bureau, 1992) The elderly who live alone are likely to older  		widows. Even though life expectancies have increased for older men in recent  		years, women still live longer and tend to marry men older than they are.  		(Adler, 1987)</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="major" id="major">III. MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC FAMILY DEFINITIONS</a></h2>
<h3>A. What Types of Federal Programs Affect Families?</h3>
<p>Federal programs define and measure families in different ways,  		depending on the intent of the program. Programmatic definitions are critically  		important from a policy perspective, because they determine who is eligible to  		receive benefits, who is not, who could be in the future, and who would be if  		program modifications were made. Almost every Federal program is either  		targeted towards families or has provisions for dependent or surviving family  		members.</p>
<p>There are literally dozens of Federal programs, which provide cash  		assistance, health care, and help with food and shelter. Overall, there are two  		main types of Federal programs which assist families: (1) <b>social insurance  		programs</b>, which include Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, and  		Worker's Compensation; and, (2) <b>means-tested programs</b> which include  		AFDC, SSI, Medicaid, food stamps, Housing Subsidies, and the Low-Income Home  		Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). </p>
<p>The AFDC program typifies what we consider to be family related Federal  		programs. The AFDC program provides monthly cash welfare payments to certain  		needy families with dependent children. In 1991 during an average month,  		12,567,500 persons (including 8,498,000 children) received AFDC payments which  		at an average cost of $135 per recipient. (U.S. House Committee on Ways and  		Means, 1992)</p>
<p>However, social insurance programs also assist many families. The  		purpose of the Social Security programs is to provide for workers and their  		families when work is interrupted or ceased. Family coverage includes dependent  		and surviving spouses and children. Nearly the same number of people receive  		family-related benefits from Social Security as from AFDC, but benefits are  		much higher. During June 1992, 12,407,000 dependent or surviving family members  		received Social Security benefits at a monthly cost of $5.04 billion, which  		resulted in an average monthly payment of $406. (Social Security, 1992) </p>
<h3>B. Social Insurance Programs</h3>
<p>Social insurance programs spread risks among a large population by  		requiring payments (or premiums) into a large central pool. The Social Security  		Act of 1935 established the Social Security and Unemployment Compensation  		programs. Thus, for the first time, American workers were protected from  		short-term job loss (due to unemployment) and long-term job cessation (due to  		retirement). Subsequent amendments in 1939 provided protection for dependents  		and survivors and in 1956 broadened coverage to workers who lost their jobs due  		to disability. (Social Security, 1991)</p>
<p>Social insurance programs are found throughout the world in all but the  		poorest countries to insure against loss or interruption of work. Besides the  		services covered by the American Social Security system, many countries also  		provide maternity benefits and family allowances through their social insurance  		systems. Maternity benefits are made to working mothers both before and after  		the birth of their child. Family allowances typically consist of cash  		allowances to families with children, but school grants, birth grants, and  		maternal and child health services may also be included. Provisions for family  		allowances are found in all industrialized nations except the United States.  		Furthermore, many industrialized nations include what we would consider to be  		"means-tested" programs as part of their social insurance structure. (Social  		Security, 1989)</p>
<p>There are three major social insurance programs in this country--Social  		Security, Unemployment Insurance, and Worker's Compensation. The latter two  		programs are focused on the individual rather than the family, although some  		States do have dependent allowances. Since the Social Security program assists  		so many families, only that program's definitions of families will be examined  		in this section. </p>
<p><b><i>Social Security: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance  		(OASDI)</i></b></p>
<p>Families are broadly defined in the Social Security program. The marital  		and fertility history of workers must be known in order to determine who could  		potentially receive benefits as family members. The Social Security program  		defines families in terms of eligible dependents or survivors of insured  		workers. </p>
<p>The Social Security program or Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability  		Insurance (OASDI) program (administered by the Social Security Administration  		or SSA in the DHHS), is the largest Federal program in the country. Social  		Security programs are split into two separate programs: (1) the Old-Age and  		Survivors (OASI) program; and, (2) the Disability Insurance (DI) program.</p>
<p>Workers can be retired or disabled and receive benefits on their own. In  		these instances, benefits can be made to eligible dependents, typically spouses  		(including divorced spouses) and children who are dependent because of age or  		disability. Survivor benefits are extended to dependents of deceased workers,  		including widows, widowers, and orphaned children. Therefore, in order to make  		actuarial projections of the Social Security program, information on almost  		every demographic trend--marriage, divorce, remarriage, birth, death, and  		disability--are needed.</p>
<p>In June 1992, a total of 41.2 million people received Social Security  		benefits, including 25.5 million retired workers, 3.7 million spouses and  		children of retired workers, 3.3 million disabled workers, 1.4 million spouses  		and children of disabled workers, and 7.3 million survivors of deceased  		workers. Altogether, nearly one in six Americans (16.3 percent) received  		benefits from Social Security, including 2.8 million (4.3 percent) of all  		children under the age of 18. Total Social Security payments for June 1992  		amounted to $23.4 billion. (Social Security, 1992)</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>Eligibility for Social Security is based on insurance status through  		employment. Almost all workers are covered through Social security with the  		exception of certain Federal, State, and local government workers. Overall,  		approximately 96 percent of workers are covered by the Social Security program.  		</p>
<p>Social Security is financed by payroll taxes contributed by both  		employers and employees through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)  		tax. Currently the FICA tax rate is 7.65 percent<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> of wages from employees matched by an  		additional 7.65 percent from employers. Self-employed persons contribute 15.3  		percent, because they contribute both the employee and employer's shares. </p>
<p>Workers can either be fully or currently insured. Insured status is  		attained based on the number of quarters of coverage accumulated during working  		years. A quarter of coverage is earned for each calendar quarter in which a  		worker was paid more than a set amount in wages ($750 in 1992). This set amount  		is adjusted annually for inflation. A maximum of four quarters can be earned  		each year. Workers with 40 quarters are fully insured for life, but those with  		as few as 6 quarters can be fully insured under certain circumstances.  		Dependent and certain survivor benefits can only be extended to eligible family  		members of fully insured workers. (Social Security, 1991; U.S. House Committee  		on Ways and Means, 1992) </p>
<p><b>Retired workers</b>: Most people who receive Social Security benefits  		are retired workers (25,480,000 in June 1992). Retired or old-age benefits are  		paid to retired workers who are aged 62 or older and who are fully insured.  		(Social Security, 1992; U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992) </p>
<p><b>Wives and Husbands of Retired or Disabled Workers</b>: Monthly cash  		benefits are paid to spouses or divorced spouses of retired or disabled workers  		if one of the following conditions is met: (1) the currently married spouse is  		age 62 or older or is caring for one or more of the worker's entitled children  		who is either disabled or is under age 16; or, (2) the divorced spouse is aged  		62 or older, is not married, and the marriage of the worker lasted at least 10  		years before the divorce became final. In June 1992, 434,000 wives and husbands  		of retired workers and 269,000 wives and husbands of disabled workers received  		benefits. (Social Security, 1992; U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means,  		1992)</p>
<p><b>Children Under 18 and Students Aged 18-19</b>: Monthly cash benefits  		are paid to unmarried children or eligible dependent grandchildren of a fully  		insured retired worker or a disabled or deceased worker. The child must be  		either under the age of 18 or a full-time elementary or secondary student aged  		18 or 19. Grandchildren are eligible for benefits if the child was adopted by  		the grandparent. During June 1992, a total of 2,817,000 children under the age  		of 18 received benefits. Of these, 434,000 were dependents of retired workers,  		1,037,000 were dependents of disabled workers, and 1,346,000 were survivors of  		deceased workers. In addition, 121,000 students aged 18 or 19 received  		benefits, including 16,000 students who were dependents of retired workers,  		34,000 dependents of disabled workers, and 71,000 surviving children of  		deceased workers. (Social Security, 1992; U.S. House Committee on Ways and  		Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Adults Disabled as Children</b>: Adult children (aged 18 or over) are  		eligible to receive monthly cash benefits if they are disabled, if their  		disability began before the age of 22, and if they are the eligible child (or  		grandchild) of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker. In June 1992, a total  		of 626,000 adults disabled as children received benefits, including 179,000  		dependents of retired workers, 40,000 dependents of disabled workers, and  		407,000 survivors of deceased workers. (Social Security, 1992; U.S. House  		Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Disabled Workers</b>: Monthly cash benefits are paid to disabled  		workers under the age of 65 who have earned the requisite number of Social  		Security quarters, who earn less than the substantial gainful activity (SGA)  		amount (currently set at $500 per month), and who meet SSA's disability  		criteria. Generally, disability is defined by SSA as the inability to engage in  		SGA because of a mental or physical impairment, which is medically determinable  		and expected to last at least 12 months or end in death. In June 1992,  		3,334,000 disabled workers received benefits. (Social Security, 1992; U.S.  		House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Nondisabled Widows and Widowers</b>: Widows, widowers, and surviving  		divorced spouses of fully insured workers receive benefits if they are aged 60  		or older and are unmarried, or married if remarriage occurred after the  		widow/widower's first eligibility for benefits. In June 1992, 5,049,000  		nondisabled widows or widowers received survivor benefits. (Social Security,  		1992; U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Disabled Widows and Widowers</b>: Disabled widows, widowers, and  		surviving divorced spouses can receive benefits if they are between the ages of  		50 and 59 and have been disabled (according to SSA criteria) throughout a  		waiting period of 5 consecutive calendar months which began no later than 7  		years after the month in which the worker died or after the end of entitlement  		to benefits as a widowed mother. In June 1992, 123,000 disabled widows or  		widowers received survivor benefits. (Social Security, 1992; U.S. House  		Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Mother's or Father's</b>: Monthly cash benefits are paid to widows or  		widowers (or in the case of divorce to surviving divorced spouse) of fully  		insured workers who have one or more entitled children in their care. Children  		must be under age 16 or disabled. In June 1992, 296,000 mothers or fathers  		received survivor benefits. (Social Security, 1992; U.S. House Committee on  		Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Parent's</b>: Dependent parents aged 62 or older are paid benefits on  		behalf of a deceased fully insured child. In June 1992, 5,000 individuals were  		paid parent's benefits. (Social Security, 1992; U.S. House Committee on Ways  		and Means, 1992)</p>
<h3>C. Means-Tested Programs</h3>
<p>Means-tested Federal programs provide assistance to the needy through  		nearly aspect of family life. Major means-tested programs are described in this  		section, including SSI and <b>AFDC</b> which provide direct cash assistance,  		<b>Medicaid</b> which pays for health care, the <b>Food Stamps</b> program,  		which purchases and provides food, <b>Housing Subsidies</b>, which provide help  		with the rent, and the <b>Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program  		(LIHEAP)</b>, which helps pay household energy costs.</p>
<p>Family definitions vary greatly along with the intent of the program and  		which aspect of family life is being addressed. For example, cash assistance  		and health care programs focus on family units, food programs focus on "eating"  		units, and housing/energy programs focus on "dwelling units". </p>
<p>Funding for Federal means-tested programs typically comes from general  		revenues at either the Federal or some combination of Federal and State and  		local sources. </p>
<p><b><i>The Role of Poverty</i></b></p>
<p>The means-test for program eligibility is usually based on some  		variation of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines, which contain income  		measures for different family sizes. Assets are also included in the  		eligibility for many means-tested programs. Means-tested program do not cover  		everyone who is poor. Sometimes, the specific criteria are less than the  		poverty line (i.e. 75 percent of poverty) and sometimes other criteria besides  		income are usually employed (i.e. type of family or disability). </p>
<p>The Poverty Income Guidelines are adjusted annually for inflation and  		are based on the Poverty Thresholds, which are statistical measures defining  		who is poor and who is not, according to income and family size. Both measures  		were originally derived by Molly Orshansky in the 1960s, who defined poverty as  		the family income level below that which could purchase an adequate diet. The  		Poverty Income Guidelines are based on the size of the family unit, but no  		standard definition of family exists. Rather, specific definitions are up to  		individual programs. (Fisher, unpublished)</p>
<p><b>SSI</b>: Supplemental Security Income or SSI (administered by SSA,  		DHHS) grew out of the Old-Age Assistance and Aid to the Blind programs  		established under the Social Security Act of 1935. Under the original  		provisions, cash assistance grants were paid by States and matched by the  		Federal government to needy aged and blind persons. In 1972, Congress  		authorized the creation of Federal SSI programs, which replaced the earlier  		State programs. Federalization resulted in much less variability across  		States.</p>
<p>The SSI program currently provides cash assistance to needy aged (aged  		65 or older), blind, or disabled persons. Blindness and disability are defined  		the same way as in the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program.  		However, unlike DI, persons of any age including newborn can receive blindness  		or disability benefits should they qualify. As of June 1992, approximately  		5,390,000 persons received SSI, 530,000 of whom were blind or disabled  		children.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>Since SSI is individually based for the most part, most benefits are  		paid directly to individuals. However, household income and living arrangements  		are taken into account in determining whether a person can receive SSI and, if  		so, how much can be received. Persons residing in institutions (usually nursing  		homes) in which the majority of their care is paid by Medicaid receive only $30  		per month. Adults who reside in the community, but who live in someone else's  		home receive two-thirds of what they would receive if they had their own place.  		Eligible married couples are subject to a maximum payment ($610 in 1991).  		Children are determined to be eligible on the basis of their parents' income at  		levels typically more generous than those for adults. (Social Security, 1992;  		U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>AFDC</b>: The Aid to Dependent Families with Children (administered  		by the Administration for Children and Families, DHHS) is commonly known as the  		AFDC or ADC program. AFDC was established as part of the Social Security Act of  		1935 through a provision which authorized the Federal government to match State  		grants to fatherless families with dependent children. According to Ellwood, at  		that time, most children were deprived of parental support due to the death,  		incapacity, or unemployment of a parent--few were abandoned or had divorced  		parents. It was felt that the AFDC program would eventually be phased out once  		other provisions of the Social Security Act would begin to compensate for  		parental deprivation due to unemployment, retirement, and death. (Ellwood)</p>
<p>During 1991, there were 12.4 million AFDC recipients, 8.4 million of  		whom were children under 18. Altogether, over one in eight or 12.9 percent of  		the nation's children were enrolled in AFDC. Average monthly expenditures for  		AFDC were $1.7 billion during Fiscal Year 1991. </p>
<p>AFDC payments are made on behalf of needy children who are deprived of  		parental support or care, because their father or mother is absent from the  		home continuously, is incapacitated, is deceased, or is unemployed. An AFDC  		family or case is the unit which receives a check. During fiscal year 1991, an  		average of 4.4 million families or cases received AFDC payments. </p>
<p>The AFDC case consists of the parent or parents and the dependent  		children. Other relatives and nonrelatives may reside in the household. These  		individuals may or may not be considered as part of the AFDC case, but their  		incomes and financial situations are considered for purposes of AFDC  		eligibility and the determination of the amount of benefits. For example, the  		incomes of stepparents are treated like the incomes of natural and adoptive  		parents. In the case of minor parents, the incomes of their parents or legal  		guardians are also considered if they live ion the same household. </p>
<p>States, Federal Territories, and the District of Columbia set their own  		eligibility criteria within broad Federal guidelines. Federal matching funds  		now constitute from 50 to 80 percent of State payments. The amount of the AFDC  		payment also varies by State, family size, and other considerations. In January  		1992, the median AFDC monthly grant was $372, an amount which reached 41  		percent of the poverty line. Alaska had the highest maximum monthly AFDC grant  		at $924 (82 percent of the poverty level) and Mississippi the lowest at $120  		per month, which amounted to only 13 percent of the poverty level. (U.S. House  		Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Medicaid</b>: Medicaid is a joint Federal-State program (administered  		by the Health Care Financing Administration, DHHS) which pays for the health  		care of low-income individuals.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> During fiscal year 1991, an average of $7.9  		billion was spent on Medicaid coverage. In fiscal year 1990, approximately 25.3  		million people received Medicaid services.</p>
<p>Medicaid eligibility is very complex and varies from State to State.  		There is no one Medicaid program, but rather a collection of 55 Medicaid  		programs. Similarly, there is no single definition of family, but many within  		each of the 55 Medicaid jurisdictions. States must provide mandatory coverage  		to AFDC recipients and (in most instances) to SSI recipients. In addition,  		States must provide coverage to needy children and pregnant women, and to other  		special groups. Besides mandatory coverage, States also have the option of  		covering certain other groups. People (and families) with comparable illnesses,  		disabilities, and incomes can be eligible for Medicaid in one State, but not in  		another. (U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992) Details of who can be  		eligible for Medicaid are shown in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>.</p>
<p><b>Food Stamps</b>: The Food Stamps program was established in 1966 to  		provide nutritious diets to needy households and is administered by the U.S.  		Department of Agriculture (USDA). In 1991, 22.6 million Americans or 9 percent  		of the total population received food stamps at an average monthly costs of  		$1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Since the purpose of Food Stamps is to provide food, the definition of  		family is quite different from those used for programs which provide cash  		payments or health care. The food stamps household (not family) is defined as  		those individuals who live and purchase and prepare food together. Sometimes,  		nonrelatives apply as a single unit and sometimes they apply separately  		depending on how food costs and meal preparation are shared. </p>
<p>As a general rule, relatives must apply together as one unit. Some  		exceptions are elderly persons who cannot purchase food for themselves due to a  		disability can apply separately. In any event, income from all household  		members has to be considered in determining eligibility for Food Stamps. In  		general, most AFDC and SSI recipients are also eligible for food stamps, as  		well as other needy families and individual who meet program criteria. </p>
<p>While the vast majority of food stamp recipients live in the community,  		persons in certain facilities are eligible as well (i.,e. special SSI-approved  		small group homes for the disabled, persons living in drug addiction or alcohol  		treatment programs, and persons who live in shelter for the homeless or for  		battered women and children). (Social Security, 1991; U.S. House Committee on  		Ways and Means, 1992)</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p><b>Subsidized Housing</b>: Federal housing aid is available through a  		number of programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban  		Development (HUD) and the Farmers Home Administration, USDA to low-income  		households. Much of the aid goes to households residing in either project-based  		low-income housing or to those in standard housing units. Generally,  		eligibility for rental certificates and vouchers are limited to low-income  		families, whose incomes are below 50 percent of the median income for their  		area, or (in some cases) to families whose incomes are less than 80 percent of  		the average for their area. In 1990, Federal outlays for such assistance  		amounted to $10 billion for 2.5 million housing units. (Social Security, 1991;  		U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<p><b>Low-Income Home Energy Assistance</b>: The LIHEAP program was  		established as part of the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 and is  		administered as State and Tribal block grants from DHHS. The LIHEAP program  		allows States to help eligible households with: (1) their heating or cooling  		bills, (2)2 a portion of low-cost weatherization, and (3) provide assistance  		during energy-related emergencies. In fiscal year 1992, $1.5 billion was  		allotted to nearly 5.8 million households. </p>
<p>LIHEAP households are defined as any individual or group of individuals  		who live together in one economic unit and who purchase residential energy in  		common or who make undesignated payments for energy in the form of rent.  		Eligibility is basically determined by States, although in general, payments  		can be made to households which contain recipients of AFDC, SSI, food stamps,  		and certain need-based veterans programs. States may also include households  		whose income is either 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines or  		60 percent of the State's median income, whichever is greater. (Social  		Security, 1991; U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1992)</p>
<h2><a name="family" id="family">IV. FAMILY DEFINITIONS AND OTHER POLICY  		ISSUES</a></h2>
<p>Family definitions play a major role not only in programs, but in  		virtually every policy arena. To illustrate how family definitions vary and why  		they impact on policy, child-support and health insurance are examined. </p>
<h3>A. Child Support</h3>
<p>Child-support is paid on behalf of children involved in a divorce or  		separation. Child support can also be paid to children whose parents were never  		married, but for who paternity was established. Typically, child support is  		paid by absent fathers to the mother and children. According to the 1988 Survey  		of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), 3.6 million women received child  		support payments and additional 4.6 million should have received court-ordered  		benefits, but did not. (Census Bureau, March 1992)</p>
<p>Child support units can also be part of other families. For example, if  		a mother remarries, she, her new husband, and children from the previous  		marriage may all be considered one family, but only she and her children are in  		the child support unit, and money is only paid on behalf of her children. </p>
<p>Parents may also share custody. In these cases, the children may move  		back and forth for short or long periods and live with their mother (and her  		family) and their father (and his family). Thus, from the children's  		perspectives, their families can change according to the custody arrangements.  		</p>
<h3>B. Health Insurance</h3>
<p>Private health insurance can be provided through individual or family  		plans, which in turn can be provided through employment, unions, or other  		groups, or privately purchased. Families can be defined in terms of health  		insurance in many ways, but generally only spouses and children (including  		stepchildren) are covered. Adult dependent children (under the ages of 22 or  		23) may or may not be covered if they live elsewhere. Similarly, children who  		are entitled to child support may also be insured from a non-custodial parent.  		In fact, health coverage is typically written into child support agreements. In  		1989, there were approximately 1 million children who received health insurance  		benefits from a noncustodial parent. (Moyer, unpublished) </p>
<p>There are many other instances where the same family can have different  		health insurance coverage, such as spouses who both work and obtain coverage  		separately, instances where a family member is disabled and cannot obtain  		private coverage. </p>
<p>It is important to note that Medicare coverage does not extend to other  		family members. Each family member must qualify on his or her own through  		receipt of Social Security benefits after age 65 or receipt of disability  		benefits after 24 months. Medicaid, on the other hand, as noted earlier, can be  		extended to family members in certain circumstances, notably receipt of  		AFDC.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">V. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Families cannot be defined simply or universally for purposes of Federal  		programs and policies. Much variation is due to the complex nature of the  		family itself and to the specific purpose of the Federal program. </p>
<p>Research on the other hand is largely based on Federal population-based  		national surveys, which collect data on individuals and use Census criteria to  		define families and households. Family relationships in these surveys are  		typically derived by these surveys by identifying a "head" and ascertaining  		everyone's relationship to that head person. Thus, while many of the Federal  		programs that we administer have diverse and broad definitions of family, the  		basis of our policy research is much more constrained.</p>
<p>Some suggestions to improve the state of family analyses include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Perform more analyses by family as well as individuals. For example,  			 disability is an individual phenomenon, but appears to be clustered in  			 families. We don't know why and we don't know the impact on patterns of  			 employment and reliance on Federal programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family history (including marital and fertility history), as well as  			 current family composition, is crucial for many policy issues as evidenced by  			 the large numbers of Americans who receive Social Security benefits by virtue  			 of dependence and survivorship and the number of children who are entitled to  			 child support payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationship within the family is sufficiently complicated to  			 require knowing more than relationship to a single head. The abundance of  			 stepfamilies, extended families, and other arrangements attests to this. The  			 SIPP Topical Module on family relationship, which is essentially a family  			 matrix of people and relationships, can be used as a model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family functioning is a key element in how families work together.  			 Family composition and functioning are highly correlated. In fact, family  			 composition (and decompensation) often are the result of how well or poorly  			 families function. Therefore, analyses of family functioning should take family  			 composition into account, in much more detail.</p>
