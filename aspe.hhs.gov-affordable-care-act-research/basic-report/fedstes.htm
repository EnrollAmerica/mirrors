</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This paper provides an overview of public financing of long-term care  		services for the elderly under Medicare, Medicaid and other public  		programs.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> Recent  		program data on public spending for both nursing home and home care services  		are presented, as well as selected data on recent expenditure trends,  		particularly under Medicare and Medicaid. Long-term care expenditures under  		both of these entitlement programs are increasing rapidly as the demand for  		services is fueled by the demographics of an aging population. In addition to  		presenting statistical highlights, the chapter also describes the  		organizational characteristics of the public financing of long-term care, and  		how the financing of long-term care vanes across states. </p>
<p>While this paper is limited to a discussion of public financing of  		long-term care services, it is important to put this discussion in a proper  		context. Public financing of long-term care services is substantial, and is  		increasing in response to the growing demand for services. But it is important  		to underscore the fact that most long-term care is not publicly funded, and  		very little long-term care is financed through private insurance. <i>Most</i>  		long-term care is provided informally by the spouses, children, relatives and  		friends of the disabled elderly who needs assistance in everyday life  		activities. Three out of four elderly persons living in the community receive  		help <i>only</i> from informal sources of care. </p>
<p>In addition, when the elderly and their families turn to the formal  		health care system for help with long-term care services, they are much more  		likely to pay for their care out of their own pockets. The elderly pay a much  		higher percentage of long-term care costs privately than they do for acute  		care. Due to Medicare's coverage of acute care services, the elderly's private  		share of total spending for inpatient hospital costs in 1987 was only 15  		percent (for deductibles, coinsurance, and non-covered stays). Similarly, the  		elderly, on average, pay only about 36 percent of the total cost of physician  		services out of pocket. In contrast, about 48 percent of all spending for  		nursing home services is paid privately by the elderly users of nursing home  		services and by their families. </p>
<p>As the demographics of our elderly population continues to change, there  		will be an increasing demand for long-term care. In brief, the largest  		increases in demand will occur for those services for which the elderly are  		insured the least. Informal care and private financing of long-term care will  		likely to continue to play a major role in the provision and purchase of  		long-term care services, but the public sector's role in supplementing private  		systems of care will also increase as well. </p>
<h2><a name="who" id="who">WHO GETS HELP? AN OVERVIEW OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID  		FINANCING OF LONG-TERM CARE</a> </h2>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid are the two major public funding sources for  		long-term care, although the circumstances under which elderly persons receive  		long-term care assistance under each of these programs is very different.  		Persons who receive long-term care assistance from these two public programs  		generally fall into two categories: (1) Medicare enrollees who are recovering  		from an acute illness; and (2) poor elderly persons who are eligible for  		Medicaid and who qualify for Medicaid-covered long-term care benefits. </p>
<p>The Medicare program provides limited long-term care coverage as an  		entitlement, without means-testing. Thus, while almost all elderly persons are  		eligible for Medicare, the long-term care benefits provided under Medicare are  		limited. Many elderly persons still do not realize that Medicare does not  		protect them from the most of the costs associated with long-term care. </p>
<p>From its inception in 1965, the primary purpose of the Medicare program  		has been to provide elderly persons with protection from the high costs of  		acute medical illness, particularly costs associated with inpatient hospital  		care. As such, in determining what Medicare will and will not pay for, a  		boundary has historically been drawn between services that are oriented toward  		the treatment of acute illness and services that are primarily custodial in  		nature. Prior to 1989, Medicare home health services were largely confined to  		short-term homebound patients requiring skilled services during recovery from  		an acute illness. In July of 1989, however, the Health Care Financing  		Administration (HCFA) issued revisions of its <i><b>Health Insurance  		Manual</b></i> (HIM-11) which clarified eligibility and coverage for the home  		health benefit. The result has been a rapid expansion in the use of the  		Medicare Home Health benefit.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup> Thus, some analysts believe that Medicare's  		traditional role in only providing coverage for episodes of care related to  		acute illness has eroded, and that the Medicare home health benefit is now  		being used to a large extent to cover services related to more chronic  		conditions. </p>
<p>Unlike Medicare, State Medicaid programs have always provided coverage  		for both skilled care related to acute illnesses and custodial care for persons  		with long-term disabilities. However, the breadth of the Medicaid benefit  		package varies from State to State. Medicaid is also a means-tested  		program--only the elderly poor qualify for Medicaid coverage. In 1992, about  		11.2 percent of the elderly were enrolled in the Medicaid program at some point  		during the year--about 3.6 million persons.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> Thus, the Medicaid program provides a more  		generous benefit package for long-term care services than the Medicare program,  		but these services are limited to persons who lack the financial resources to  		pay for their own care. </p>
<p>Medicaid also serves as a public safety net for elderly persons who  		cannot afford the cost of a long nursing home stay. Many elderly persons do not  		qualify for Medicaid when they first enter a nursing home, but become eligible  		for Medicaid coverage after depleting what resources they had in paying for  		their own care over a period. of months or years. In this manner, the Medicaid  		program at least provides some assurance that a long-term care safety net  		exists for all elderly persons, once their private resources are gone. </p>
<p>Medicaid is a program that is jointly financed by the Federal government  		and by State governments, and the generosity with which individual States  		finance long-term care varies enormously. States also vary in the amount of  		their own general revenue funds that they allocate to community-based service  		programs for the elderly outside of Medicaid. <b>An extremely important feature  		of the public long-term care system is the lead role that State governments  		have in shaping the characteristics of local financing and delivery systems for  		long-term care services</b>. Consequently, where an elderly person lives can  		have an great impact on the access which he or she has to publicly-financed  		long-term care. </p>
<h2><a name="public" id="public">MOST PUBLIC LONG-TERM CARE DOLLARS PAY FOR NURSING  		HOME CARE</a> </h2>
<p>Although about two-thirds of elderly persons with disabilities live in  		the community, over three out of four public dollars spent on long-term care  		are spent for nursing home care. As shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a>,  		total public expenditures for elderly nursing home care totalled $58.6 billion  		in 1993, compared to $20.6 billion for home care services. </p>
<p>At the same time, public spending accounts for a greater share of total  		spending for home care than for nursing home care. The public sector accounts  		for just over half of all spending for nursing home care, but about 74 percent  		of all spending for formal home care. This is largely due to the fact that  		informal care is more likely to substitute for formal paid home care than for  		24-hour nursing home care. When an elderly family member needs care at home,  		most families elect to provide care themselves rather than pay for care. But  		when nursing home care can no longer be avoided, families must pay for care out  		of their own pockets, unless the disabled elder is eligible for Medicaid. </p>

</tr></table><h3>The Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Benefit</h3>
<p>Medicare provides some nursing home coverage as an entitlement, without  		means-testing, but this coverage is restricted to short-term nursing home stays  		after discharge from a hospital. Medicare <b>does not</b> cover custodial  		nursing home care. The Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) benefit was  		originally enacted and is presently administered as extended hospital care for  		patients who are recovering from an acute illness episode, but who can be more  		economically served in a skilled nursing facility, rather than in an inpatient  		hospital setting. </p>
<p>The Medicare SNF benefit provides up to 100 days of coverage per spell  		of illness. To qualify for coverage, a Medicare beneficiary must have been  		transferred to a skilled nursing facility directly from a hospital stay of not  		less than three days. The beneficiary is also liable for a copayment amount for  		all covered days after the 20th day. In 1993, the Medicare SNF copayment amount  		was $84.50 per day for days 21 through 100. Since the SNF copayment requirement  		may be higher than the Medicaid nursing home rate, or even private pay rates in  		a facility, some patients convert to private pay or Medicaid status on the 21st  		day, even though they still qualify for Medicare coverage. </p>
<p>Medicare beneficiaries must meet relatively restrictive functional  		criteria for Medicare SNF coverage. The Medicare SNF regulations stipulate that  		a beneficiary must require skilled nursing care or skilled rehabilitation  		services, and explicitly state that individuals who require custodial care only  		are <b>not</b> eligible for Medicare SNF coverage. </p>
<p>There has been continuing controversy regarding the interpretation of  		these Medicare SNF criteria by the fiscal intermediaries who process claims  		from nursing home providers for Medicare reimbursement. To address these  		concerns, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) implemented new  		guidelines in April 1988 for fiscal intermediaries to use in reviewing SNP  		claims in order to achieve greater uniformity in determining what types of  		patients were eligible for Medicare SNF coverage. </p>
<p>In 1989, under the provisions of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act  		(MCCA), the Medicare SNF benefit was temporarily expanded. The copayment  		requirement was reduced, the total days of coverage per calendar year was  		expanded from 100 days to 150 days, and the three-day prior hospitalization  		requirement was eliminated. When the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was  		subsequently repealed, these expanded benefits were terminated effective  		January 1, 1990, and the Medicare SNF benefit reverted to its pre-MMCA  		provisions. </p>
<p>Partly due to the revised guidelines for interpreting Medicare SNF  		functional criteria, and partly due to the expansion in benefits enacted under  		the MCCA, Medicare SNF expenditures for beneficiaries over the age of 65 more  		than tripled from 1988 to 1989, as shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure2">Figure 2</a>.  		Between 1980 and 1988, expenditures for SNF care rose from $340 million to $723  		million, an average annual rate of increase of 9.9 percent.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup> Between 1988 and 1989, SNF  		expenditures rose 241 percent, from $723 million to almost $2.5 billion. With  		the termination of the MCCA expanded benefits in January 1990, Medicare SNF  		expenditures declined to $2.1 billion. By 1992, however, Medicare SNF  		expenditures again increased--to over $3.0 billion. Therefore, although the  		expanded coverage provisions for SNF care under MCCA were subsequently  		repealed, it appears that the temporary expansion of these benefits has had a  		long-term impact on the growth in expenditures. </p>
<h3>Medicaid Nursing Home Coverage is Means-Tested</h3>
<p>Unlike Medicare, which provides limited nursing home coverage for all  		Medicare beneficiaries, the Medicaid program provides relatively broad nursing  		home coverage to a limited population--those elderly who cannot afford to pay  		the total costs of their own care. Over 78 percent of all public spending for  		nursing home care flows through the Medicaid program.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup> Medicaid also accounts for more than 40  		percent of all public and private spending for nursing homes. In 1992, about  		1.5 million persons over the age of 65 received some public assistance for the  		costs of their nursing home care through Medicaid. </p>
<p>Since Medicaid is jointly financed by the Federal government and the  		States, Medicaid coverage of nursing home care varies substantially across the  		fifty State Medicaid programs. This coverage varies across a variety of  		dimensions including: (a) financial criteria used to determine eligibility for  		Medicaid coverage; (b) functional criteria used to determine whether nursing  		home care is needed; (c) access to nursing home beds for those who qualify for  		coverage; and (d) Medicaid payment rates to nursing home providers, which can  		affect access to care and the quality of care provided. </p>
<p>The financial criteria used to determine whether an applicant qualifies  		for Medicaid coverage in a nursing home are complex, and it is not possible to  		present all of the intracacies of Medicaid eligibility policy in this  		reports.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> However, some  		general rules can be described. It is usually true that any elderly person who  		is covered by Medicaid prior to entering a nursing home will also qualify for  		Medicaid nursing home coverage once admitted. Furthermore, many persons who do  		not qualify for Medicaid prior to nursing home admission become eligible once  		they enter a nursing home because their income and assets are insufficient to  		pay the costs of nursing home care. In addition, many persons pay for their  		nursing home care privately for months or years, and then become eligible for  		Medicaid after their private resources are depleted. Such persons are  		considered to have "spent down" to Medicaid eligibility. </p>

</tr></table><p>Elderly individuals who seek Medicaid coverage for nursing home care  		must meet both <b>income</b> and <b>asset</b> criteria. These criteria vary to  		some degree across the fifty State Medicaid programs. In 35 States (generally  		those which have adopted medically needy programs covering nursing home care)  		no <b>income</b> limits apply. In these States, if an individual cannot afford  		to pay for nursing home care from his or her own income, he or she can qualify  		for Medicaid, assuming the individual also meets Medicaid <b>asset</b>  		criteria. </p>
<p>In the remaining 15 States, individuals can only qualify for Medicaid  		nursing home coverage if their income does not exceed a <b>special income  		level</b>.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup> This special  		income level, by Federal law, cannot exceed 300 percent of the Federal income  		standard used in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which in 1993  		was $434 per month for a single individual. Thus, these 15 States had special  		income levels at or below $1,302 per month in 1993. As explained later on,  		these income criteria only determine whether an individual is eligible for  		Medicaid. Even those who qualify for Medicaid must still pay for part of the  		cost of their nursing home care out of their available income. </p>
<p>Medicaid eligibility is also contingent upon applicants meeting  		financial <b>asset</b> criteria. In most States, Medicaid asset criteria are  		the same used in determining financial eligibility for the SSI program, which  		in 1993 was $2,000 for an individual and $3,000 for a couple. In 1992, five  		States had lower asset criteria, and ten States had higher criteria, up to  		$4,000.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup> Certain assets,  		however, are excluded in determining eligibility for Medicaid. These include:  		</p>
<ul><li>Life insurance with a face value of less than $1,500; </li>
<li>Funds up to $1,500 designated for a burial; </li>
<li>Burial space; </li>
<li>An automobile, within limits; and </li>
<li>Equity in a home, regardless of value, provided it is the person's  		  principal place of residence. </li>
</ul><p>One area of eligibility policy that varies across States, however, is  		the criteria which States use to determine whether a home is or is not still  		the "principal place of residence." Medicaid rules for determining whether  		equity in a home is a "countable" or "exempt" resource generally follow rules  		established for the SSI program, which stipulate that as long as an individual  		states an <b>intent</b> to return home from the nursing home, regardless of how  		long he or she has been in a nursing home or whether there is any reasonable  		expectation that the individual could possibly return home, then the house is  		to be considered an exempt asset.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note9">9</a></font></sup> A few states (so-called 209[b] States) are  		allowed to use more restrictive criteria than are used in the SSI program, and  		include home equity as a countable resource once a Medicaid recipient has been  		in a nursing home for an extended period of time and has no reasonable  		expectation of returning home. Recipients may be required to sell their homes,  		in which case they go off Medicaid until the resources obtained from the sale  		of the home are depleted. </p>
<p>The financial criteria described above apply to individuals in nursing  		homes who do not have spouses still living at home.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note10">10</a></font></sup> Medicaid financial criteria for  		couples are significantly different, and were recently modified by one of the  		unrepealed sections of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA) of 1988.  		Prior to enactment of the MCCA, a spouse of a nursing home user could be  		financially devastated by the costs of providing nursing home care. This was  		because Medicaid rules stipulated that the countable assets of a Medicaid  		applicant included any asset that the applicant had the unrestricted right to  		liquidate or dispose of. This was true even if assets were jointly held by both  		spouses. Thus, if an elderly couple had joint savings or other financial assets  		which the nursing home recipient could access without authorization from the  		other spouse, then all of those assets had to be spent down before the  		recipient could become eligible for Medicaid. This could leave the community  		spouse with few or no resources at all. </p>
<p>Under the provisions of MCCA, all countable resources held by either  		spouse are now totalled, and then divided equally. Half must be used to pay for  		the recipient's nursing home care prior to Medicaid coverage, and half remain  		with the community spouse--subject to both minimum and maximum amounts. In  		1993, the community spouse was allowed to retain at least $14,148 of the total.  		At their option, States may raise this minimum to as high as $70,740. In  		January 1991, 30 States had elected to protect a minimum of $13,296 for a  		community spouse, 16 States had opted for a minimum of $66,480, and 5 States  		had selected protection levels somewhere in-between.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Under the MCCA, community spouses of Medicaid recipients in nursing  		homes are also guaranteed to receive a protected amount of the  		institutionalized spouse's income. In 1993, this income amount, known as the  		Minimum Monthly Maintenance Needs Allowance (MMMNA) is set at a minimum of  		$1,149 per month (150 percent of the Federal poverty level for a couple).  		States may set higher protected income levels for community spouses if they so  		choose--up to $1,769 per month in 1993. In 1991, 21 States had established such  		higher income levels. </p>
<p>Once a nursing home recipient is determined eligible for Medicaid, and  		income for a remaining community spouse is allocated (if applicable) then the  		Medicaid recipient is required to contribute almost all of his or her income to  		the cost of nursing home care. For example, let us assume that a Medicaid  		recipient has no living spouse and monthly income of $724. The recipient is  		required to contribute all income in excess of a <b>personal needs  		allowance</b> and other eligible deductions towards the cost of his or her  		care. In 1993, the minimum personal needs allowance was $30 per month. States  		are allowed to establish higher personal needs allowances, but most do  		not.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note12">12</a></font></sup> Assuming a  		personal needs allowance of $30, the recipient in the example above would be  		required to pay to the nursing home all income above that amount, or $694  		towards the cost of their care. The nursing home provider would then bill the  		State Medicaid program for the balance between the monthly Medicaid  		reimbursement rate and the recipient's contribution. </p>
<p>In determining the recipient's contribution to the cost of care, certain  		other deductions may be taken. For example, if an individual without a spouse  		still retains a principal residence, then funds can be deducted for the costs  		of maintaining the home (e.g. property taxes and maintenance expenses). Also,  		the recipient may deduct other out-of-pocket medical expenses that are not  		covered by Medicare or Medicaid. </p>
<h3>Medicaid Transfer of Asset Provisions</h3>
<p>Medicaid coverage is generally only available to persons who have less  		than $2,000 in financial assets. Because the cost of paying for nursing home  		care with private funds is so high, it is known that some individuals attempt  		to divest or shelter their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid-financed  		nursing home care without having to spend their private assets first.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note13">13</a></font></sup> Medicaid rules stipulate that  		persons who give away or sell assets for less than fair market value for the  		sole purpose of establishing eligibility for Medicaid can be denied  		eligibility. These rules apply to assets which are given away or sold for less  		than fair market value for up to 36 months prior to application for Medicaid  		coverage. </p>
<p>There are a variety of "legal" strategies which can be used to establish  		Medicaid eligibility for nursing home coverage. Indeed, some attorneys have  		specialized in protecting estates from the prospect of being depleted by high  		nursing home costs through "estate planning" for Medicaid coverage.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note14">14</a></font></sup> For example, one simple  		strategy is to convert "countable" assets, such as savings and securities, into  		"exempt" assets, such as home equity, by paying off a mortgage or doing a major  		home renovation. By using these strategies, assets that would otherwise have to  		be used to pay for nursing home care can be protected, and individuals can  		qualify for Medicaid coverage sooner than they otherwise would.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Medicaid Expenditures for Institutional Care</h3>
<p>In fiscal year 1992, State Medicaid programs paid more than $20.1  		billion for institutional long-term care for recipients over the age of  		65.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note16">16</a></font></sup> This figure  		includes $2.1 billion in Medicaid payments for the aged in intermediate care  		facilities (ICFs) for the mentally retarded, as well as Nursing Facilities  		(NFs).<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Medicaid expenditures for elderly persons in NFs increased from $6.6  		billion in 1980 to $18.0 billion in 1992, an average annual rate of growth of  		8.7%, as shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure3">Figure 3</a>. In 1992, Medicaid spending  		for elderly nursing home care exceeded Medicare SNF expenditures by a ratio of  		approximately six to one. </p>
<p>However, the number of elderly nursing home recipients on Medicaid per  		capita has actually declined slightly in recent years, as shown in  		<a href="fedstes.htm#figure4">Figure 4</a>. Elderly persons in nursing homes receiving  		Medicaid coverage dropped from 457 per 10,000 elderly in 1980 to 418 per 10,000  		in 1992, a decline of 8.5 percent.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note18">18</a></font></sup> This decline may be partly due to an overall  		decline in nursing home utilization rates, and/or to the fact that a lower  		proportion of nursing home users are qualifying for Medicaid  		coverage.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Medicaid spending for nursing home care for  		persons over the age of 65 accounts for a declining proportion of total  		Medicaid spending, as shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure5">Figure 5</a>. In 1980,  		Medicaid payments for nursing home care for persons over the age of 65  		accounted for 32 percert of total Medicaid expenditures. In 1992, they  		accounted for 22 percent. </p>
<h3>Other Public Nursing Home Spending</h3>
<p>In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, a few other public programs also  		pay for nursing home care. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates  		about 117 nursing facilities of its own, generally located in VA medical  		centers. In 1988, these homes served an average daily census of about 7,100  		residents over the age of 65. In addition, the VA pays the cost of nursing home  		care for certain veterans in non-VA nursing homes. Total spending for veterans  		over the age of 65 in nursing homes under both of these programs was  		approximately $590 million in FY 1988.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition, some States finance nursing home care for certain elderly  		individuals outside the structure of their Medicaid programs. For example, the  		State of Arizona has only recently begun to claim Federal reimbursement for  		long-term care services under a special demonstration program that serves as an  		alternative to Medicaid. Prior to the demonstration, the financing of nursing  		home care for the indigent elderly in Arizona fell to county governments.  		Alaska, Delaware and Massachusetts are other States which still finance some  		institutional long-term care services with all-State funds, outside the  		Medicaid program. </p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="home" id="home">HOME CARE SERVICES ARE FINANCED BY MULTIPLE FUNDING  		SOURCES</a> </h2>
<p>Unlike the financing of nursing home care, where Medicaid accounts for  		over 77 percent of all public spending, public support of home care services  		for the disabled elderly is distributed across numerous payment sources at the  		Federal, State and local levels. In addition, even <b>within</b> specific  		funding programs, such as Medicaid, criteria for allocating public resources  		for home care services are highly diverse across States, and even sometimes  		within States. In brief, a major characteristic of the public financing system  		for home care services is its <b>lack</b> of uniformity across States, regions,  		programs, and target populations. </p>
<h3>Public Spending for Home Care is Much Less than for  		Nursing Home Care</h3>
<p>As was shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a>, public programs spent  		about $15.3 billion for home care services to persons over the age of 65 in  		1993, compared to the $30.3 billion in public spending for nursing home care.  		Thus, spending for home care services comprised about one-third of total public  		spending for long-term care in 1993. </p>
<p>This distribution between spending for nursing home care and home care  		is also reflected in the private sector. Only about 16 percent of all private  		spending for long-term care is used to purchase home care; 84 percent is used  		to purchase nursing home care. </p>
<h3>Medicare Home Health Benefits</h3>
<p>The Medicare home health benefit pays for nursing care; physical,  		occupational, or speech therapy; medical social services; home health aide  		services; and durable medical equipment and supplies for Medicare beneficiaries  		who meet the benefit criteria. To meet these criteria, an individual must be  		certified by a physician as in need of skilled nursing services on an  		"intermittent" (as opposed to continuous) basis. Medicare home health  		recipients must also be "homebound," meaning that they have a condition that  		restricts their ability to leave home, except with the assistance of another  		person or the aid of a supportive device. </p>

</tr></table><p>Expenditures for Medicare home health care services for beneficiaries  		over the age of 65 totalled $6.6 billion in 1992. Expenditures have increased  		at an annual rate of growth of 25.4 percent since 1980, as shown in  		<a href="fedstes.htm#figure6">Figure 6</a>. Unlike public spending for nursing home care,  		in which Medicare plays a relatively minor role, Medicare spending for home  		health care services exceeds Medicaid spending for home care services. Medicare  		expenditures for home health care are also increasing at a much faster rate  		than Medicaid expenditures for home health services. The exact causes for this  		rapid increase in Medicare home health expenditures are not clear, but there is  		some belief that the fundamental nature of the Medicare home health beneift has  		changed from its historical post-acute and rehabilitative role to a more  		chronic care service. </p>
<p>Although Medicare is a Federally-financed program that is uniformly  		administered nationwide, studies have shown that utilization rates of  		Medicare-financed home health care services vary from region to  		region.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note21">21</a></font></sup> For example,  		the likelihood of using Medicare-financed home care in 1985 was about 40  		percent higher in New England than in other regions of the country, all other  		factors being equal. </p>
<h3>Medicaid Financing of Home Care Services Varies Across  		States</h3>
<p>The financing of home care services under the Medicaid program occurs  		primarily under three different coverage options in State Medicaid plans: (1)  		home health care services; (2) personal care services; and (3) home and  		community-based waiver services. Home health care services are a mandatory  		service, meaning that all States are required to cover home health services for  		certain groups of Medicaid enrollees. Personal care services, and home and  		community-based waiver services, on the other hand, are optional services,  		meaning that States may elect to provide coverage for these services, but are  		not required to do so. </p>
<p>Medicaid <b>home health services</b> are generally services provided by  		a Medicare-certified home health agency, and are usually the same set of  		services provided under the Medicare home health care benefit (i.e. skilled  		services) although State Medicaid programs may have different rules on the  		amount, duration, and scope of coverage than Medicare, and may pay different  		rates. For example, while Medicare will only pay for home health services on an  		intermittent basis to persons who are recovering from an acute illness,  		Medicaid home health services may be used to pay for skilled care for patients  		who have chronic conditions that require continuous treatment. </p>
<p><b>Personal care services</b> are semi-skilled or non-skilled services  		provided to Medicaid beneficiaries who need assistance with basic Activities of  		Daily Living (ADLs) in their own home. Personal care providers are generally  		non-licensed individuals who provide disabled elderly individuals with help in  		bathing, grooming, dressing, housekeeping, toileting, and other basic living  		activities. They may be employed by a community agency, or they may work under  		direct contract to the State Medicaid agency. Federal regulations defining  		reimbursable personal care services are relatively broad, and only stipulate  		that they be: </p>
<ul><li>Prescribed by a physician; </li>
<li>Provided under a written plan of treatment; </li>
<li>Provided by a qualified individual; </li>
<li>Supervised by a registered nurse; and </li>
<li>Provided by someone who is not a member of the recipient's family.  		  </li>
</ul><p>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 modified Medicaid coverage  		of personal care services by expanding the definition of personal care to  		include services provided outside the recipient's home. This modification will  		allow a personal care provider to also be paid for shopping, transportation, or  		for other services provided outside the home. This provision will not take  		effect in all States until FY 1995. </p>
<p>As of October 1991, 28 States provided personal care services as an  		optional benefit under their State Medicaid plans.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note22">22</a></font></sup> Spending for personal care services accounts  		for the majority of total spending for home care services under Medicaid, as  		shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure7">Figure 7</a>. Of the approximately $4.7 billion  		spent for home care services under Medicaid for the elderly in 1991, about $2.1  		billion was spent under the personal care services option. However, spending  		for personal care services is also highly skewed across States. Six  		States--Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York, Michigan, Texas, and  		Oklahoma--account for over 95 percent of all personal care spending for the  		elderly. New York alone accounts for over 80 percent.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Home and community-based waiver</b> services were first authorized  		under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981. Home and  		community-based waiver services are not Medicaid State plan options, since  		coverage of these services requires a separate application to the Health Care  		Financing Administration (HCFA). </p>

</tr></table><p>The Medicaid home and community-based waiver program allows States to  		cover a broad array of non-medical community-based services that otherwise  		cannot be covered by State Medicaid plans under Federal law. These services can  		be covered <b>only if</b> the States demonstrate to HCFA that such coverage is  		cost-effective. States must demonstrate to HCFA that spending for home and  		community-based waiver services will be offset by reduced expenditures for  		nursing home care of at least an equal amount. Persons receiving services under  		home and community-based care waivers must meet the same level of care criteria  		that are used by States to certify Medicaid coverage for nursing home care.  		Limits are also placed on the number of individuals who may receive home and  		community-based waiver services annually in order to maintain  		cost-effectiveness. </p>
<p>Typical services provided by States under home and community-based  		waiver programs include case management, non-medical day care, personal care  		services, non-medical transportation, homemaker services, and respite care.  		Although some of these services can be offered under regular State Medicaid  		plans, the waiver program also allows States to provide these services under  		alternative regulatory requirements than are applied to regular State plan  		services. For example, a State may limit home health care services to two  		visits per week under its regular Medicaid program, but allow a higher number  		of visits for home and community-based waiver recipients. Or a State may  		provide personal care services under a waiver program without a requirement  		that these services be authorized by a physician, allocating that authority to  		professional case managers instead. </p>
<p>As of December 1991, 40 States operated one or more waiver programs for  		aged and physically disabled Medicaid enrollees.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note24">24</a></font></sup> Spending for all home and community-based  		waiver programs grew rapidly in the 1980s, reaching $1.6 billion in 1991, but  		spending for waiver programs that target the disabled elderly accounted for  		only about 32 percent of the total. The majority of Medicaid spending for home  		and community-based waiver services (64 percent) is for children and adults  		with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. </p>
<p>In OBRA 1990, Congress enacted a new Medicaid provision (Section 4711)  		that allows States to provide home and community-based services, like services  		provided under the Medicaid waiver program, as a State option. Although States  		electing to use this option will not have to make a special application to HCFA  		to provide these services, and will also not have to demonstrate the  		cost-effectiveness of these services, the circumstances under which these  		services can be provided as a regular State option are quite proscriptive. To  		date, only the state of Texas has elected to use this new benefit option in its  		Medicaid program. </p>
<p>As shown in <a href="fedstes.htm#figure6">Figure 6</a>, total Medicaid spending for  		home health care services for the elderly is increasing rapidly, exceeding  		annual rates of growth of 20 percent throughout the 1980s. Spending for home  		health care services to elderly Medicaid recipients was about $2.3 billion in  		1992. Nonetheless, Medicaid spending for home and community-based services is  		increasing at a far lower rate than Medicare home health spending. </p>
<h3>Older Americans Act Programs</h3>
<p>Under Title III of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, the  		Administration on Aging allocates Federal grants to States for the development  		of comprehensive and coordinated community-based systems of services for the  		elderly. The objectives of Older Americans Act programs are: (1) to help older  		persons to secure and maintain maximum independence and dignity in a home  		environment; (2) remove barriers to independence for older persons; and (3)  		provide a continuum of care for the vulnerable elderly. Federal Title III funds  		are allotted to State Agencies on Aging, which in turn allocate funds  		throughout each State to local Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) which make  		provisions for the delivery of services within their respective planning and  		service areas. </p>
<p>Federal funding for Title III programs is capped at an annual  		appropriation level and requires matching funds from grantees at a 25 percent  		rate for program administration and a 15 percent rate for program activities.  		The grantees' matching share may be either in cash or in-kind. In FY 1989,  		Federal appropriations for the Title III program equalled $715.5 million. </p>
<p>All persons over the age of 60 are eligible for Title III-funded  		services, without means-testing. However, particular focus in allocating  		resources is placed on the most vulnerable elderly, meaning those persons with  		the greatest economic and social needs. Although Title III regulations prohibit  		means-testing, the program allows participants the opportunity to contribute  		toward the cost of services they receive. In FY 1989, approximately $179  		million in voluntary contributions were received by AOA program  		providers.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p><a href="fedstes.htm#figure8">Figure 8</a> presents the distribution of Federal  		Title III expenditures, by type of expenditure, in FY 1991. Supportive  		services, which include information and referral, transportation, employment  		services, legal assistance, counseling, health education and screening, home  		repairs and maintenance, and in-home services such as homemakers or home health  		aides, account for about 35 percent of total program expenditures. Fifty-three  		percent of all program funds in FY 1991 ($447.6 million) were used for  		nutrition services. Congregate nutrition services--meals provided in settings  		such as senior citizen centers, adult day care programs, and elderly housing  		projects--accounted for $360 million of this amount, while home-delivered meals  		(the well-known Meals-on-Wheels program) accounted for $87.6 million.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Under the Older Americans Act, States are also required to establish and  		operate an Office of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, whose purpose it is to  		monitor the quality of care provided to disabled elderly persons in nursing  		homes and to investigate complaints made by nursing home recipients about the  		services they receive. In FY 1991, approximately $2.4 million in Title III  		funds were allocated to these programs. Many States provide additional funding  		of their own. </p>
<p>The 1987 amendments to the Older Americans Act targeted the first funds  		to provide in-home services for frail older individuals. These amendments  		marked the first time that Title III funds were specifically targeted to  		elderly individuals who are dependent in daily activities. Program expenditures  		under this component of the Older Americans Act totalled $6.8 million in FY  		1991. </p>
<p>Older Americans Act programs make an important contribution to the  		publicly-financed home care system by supporting an infrastructure through  		which home care resources can be coordinated. State Agencies on Aging and local  		Area Agencies on Aging are generally not in the business of funding or  		providing direct home care services for the disabled elderly. Their primary  		role is to serve as a central information and referral source for all elderly  		persons seeking help for their long-term care needs. Many AAAs are formalizing  		their roles as providers of case management services for the disabled elderly,  		becoming the main access points, gatekeepers, care planners, and service  		monitors of publicly-financed home care programs. </p>
<h3>The Social Services Block Grant</h3>
<p>Title XX Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds are allocated to the  		states on the basis of population. Total Federal funding under the SSBG was  		$2.8 billion in 1993. States are no longer required to provide any matching  		funds for the Federal dollars they receive through SSI3G. SSBG funds are not  		specifically intended to be a financing source for home care services. States  		have broad authority to spend their SSBG allocations on a wide array of social  		services, of which home care for the disabled elderly is only one. Since  		reporting requirements on how States spend their SSBG allocations are minimal,  		reliable estimates of the amount of SSBG funds allocated to home care services  		for the disabled elderly are lacking.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note27">27</a></font></sup> Nonetheless, the data which are available  		indicate that many States do use SSBG funds to augment home care programs  		financed by other sources. </p>
<p>At least 38 States used some portion of their SSBG funds to support home  		and community-based services for the frail elderly in 1986.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note28">28</a></font></sup> Estimated allocations for home  		care services totalled $375 million, about 15 percent of the total Federal SSBG  		allocation of $2.6 billion in that year. However, over 50 percent of this SSBG  		spending for home care was made by the State of California alone, which used  		$195 million of its SSBG allocation to fund its In-Home Supportive Services  		program, a broad home and community-based services program for the elderly and  		physically disabled. Other States that use significant portions of their SSBG  		allocations (more than 10 percent) to finance home care services include  		Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. </p>
<h3>Department of Veterans Affairs Home Care Progrms</h3>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates a range of programs for  		disabled veterans living at home or in alternative residential care facilities.  		About 78 VA medical centers operate home care programs that provide primary  		medical care and supportive services to veterans in their own homes. The VA  		also operates a small number of adult day care centers, a community residential  		program for about 11,000 veterans, a respite care program, and an Aid and  		Attendance program, which provides pension supplements to low-income veterans  		living in the community who require help with activities in daily living, or to  		spouses or parents of veterans who are similarly impaired, and a Senior  		Companion Program. </p>
<h3>Home Care Services Funded Out of State General  		Revenues</h3>
<p>Adding to the complexity of multiple Federal funding streams for home  		care is the fact that many States support their own home care programs with  		general revenue funds. The majority of State funds spent on home care are used  		for State matching requirements under Medicaid and the Older Americans Act  		programs.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note29">29</a></font></sup> However,  		most States also provide additional funding for home care above and beyond  		these Federal matching requirements. This additional financing is generally  		expended in one or more of the following ways: (1) supplemental funding of  		Social Services Block Grant programs and/or OAA programs; (2) special State  		Supplementation Payments to Federal SSI benefits targeted to elderly persons  		with long-term care needs and/or living in supervised residential settings,  		such as board and care homes; and (3) "stand-alone" programs which provide home  		and community-based services to eligible elderly persons. </p>
<p>A survey of all fifty States estimated that total State-only spending  		for home and community-based services and special State supplements to Federal  		SSI benefits totalled approximately $770 million in FY 1986.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note30">30</a></font></sup> This exceeded the amount spent  		by States for matching requirements under Medicaid and Older Americans Act  		Programs. Given the wide variation across States in both the level of public  		support for long-term care, and in the financing and program structures through  		which this support is provided, Sections 3.6 and 3.7 of this chapter discuss  		State variation in the financing of long-term care services more directly. </p>
<h2><a name="cost" id="cost">COST CONTAINMENT IN THE LONG-TERM CARE SYSTEM</a> </h2>
<p>Numerous mechanisms are employed in the Medicare and Medicaid programs  		to constrain the rate of growth in public expenditures for long-term care. In  		Medicare, long-term care spending is controlled primarily by policies to  		maintain the boundary between the acute care orientation of Medicare benefits,  		and custodial care. Medicare coverage of nursing home and home care services  		generally ends when a "spell of illness" is completed. Although is it is often  		difficult to ascertain exactly when a "spell of illness" is over, Medicare's  		primary cost containment mechanism in long-term care is to maintain its  		orientation towards coverage of acute illness. The high copayment rate ($84.50  		in 1993) for Medicare SNF coverage after the 21st day of coverage also serves  		as a significant cost containment mechanism. </p>
<p>Since Medicaid is jointly administered by the Federal government and the  		States, both entities participate in efforts to control costs. As under  		Medicare, the Federal government's primary cost containment mechanism in  		Medicaid has been to define the boundaries of Medicaid-covered benefits. In  		other words, Federal Medicaid policy defines what types of services are or are  		not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement, and therefore Federal Financial  		Participation (FFP). </p>
<p>Although the boundary of Medicaid-covered services is considerably  		broader than under Medicare (Medicaid coverage definitely includes custodial  		care and other long-term care services related to chronic conditions) Medicaid  		policy still limits coverage to "medically-oriented" services. For example,  		Federal Medicaid policy has historically limited coverage of more  		socially-oriented services, such as homemaker services, case management,  		housing modifications, meal preparation, and non-medical transportation. More  		recently, however, these services have become increasingly eligible for  		Medicaid coverage under the Home and Community-Based Waiver Program and other  		Medicaid program options. </p>
<p>State Medicaid programs employ a number of strategies to contain the  		growth in long-term care costs. Limiting the overall supply of nursing home  		beds has been found to be one effective strategy for controlling Medicaid  		nursing home expenditures; Certificate of Need programs, and statewide  		moratoria on the construction of. new nursing home beds, are common strategies.  		Many States have resorted to these controls on supply after coming to the  		conclusion that other strategies to contain nursing home costs were not as  		effective. Many States feel that "a bed built is a bed filled." Limits on the  		supply of nursing home beds obviously raise questions about whether access to  		nursing home care is also being inappropriately restricted, however. </p>
<p>Other cost containment mechanisms used by States include: </p>
<ul><li> Financial criteria for Medicaid eligibility, including the relative  		  restrictiveness with which States enforce prohibitions on transfers of assets  		  and the circumstances under which home equity is included as a countable  		  resource; </li>
<li> Functional ("level of care") criteria for Medicaid coverage in  		  nursing homes, including the use of nursing home pre-admission screening  		  programs to determine whether applicants meet Medicaid criteria prior to  		  nursing home entry; </li>
<li> Medicaid payment levels for nursing home care, as well as the  		  methodologies used in setting rates and paying providers, such as prospective  		  payment and case-mix reimbursement methods; </li>
<li> State development of alternative service options for persons in need  		  of intensive levels of care, including adult foster care, assisted living  		  facilities, and home and community-based care programs targeted to high risk  		  individuals. </li>
<li> Efforts to maximize the participation of family members and other  		  informal caregivers in the provision of care, including actively including  		  family members in the care planning process, supporting respite care programs,  		  and caregiving education programs. </li>
</ul><p>Last, but not least, several States, such as Oregon and Washington, are  		involved in efforts to dramatically restructure their entire long-term care  		service delivery systems. A common thread in these restructuring strategies has  		been the consolidation of financing and delivery systems into more streamlined,  		coordinated, and efficient administrative structures. </p>
<h2><a name="federal" id="federal">FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY EFFORTS TO ASSURE  		QUALITY</a> </h2>
<p>Public payers of long-term care services continually face the challenge  		of assuring the quality of services being purchased with taxpayer dollars. This  		focus of this report is on the financing of long-term care services, partly due  		to the fact that major policy initiatives aimed at improving the quality of  		publicly-financed long-term care have been recently implemented, particularly  		under the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.  		Nonetheless, discussions of Federal and State spending for long-term care  		services must always be presented in the context of what is being bought with  		these public dollars. Regulatory mechanisms are the primary means by which  		public payers ensure that the services they buy meet minimum standards of care.  		</p>
<p>Nursing homes which receive reimbursements from Medicare and/or Medicaid  		must meet Federal and State certification requirements. Compliance of  		Medicaid-certified nursing facilities and Medicare-certified skilled nursing  		facilities with regulatory standards is assessed, on average, every 12 months  		through surveys conducted by State agencies. The Federal government also  		conducts its own surveys to determine the validity of State assessments. The  		surveys examine, at a minimum, the following dimensions: (1) quality of care;  		(2) residents' assessments and plans of care; and (3) compliance with patients'  		rights. </p>
<p>Noncompliance with, certification standards can result in the imposition  		of various remedies, including directed plans of correction, denial of payment  		for new admissions, civil monetary penalties (CMPs), temporary takeover of  		management, enhanced State monitoring and/or termination of certification. The  		Federal government can also reduce its contribution to State administrative  		costs when State survey performance is found to be deficient. In 1991, there  		were 15,175 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing facilities. During the  		period from October 1990 to September 1991, 35 homes were involuntarily  		terminated from the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs for noncompliance with  		quality of care standards. </p>
<p>The process of determining the compliance of Medicare-certified Home  		Health Agencies (HHAs) with certification standards is similar to the nursing  		home survey process outlined above. Additionally, home visits to Medicare  		beneficiaries may be conducted with the consent of the beneficiary.  		Medicaid-certified HHAs must meet Medicare requirements. </p>
<p>The quality of other Medicaid-financed home care services, such as  		personal care services and home and community-based care waiver services, are  		less regulated by the Federal government. States are required to develop their  		own standards for these services, and provide assurances to the Federal  		government that these standards are being implemented, but there is no minimum  		Federal standard that must be met, other than that all providers must be  		"certified." All recipients of home and community-based waiver services must  		also have access to case management services. </p>
<p>As with financing policy, a major issue in regulating the quality of  		care produced by providers of publicly-financed long-term care services is the  		level of involvement which the Federal government should have in establishing  		and enforcing standards. Historically, the Federal government has taken a more  		active role in the establishment of quality of care provisions for the elderly,  		and less involvement in quality of care standards for the non-elderly disabled.  		This distinction is evident in the new community care benefits enacted under  		the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) which specifies  		detailed standards for community services provided to the elderly, but relies  		on State standards for services provided to the developmentally disabled. </p>

<p>Far more than the Federal government, States have the lead role in  		formulating, financing and implementing long-term care policy. While the  		Federal government participates in the financing of long-term care services  		through Medicaid and other programs, most of the policy decisions that  		determine both the level and character of public assistance for elderly persons  		with disabilities are made at the State level. As a consequence, long-term care  		systems vary considerably across States. This section, and the one which  		follows, discuss how States vary in their financing of both nursing home care  		and home care services for the disabled elderly. </p>
<h3>Nursing Home Use and Expenditures Vary Greatly Across  		States</h3>
<p>Although Medicaid is an "entitlement" program, this does not mean that  		poor elderly persons are equally served in all States. <a href="fedstes.htm#table1">Table  		1</a> presents selected data on interstate variation in nursing home supply,  		utilization, payment levels, and public expenditures for nursing home care. The  		table underscores the wide variation that exists across States. </p>
<p>The supply of nursing home beds per 1,000 elderly State residents vanes  		dramatically across the fifty States (first column of <a href="fedstes.htm#table1">Table  		1</a>). In 1992, nationwide, there were 53.1 beds per 1,000 persons age 65 and  		over. At the State level, the number of nursing home beds ranged from 24.4 per  		thousand enrollees in Nevada to 86.2 per thousand in Nebraska, a difference of  		253 percent. </p>
<p>States with relatively low supplies of nursing home beds (less than 40  		beds per 1,000 elderly) include Nevada, Hawaii, Florida, Arizona, West  		Virginia, Oregon, New Mexico, and South Carolina. However, a low ratio of  		nursing beds to the size of the elderly population is not necessarily an  		indicator that there are too few nursing home beds in a specific State. This is  		because some States, like Florida, have made extensive use of use  		board-and-care facilities which serve many disabled elderly who in other States  		would be cared for in ICF-level nursing homes. States with the highest supply  		of nursing home beds (more than 75 beds per 1,000 elderly) include Iowa,  		Indiana, Minnesota, Louisiana, Nebraska, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota,  		Kansas, and Oklahoma. </p>
<p>One factor influencing the supply of nursing home beds is whether States  		have Certificate of Need programs that require prior approval for new bed  		development from local and/or State agencies. In 1992, 38 States plus the  		District of Columbia had Certificate of Need programs for nursing homes, while  		12 States did not. </p>
<p>The second and third columns of <a href="fedstes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> present  		data on the number of elderly persons receiving Medicaid-financed nursing home  		care in 1992 and the number of elderly Medicaid recipients in nursing homes per  		1,000 elderly population. Nationwide, 41.8 elderly persons per 1,000 population  		(i.e. about 4 percent of all elderly persons) received Medicaid-financed  		nursing home care care in 1992. Utilization rates ranged from 19.9 per 1,000 in  		Nevada to 67.8 per 1,000 in Connecticut (excluding Rhode Island).<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note31">31</a></font></sup> Moreover, it is important to  		recognize that the relationship between Medicaid utilization rates and overall  		bed supply is far from perfect. For example, Illinois has a relatively high  		supply of nursing home beds, but a relatively low Medicaid utilization rate.  		</p>
<p>Columns four through seven in <a href="fedstes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> present  		State-level data on Medicaid expenditures for nursing home care. Average annual  		Medicaid payments per nursing home recipient are determined by three major  		factors: (1) Medicaid reimbursement rates; (2) average length-of-stay; and (3)  		patient contributions to the cost of care. Average Medicaid payments per  		recipient ranged from $783 per year in Arizona to $35,745 per year in Alaska.  		Both of these figures should be interpreted with caution, however. The nursing  		home expenditure amounts for Arizona are extremely low relative to other  		states. And Alaska is atypical because of its very high reimbursement rates  		($217.19 per day). Excluding Arizona and Alaska, average Medicaid payments for  		nursing home care ranged from $3,707 in Utah to $31,199 in New York. The  		average payment nationally was $14,889. Average daily Medicaid reimbursement  		rates for nursing facility care (excluding Alaska) ranged from $49 per day in  		Arkansas to $127 per day in the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>A good summary statistic for comparing State Medicaid spending for  		nursing home care is presented in Column 6, which shows annual Medicaid  		spending for nursing home care per elderly State resident in 1992. In that  		year, Medicaid programs spent an average of $623 per elderly State resident for  		nursing home care. However, excluding Arizona, there was a greater than  		fifteen-fold difference in per capita expenditures across States, from a low of  		$88 per capita in Utah to a high of $1,382 per capita in Connecticut. The  		States with the highest rate of expenditures per capita (greater than $1,000)  		Were New York, Alaska, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New  		Hampshire, and the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>In summary, the level of public support for Medicaid-financed nursing  		home care varies significantly from State to State. Medicaid spending for  		nursing home care varies four-fold from the highest spending States to the  		lowest spending States. Despite lower rates of poverty, wealthier States spend  		more for Medicaid-financed nursing home care than poorer States. This is  		because Medicaid spending for nursing home care is affected by a number of  		factors, including overall bed supply, Medicaid eligibility and functional  		criteria for nursing home coverage, length-of-stay patterns of Medicaid  		recipients in nursing homes, and Medicaid payment rates. </p>
<h3>Trends in Nursing Home Bed Capacity</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, the supply of nursing home beds has remained  		stable, relative to growth in the elderly population.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note32">32</a></font></sup> The total number of certified nursing home  		beds per thousand elderly was 53.31 in 1980 and 53.1 in 1992. Occupany rates in  		nursing homes have also remained relatively stable in recent years, although  		the average occupancy rate in nursing homes is high, at 90 percent in  		1991.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note33">33</a></font></sup> Interestingly,  		nursing home occupany rates do not appear to be related to the number of  		nursing home beds per aged population.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note34">34</a></font></sup> Occupancy rates are highest in the  		northeastern States and lowest in the western States. </p>
<h3>Is There a Nursing Home Access Problem?</h3>
<p>Many people have expressed concern that Medicaid recipients do not have  		the same access to nursing homes as people who pay privately. Another concern  		has been whether nursing homes discriminate against admitting patients with  		heavier care needs, because they consume more resources, and are ultimately  		"less profitable" to care for. The evidence on whether these are serious  		problems is mixed, although there is considerable evidence that there are  		access problems for some patients in some areas. </p>
<p>Several studies have shown that hospital discharge delays and the  		probability of nursing home placement are statistically related to nursing home  		bed supply.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note35">35</a></font></sup> Although  		researchers report mixed results, both quantitative and qualitative studies  		suggest that Medicaid patients and patients with heavy care needs in hospitals  		experience longer delays waiting for nursing home placement than private pay  		patients and patients with lighter care needs. </p>
<p>It has often been hypothesized that Medicaid patients in States with  		lower Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing home care have more difficulty  		gaining access to nursing homes than States with more generous Medicaid payment  		rates, but research has shown only small effects. Nursing home bed supply  		appears to have a stronger effect on access to nursing homes for Medicaid  		patients than reimbursement rates. There may be a trade-off between  		restrictions on supply and Medicaid rates. Medicaid patients in States with low  		bed supplies may have more severe access problems, leading to pressures to  		raise Medicaid payment rates. States with higher bed supplies may show higher  		Medicaid utilization levels, but there may be less pressure to increase payment  		rates to ensure access. Further research on the complex relationships between  		nursing home bed supply, Medicaid policies, patient characteristics, and access  		to nursing home care is still needed. </p>
<h2><a name="finance" id="finance">STATE VARIATION IN THE FINANCING OF HOME CARE</a>  		</h2>
<p>As with the public financing of nursing home, the financing of home care  		varies across States. However, accurate data on aggregate State spending for  		home care services is difficult to obtain. For one, States use multiple  		financing sources to provide home care services for the disabled elderly, as  		will be discussed further later on. Second, many home care programs serve both  		persons over the age of 65 with functional impairments, and persons with  		disabilities under age 65, and many States cannot disaggregate utilization and  		expenditure data by age groups. Nonetheless, the data that are available make  		it readily apparent that State spending for publicly-financed home care varies  		at least as much as spending for nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>For example, as previously reported, the State of New York alone  		accounts for about 64 percent of all Medicaid spending for home care services  		to the disabled elderly. If all States provided publicly-financed home care at  		the same level that New York does, total Medicaid home care spending for  		elderly Medicaid recipients would have been over $5.8 billion in FY 1992,  		instead of the $2.2 billion that was actually spent.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Alternative Financing Mechanisms</h3>
<p>The manner in which publicly-financed home care services are funded  		varies greatly across the States, and the election of different funding  		mechanisms have different programmatic implications. As previously discussed,  		Medicaid funding of home care services falls under three major service  		categories: (1) personal care services; (2) home health care services; and (3)  		home and community-based waiver services. Although 30 States cover personal  		care services in their Medicaid benefit package, aggregate personal care  		spending is concentrated in only a few States. </p>
<p>While Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver Programs have become a  		popular financing mechanism for non-skilled home care services, the size of  		these programs has been limited by their need to meet the statutory test of  		cost-effectiveness. Oregon is the only State that uses the waiver program as a  		major source of funding for home care. Under a modification to the original  		legislation (Section 1915[d]), Oregon has no restrictions on Medicaid financing  		of waiver services, as long as <b>total</b> Medicaid spending for long-term  		care (nursing home care plus home care) stays under a fixed budget amount.  		Expenditures over this amount are not eligible for Federal Financial  		Participation. </p>
<p>Other States elect not to use Medicaid as the primary funding source for  		home care services, and rely on other funding mechanisms instead. One option is  		for States is to use their allocations under the Social Services Block Grant  		(SSBG) to fund home care services for the disabled elderly. California is the  		prime example--it uses virtually all of its Federal SSBG allocation to fund its  		In-Home Supportive Services, a broad-based program that funds home care  		services for both elderly and non-elderly persons with functional disabilities.  		In addition to its Federal allocation, California overmatches its SSBG funds  		with its own State revenues to support the program. Other States that use a  		significant percentage of their SSBG allocations to support home care services  		include Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia  		and Washington. </p>
<p>Texas combines Federal SSBG funds and Medicaid personal care funds in  		its large in-home care program. Medicaid personal care funds are used for those  		clients who meet Medicaid eligibility criteria, while SSBG funds are used for  		those who are not. The services provided are essentially the same. </p>
<p>Some States do not use many Federal resources at all to finance home  		care for the elderly disabled; they simply invest their own resources to  		operate programs outside the constraints that go along with the use of Federal  		funds. These States include Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, Washington,  		Colorado, Pennsylvania and Utah. For example, Massachusetts spends over $100  		million annually of State general revenue funds on its statewide Home Care  		Program. </p>
<p>In some cases, State general revenue funds are used in conjunction with  		other funding sources. For example, Minnesota's Alternative Care Grants (ACG)  		program for the elderly is primarily funded under the Medicaid home and  		community-based waiver program, but State general revenue funds are used to pay  		for services to clients who are not eligible for Medicaid, but who would  		spend-down to Medicaid within six months if they had to pay for services  		themselves. </p>
<p>While some States support home care programs, others elect simply to  		increase the incomes of elderly persons with disabilities, and to leave  		decisions about the use of these resources to the clients themselves (more akin  		to a voucher approach). This is usually accomplished through special State  		supplementation payments (SSP) to Federal SSI benefits. Elderly persons who  		meet certain disability and financial criteria, or who live in residential care  		facilities which reflect a need for long-term care services (i.e.  		board-and-care homes) receive State-financed cash payments that supplement the  		income they receive from the SSI program. States which have taken this "cash  		payment" approach to assisting the poor elderly with long-term care needs  		include California, Alabama, Colorado, Missouri, New York, North Carolina and  		Virginia. </p>
<h3>Do States that Spend More for Home Care Spend Less for  		Nursing Home Care?</h3>
<p>A frequent argument for expanding public funding for home care services  		has been to ameliorate the growth in public spending for nursing home care.  		However, support for this argument is illusive. In general, the opposite is  		true. States that have high expenditures for home care services per capita also  		tend to have high expenditures for Medicaid-financed nursing home care. Thus,  		although attempts are often made to classify States along a continuum of  		"institutionally-oriented" to "community-based oriented" long-term care  		systems, a more accurate classification of States is simply along a continuum  		of how much they spend in public dollars for long-term care in general. </p>
<p>There is mixed evidence regarding the relationship between spending for  		home care and nursing home care, however. While States that spend more for home  		care also tend to spend more for nursing home care, there does seem to be a  		relationship between <b>Medicare</b> home health care use and the supply of  		nursing homes. Research studies show that the number of Medicare enrollees  		using Medicare-financed home health care is higher in areas where there are  		fewer nursing home beds.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note38">38</a></font></sup> These studies suggest that Medicare home  		health care utilization may increase in areas where there is an excess demand  		for nursing home beds. </p>
<h3>Why Don't States Tap Medicaid More?</h3>
<p>Given the opportunity to leverage Federal resources under the financing  		structure of Medicaid, why don't States take more advantage of the financing  		options that are available under the Medicaid program? The Federal government  		pays for at least 50 percent of all Medicaid-financed services, and in some  		States up to 80 percent. The answer lies in the nature and intent of the  		Medicaid program and its inherent limitations as a financing source for home  		care. For example: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Medicaid's financial eligibility standards</b>. Only those  			 elderly who receive Federal SSI benefits and/or State supplementation payments  			 are generally eligible for Medicaid-financed care in the community.<sup><font><a href="fedstes.htm#note39">39</a></font></sup> Less than seven percent of the  			 elderly living in the community receive SSI/SSP benefits. Relatively low  			 protected income levels under State medically needy programs also make it  			 difficult for other poor elderly persons to participate in the program through  			 "spend-down" provisions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Restrictions on the number of persons who can be served under  			 Medicaid home and community-based care waiver programs</b>. By statute, States  			 can only provide home and community-based waiver services to persons who would  			 otherwise be at risk of placement -in nursing homes. Thus, individuals who  			 receive waiver services must meet nursing home level-of-care criteria. Persons  			 who are somewhat disabled, but do not meet nursing home criteria, are not  			 eligible for waiver services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medicaid coverage of non-skilled home care services is still  			 limited by Federal law</b>. Outside the Section 2176 home and community-based  			 waiver program, coverage of other home care services as Medicaid State plan  			 options is still limited. Optional services that can be used to fund  			 community-based care include: (1) personal care services; (2) private duty  			 nursing; (3) professional therapeutic services, such as physical therapy; and  			 (4) medical day care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Many States are concerned about their abilitV to control costs  			 for home care when funded as an "entitlement."</b> When States elect to cover  			 optional services under their State Medicaid plans, they are under certain  			 obligations not to arbitrarily restrict access to those services. For example,  			 States cannot arbitrarily deny payment for services simply because expenditures  			 have exceeded amounts appropriated in State budgets. The entitlement nature of  			 Medicaid gives Medicaid beneficiaries the right to sue States if services are  			 arbitrarily denied. Although there are numerous other mechanisms available to  			 States for managing costs, coverage of home care as an "entitlement" under  			 Medicaid is still perceived as risky fiscal policy by many States, particularly  			 given the popularity of these services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medicaid restricts Payments to family members as home care  			 providers</b>. Several States elect to use Medicaid as a funding source for  			 home care services because Medicaid policy generally does not allow family  			 members to be paid as home care providers. Some States, on the other hand,  			 would rather keep the option of paying family members as home care providers if  			 it is determined that a family member is the most appropriate choice for the  			 home care provider. Although States also place restrictions on the  			 circumstances under which family members can be paid with public funds as home  			 care providers, States can establish their own criteria when using their own  			 general revenue funds. Medicaid's restriction on payment to family members is  			 much more inflexible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>States differ in their perceptions of what can and cannot be done  			 under Medicaid</b>. Medicaid is an an extremely complex program. Some States  			 have not taken full advantage of the Medicaid options that are available simply  			 because they perceive that certain things cannot be done within the statutory  			 and regulatory provisions of the program, even though another State may be  			 using Medicaid exactly that way. Many States are also concerned about future  			 changes in Medicaid regulation that may render something they are currently  			 doing impermissible. In such cases, States would be faced with the option of  			 cutting services to clients who are presently in the program, or continuing to  			 fund services without Federal Financial Participation (FFP). </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In summary, funding of home care under Medicaid is generally restricted  		to the poor elderly who are eligible for cash assistance under the SSI/SSP  		program. Even among those elderly who are eligible for Medicaid, a number of  		barriers still exist to using Medicaid as a financing source for home care  		services. Consequently, many States prefer to use alternative mechanisms for  		financing their home care programs. </p>
<h2><a name="policy" id="policy">POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF STATE VARIATION IN LONG-TERM  		CARE FINANCING</a> </h2>
<p>An understanding of the State role in long-term care is key to  		evaluating the merits of potential Federal reforms, because reforms at the  		Federal level will affect all States differently. One key policy consideration  		is the balance between Federal control and State flexibility. Should  		publicly-financed long-term care benefits be made more uniformly available  		under a Federalized program? Or should States retain the flexibility which they  		currently exercise over the allocation of public resources for long-term care  		services, or even be given even greater discretionary authority than they  		currently have? And if the balance of authority shifts more toward the Federal  		government or to States, how would that impact the financing of services? For  		example, States may be less willing to help finance a system in which they have  		less control over how resources are used. </p>
<p>The Federal government presently plays a secondary role in shaping the  		publicly-financed long-term care system; States have the primary role. Federal  		resources for financing long-term care, particularly home care, are available  		under a variety of mechanisms that States can use as they choose. </p>
<p>This flexibility in Federal financing approaches has led to substantial  		variation across States in the level of public support for long-term care, Some  		States simply spend a lot more tax dollars (both Federal and State) for  		publicly-financed services than others. This contributes to significant  		variation across States in the degree to which the disabled elderly can access  		publicly-financed benefits, both in nursing homes and in the community. </p>
<p>Is this State variation desirable or undesirable? There are numerous  		trade-offs to consider. One perspective is that the Federal government should  		not dictate to States what public long-term care systems should be like. A  		uniform Federal program is not likely to reflect the specific circumstances,  		politics, history, and preferences of individual States. Federal mandates are  		likely to stifle State experimentation with new approaches to addressing the  		long-term care needs of their disabled senior citizens. Indeed, many believe  		even greater flexibility should be built into Federal financing mechanisms such  		as Medicaid, so that Federal dollars could be made available for an even  		broader range of long-term care policies and programs. Also, given the need to  		allocate public resources in accordance with the availability or unavailability  		of informal caregivers, local discretion in resource allocation decisions has  		obvious advantages over a centralized Federal program. </p>
<p>The opposite point of view assumes that because many States are  		unwilling or unable to invest public resources in long-term care, many poor and  		disabled elderly are denied access to even a basic level of care. From this  		perspective, low Medicaid spending for nursing home care may result in some  		Medicaid beneficiaries having difficulty getting into nursing homes, even  		though they are "entitled" to care. It is also argued that low State spending  		for home care services means that some or many elderly persons who are too poor  		to buy their own care either go without care, or become extremely heavy burdens  		on their families. Should Federal long-term care policy have the objective of  		raising the minimum floor of access and quality for  		publicly-financed services? If so, should new Federal resources be targeted to  		those States that currently spend the least for publicly-financed care? Should  		States be mandated to spend more of their own funds, or, if the Federal  		government is going to mandate a more uniform public benefit for long-term  		care, should the Federal government be responsible for financing the "minimum"  		benefit? </p>
<p>Others would go even further and state that the Federal government must  		be more aggressive in shaping the characteristics of the public long-term care  		delivery system, such as mandating nursing home pre-admission screening  		programs, requiring more uniformity in provider reimbursement methods and  		payment levels, specifying the characteristics of long-term care quality  		assurance systems, and so on. </p>
<p>This tension between Federal direction and State flexibility runs  		through the entire Medicaid program, not just in long-term care policy.  		However, it is important that proposals to reform the manner in which the  		Federal government finances long-term care services for the disabled elderly  		include a clear articulation of what their objectives are regarding Federal and  		State decision-making over long-term care policy. </p>
