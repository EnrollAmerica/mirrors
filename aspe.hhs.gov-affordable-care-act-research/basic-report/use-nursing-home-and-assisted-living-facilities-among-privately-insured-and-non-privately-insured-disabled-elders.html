Capital Assurance, Linda Berg-Maney and Peter Bokjov from John  		Hancock, and Bonnie Davis and Jim DuEst from UnumProvident. All of these  		individuals devoted a significant amount of time to assure that the sample of  		home care claimants was representative, that data from administrative systems  		was uniform and accurate, and that the fieldwork could be completed  		successfully. We are grateful for their patience and good cheer during the  		entire research process.</p>

<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>The dramatic growth in the number of Americans over age 75 coupled with  		the need to minimize the duration of expensive inpatient hospital care, portend  		continued reliance on nursing home care for a significant portion of the  		disabled population. Even in the presence of significant expansions in home and  		community-based care, the nursing home still remains a key provider of  		long-term care (LTC) services to more than 1.5 million people, most of whom are  		over age 65. Alternative institutional settings such as assisted living  		facilities (ALFs) are also growing in popularity. Today there are more than  		28,000 such residences housing more than one million people, many of whom have  		limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs). Thus, institutional-based  		care has and will remain an important component of the long-term care service  		delivery system. </p>
<p>The costs associated with receiving long-term care in institutional  		settings are significant and pose a financial hardship to many individuals. To  		meet this hardship, a growing number of individuals are purchasing private  		long-term care insurance. Through a series of actions, the Federal government  		is also signaling its desire that individuals accept greater personal  		responsibility for planning and paying for their long- term care needs. Such  		actions include tax clarification of long-term care insurance contracts, a plan  		to implement a Federal employees long-term care insurance plan, and  		expenditures on education related to the risks and costs of long-term care.  		</p>
<p>While there is a growing body of knowledge about who buys policies and  		what motivates them to do so, there has been no systematic study of individuals  		in institutionalized settings who are receiving benefits under their long-term  		care insurance policies. On an industry-wide basis, no one knows whether  		claimants and/or their families feel they are getting good value for their  		premiums, and whether the presence of private insurance influences the type of  		care people receive in these settings. </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to provide basic descriptive statistics on  		disabled private LTC insurance policyholders who have accessed long-term care  		benefits in institutional settings, and to compare such data and findings to  		non-privately insured institutionalized elders. We did this by interviewing 480  		long-term care insurance claimants from seven participating companies receiving  		benefits under their policies and residing in nursing homes or assisted living  		facilities. Key findings of the study are presented below. </p>
<h3>The Profile of Long-Term Care Insurance Claimants in  		Residential Care Facilities (Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities)</h3>
<ul><li>
<p> The majority of claimants in residential care facilities -- 72% --  			 were residing in nursing homes, and 28% were receiving services in assisted  			 living facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are few differences in the socio-demographic profile of  			 nursing home and assisted living claimants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Most claimants in residential care facilities are over age 80,  			 female, unmarried, highly educated and have incomes greater than $30,000.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average income had by these residential facility claimants was  			 about $33,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Married claimants are more likely to be in nursing homes than in  			 assisted living facilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly less than one in three claimants with dementia who are in  			 residential care settings receive their care in assisted living facilities.  			 Typically, the costs associated with caring for individuals in these facilities  			 are less than in nursing homes. Thus, for some cognitively impaired  			 individuals, private insurance coverage for assisted living care substitutes  			 for more costly nursing home care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claimants in assisted living are about twice as likely to assess  			 themselves to be in excellent health compared to those in nursing facilities. A  			 parallel finding is that, compared to assisted living claimants, nursing home  			 claimants are twice as likely to describe their health as poor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The differences in the prevalence of specific diagnoses between  			 residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities are not statistically  			 significant. This suggests that it is not the underlying primary diagnosis that  			 differentiates individuals in each of these service modalities, but, instead,  			 the way the diagnosis manifests itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average number of ADL limitations for nursing home claimants is  			 4.7, whereas for assisted living claimants, this figure drops to 2.8 -- 79% of  			 current claimants have two or more ADL limitations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the participating companies, the average number of ADL  			 limitations among nursing home claimants ranged from 4.0 to 5.2; for assisted  			 living claimants, the range for the average number of ADL limitations was from  			 2.6 to 4.7. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each ADL, the proportion of nursing home claimants in need of  			 assistance is greater than the corresponding proportion of assisted living  			 claimants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prevalence of cognitive impairment (as measured by diagnosis and  			 orientation) is higher among nursing home claimants than it is among assisted  			 living claimants. Overall, claimants in the nursing home are 1.3 times more  			 likely to be cognitively impaired than are those found in assisted living  			 facilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proportion of claimants with cognitive impairment in the nursing  			 home ranges between 75% and 86%, whereas in assisted living, the range is  			 between 47% and 81%. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Claimants in Residential Care Facilities and HIPAA  		Eligibility Criteria</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>At the time of the in-person interview, almost all nursing home  			 claimants had two or more ADL limitations or were cognitively impaired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 78% of assisted living claimants met the HIPAA benefit  			 eligibility criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals who did not meet HIPAA triggers in the assisted living  			 facilities were much more likely to be unmarried, slightly less educated, and  			 had somewhat lower levels of income. They also resided in facilities with lower  			 daily charges -- $86 compared to $92.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About half (46%) of the assisted living residents who did not meet  			 HIPAA benefit eligibility triggers had no ADL limitations at all.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Prior Residence and Service Use</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>About three in five (63%) of all nursing home residents and three in  			 four (73%) assisted living residents had either been a previous resident in an  			 assisted living facility or nursing home or had used home care prior to  			 entering their current facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost half of assisted living residents had been in a different  			 assisted living facility or nursing home before moving to their current  			 residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About one-quarter of the assisted living residents had been  			 transferred to assisted living from a nursing home. This suggests movement in  			 both directions along the continuum of care: from nursing homes to assisted  			 living and from assisted living to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About two in five facility residents had accessed formal home care  			 services before their current admission to the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The probability of entering a nursing home from a hospital is more  			 than twice as high as entering an assisted living facility directly from a  			 hospital -- 25% compared to 11%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to entering a residential care facility, between 43% and 47%  			 resided in the community either alone or with their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Service Use, Costs and Payment Sources in Residential  		Care Settings</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Claimants residing in nursing homes receive an average of five types  			 of services each month, compared to four service types for assisted living  			 claimants. This is not surprising, given the greater level of disability among  			 nursing home claimants. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nursing home residents use more medical services, skilled nursing  			 care, nutritional services and social services than do assisted living  			 claimants. In contrast, assisted living residents are much more likely to use  			 transportation services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the exception of charges for skilled care, charges for care  			 provided at the intermediate, residential and Alzheimers level are  			 significantly lower in assisted living facilities -- an average of 27% for  			 these claimants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living facilities enable Alzheimers patients to be  			 cared for at a lower cost than care provided in a nursing home. For this block  			 of claimants, the associated savings of being able to access  			 cognitive-related care in an assisted living facility instead of a nursing home  			 are16%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on institutional setting, the insurance is the primary  			 payment source for between 70% and 80% of these claimants. What is not paid for  			 by the insurance is typically funded from personal resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An average of 73% of the long-term care liability is paid for by  			 insurance. For nursing home claimants, 67% of the costs are covered, whereas  			 for assisted living residents, the average daily benefit pays for most (88%) of  			 the incurred costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where insurance is not the primary payment source for  			 nursing home claimants, the average daily benefit is lower, there is less  			 likelihood of having a policy with inflation protection, and the difference  			 between the daily charge and the daily benefit is greater.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Benefits Paid Under Insurance Contracts and Insurance  		Policy Designs</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The average monthly insurance benefit paid to claimants is  			 $2,141.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monthly nursing home benefits are about 23% higher than assisted  			 living benefits -- $2,251 versus $1,827.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These claimants have already used an average of $29,000 in insurance  			 benefits per person -- $34,000 for nursing home residents and $16,000 for  			 assisted living residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of these individuals (85%) have reimbursement policies covering  			 four or more years of care at around $83 per day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About two in five are eligible to receive over $100 per day in  			 benefits for institutional care services; 45% of the claimants have policies  			 that include some level of inflation protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average value of available benefits is $161,000 and these  			 individuals have thus far used up about 18% of their benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most individuals have been on claim for about 17 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 45% of nursing home residents have been receiving benefits for  			 more than a year-and-a-half; the comparable figure for assisted living  			 residents is 25%.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Claimant Satisfaction with Insurance Policy and  		Insurance Company</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The vast majority of claimants are satisfied with their policy, with  			 most being very satisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vast majority (85%) had no difficulty understanding what their  			 policy covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly four out of five assisted living claimants felt that the  			 benefits were adequate, given their care needs; the corresponding figure for  			 nursing home claimants was about three out of five residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most individuals -- more than 70% -- found the process of filing a  			 claim to be easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living claimants were more likely -- 1.7 times more likely  			 -- to find the process of filing a claim to be difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 90% of all individuals filing claims had either no  			 disagreements with their insurance companies or had a disagreement(s) that was  			 resolved satisfactorily. About 4% of claimants felt their disagreement was not  			 resolved satisfactorily.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Impact of Private Long-Term Care Insurance on  		Claimants</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>For about three-quarters of claimants, the presence of insurance was  			 not viewed as having had an influence on service-seeking behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One in five assisted living claimants, and one in eight nursing home  			 claimants, indicated that the presence of insurance allowed them to delay their  			 entry into an institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly one in ten individuals indicated that they entered an  			 institution sooner than they otherwise would have, given the presence of their  			 insurance benefits. An analysis of the profile of these individuals suggests  			 that they are typically older, have higher incomes, and are somewhat less ADL  			 dependent than are those who did not change their behavior and enter an  			 institution sooner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data suggests that, for some claimants, entry into the institution  			 is motivated by social concerns as well as by a desire to be in a protective  			 environment should additional declines in functioning occur.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Comparing Privately Insured and Non-Privately Insured  		Institutionalized Disabled Claimants<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></h3>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Residents</i></b> </p>
<ul><li>
<p>On average, disabled nursing home residents with long-term care  			 insurance are somewhat younger than their non-privately insured  			 institutionalized counterparts: the proportion of privately insured claimants  			 age 85 and over is only half that found in the general population of nursing  			 home residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There also tends to be a greater proportion of privately insured  			 male residents compared to other residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residents with private long-term care insurance are 2.8 times more  			 likely to be married than are those without such insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to non-privately insured nursing home residents, insured  			 residents are four times as likely to be college educated and about 3.2 times  			 more likely to have incomes greater than $20,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The privately insured sample is slightly more impaired compared to  			 other residents. The average number of limitations for disabled long-term care  			 insurance claimants is 4.9; this compares to between 4.4 and 4.7 limitations  			 among non-privately insured residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vast majority of disabled residents have some degree of  			 cognitive impairment, although insured residents are somewhat less likely to be  			 cognitively impaired.</p>
</li>
<li>Privately insured disabled residents appear to receive fewer services  		  than do other residents -- 5.4 services per month versus 6.7. </li>
<li>
<p>The non-insured resident population has somewhat greater medical or  			 skilled care needs. This is borne out by their greater use of skilled nursing  			 and medical services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-privately insured residents have an average of 4.0 medical  			 diagnoses whereas for claimants, the number is 3.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data presented here suggests that, after gaining admission to a  			 nursing home, the privately insured appear to use fewer services than that seen  			 for other residents. Thus, if the costs associated with room and board are  			 similar between privately insured and other residents, the former would be more  			 profitable for two reasons: (1) the daily rate paid is likely to be higher than  			 what is paid by other residents; and (2) service use is lower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In nominal terms, the average charge among privately insured  			 residents ($3,742) was between 27% and 40% higher than for other residents.  			 After accounting for the impact of inflation, the difference narrows somewhat  			 to between 10% and 22%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the privately insured, long-term care insurance and personal  			 resources account for the major payer sources, whereas for the non-privately  			 insured, Medicaid and personal resources comprise the primary payer  			 sources.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Assisted Living Residents</i></b> </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Compared to other residents in assisted living, long-term care  			 insurance claimants are somewhat younger, more likely to be male, and much more  			 likely to be married. They also have somewhat higher income levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term care insurance claimants in assisted living facilities  			 have more disabilities than do non-privately insured residents. The average  			 number of disabilities among claimants is 2.8, whereas among non-insured  			 residents the comparable figure is 1.7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 75% of all assisted living residents have two or fewer ADL  			 limitations. Among the privately insured, only 35% have fewer than two  			 limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each ADL, higher proportions of insured residents exhibit  			 dependency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The greatest differences between the two groups relate to continence  			 and toileting where claimants are between 1.8 and 2.8 times more likely to  			 require assistance in these basic activities of daily living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living residents with long-term care insurance are about  			 twice as likely to be cognitively impaired, compared to all assisted living  			 residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monthly costs of care for insured residents ($2,700) are roughly  			 1.3 to 1.8 times higher than for other residents.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Whereas one might have thought that the continuum of care moves from  		home care to assisted living to nursing home care, the data present a more  		complicated picture. For some individuals, assisted living may actually  		substitute for remaining in the home and relying on formal home care services.  		Other claimants in assisted living facilities faced the alternative of nursing  		home care. Either way, it appears that, in the presence of comprehensive  		insurance coverage, one can expect greater use of lower intensity and more  		home-like institutional settings like assisted living. This presents  		opportunities to a sub-set of policyholders who would otherwise face more  		costly nursing home care. </p>
<p>Given the rapidly changing landscape of the service delivery network,  		insurers will need to continue to emphasize flexibility in their products.  		Along with such flexibility, however, is the need to keep consumers informed  		about the relationship between benefit levels and future service costs. This is  		particularly true for those accessing costly nursing home services. Here policy  		benefits cover a smaller fraction of the costs than in either the home or  		assisted living setting. While the presence of insurance will certainly alter  		service utilization patterns, few individuals seem to be drawn more quickly to  		seek institutional alternatives just because they have insurance. What the  		insurance does allow is the ability for disabled individuals to access a  		variety of services in alternative settings and to do so in a way that leaves  		these people very satisfied with their coverage. </p>
<h2><a name="section1" id="section1">I. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>The dramatic growth in the number of Americans over age 75, coupled with  		the need to minimize the duration of expensive inpatient hospital care, portend  		continued reliance on nursing home care for a significant portion of the  		disabled population. Between 1987 and 1996, the number of nursing homes and the  		number of nursing home beds both increased by almost 20% (Rhoades and Krauss,  		1999). Yet, the growth in the elderly population over this time period outpaced  		the growth in nursing home beds. The fact that the number of beds did not keep  		pace with the growth in the elderly population is due to a number of factors.  		These include the imposition of restrictions on supply through Certificate of  		Need (CON) programs, an expanding home and community-based care network, growth  		in assisted living facilities, and a decline in age-specific rates of  		disability (Bishop, 1999; Lewin-VHI, 1991; Wiener, et al, 1998). Even though  		there has been a decline in nursing home use, however, the nursing home still  		remains a key provider of long-term care services to more than 1.5 million  		people, most of whom are over age 65.</p>
<p>Another institutional setting growing in popularity and serving disabled  		elders is assisted living. Assisted living facilities typically offer a  		combination of housing, health care, personal assistance and supportive  		services. The term "assisted living" refers to a type of care that combines  		housing and services in a homelike environment that strives to maximize the  		individual functioning and autonomy of the frail elderly and other dependent  		populations (Lewin-VHI, 1992). Today, there are more than 28,000 assisted  		living residences in the U.S., housing more than one million people; the  		typical assisted living resident is 83 years old, female, and slightly  		disabled, having limitations in 1.7 activities of daily living (National Center  		for Assisted Living, 1998).</p>
<p>There are substantial variations in the range of services that assisted  		living facilities provide and in the type of populations they serve. For the  		most part, individuals living in assisted living facilities are medically  		stable and do not require 24-hour nursing care. Most facilities provide or  		arrange for some level of personal care services for those individuals who may  		require them. In fact, about 70% of assisted living residences contract with a  		home health agency to provide skilled nursing, and 65% of residences contract  		with a hospice provider for hospice services (National Center for Assisted  		Living, 1998).</p>
<p>The growth in assisted living facilities reflects consumer demand for  		supportive living environments that closely parallel a "home-like" atmosphere.  		In addition, the growth in the sub-acute market may have begun to create a  		vacuum in the provision of traditional low-technology, facility-based long-term  		care that assisted living beds are designed to fill. Assisted living costs can  		range from 30% up to 100% of skilled nursing care costs (Raskin, 1995).  		Moreover, recent research suggests that transferring certain Alzheimer's  		patients from nursing homes to assisted living facilities could save up to 14%  		of long-term care costs (Leon, et al, 1999). These facilities may also achieve  		economies of scale in the delivery of home health care to frail elders that  		would be difficult to achieve if living alone in their own homes. Because  		elders overwhelmingly prefer to stay in their own homes or reside in congregate  		living situations compared to nursing homes, the assisted living modality is  		likely to continue to grow and expand.</p>
<p>Expenditures on institutional care are significant. As of 1997, the  		average private pay daily rate for nursing home care was $125 and the average  		nursing home cost approximately $50,000 per year (AARP, 1998). The average  		daily charge for assisted living was about $60 or $22,000 per year (ALFA,  		1998). Not surprisingly, long-term care expenditures on nursing homes and  		related facilities now account for a growing share of total personal health  		expenditures. Among people aged 65 and older, expenditures on institutional  		care account for about 25% of personal health expenditures. The primary payers  		of long-term care institutional services include disabled elders and their  		families and the Medicaid program. In 1997, Medicaid spent over $32 billion on  		nursing home care (Burwell, 1998). This represents roughly 43% of the total  		nursing home bill, which was nearly $75 billion in that year. Currently, about  		35 states cover, or plan to cover, assisted living or board and care as a  		Medicaid service (NIC, 1997). When the costs of assisted living are included,  		expenditures on institutional care settings reach $100 billion (Burwell, 1998;  		National Center for Assisted Living, 1998). </p>
<p>Historically, exposure to catastrophic cost risks of this nature has  		stimulated demand for private insurance, expanded public financing -- or both.  		Over the past decade, the potential of private long-term care insurance to  		become a significant source of financing for formal long-term care services has  		been much debated (See Cohen et al, 1987; Rivlin and Wiener, 1988; Friedland,  		1990; Families USA, 1993; Crown, et al, 1992). Even as the debate continues,  		the individual and employer-group markets continue to grow significantly.  		Long-term care insurance is one of the fastest growing health insurance  		business lines; in 1999 alone, growth in premium from new sales was 13%  		(LifePlans, Inc. 2000). More than 5.5 million people will have at one time or  		another acquired a policy (HIAA, 1998).</p>
<p>Recent actions suggest that the federal government has now shifted much  		of its focus to private insurance to help address the long-term care financing  		problem. On August 5, 1999, the Senate and the House of Representatives  		approved the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 (H.R. 2488), which among  		other things proposed changing the tax status of premiums paid for long-term  		care (LTC) insurance contracts. Currently, individuals can deduct their  		insurance premiums if they itemize their deductions and their medical expenses  		exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Under the new legislation, which was  		subsequently vetoed by President Clinton, individuals would have been able to  		take an "above the line deduction" of LTC insurance premiums. Individuals  		purchasing LTC insurance could have deducted the full amount of their premium  		payment from adjusted gross income, whether or not they itemized deductions or  		had medical expenses above the 7.5% threshold. The purpose of the proposed  		legislation was to use the tax code to encourage individuals to acquire private  		insurance to cover the potentially catastrophic costs of long-term care. </p>
<p>In his 1999 state of the union message, the President recommended that a  		new long-term care insurance program be established for federal employees.  		Moreover, in recognition of the financial burden imposed by informal  		caregiving, this year the President recommended that a tax credit of up to  		$3,000 per year be available to those caring for disabled relatives. With these  		actions, the federal government is continuing to signal its desire that  		individuals accept personal responsibility for planning and providing for their  		long-term care needs. </p>
<p>Questions remain, however, about whether private long-term care  		insurance represents a "good buy." Proponents of private long-term care  		insurance argue that its purchase is the only viable alternative to  		out-of-pocket spending or reliance on informal family caregiving for elders  		with incomes and assets above the means-tested eligibility levels for most  		publicly-funded long-term care service coverage. Critics question both the  		affordability of private long-term care insurance to the target market of  		middle-aged and "young-old" individuals and whether the product will meet the  		needs of those who purchase it.</p>
<p>Given anticipated changes in Federal policy with respect to Medicare and  		Medicaid, as well as recent attempts to further clarify the tax status of  		long-term care insurance, it is likely that the market will continue to expand.  		Yet, while there is a growing body of knowledge about who buys policies and  		what motivates them to do so (ACLI, 2000; HIAA, 1992 &amp; 1995), there has  		been no systematic study of individuals in institutionalized settings who are  		receiving benefits under their long-term care insurance policies. On an  		industry-wide basis, no one knows whether claimants and/or their families feel  		they are getting good value for their premiums, and whether the presence of  		private insurance influences the type of care people receive in these settings.  		</p>
<p>The current study of institutionalized claimants is part of a larger  		study on Long-Term Care Insurance Claimants, funded by the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), Office of Disability,  		Aging and Long-Term Care Policy and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The  		principal report was completed in April 1999 and is entitled: "<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/ifpattrn.htm">A Descriptive Analysis  		of Patterns of Informal and Formal Caregiving among Privately Insured and  		Non-Privately Insured Disabled Elders Living in the Community</a>." Two  		supplemental reports about the informal caregivers of these community-dwelling  		disabled elders and the use of multivariate modeling to understand service use  		were completed in December 1999. The current report focuses on the experiences  		of institutionalized claimants, that is, those who are receiving care in  		nursing homes and in assisted living facilities. </p>
<h2><a name="section2" id="section2">II. PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this research is to provide basic descriptive statistics  		on disabled private LTC insurance policyholders who have accessed long-term  		care benefits in institutional settings and to compare such data and findings  		to non-privately insured institutionalized elders. We intend to:</p>
<ul><li> provide detailed descriptive information on the socio-demographic  		  and service utilization profile of disabled claimants residing in institutions  		  receiving benefits under their LTC insurance policies;</li>
<li> characterize the level and mix of services among disabled  		  institutionalized claimants and compare this to a nationally representative  		  sample of non-privately insured disabled elders residing in institutions;</li>
<li> identify any factors associated with observed differences between  		  the insured and non-insured groups in relation to the utilization of  		  services;</li>
<li> evaluate claimant and or family perceptions regarding the value of  		  the LTC policy; and, </li>
<li> discuss the implications of findings on the service delivery system  		  as well as on the design of private and public LTC policies and programs.</li>
</ul><p>Obtaining answers to these questions is important from a public policy  		and regulatory standpoint. The vast majority of LTC policies cover care  		provided in a variety of modalities. Thus, their proliferation in the market  		will affect the level and mix of publicly funded long-term care services. In  		the absence of "hard data" about the experience of claimants, it is difficult  		to develop targeted regulatory and consumer protection strategies related to  		claims issues. Also, if state and Federal governments wish to encourage  		development of the long-term care insurance market, it is important that there  		be adequate information about how the product is performing from the  		perspective of claimants and their families. This will assist the government in  		assessing the future potential of long-term care insurance.</p>
<p>Such information is also of interest to private insurers, who are trying  		to increase the market for long-term care insurance, and actuaries who are  		responsible for pricing long-term care insurance products. Often, the only  		information available to actuaries on a national basis is derived from  		uninsured experience among the general population of disabled elders (e.g. 1985  		and 1995 National Nursing Home Survey and 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey).  		Information from these surveys may not accurately represent experience in an  		insured context. Thus, it is important to determine whether, and in what ways,  		the utilization of institutional services differs in the presence of long-term  		care insurance. This has implications for the way policies are designed,  		priced, and marketed.</p>
<h2><a name="section3" id="section3">III. METHOD</a></h2>
<h3>A. Sample</h3>
<p>The study relied on the development of three analytic samples. These  		included: </p>
<ol><li> Privately insured institutionalized individuals who are accessing  		  benefits under their LTC insurance policies (Institutional Claimants);</li>
<li> Disabled institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries who do not have  		  private LTC insurance (1994 National Long-Term Care Survey -- 1994 NLTCS  		  sample);</li>
<li> A sample of 1,409 nursing homes and 8,056 of their current residents  		  (1995 National Nursing Home Survey -- 1995 NNHS). </li>
</ol><p><b><i>Institutional Claimants</i></b> </p>
<p>To be included in the privately insured claimant sample, individual  		claimants had to meet the following criteria: </p>
<ol><li> They had to be age 65 and over;</li>
<li> They had to be classified as an active claim with at least one  		  payment for institutional services; and</li>
<li> They had to have a policy that covered both nursing home care and  		  home and community-based services. </li>
</ol><p>We asked each company to provide a sample of claimants who met these  		criteria. We focused on individuals with "dual-coverage" policies, rather than  		on those with policies covering only institutional care, because roughly 80% of  		all policies currently selling in the market cover services in at least these  		two modalities. By doing so, we could assure that study findings would be  		applicable in the future as well as in the present. Together, these eight  		companies provided an institutional claimant block of 583 eligible  		institutionalized individuals of whom 82% or 480 participated in the study.  		</p>
<p><b><i>The 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey</i></b> </p>
<p>The 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) was designed to collect  		data about the health and function of the Medicare beneficiary population age  		65 and older. The questions were meant to identify persons who had certain  		disabilities or health problems lasting three months or longer. In general, the  		institutional section of the survey includes persons who were in the community  		in previous waves of the survey (i.e. 1982, 1984, 1989), both those screened in  		as disabled and those who did not pass the disability screen in a previous  		year. A sample of nursing home residents was included as well, so that the  		entire sample is representative of nursing home residents nationwide. The total  		1994 NLTCS sample of institutionalized elders consisted of 1,335 individuals.  		</p>
<p><b><i>The 1995 National Nursing Home Survey</i></b> </p>
<p>The 1995 National Nursing Home Survey is a two-stage design with a  		probability sample of 1,500 nursing facilities in the first stage and up to six  		current residents per facility in the second stage of sampling. The facilities  		included in the universe were nursing and related care homes in the United  		States that had three or more beds, were staffed for use by residents, and  		routinely provided nursing and personal care services. The sample of current  		patients was obtained by randomly selecting up to six residents who were on the  		rolls of nursing homes as of midnight the night prior to the day of the survey.  		In total, 1,409 nursing homes participated in the study, and there is data  		available on 8,056 of their residents.</p>
<h3>B. Data</h3>
<p><b><i>Sources of Information</i></b> </p>
<p>Seven of the largest LTC insurance companies in the U.S. participated in  		the study and contributed a sample of claimants residing in institutional  		settings. These companies also provided data from their administrative and  		claim systems to supplement information collected directly from claimants. </p>
<p>The participating companies included: (1) Aegon; (2) American  		Travellers; (3) Bankers Life and Casualty; (4) CNA Insurance; (5) Fortis  		Long-Term Care; (6) G.E. Capital Assurance; and (7) UnumProvident. Together  		their claimant blocks comprise more than 80% of all open institutional claims.  		These companies also represent diverse market segments and policy designs, and  		employ differing underwriting and claims management strategies. </p>
<p>As mentioned, in addition to the information provided by the LTC  		insurance industry, we analyzed information from the 1994 National Long-Term  		Care Survey (1994 NLTCS).<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> This data allowed us to make comparisons  		between privately insured and non-privately insured disabled elders living in  		the community. Questions on the claimant survey were designed to mirror those  		on the 1994 NLTCS; this assured that accurate comparisons between the privately  		insured and non-privately insured samples could be made. Many of the questions  		on the claimant survey were also designed to correspond to those found on the  		1995 National Nursing Home Survey. This enabled us to compare the types of  		facilities and service packages used by the privately insured and the  		non-privately insured.</p>
<p><b><i>Data Collection</i></b> </p>
<p>We gathered data from all privately insured institutionalized claimants  		via in-person interviews conducted by trained nurses and social workers with at  		least two years of geriatric experience. Each interviewer underwent  		comprehensive training to assure inter-rater reliability. Information garnered  		from these interviews was then linked to policy design and claim information  		generated from the administrative systems of the participating insurance  		companies. Most often, we conducted interviews with proxies, primarily family  		members including spouses and children. When necessary, we gathered information  		from a claimant's chart or the nurse most familiar with their care. In some  		instances, where the claimant was found to be cognitively intact, we conducted  		the interview with the claimant themselves. We also collected a great deal of  		administrative and billing information pertaining to charges, bed  		classification, facility licensure, and payer source. We completed the  		fieldwork between January 1999 and January 2000. It is important to note that  		each completed survey underwent a detailed quality review by home-office staff.  		In some cases, surveys had to be returned to the field either because certain  		data elements were not complete or because of the presence of clinical  		discrepancies. </p>

</tr></table><p>The next figure shows the distribution of claimants by the type of unit  		in which they reside. Again, data is presented for claimants in nursing homes  		and in assisted living facilities. Most striking is the fact that about 30% of  		dementia patients receive their care in assisted living facilities. As shown in  		<a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure3">Figure 3</a>, about 18% of private long-term care claimants  		in both nursing homes and assisted living facilities are in specialized  		dementia units within these facilities. Typically, the costs associated with  		caring for individuals in these facilities are less than in nursing homes  		(Leon, et al, 1999). Thus, for some cognitively impaired individuals, private  		insurance coverage for assisted living care substitutes for more costly nursing  		home care.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is the fact that most claimants are not receiving  		skilled care services but intermediate and personal care services. This finding  		supports the notion that private long-term care insurance is designed to pay  		for chronic care needs rather than post-acute recuperative needs. Data on bed  		classification at the time of assessment also support this proposition -- less  		than half of all institutional claimants were receiving skilled care or  		rehabilitation/sub-acute care.</p>

</tr></table><p>For the most part, there are few differences in the socio-demographic  		profile of nursing home and assisted living claimants. While it appears that  		there are slightly more females in assisted living than in nursing homes, the  		difference is not statistically significant. A surprising finding is that  		married claimants are more likely to be in nursing homes than in assisted  		living facilities. This may reflect the fact that if one member of a couple  		becomes disabled the spouse may choose to remain in their home rather than move  		to an assisted living facility. For the disabled individual, the difference  		between being alone in an assisted living facility versus a nursing home may  		not be so great. Given that most elders who become disabled do experience  		additional declines, the opportunity to move once, rather than twice, may also  		be a contributing factor explaining this finding. It may also be the case that  		married individuals in nursing homes are more disabled than married individuals  		in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p>Regarding race, a slightly higher proportion of non-white claimants  		reside in assisted living. Finally, in terms of education level, income and  		estimated value of housing (for individuals who still own a home), there were  		few differences between the groups. The average income had by these  		institutional claimants was about $33,000.</p>
<p><b><i>Health Status</i></b> </p>
<p>Respondents were asked a number of questions relating to their health  		status. The figure below illustrates how claimants assessed their health status  		at the time of the in-person interview. Not surprisingly, claimants in assisted  		living are about twice as likely to assess themselves to be in excellent health  		compared to those in nursing facilities. A parallel finding is that compared to  		assisted living claimants, nursing home claimants are twice as likely to  		describe their health as poor. These differences are significant at the .01  		level.</p>

<p>The next three figures illustrate the extent of disability among  		privately insured institutional claimants. Disability is measured in three  		ways: (1) the number of limitations in ADLs; (2) whether or not someone is  		cognitively impaired, as determined by medical diagnosis, or their orientation  		to person, time and place; and (3) the presence of limitations in higher order  		functions or selected instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). </p>
<p>Most currently available LTC policies require an individual have at  		least two ADL limitations or be cognitively impaired in order to qualify for  		benefits. All currently issued tax-qualified policies have such a requirement.  		Older and non-tax qualified policies do, however, enable an individual to  		access benefits if LTC services were deemed by a physician to be "<i>medically  		necessary</i>".<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note5">5</a></font></sup>  		Seventy-nine percent of current claimants in residential facilities have two or  		more ADL limitations.

The average number of ADL limitations for  		nursing home claimants is 4.7, whereas for assisted living claimants this  		figure drops to 2.8. Not shown in the diagram is the fact that, among the  		participating companies, the average number of ADL limitations among nursing  		home claimants ranged from 4.0 to 5.2; for assisted living claimants the range  		for the average number of ADL limitations was from 2.6 to 4.7.<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>

<p><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure8">Figure 8</a> displays the claimant sample by  		cognitive status. The prevalence of cognitive impairment (as measured by  		diagnosis and orientation) is higher among nursing home claimants than it is  		among assisted living claimants. Overall, claimants in the nursing home are 1.3  		times more likely to be cognitively impaired than are those found in assisted  		living facilities. It is also true that orientation problems are less prevalent  		among assisted living residents. </p>
<p>How does this finding correspond to the earlier result that roughly 18%  		of claimants in both assisted living and nursing homes are in dementia units?  		Data presented in <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure8">Figure 8</a> suggests that while roughly  		five in eight assisted living claimants has some level of cognitive impairment,  		many would only be considered moderately or mildly impaired. Thus, they are not  		residing in dementia/Alzheimer's units. Regarding the nursing home claimants,  		many with cognitive impairment are actually treated in other units for medical  		and personal care issues. Thus, most of them are also not residing in a  		specialty care unit for the cognitively impaired.</p>

</tr></table><p>Because companies use different underwriting techniques to identify  		individuals who may be at high risk for becoming cognitively impaired, there is  		a great deal of variation between companies in the number of claimants with  		cognitive impairment issues. The proportion of claimants with cognitive  		impairment in the nursing home ranges between 75% and 86% whereas in assisted  		living, the range is between 47% and 81%. Some companies conduct more intensive  		in-person assessments during the policy application process, while others rely  		more heavily on medical records or phone interviews. Clearly, some companies  		are more successful than others at identifying the risk of cognitive claims.  		Also, policy designs and claims adjudication procedures may lead to variability  		in the number of claimants with cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>Another measure of one's disability status is the ability to perform  		IADLs. These higher order activities must also be performed as part of  		independent living. Such activities typically include shopping, laundry, light  		housework, outdoor mobility, managing medications, managing money, getting to  		places out of walking distance, and meal preparation. Loss of the ability to  		perform these activities is usually a precursor to loss of ADL function. </p>
<p>While useful in tracking levels of functional capacity, there are  		shortcomings with this measure. One difficulty with relying on IADLs to measure  		disability is that many of them are role-related. That is, an individual may  		never prepare meals because his or her spouse has always prepared them. Not  		being able to prepare a meal would not necessarily be indicative of one's lack  		of ability to do so. Also, in institutional settings, as a matter of routine,  		many IADLs are performed for individuals by staff. Therefore, a more  		specialized list has been developed to measure disability in these higher order  		functions for individuals in institutional settings. We asked claimants whether  		or not they receive any personal help or supervision in:</p>
<ul><li>Managing money;</li>
<li>Caring for personal possessions such as clothing, toiletries,  		  etc.;</li>

<p>In the HIPAA (i.e. Kennedy-Kassebaum) legislation, long-term care  		insurance policies are tax qualified if access to benefits is limited to (1)  		individuals with at least two ADL limitations or (2) individuals who are  		moderately or severely cognitive impaired. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure10">Figure 10</a>  		shows that, at the time of the in-person interview, almost all nursing home  		claimants met these criteria. Only 78% of assisted living claimants met the  		criteria. Taken together, these findings suggest that, depending on site of  		care, somewhere between 4% and 22% of claimants would not have met HIPAA  		triggers at the time of the in-person interview. By way of comparison, we also  		provide data on home care claimants. Additional analysis does reveal, however,  		that most of these individuals were either on their way to becoming more  		disabled or were in the process of improving in function.</p>

<h3>D. Service Use and Residence before Current  		Admission</h3>
<p>For the most part, when individuals enter institutional settings it is  		only after alternatives have been tried in the community. That is, unless there  		has been a severe acute event (e.g. stroke) that leads to significant  		functional limitations necessitating immediate institutionalization, many  		individuals first experience declines in the community before entering an  		institution. Only after informal support networks or paid care can no longer  		meet an individual's needs in the community do individuals tend to move to  		institutional settings. </p>
<p>All claimants in this sample have insurance policies that cover home and  		community-based care services as well as institutional services. We asked  		whether or not they had received any home or community-based services or  		whether they had resided in other long-term care institutions prior to their  		current residence. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure12">Figure 12</a> summarizes results.</p>

</tr></table><p>The majority of individuals had accessed long-term care services before  		entering their current institution. In fact, 63% of all nursing home residents  		had either been a previous resident in an assisted living facility or nursing  		home or had used home care prior to entering their current facility. The  		comparable figure for assisted living claimants is 73%. Given that entry to a  		nursing home is often precipitated by an acute incident, it is not surprising  		that fewer nursing home residents accessed long-term care services before  		entering a nursing home.</p>
<p>Almost half of assisted living residents had been in a different  		assisted living facility or nursing home before moving to their current  		residence; about one-quarter of the assisted living residents had been  		transferred to assisted living from a nursing home. This suggests movement in  		both directions along the continuum of care: from nursing homes to assisted  		living and from assisted living to nursing homes. It also indicates a very high  		"moving rate" among these individuals.</p>
<p>About two in five institutionalized residents had accessed formal home  		care services before their current admission to the facility. The proportion is  		slightly higher among assisted living residents, again suggesting that a  		greater number of nursing home residents had likely experienced an acute  		incident that necessitated immediate institutionalization in a nursing  		facility. </p>
<p>Given that these claimants had policies that covered both home care and  		institutional care services, it is surprising that less than half had used home  		care benefits. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it  		may be that these individuals want to conserve their insurance benefits to pay  		for the care that carries with it the greatest financial risk -- institutional  		care. They may be able to rely on informal caregivers to provide the level of  		care needed in the community. Second, although the financing may be in place,  		the service infrastructure may not be available to provide significant amounts  		of home and community-based care. Finally, it may also be the case that these  		claimants did not fully understand that their policies covered home care  		services.</p>
<p><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure13">Figure 13</a> shows that the probability of entering  		a nursing home from a hospital is more than twice as high as entering an  		assisted living facility directly from a hospital. Data also indicate that  		prior to entering an institution, between 43% and 47% resided either alone or  		with their families. </p>

</tr></table><h3>E. Service Use and Cost in Long-Term Care  		Facilities</h3>
<p>Long-term care services are often classified as being either home or  		community-based or institutional in nature. Analyses of individuals' use of  		home care services typically focus on the type of service (e.g. home health  		aide, therapist, nurse, etc) and its frequency and duration of provision. Such  		is not the case when it comes to institutional alternatives. For the most part,  		the discussion stops with the observation that an individual has moved into a  		nursing home or assisted living facility. Few researchers have adequately  		focused attention on the service packages that are provided -- as opposed to  		offered -- to residents once in a facility. </p>
<p>In <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#table2">Table 2</a>, we show the proportion of residents  		receiving various services related to their long-term care, social and acute  		care needs. Claimants or their proxies were asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>In the last month (since date one month ago), which of these  		  services did you receive, either inside or outside this facility?</i>  		  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assessor was also instructed to refer to the insured's medical and  		administrative chart and verify and/or obtain the information requested. As  		shown in <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#table2">Table 2</a>, claimants residing in nursing homes  		received an average of five types of services during the previous month; this  		compares to about four types for assisted living claimants.</p>

</tr></table><p>Given their greater level of disability, this finding is not surprising.  		The greatest differences relate to nursing home residents' greater use of  		medical services, skilled nursing care, nutritional services and social  		services. In contrast, assisted living residents are much more likely to use  		transportation services. This likely reflects their greater ability to move  		about outside of their facility. Excluding medications, the most commonly used  		service among assisted living claimants is personal care.</p>
<p>The charges associated with the services provided in these institutional  		settings vary greatly.<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note8">8</a></font></sup>  		Recent data suggests that the average private pay rate in a nursing home is  		about $125 (AARP, 1998). <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure14">Figure 14</a> shows the average  		charges for these claimants according to the type of bed in which they resided.

Assisted living facilities have enabled  		such patients to be cared for at a lower cost to the claimant as well as to the  		insurance company. Other recent research found that among non-privately insured  		individuals, care for Alzheimer's patients is cheaper -- by about 14% -- when  		provided in assisted living facilities as opposed to a nursing home (Leon et  		al, 1999). For the privately insured claimants in this study, the associated  		"savings" of being able to access assisted living instead of nursing home care  		for cognitive-related needs are 16%.</p>
<p>We asked claimants what was their primary source of payment for their  		previous month's charges. We also asked them about their secondary sources of  		payment. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#table3">Table 3</a> summarizes results.</p>
<p>Long-term care insurance is not the primary payment source <b>at  		admission</b> to a nursing home or assisted living for most (70%) of these  		claimants. The insurance is only accessed at a later point either when  		individuals have completed their elimination period, or when individuals have  		reached a point of functional or cognitive decline that would allow them to  		access benefits from the policy. Depending on institutional setting, the  		insurance does become the primary payment source for between 70% and 80% of  		these claimants. What is not paid for by the insurance is typically funded from  		personal resources. Medicare is only a significant payment source for about  		one-third of nursing home residents, but only at initial admission. Within a  		few months, Medicare ceases to be a meaningful payer of services in the nursing  		home.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is surprising that for roughly 30% of nursing home claimants,  		insurance is not their primary payment source. In most of these cases, the  		insurance benefit represents less than half of the daily charge associated with  		care. Additional analysis reveals that, in cases where insurance is not the  		primary payment source for nursing home claimants, the average daily benefit is  		lower, there is less likelihood of having a policy with inflation protection,  		and the difference between the daily charge and the daily benefit is greater.  		These individuals also tend to be somewhat more ADL impaired, are more likely  		to be cognitively impaired, and are less likely to be married.</p>
<h3>F. Benefits paid under Insurance Contracts and Insurance  		Policy Designs</h3>
<p>In these institutional settings, claimants are receiving significant  		amounts of care. Much of this care is paid for by insurance benefits. In fact,  		for more than 70% of claimants, insurance pays the majority of the costs of  		care. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure15">Figure 15</a> shows that the average monthly  		insurance benefit paid to claimants is $2,141. Monthly nursing home benefits  		are about 23% higher than assisted living benefits -- $2,251 versus $1,827.  		</p>
<p>These figures must be viewed with caution, because they are derived by  		taking the current claim's total dollar expenditure and dividing this by the  		amount of time that the individual was on claim. The total dollar expenditure  		is a function of submitted bills by the claimant or the institution. In some  		cases, claimants (or their families) may aggregate or hold bills for a few  		months before submitting them for payment to the insurance company. Given our  		method of calculation, we may actually underestimate the average monthly claim  		payment by residence. A completely accurate accounting would require us to  		focus on the experience of closed claims, something that is outside the scope  		of the current inquiry.</p>

Given that most of these individuals (60%) have  		policies covering four or more years of care at around $83 per day -- about  		$161,000 in available benefits -- these individuals have thus far used up about  		18% of their benefits (see <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#table4">Table 4</a>).

</tr></table><p>The most conservative -- although from a claims standpoint less  		predictable -- of these policy designs is the reimbursement model. Almost all  		of the institutional care benefits in the policies held by these claimants are  		paid on a reimbursement basis (85%). Almost none of the institutional claimants  		in this sample have accessed benefits through a disability policy design.  		Almost all claimants have either a reimbursement or indemnity policy  		design.</p>
<p>The average daily benefit for institutional coverage in the sample is  		$83 and about two in five are eligible to receive over $100 per day in benefits  		for institutional care services. It is also noteworthy that 45% of the  		claimants have policies that include some level of inflation protection.</p>
<p>In terms of coverage duration, more than half of the claimants have  		policies that cover the equivalent of daily care for a five-year period. Such  		durational coverage should provide payments for the total duration of care for  		all but 15% of nursing home claimants.<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> Given the lack of information about the  		average length of stay in assisted living, we cannot be certain that durations  		will cover most of these residents.</p>
<p>An important issue is the extent to which the daily benefit amount  		covers the daily cost of care. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure17">Figure 17</a> shows that  		among all claimants, an average of 73% of the long-term care liability is paid  		for by insurance.

</tr></table><p>Given the relatively complex nature of long-term care insurance  		contracts, an issue of concern to consumer groups and the industry alike is  		whether or not claimants actually understand what they are buying.  		Claimants/proxies were asked whether they had any problems understanding what  		was and was not covered by their policy. The vast majority (85%) had no  		difficulty understanding what their policy covered. There were no differences  		between nursing home and assisted living claimants. Nor were there significant  		differences across companies.</p>
<p>We asked claimants and their proxies whether the benefits paid by their  		insurance policy were sufficient to meet their care needs in the institutional  		setting. This question begins to focus on the issue of adequacy  		vis-à-vis benefit levels chosen by the insured. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure19">Figure 19</a> shows that roughly three in four assisted living  		claimants felt that the benefits were adequate, given their care needs. Over  		half of nursing home claimants considered their benefits enough to meet their  		care needs. The lower percentage of claimants in nursing homes who feel their  		benefits are adequate is not surprising, given that nursing home residents have  		a somewhat smaller proportion of their total costs covered by their insurance  		benefits.</p>

</tr></table><p>Most long-term care insurance policies reimburse expenses incurred for  		direct service costs, or pay a flat benefit when service costs are incurred.  		This means that bills must be sent to the insurer in order to process a claim,  		and one might expect this to be cumbersome, especially for policyholders  		suffering from dementia or other cognitive ailments. It could also be difficult  		for claimants entering assisted living facilities where there remains a great  		deal of confusion around issues related to licensure.</p>
<p>We asked claimants whether it was difficult for them to file their claim  		and obtain benefits. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure20">Figure 20</a> shows that most  		individuals -- more than 70% -- found the process to be easy.

</tr></table><h3>H. Impact of Private Long-Term Care Insurance on  		Claimants</h3>
<p>The presence of insurance to cover services that can be close  		substitutes -- home and community-based care and institutional care -- raises  		important questions about service utilization in an insured environment. On  		average, these individuals had their policies about five years before their  		current use of services. Depending on the income, disability status,  		availability of informal supports and tastes of the individual, as well as the  		service system itself, one could imagine two possible scenarios: (1) that the  		presence of insurance would reduce the net cost of institutional care, thus  		encouraging individuals to access such services earlier than they otherwise  		might have in the absence of insurance; or, (2) that insurance coverage for  		home and community-based care would enable individuals to delay their  		institutionalization. From the previous study of home care claimants, about  		half indicated that, in the absence of their policy, they would have to seek  		institutional care (HHS, 1999).</p>
<p>We asked claimants and their proxies (e.g. primary informal caregivers  		or powers of attorney) questions about how having a long-term care insurance  		policy has influenced their movement between the community and their current  		residence. <a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#figure22">Figure 22</a> displays responses to two  		questions:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Did having the long-term care insurance policy allow the insured to  			 remain at home longer than he/she otherwise would have if he/she did not have  			 the policy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the insured enter a facility sooner than he/she would have  			 because he/she had a long-term care policy?</p>
</li>
</ol><table title="FIGURE 22: Impact of Policy Ownership on Movement between the Community and Current Residence"><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure22" id="figure22">FIGURE 22</a>: Impact of Policy Ownership  			 on Movement between the Community and Current Residence</b></font></td>

</tr><tr><td><font><b>SOURCE</b>: 2000 National Claimant  			 Study.</font></td>
</tr></table><p>The first thing to notice is that for most -- about three in four -- the  		presence of insurance was not viewed as having had an influence on service  		seeking behavior. For between one in five assisted living claimants and one in  		eight nursing home claimants, the presence of insurance allowed them to delay  		their entry into an institution. These differences are significant at the .01  		level. On average, individuals residing in nursing homes have had their  		policies for about five years, whereas those residing in assisted living  		facilities have been insured for closer to four years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, roughly one in ten individuals indicated that they  		entered an institution sooner than they otherwise would have, given the  		presence of their insurance benefits. An analysis of the profile of these  		individuals suggests that they are typically older, have higher incomes, and  		are somewhat less ADL dependent than are those who did not change their  		behavior and enter an institution sooner. This suggests that for some, entry  		into the institution is motivated by social concerns as well as by a desire to  		be in a protective environment should additional declines in functioning occur.  		</p>
<h3>I. Comparing Privately Insured and Non-Privately Insured  		Institutional Residents</h3>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Residents</i></b></p>
<p>A primary purpose of this study is to compare privately insured disabled  		nursing home residents to other residents in nursing homes. Information on  		other residents was obtained from two data sources: the 1994 National Long-Term  		Care Survey (NLTCS) and the 1995 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). However,  		the sample inclusion criteria for these two national surveys was more liberal  		than the criteria for inclusion in the privately insured claimant sample --  		service use among individuals with two or more ADL limitations or cognitive  		impairment. Thus, in order to enable meaningful, direct comparisons of the  		privately insured and non-privately insured nursing home populations, we  		applied the same minimum disability threshold to all three surveys and focused  		our analysis on the subset of residents that met this minimum disability  		threshold.</p>
<p>The criteria that are applied to individuals in these samples include  		being:</p>
<ol><li> disabled in at least two out of six ADLs that require some level of  		  human assistance;<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note14">14</a></font></sup><b>or</b></li>
<li> cognitively impaired as measured by the Short Portable Mental Status  		  Questionnaire (SPMSQ);<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note15">15</a></font></sup><b>or</b></li>
<li> diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ol><p>Once these minimum disability selection criteria are applied, the  		samples can then be compared one to the other on all dimensions of interest.  		The sub-samples are comprised of 1,158 residents from the 1994 NLTCS, 6,492  		residents from the 1995 NNHS, and 322 residents from the 2000 National Claimant  		Study. All individuals are age 65 and over.</p>
<p><b><i>Socio-Demographic Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#table5">Table 5</a> displays the socio-demographic profile of  		insured claimants and other nursing home residents. The data reveals important  		differences between the claimant sample and the two national samples. On  		average, disabled nursing home residents with long-term care insurance are  		somewhat younger than their non-privately insured institutionalized  		counterparts. In fact, the proportion of privately insured claimants age 85 and  		over is only half that found in the general population of nursing home  		residents. There also tends to be a greater proportion of privately insured  		male residents compared to other residents. This is in spite of the fact that  		the proportion of males in the general population age 65 and over and in the  		population of long-term care insurance policyholders is roughly equal. In terms  		of racial composition, given that the overwhelming majority of policyholders is  		white, it is not surprising that privately insured claimants are much more  		likely to be white.</p>
<p>One of the biggest differences in demographic characteristics relates to  		marital status. Residents with private long-term care insurance are 2.8 times  		more likely to be married than are those without such insurance. In the general  		population 53% of elders age 65 and over are married; among long-term care  		insurance policyholders, 69% are married. Thus, everything else held constant,  		we would expect a higher proportion of married insured residents -- roughly 1.3  		times higher -- than that found among the general resident population. The fact  		that the difference is so great suggests that other factors, like disability  		status, may be at play. Additional analysis does reveal that the married  		residents with private insurance are much more disabled than single residents  		and non-privately insured married residents. Thus, although they may have  		informal supports available to them, their needs may be too great to be met in  		a community setting. The presence of insurance enables them to more easily have  		their needs met in a nursing home.</p>

</tr></table><p>Regarding income status, it is well known that long-term care insurance  		policyholders are more affluent than their counterparts in the general  		population (ACLI, 2000; HIAA, 1995).

Compared to non-privately insured nursing home  		residents, they are four times as likely to be college educated and about 3.2  		times more likely to have incomes greater than $20,000. In fact, the average  		income of disabled claimants is more than twice that for non-insured disabled  		residents -- $26,794 compared to $12,445.

<p>There was no implementation of a uniform measure for cognitive  		impairment across the three surveys. The 2000 National Claimant Study relied on  		the combination of three measures: (1) the Short Portable Mental Status  		Questionnaire (SPMSQ); (2) the presence of a cognitive-related diagnosis such  		as Alzheimer's or Dementia; and, (3) orientation to time, person and place. The  		1994 NLTCS relied exclusively on the SPMSQ.<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> Because of the differences in measurement,  		comparative statistics across the samples must be viewed cautiously.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is difficult to understand the differences in results between the  		1994 NLTCS and 1995 NNHS. For almost all other variables, results do not differ  		substantially. The question on residency was very similar in each of the  		surveys. The major difference in study design is that the 1994 NLTCS sample was  		drawn on a random sample of individual residents, whereas the 1995 NNHS sample  		was drawn from a random sample of institutions within which a random sample of  		residents was drawn. This may affect results on this variable, but it is not  		clear why this would be the case.</p>
<p><b><i>Service Use and Charges in Institutional Settings</i></b></p>
<p>We obtained information about the specific services that were received  		by residents in the 2000 National Claimant Study and in the 1995  		NNHS.<sup><font><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#note18">18</a></font></sup><a href="use-nursing-home-and-assisted-living-facilities-among-privately-insured-and-non-privately-insured-disabled-elders.html#table6">Table 6</a> shows that, in general, privately insured  		disabled residents appear to receive fewer services than do other residents --  		5.4 services per month versus 6.7. With the exception of dental care and  		transportation services, the proportion of privately insured residents  		receiving medical, mental health, skilled nursing, social services and personal  		care services is lower than what is observed for other disabled residents. The  		same is true for occupational therapy services.</p>
<p>Clearly, differences in the service packages received by individuals  		should reflect underlying care needs. From previous data we learned that for  		every privately insured claimant who entered a nursing home directly from a  		hospital, according to the 1995 NNHS, there were 1.8 non-privately insured  		residents doing so. This suggests that the non-insured resident population has  		somewhat greater medical or skilled care needs. This is borne out by their  		greater use of skilled nursing and medical services. Not surprisingly,  		additional analyses reveal that non-privately insured residents have an average  		of 4.0 medical diagnoses, whereas for claimants, the number is 3.0. Finally,  		the greatest proportion of privately insured residents receives personal care  		services, whereas for other residents, the greatest proportion receives medical  		services. Somewhat lower use of personal care services among the privately  		insured, compared to other residents, may reflect the fact that insured  		residents, who are more likely to be married, may be receiving personal care  		services from spouses. It is not uncommon for significant amounts of informal  		care to be provided in nursing homes by family members.</p>
<p>Anecdotal information suggests that having private insurance may improve  		access to a nursing home. This is because limits on Medicaid reimbursement  		rates have led many nursing home operators to seek out private pay residents.  		Data presented here suggests that, after gaining admission to a nursing home,  		the privately insured appear to use fewer services than that seen for other  		residents. Thus, if the costs associated with room and board are similar  		between privately insured and other residents, the former would be more  		profitable for two reasons: (1) the daily rate paid is likely to be higher than  		what is paid by other residents; and (2) service use is lower.</p>

Alternatively, it may be that the facilities chosen by privately insured are  		more costly at every level of service provision.

<p>To date, there has not been a comprehensive national survey that has  		collected detailed information on assisted living residents. Thus, in the  		analyses that follow, we present comparative data drawn from a variety of  		published sources. Much of the data is based on published reports and studies  		by the National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL) and the Assisted Living  		Federation of America (ALFA), working with Coopers and Lybrand. Additional  		information derives from studies contracted for by the federal government and  		researchers who have collected information about such facilities.</p>
<p>The sample of assisted living claimants is comprised of 133 claimants.  		We begin with a summary of basic demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>Compared to other residents in assisted living, long-term care insurance  		claimants are somewhat younger, more likely to be male and much more likely to  		be married. They also have somewhat higher income levels, and the distribution  		of income among them is somewhat more skewed toward the higher end. We know  		that the median income of claimants is somewhat lower than non-claimants, thus  		suggesting that a few high-income claimants dominate the average. In fact,  		slightly less than 10% of claimants have annual incomes greater than  		$75,000.</p>

The costs to insured residents  		are roughly 1.3 to 1.8 times as much as to other residents. There are a number  		of possible explanations for this finding. First, it may be that the wealth  		profile of the privately insured (including assets) enables them to access care  		in more "up-scale" facilities. Second, these claimants are more disabled than  		the average assisted living resident. Thus, they require more care. As a  		result, their actual monthly charges may reflect this greater need for care.  		Finally, the information about average charges from other assisted living  		residents represents summaries of basic service package charges rather than  		actual charges on a per-resident basis. Consequently, one cannot make direct  		comparisons between actual claimant charges and aggregate service package  		charges for non-insured residents. The former may be "buying up" to account for  		their disability status whereas we do not have comparable charges for similarly  		disabled residents who do not have private insurance.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that long-term care insurance is the primary payer  		source for 70% of nursing home claimants, only slightly more than half of  		residents indicate that their policy benefits are meeting their care needs in  		the facility. When the policy pays a greater proportion of nursing home  		charges, a significant number of claimants still report that the policy  		benefits were insufficient to meet current care needs. While there is no  		comparable data from the non-privately insured resident population, this data  		does suggest that service delivery issues inside of these nursing homes may  		exist. That is, even among private pay patients, there appears to be a gap  		between what is received and what is perceived to be needed. This could relate  		to how services are provided (e.g. responsiveness, quality and  		comprehensiveness) or whether they are provided at all (e.g. availability and  		staffing issues).</p>
<p>Although a greater proportion of individuals in assisted living  		facilities report that their needs are being met, there still remains a  		sizeable minority -- 28% -- who do not. The insurance benefits that these  		people receive cover 96% of the charges that they are assessed. Again, this  		reinforces the finding that service problems may exist even in the presence of  		significant financing.</p>
<p>Given the relatively rich benefit packages of these claimants, it is  		surprising that among nursing home residents the average difference between the  		monthly benefit paid and the charge in the nursing home is $1,290 -- roughly  		30% of the total costs. Even among individuals who had inflation protection  		built into their policies, out-of-pocket expenses averaged $1,000 per month. If  		individuals had an expectation that their policy would fund all of their care,  		they would be disappointed at claim time. On the other hand, if there was an  		expectation of having a significant co-payment, then their purchase decision  		would reflect the ultimate reality that they face. Recent research suggests  		that most policyholders expect their policy to pay for more than half, but less  		than all, of future long-term care costs (Miller and Cohen, 2000).</p>
<p>This finding has important implications for insurance policy design and  		marketing. In both the assisted living and home care setting, daily benefit  		amounts were more than adequate to pay for almost all of the costs of care. In  		the home care setting, not all benefits are being fully utilized, whereas in  		the nursing home, there are shortfalls in insurance benefits. Current policies  		are "fully-integrated", which means that a daily, weekly or monthly limit can  		be spent in either the community or an institutional setting. It may be  		worthwhile for companies to move back to separate benefit caps that offer  		higher levels of institutional coverage and lower levels of community coverage  		at a similar level of premium as that found for integrated policies. Or perhaps  		policies could come with inflation protection on the institutional benefit but  		not necessarily on the community benefit. Finally, making available guaranteed  		purchase options for benefit upgrades, coupled with education to policyholders  		regarding the relationship between benefit levels and service costs, would be a  		particularly important insurer action.</p>
<p>Despite gaps in dollar coverage, claimants are very satisfied with their  		policy. They experienced few problems filing their claim, had few disagreements  		with the company, and understood what their policy covered. Levels of  		satisfaction are even higher in the nursing home than they are for community  		residences. This may reflect the relative ease with which companies can verify  		eligibility and charges in the institutional setting.</p>
<p>For the most part, long-term care insurance benefits are well targeted.  		The vast majority of individuals has significant ADL dependencies or is  		cognitively impaired. More than four in five institutionalized claimants have  		over two ADL limitations. With that said, however, up to one in five assisted  		living claimants did not meet HIPAA benefit eligibility triggers at the time of  		the interview. It is possible that they were eligible at the time that they  		applied for benefits or were likely to become eligible in the very near future.  		Either way, the assisted living population appears to be even less disabled  		than claimants that are served in home care settings.</p>
<p>Whereas one might have thought that the continuum of care moves from  		home care to assisted living to nursing home care, the data present a more  		complicated picture. It appears that for some individuals, assisted living may  		actually substitute for remaining in the home and relying on formal home care  		services. In fact, receipt of home care services may not always be an option  		for many of the individuals found in assisted living, since such a large  		percentage of them are single and do not have available informal supports.  		Results from the study of home care claimants showed that most of these  		individuals could rely both on formal and informal care.</p>
<p>Other claimants in assisted living facilities faced the alternative of  		nursing home care. Fully one-quarter of assisted living residents had come from  		nursing homes. Given that the costs of care in assisted living facilities are  		typically lower, this pattern of use suggests service use efficiency. This is  		particularly true for Alzheimer's patients where a growing number are being  		served in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p>The majority of claimants in both the nursing home and assisted living  		setting indicated that the presence of insurance had little effect on the  		timing of their decision to enter either service modality. One in ten claimants  		did indicate, however, that having insurance benefits enabled them to enter an  		institutional setting somewhat earlier than they otherwise might have. These  		individuals, who tended to be older, yet less disabled, appear to have been  		motivated by social concerns and a desire to be in a protective environment.  		</p>
<p>The profile of disabled nursing home residents with long-term care  		insurance is very different than the profile of non-privately insured  		residents. The former tend to be younger, more male, and much more likely to be  		married. They also tend to have more ADL limitations and fewer skilled care  		needs. This may explain why insured residents receive fewer services: their  		care is less medically intensive and they require more palliative care for  		functional limitations and less curative care.</p>
<p>Given the differential intensity of service use, one might have expected  		that average charges for privately insured patients would be lower. Such is not  		the case. In real terms, charges to privately insured residents are 10% to 20%  		higher. This may reflect the fact that they choose more costly nursing homes or  		that nursing homes charge them more to offset inadequate Medicaid  		reimbursement. Either way, it would appear that, given their service use, these  		residents are among the most profitable to the nursing home.</p>
<p>While we do not have particularly good comparative data on assisted  		living residents, we do know that those with private insurance tend to be  		somewhat younger, more male, more likely to be married, and wealthier than  		their non-privately insured counterparts. They are also more disabled and much  		more likely to be cognitively impaired. They pay a great deal more for their  		residency as well. Having insurance enables these individuals to access the  		full continuum of service options -- from options in the community to  		institutional settings. The fact that these insured assisted living residents  		differ so much in profile from non-insured residents does suggest that, when  		significant and comprehensive insurance coverage is available, very different  		patterns of service use are likely to emerge. In particular, greater use of  		lower intensity and more home-like institutional settings is likely to  		occur.</p>
<p>All of the institutionalized individuals in this sample had the  		opportunity to use their insurance benefits in the community. That only 40%  		chose to access home and community-care services before entering their current  		institutional residence suggests that not all individuals experience a steady  		decline in functioning that enables them to move seamlessly across the  		continuum of care. Some experience rapid declines that force them to move from  		a functionally independent state in the community to a state of dependency in a  		nursing home. Others may, in fact, try to remain in the community for a short  		time, and because of either inadequate formal or informal support, need to move  		into institutional settings. Still others may want to self-pay for services in  		the community and use their insurance benefits on more costly institutional  		care. The implication, in terms of insurance policy design, is that greater  		flexibility in service coverage (i.e. integrated benefit designs) does enable  		individuals to spend their benefits on the care that they desire. Whether their  		needs are best met by their choices is a separate matter that requires  		additional empirical analysis. A final point is that some residents indicated  		that they did not know that their policy would pay for care in the home. This  		points to the need for even greater communication between the company and the  		insured, both at the time of sale and at claim time.</p>
<p>Given the rapidly changing landscape of the service delivery network,  		insurers will need to continue to emphasize flexibility in their products.  		Along with such flexibility, however, is the need to keep consumers informed  		about the relationship between benefit levels and future service costs. While  		the presence of insurance will certainly alter service utilization patterns,  		few individuals seem to be drawn more quickly to seek institutional  		alternatives just because they have insurance. What the insurance does allow,  		is the ability for disabled individuals to access a variety of services in  		alternative settings and to do so in a way that leaves these people very  		satisfied with their coverage.</p>
