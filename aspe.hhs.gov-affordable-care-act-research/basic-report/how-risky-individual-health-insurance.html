<p>This paper describes the relationship between the type of insurance  		coverage a person has in one period and the likelihood of becoming uninsured in  		the next. Using SIPP data, we find that, for people at the median health status  		("very good"), becoming uninsured is most likely for those with individual  		insurance, less likely for those with small group insurance, and least likely  		for those with large group insurance. However, we find that for people in poor  		or fair health, the chances of losing coverage are much greater for people who  		had small group insurance than for those who had individual insurance. We  		attribute these results to the offsetting effects of high loadings and  		guaranteed renewability on the individual market.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Among the various ways Americans can obtain private health insurance  		coverage, the version usually cited as most problematic is the individual  		market. Data on this market show some problems relative either to private  		employment-based group insurance or public insurance: higher premiums relative  		to benefits because of higher administrative costs and lower or no tax breaks,  		risk-based underwriting, and higher rates of turnover. Consumers clearly are  		faced with more immediate challenges in navigating the individual insurance  		market than in other settings (though we shall argue that there are some  		serious though less obvious problems in group markets as well).</p>
<p>One unanswered question about different types of health insurance  		markets, however, is in many ways the most important one: once someone has done  		what many consider to be the right thing and obtained insurance before becoming  		a high risk, how likely is he or she to stick with insurance if a high risk  		condition hits? To what extent can being or becoming a high risk trigger the  		loss of insurance coverage? We know that the great majority of high risk people  		uninsured at any point in time had some private insurance sometime in their  		lives, so one way to diminish the problem of the high risk uninsured would be  		to emphasize insurance arrangements that have a lower likelihood of people  		losing coverage (or have higher "persistence"), especially when they transition  		into high risk states. We also know that the vast majority of people start out  		their adult lives as low risks, and only become higher risks as they age and  		chronic conditions pile up. Social concern about losing coverage should apply  		to people at all risk levels, but we probably are more concerned about the  		retention of coverage by people who are or become high health risks, since  		insurance-impacted access to care may have the greatest short run consequences  		for health for people who are already sickly.</p>
<p>The common negative perception of individual insurance, based largely on  		its high administrative cost and lack of tax advantages, suggests that it might  		score poorly on the persistence scale, and especially for higher risks. But  		there is a feature unique to individual insurance which potentially works in  		the opposite direction: guaranteed renewability at class average rates. This is  		a policy provision in which the insurer promises not to increase premiums  		differentially based on health risk for people seeking to renew. While  		individual insurance is medically underwritten when newly issued, and while the  		insurer is free to raise premiums for all in a class, individual insurance is  		not supposed to be "re-underwritten" if one buyer's risk should change; the  		initial buyer has an unqualified right to renew at the rate charged to others  		in the class, regardless of any change in his or her health state. Group  		insurance, in contrast, is often not guaranteed renewable at premiums  		independent of risk changes at the group level (depending on state insurance  		regulations and whether or not the group self-insures), because changes in  		group membership as workers quit or are hired over time may change group risk  		or experience. More importantly, there is no guarantee whatsoever of a  		continued long term offer of coverage at nondiscriminatory rates to individual  		employees (or their dependents) who leave the firm's employment, whatever the  		offer of insurance to those who remain in the group. The Health Insurance  		Portability and Accountability Act "guaranteed issue" rules that protect some  		workers leaving a group and transitioning to individual coverage do not specify  		anything about future premiums, and, in particular, do not preclude the  		possibility that the offering of nongroup coverage to someone who became a high  		risk is at extremely high premiums.</p>
<p>For group insurance the economically relevant premium is whatever the  		employees might have been explicitly charged for insurance (the "employee  		share") plus the portion of the premium the workers paid by devoting a portion  		of their compensation to a benefit the employer paid directly to the insurer  		(the "employer share"). Specifically, employees who become high risk and lose  		their jobs have at best temporary protection at average group premiums under  		Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) provisions, but they  		will be left without a guarantee of the opportunity to obtain coverage at the  		previous group premiums after 18 months.</p>
<p>This paper reports on analysis of panel data intended to see whether  		guaranteed renewability provisions in individual insurance actually do provide  		protection against losing coverage as written, and to what extent they provide  		better protection to high risks compared to group insurance. (We cannot  		conclusively rule out some insurer re-underwriting because we cannot know the  		details of how relative premiums changed, but we can see whether anything  		happened to cause the person to drop coverage.) There has been a fear that some  		individual insurers are able to avoid carrying out the obligations the policy  		provisions appear to impose,<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> by such strategies as dropping entire classes  		of insurance. Whatever is reported in a few anecdotes, the more important  		question is how the protection actually held by a full set of workers with  		individual insurance with guaranteed renewability differs from that provided to  		a similar set of workers who have group insurance. </p>
<p>Specifically, we use recent data from the Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (SIPP), a relatively large panel survey, to see what happens over  		time to people who initially obtained different kinds of insurance coverage. We  		examine differences in the absolute and relative probabilities of becoming  		uninsured at insurance renewal time for workers at different risk levels who  		had individual insurance, small group insurance, and large group insurance, for  		two different lengths of time with the initial form of insurance.</p>
<p>Our analysis is complementary to the recent study by Ziller et  		al.<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> who also explored  		SIPP data on insurance coverage. They only looked at people with individual  		insurance, and looked at those who terminated spells of this type of insurance  		for a wide variety of alternatives (group insurance, public insurance, and  		becoming uninsured), not at those who persisted. In contrast, we compare people  		who started with group insurance as well as individual insurance, and look at  		determinants of the absolute and relative probability of becoming uninsured.  		Specifically, we ask what are the odds that someone at a given level of health  		status who had either individual or group coverage already in the previous year  		becomes uninsured in the next time period (the difference in absolute  		probability). We also ask how the odds of becoming uninsured vary with the risk  		level for people with each type of coverage (the difference in relative  		probability). However, we only look at the outcome of becoming uninsured, and  		do not ask whether the coverage that continues is the initial coverage the  		person had or some substitute (another type of private coverage or Medicaid  		coverage) that he or she was able to obtain.</p>
<h2><a name="concept" id="concept">A CONCEPTUAL MODEL</a></h2>
<p>We suppose that people are risk averse, so they potentially value  		insurance, compared to the alternative of taking a chance on various levels of  		out of pocket payment. However, whether they will choose coverage in any given  		time period will depend both on the premium they would have to pay and on the  		expected benefits they would expect to collect. That is, a person is most  		likely to obtain insurance if the premium is low but the risk of seeking  		medical care (and therefore the benefits to be collected on average from a  		given policy) is high.</p>
<p>A measure that combines both of these factors is the "net loading" for  		an insurance policy: the difference between the net-of-taxes premium the person  		pays and the average benefits they might collect; this is usually measured as a  		proportion of the premium. The higher the loading, the less likely the person  		is to buy insurance in the first place. But what about the willingness to  		continue with coverage? Clearly that will be lower should the loading increase.  		But it also seems plausible to assume that, the higher a constant-over-time  		loading (and therefore the lower the net benefit) from insurance that one had  		bought, the greater the likelihood of failing to renew. A fall in disposable  		income, the onset of some other financial emergency, or even just lower  		marketing of or attention to the need for coverage is more likely to lead to  		neglect to renew when the price of insurance relative to its benefits was not  		very advantageous in their first place.</p>
<p>We can use this model to predict when there will be greater likelihood  		of dropping or losing coverage. On average, insurance net-of-tax loading is  		known to be lowest for large group insurance, higher for small group insurance,  		and highest of all for individual insurance.<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> The loading in group insurance is reduced both  		by the lower resource cost of administering such insurance and the fact that,  		compared to individual insurance, the potential tax advantages are greater. The  		worker who receives compensation in the form of a partially employer paid  		premium can avoid income and payroll taxes on that amount of income, and the  		adoption of a Section 125 or cafeteria plan can shield any explicit employee  		premium from income taxes. In contrast, a person who buys individual insurance  		cannot reduce payroll taxes, and can reduce income taxes only if self employed  		and itemizing deductions, and only toward the end of the observation period.  		These observations imply that the likelihood of continuation of coverage for a  		person of average risk at a given income level should be greatest in large  		group insurance and lowest in individual insurance, with small group insurance  		being intermediate.</p>
<p>The more complex question has to do with the level of and variation in  		risk. As a benchmark, if premiums were always proportional to initial risk  		(perfect risk rating and therefore constant percentage loading) we would in  		theory expect initial purchases to be independent of the level of risk as long  		as household income was high enough that the premium itself was "affordable" in  		one of several senses.<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>If risk were then to increase with the onset of a costly chronic  		condition, whether coverage would continue would depend on what would happen to  		the net premium the person would have access to. Here is where the answer to  		the question of developing plausible hypotheses is somewhat murky. For  		individual insurance with guaranteed renewability, the most plausible  		hypothesis is at least somewhat clear: if the premium is guaranteed not to jump  		when risk increases, the person who becomes a higher risk should if anything  		actually be more likely to continue coverage than the person who remains a low  		or average risk. For group insurance, a key determinant of future premiums and  		coverage is employment status. If workers can hang onto the job, they can  		continue to obtain group coverage at a total net of tax premium (taking account  		both of explicit premiums and wage offsets) that remains low and constant.  		Moreover, as Madrian<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note5">5</a></font></sup>  		has shown, people who become higher risks who can keep a given job with  		coverage tend to do so: there is "job lock" for higher risks especially. But if  		reasonably good health is needed to retain employment, the person who becomes a  		higher risk and can no longer hold a job will surely face a very large increase  		in potential premium: the group coverage will disappear as an option (at least  		by the end of any COBRA continuation) and the only options in most states will  		be individual insurance at very high medically underwritten premiums, or a high  		risk pool at high premiums (if the pool is accepting more members). Moreover,  		in many states a small group's premium can be subject to a large increase if a  		worker or dependent becomes higher risk.<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> Thus the impact on the likelihood of retaining  		coverage under group insurance depends on a host of conflicting influences: the  		low future premium for the person who keeps their job, the stronger incentive  		to hold onto that job, but the much higher premium for the person who loses  		their job. It may also matter whether the "owner" of the insurance is the  		working family member who is a high risk; if the unhealthy person is covered  		under a small group family plan owned by another household member, there will  		be an incentive to hang onto group coverage, but also the possibility of a  		large increase in experience rated premiums. What will actually happen in the  		face of these conflicting incentives and circumstances is an empirical  		question.</p>
<h2><a name="spec" id="spec">DATA AND MODEL SPECIFICATION</a></h2>
<p>We use the nationally representative SIPP data which covers the period  		2000-2004. Participants are interviewed every four months. The sample is split  		into four groups, so that every month, one fourth of the participants are  		interviewed about the preceding four months. If households, or adults (defined  		as individuals 15 or older) within a household, move they are followed to their  		new address. The data in the SIPP is split into two groups -- core data  		(including employment and health insurance status) which is asked at every  		interview, and topical data, which is asked yearly (or less  		frequently).<sup><font><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> Our sample  		consists of people who reported being employed at the observation of initial  		insurance coverage; it includes both men and women workers, and among those  		with individual coverage are both self employed workers and other workers who  		bought individual rather than group coverage, generally because the latter was  		not offered. Workers may be covered either as the primary insured or owner of  		the policy or as a dependent on a family policy. We wanted to include workers  		who were dependents since their health status would affect risk-rated family  		premiums for individual insurance, at least initially. We combine the periodic  		waves into annual intervals, since most insurance policies provide coverage for  		12 months. (There are some explicitly temporary individual policies which can  		be taken for various intervals of time and do not carry guaranteed  		renewability, but their market share is small.)</p>
<p>While individuals in the SIPP can in principle be followed for some  		time, both attrition and complexity grow the longer we try to follow a given  		individual. Attrition is especially a problem for the individual market which,  		even in this large sample data set, starts with a relatively small number of  		observations and goes down from there. Accordingly, we are able to look at  		insurance purchasers who were documented as being insured only for one year  		(that is, observed for two years); however, this is long enough for renewal to  		be an issue. We then ask: given that we have observed a person with a given  		type of insurance for one year, what determines the probability that the person  		will be uninsured in the next period? </p>
<p>In addition to the initial type of insurance, we also have measures of  		household income, change in income, sex, and the level of the worker's health  		status in the initial period. Over a two-year time frame there are too few  		changes in health status to justify including change in worker health status as  		a regressor, and in preliminary specifications the change in health status was  		not statistically significant. However, many of the workers who are in worse  		health states made the transition from lower (if not low) risk in the recent  		past.</p>
<p><a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#table1">Table 1</a> shows means for the sample we study, the  		sample of people who had a given type of coverage for at least one year. Many  		of the people in this sample probably had that coverage for longer than one  		year, but we can only track their experience from the first time we observe  		them.</p>
<p>The most interesting finding in <a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#table1">Table 1</a> is the  		proportion in each insurance setting who became uninsured at the end of the  		indicated period. As expected, that proportion is lowest for people in large  		groups and highest for those with individual coverage. The average household  		income is considerably higher for those who work in large groups, and the  		individual coverage sample is disproportionately female. </p>
<p>The large group sample had so low a rate of dropping coverage that  		formal analysis would not be meaningful. This reinforces a well known  		proposition: large group coverage is good if you can get it (and good  		[high-paying] large firm jobs carry good insurance). We therefore concentrated  		on comparing persistence and its determinants in the small group versus the  		individual samples. </p>
<p>To understand the determinants of dropping coverage in each sample, we  		estimated logit regressions that relate the (log) odds of dropping or losing  		coverage to various covariates, including health status as a measure of risk  		level. Health state was transformed into a continuous variable (with "poor"  		being one and "excellent" being five. </p>
<p>All regressions were statistically significant according to the Wald  		test. The multivariate analysis indicated that income, sex, and age are  		significantly related to the odds of dropping coverage. Higher income and older  		workers in both the small group and individual samples were less likely than  		younger workers to drop. Those with a larger increase in wages were less likely  		to drop all coverage in the group sample while there is no effect of risk in  		the individual sample.</p>
<p>Foreshadowing our general results, being in worse health substantially  		increases the odds of dropping coverage for small group insurance for both  		samples. That is, the worse is health status, the greater is the likelihood of  		losing all coverage in the small group market (higher relative probability).  		Regression coefficients from the logit regressions are shown in  		<a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p>We also explored another specification in which health state was a  		binary, with those with "fair" or "poor" health in one category, and those with  		"good," "very good," and "excellent" in the other. The measures of goodness of  		fit were less good for this specification but the overall pattern was the same  		as that shown with the continuous measure: people initially with small group  		coverage who were in fair or poor health were more likely than those in good to  		excellent health to lose coverage, whereas there was no effect of health status  		for those with individual coverage.</p>
<p>Because the relationships of variables are complex in the logit  		functional form, and the numerical magnitudes of regression coefficients hard  		to interpret, we present some sample results derived from these regressions by  		a simulation. We simulate the probability of losing coverage as a function of  		health status for three hypothetical workers: a middle aged male, a young male,  		and a young female worker. </p>
<p>In the small group sample, male workers were very rarely covered under a  		spouse's plan, so their relationship between risk and dropping coverage will be  		affected by ability to work. <a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#table2A">Table 2a</a> and  		<a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#table2b">Table 2b</a> show the estimated probabilities that a younger  		and older male who had insurance for at least one year dropped all insurance  		coverage in the subsequent period. <a href="how-risky-individual-health-insurance.html#table2c">Table 2c</a> shows the  		results for young women, who have a lower probability of dropping then young  		men but who display the same health effect in the small group market. At the  		median health status ("very good"), as expected, the dropout rates for small  		group coverage were consistently lower than those for individual coverage.  		However, the most striking finding is that this order is reversed for workers  		with health status "fair" or "poor." Sicker workers initially with group  		coverage are more likely to lose any and all coverage compared to healthier  		workers in the same setting. They were also more likely to lose coverage  		compared to similarly sick workers with individual coverage. That is, in small  		group insurance, less healthy workers are relatively more likely to lose  		coverage than healthier workers and are also absolutely more likely to lose  		coverage when they are in the small group setting than when they are in the  		individual setting. </p>
<p>In the simulations as in the regressions, the individual coverage  		dropout rates do not vary strongly with health status. There is an apparent  		"protective" effect of lower health status, but this is based on a coefficient  		that is not statistically significant.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the relationship of health state to losing  		coverage for those with group insurance is reasonably clear for those (almost  		exclusively male) workers who were the primary source of insurance coverage:  		the most likely reason why these workers lose coverage when they are in poor  		health is that they cannot continue working. However, the relationship might be  		different for those workers who were covered as dependents under family  		coverage, primarily working wives in two worker households, since poor health  		of a working spouse covered as a dependent does not directly impact the primary  		insured's job tenure (though some workers may need to quit to care for a sick  		spouse). We therefore further investigated the relationship between health  		status and continuation of coverage for the subsample of workers initially with  		small group coverage who were not the "owners" of insurance coverage. We found  		effects very similar in sign to the full sample; the magnitudes of the impact  		of health state were a little lower (but still significant). However, female  		workers with small group coverage were less likely than males to drop or lose  		coverage at all health state levels. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>The results reported above are consistent with two frequently debated  		and somewhat conflicting empirical propositions: that individual insurance is  		more costly than group insurance, but that individual insurance provides better  		protection for people who become high risks than does group insurance.  		Specifically, for an initially insured person of average or better risk,  		dropping back (or out) to no health insurance coverage is more likely if the  		coverage was expensive individual insurance than if it was cheaper and tax  		subsidized group insurance. But group insurance has a tear in its net of  		protection: it leaves a person who becomes sick, possibly too sick to work at  		the same job, more vulnerable to losing any and all coverage. </p>
<p>The point estimate that a young male high risk who had small group  		coverage faces a 44% chance of becoming uninsured in the next period, a risk  		nearly twice times as great as if he had individual insurance, might be large  		enough to get policy attention. Somewhat ironically, the usual blame for such a  		person lacking coverage will be laid at the door of the medically underwriting  		individual insurer which quotes a high premium, rather than referred to the  		group insurance system that plunged this person into such a vulnerable  		situation in the first place.</p>
<p>In summary, neither the individual nor the group insurance system is  		strictly preferable to the other; they both have advantages and disadvantages.  		It would be possible to design a group policy that did provide the protection  		it now lacks: build in guaranteed renewability at low risk premiums for small  		group insureds upon conversion to individual coverage. However desirable this  		feature might be from a social perspective, and despite the fact that  		group-to-individual conversion is offered by some insurers, it might be a hard  		sell to many employers. Employers may want to offer insurance to attract  		employees if and only if they continue to work for the employer; the employer  		may balk at appearing to pay more up front to provide protection for employees  		who quit or get fired. Perhaps wise employers might see that by offering  		workers a less risky framework for insurance purchasing they could get better  		workers for the same money wage, or could get workers to sacrifice even more  		alternative compensation for such an attractive benefit. </p>
<p>At least in the short run, leveling the tax playing field between  		individual and group coverage might be help with (though not solve) this  		problem, as with many others. At a minimum, some of the negative perception of  		individual insurance may be undeserved.</p>
