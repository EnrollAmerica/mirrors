<h2>November 2, 1994</h2>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide background information for the  		Working Group Meeting on Personal Assistance to be hosted by the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of the U.S. Department  		of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C. on November 10, 1994. The  		purposes of the meeting are to: (1) select high priority policy-relevant  		research questions; (2) define research strategies in the context of existing  		research, resources, and data; and (3) to identify cost-effective studies  		appropriate to ASPE.</p>
<h2>II. CONCEPTUAL FRAME WORK </h2>
<h3>A. Personal Assistance Services: An Emerging  		Paradigm </h3>
<p>Personal assistance services (PAS) is a broadly inclusive  		term used to refer to any and all forms of assistance that enable persons with  		disabilities to accomplish tasks that the individual would normally do  		himself if he or she did not have a disability. (Litvak et al. 1991).  		Such tasks include--but are not limited to--personal care (i.e., basic  		Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) as bathing, dressing, transferring, eating,  		toileting) or to other maintenance ADLs (i.e., those generally included in  		Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) scales--such as shopping,  		housecleaning, meal preparation, doing laundry, etc.). PAS is not limited to  		services provided in specific settings (e.g., the home). Nor is PAS limited to  		human assistance. PAS can also include assistive technologies, environmental  		adaptations (including transportation services), animal assistance (e.g., guide  		dogs), and the appropriate training for utilizing both human and other forms of  		assistance. </p>
<p>The growing popularity of the term PAS as a replacement or synonym for  		home and community-based long-term care--reflects a  		reconceptualization of long-term care policies, programs, and services to take  		into account the needs of persons of all ages (not just those aged 65 and over)  		for functional assistance. Specifically, PAS reflects the  		philosophy of the Independent Living Movement for persons with disabilities. As  		such, the PAS concept encompasses modalities of assistance intended to enable  		persons with disabilities to engage in any and all life activities that  		nondisabled persons normally pursue: going to school, going to work,  		socializing with friends, participating in sports, hobbies, and other  		recreational activities, and attending community functions. </p>
<p>Until recently, the presumed purposes of long-term care, including home  		and community-based services, have been rather narrower in focus.  		Long-term care policy and research initiatives have been defined  		almost exclusively around the perceived service needs of frail  		elders--persons aged at least 65 but more often 75 or 80 and older whose  		chronic health problems and related disabilities necessitate or put them at  		risk of receiving care in a nursing home or related facility. The probability  		that disability will lead to nursing home use increases dramatically with age.  		Hence the traditional focus on frail elders has meant that the  		design of financing mechanisms and service delivery systems for home and  		community-based long-term care services has been typically conceptualized  		in terms of alternatives to institutionalization. </p>
<p>Even when home and community-based services targeted at frail elders  		have envisioned more than just preventing or postponing nursing home entry, the  		scope of services has been limited by implicit assumptions about retirement  		lifestyles. Persons of advanced aged are believed to lead comparatively  		inactive and home-centered lives in which maintenance rather than  		goal-oriented or productive activities take up most of the day. Relationships  		with other people are assumed to be largely limited to a small--and very likely  		shrinking--circle of close family, old friends, and long-time neighbors. </p>
<p>Over the past ten years or so, there has been a growing societal  		recognition of the barriers that often prevent persons with  		disabilities--especially those below the normal retirement age of 65--from  		active participation in the kinds of life activities (i.e., school, work)  		engaged in by their nondisabled peers. The most recent major embodiment of this  		rising awareness is the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This landmark  		piece of legislation has created a civil rights framework according to which  		government and the private sector are increasingly being held accountable for  		promoting and facilitating access by persons with disabilities. The initial  		emphasis was on physical access to public places and via public transportation.  		The focus then moved to expansion of educational and employment opportunities.  		Most recently, the focus has begun to shift again toward greater attention to  		the financing and delivery of health care and related services such as PAS.  		Viewed against the backdrop of the ADA, policy makers are beginning to realize  		that the traditional aims of home care programs and policies are  		very limited and, as such, may be limiting--albeit unintentionally--of the  		potential of persons with disabilities. </p>
<h3>B. The Policy Context: Health Reform 1993 and Beyond  		</h3>
<p>ASPE--most specifically the Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term  		Care Policy (DALTCP)--played a central role in developing the long-term care  		provisions of President Clintons Health Care Reform plan. The centerpiece  		of the plans long-term care proposals was a greatly expanded home and  		community-based long-term care services program for people with significant  		disabilities of all ages. It was estimated that 3.1 million Americans would  		qualify for benefits and that nearly one-third of these individuals would be  		younger than age 65. Eligibility criteria for the benefit explicitly sought to  		bring in persons with certain disabling conditions that have often been  		overlooked in the past as bases for inclusion in the long-term care population.  		These target populations included persons with serious mental illness, persons  		with severe and profound mental retardation, and children with severe medical  		conditions or developmental disabilities under age six. </p>
<p>In response to input from consumers with disabilities and their  		advocates, the Presidents long-term care reform proposals deliberately  		emphasized consumer empowerment in a variety of ways. In particular, consumers  		were afforded more choice and control through the inclusion of a requirement  		that States make personal assistance services available through both  		consumer-directed and professionally managed modes of provision. In addition,  		States were given the option to offer cash allowance and vouchers rather than  		paying directly for services. States were also given the option of capitating  		long-term care benefits for inclusion in managed health care arrangements.  		Finally, rather than listing defined benefits that could be covered, States  		were given the flexibility to tailor services specifically to the needs to  		individual beneficiaries. </p>
<p>The Clinton plan also included tax incentives for the purchase of PAS by  		individuals. These provisions were intended to facilitate the employment of  		persons with disabilities. </p>
<p>Although the 103rd Congress did not enact the Presidents health  		reform initiative, the proposed legislation is likely to serve as the starting  		point for future discussions about long-term care reform. Although the focus of  		future health reform initiatives may have shifted to the individual States in  		the immediate future, this does not in any way diminish the policy relevance of  		the issues raised in the design of the Clinton plans long-term care  		reform proposals. </p>
<p>First and foremost, the concept of a generic long-term care  		system that encompasses the needs of persons with disabilities across all ages,  		diagnoses, and conditions is now firmly established. The Clinton long-term care  		reform proposal also attempted to reframe some of the key issues in policy and  		program design by acknowledging the desires of many persons with disabilities  		for more choice among service modalities and more possibilities for  		consumer-direction. However, the changes in direction introduced in the Clinton  		plan were not without controversy. Most notably: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Some key supporters of long-term care reform in the Congress felt  			 that Federal policy should provide much more direction to the States in terms  			 of defining and mandating quality assurance safeguards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some advocacy organizations expressed concern about the lack of  			 definition of services that would and would not be covered in the new  			 Federal/State program. Some advocates for persons with particular types of  			 disabling conditions were skeptical that the types of PAS appropriate to their  			 constituencies would be included in State plans. Some advocates also worried  			 that many younger persons would be ineligible for coverage, despite the  			 severity of their needs due to the proposed new programs emphasis on ADLs  			 as eligibility criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State officials questioned the accuracy of underlying assumptions  			 used to arrive at budget estimates for the proposed capped Federal  			 funding--especially given that the proposed new program would be required to  			 serve persons of all ages. Although the program did not, legally speaking,  			 create an individual, disability- based entitlement to services,  			 States were explicitly prohibited from using age, type of condition, or  			 severity of disability criteria to prioritize applicants if funding proved  			 inadequate to serve all who met the Federally-defined eligibility criteria.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>These and other concerns raised about the Clinton long-term care  		proposals seem to ASPE staff to flag issues in need of further research. </p>
<h2>III. INVENTORY OF POLICY ISSUES, KNOWLEDGE GAPS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH  		DIRECTIONS </h2>
<h3>A. Measuring PAS Needs, Service Use, and Costs in  		Relation to Persons with Disabilities Under Age 65</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues</b></i></p>
<p>Population-based estimates of need for services as well as  			 information about likely service use cost patterns are required to project  			 public program funding requirements. It is important to develop a capacity to  			 project the amount, type, and likely cost of services among individuals with  			 particular kinds of disabilities, at different ages. It is also important to  			 understand the impact of defining certain kinds of services as ones that may or  			 may not be covered--e.g., psychosocial habilitation and rehabilitation services  			 for the mentally retarded and mentally ill. It is equally vital to understand  			 the service use and cost consequences of providing services via particular  			 service delivery models or modes (e.g., independent provider as compared to  			 agency-employer personal assistants). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway</b></i></p>
<p>There is a wealth of nationally representative survey data available  			 on the functional assistance needs of community-dwelling persons aged 65 and  			 older and their patterns of formal and informal services use. In contrast, the  			 1990 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) has been the only source  			 of nationally representative survey data on younger adults with disabilities.  			 Nationally representative survey data on children under age 15 has been all but  			 nonexistent. </p>
<p>To address the dearth of nationally representative data on the  			 under-65 disabled population, ASPE has led a consortium of Federal agencies in  			 supporting the design, development, and funding of the Disability Survey, a  			 supplement to the 1994 and 1995 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). Phase  			 I interviews screen in relevant populations and collect basic descriptive  			 information about people with disabilities, including their disabling  			 conditions and the nature, severity, and duration of their disabilities. Phase  			 I interviews began in January 1994 and will continue through December 1995. The  			 Phase II interviews (conducted several months after Phase I) will collect  			 detailed information on how people with disabilities live (i.e., their housing,  			 transportation, and employment arrangements) and their service use and  			 expenditure patterns. Phase II interviews begin in late 1994 and will continue  			 until the fall of 1996. Nationwide, about 250,000 people in one million  			 households will participate in Phase I and approximately 40,000 people will be  			 included in Phase II.</p>
<p>ASPE has also funded, via an Interagency Agreement with the Census  			 Bureau, special analyses of 1990 Census questions on disability. Due to the  			 stringent confidentiality restrictions governing the 1990 Census, these  			 analyses can only be performed by the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>In addition, ASPE has awarded a number of grants focusing on the  			 service needs and services use of children with disabilities. In the area of  			 measurement development, ASPE has funded an assessment of the policy  			 implications of alternative functional definitions of disability among  			 children. The Principal Investigator of this study is Ruth Stein at the Albert  			 Einstein College of Medicine, Brooklyn, New York. Another grant, to Peter  			 Brandon at the University of Wisconsin, attempts to measure the use of formal  			 child care and the need for specialized child care services for families of  			 children with disabilities. Projects at Johns Hopkins University and the  			 University of Chicago will analyze data bases from Washington State and  			 Illinois (respectively) concerning patterns of service use by disabled  			 children. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>Are there particular age groups and types of disabilities--in  			 addition to disabled children under age six--who are likely to be seriously  			 under represented in national surveys? Are there any untapped data sources  			 (i.e., available but un or under analyzed data bases) pertaining to these  			 groups? What new data collection strategies are appropriate for obtaining  			 information about these groups? </p>
<p>Are minority group persons with disabilities likely to be under  			 represented in national data bases? Are there particular groups with special  			 needs or potential problems in accessing services that merit special research  			 efforts? </p>
<p>Is there a need to develop measures beyond the traditional ADL/IADLs  			 for measuring service needs that may be appropriate for persons with particular  			 types of disabilities? Do ADL and IADL impairment measures adequately capture  			 the range of service needs among younger disabled persons who are expected to  			 attend school or who may be able to work? Are there measures that have been  			 developed that should be tested? </p>
<p>What is the potential to use State Medicaid claims or other program  			 data bases for analyzing cost patterns? </p>
<p>How can we address the problems posed by existing patterns of  			 service use being so heavily influenced by the rules and regulations of  			 existing payment sources? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>B. Quality Assurance </h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>A substantial percentage (almost half) of public programs that  			 currently finance PAS services permit personal attendant services to be  			 provided only through licensed home health or home care agencies. Such  			 requirements contradict the strongly expressed preferences of many persons with  			 disabilities, especially those under age 65 who are involved in the Independent  			 Living Movement, to hire, fire, and manage their own providers. On the other  			 hand, many other States limit consumer choice by requiring the use of  			 independent providers because this mode is believed to be more cost efficient.  			 Whereas some PAS users may wish to hire and manage their own assistants, others  			 may find this responsibility a burden or may feel ill prepared to undertake it.  			 Still other consumers may be mentally incapable of hiring and managing their  			 own assistants. </p>
<p>Programs requiring the use of independent providers also raise  			 questions about the adequacy of public accountability vis a vis quality and  			 safety issues, including client vulnerability to provider abuse or neglect. Can  			 clients adequately judge the quality of care they are receiving? Are they able  			 and willing to take appropriate actions even when they know that they realize  			 that they are receiving substandard services or even when they know that they  			 are being abused and exploited? Is it possible to assure timely access to  			 back-up and replacement sources of help and to arrange for liability insurance  			 protection when consumers are responsible for hiring their own independent  			 providers? </p>
<p>Many of the same issues come up with respect to case management by  			 State-employed case managers or provide agencies that specialize in providing  			 case management services. For example, to what extent should receipt of case  			 management services or the nature and frequency of case management be a matter  			 of consumer choice? </p>
<p>How much risk of untoward consequences are PAS consumers willing to  			 assume in connection with consumer direction and what level of risk is  			 politically acceptable? If future policy directions promote greater choice  			 among modalities of care provision, what criteria--if any--should be used to  			 override consumer preferences and assign individuals to consumer-directed  			 versus professionally managed service modes? Advocates argue that the abilities  			 and willingness of consumers to assume management responsibilities should be  			 determined through an objective assessment process (Nosek 1991). However,  			 formal assessment is not standard practice. </p>
<p>Advocates also argue that consumers who want to manage their own  			 providers should be afforded opportunities for training in PAS management  			 skills and some consumers may only become capable of managing their own  			 providers if they receive such training. Independent Living Centers routinely  			 offer training in PAS management for persons with disabilities and the  			 Administration on Developmental Disabilities has funded training programs in  			 self-advocacy for individuals with developmental disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>We have identified only a handful of studies--mostly very  			 small-scale--that have attempted to measure preferences for or compare outcomes  			 of consumer- directed versus professionally managed services. In 1991, the  			 Commonwealth Fund sponsored a survey in three States of low-income individuals  			 age 65 and older receiving Medicaid funded personal care services in which  			 clients who reported more consumer choice also reported higher levels of  			 satisfaction. Mattson-Prince (1994) has reported favorable health and  			 psychosocial outcomes associated with provision of services through an  			 independent living model of consumer-directed PAS as compared to  			 agency-provided services, based on data collected from a small sample of  			 persons with spinal cord injuries. Similarly, positive outcomes were also found  			 to be associated with consumer direction in a National Institute for Disability  			 and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) study carried out by the Human Service  			 Research Institute and the United Cerebral Palsy Association that involved a  			 small sample of consumers with mobility, sensory, and cognitive impairments  			 (Kimmich 1991). </p>
<p>Additional NIDRR-sponsored projects focusing on outcomes of  			 consumer- directed as compared to professionally managed services are currently  			 underway at Baylor Universitys Center for Research on Women with  			 Disabilities, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, and the World Institute on  			 Disability (WID). </p>
<p>ASPE has just awarded a contract to the University of California at  			 Los Angeles (A.E. Benjamin, Principal Investigator) to design and carry out a  			 survey of PAS consumers in Californias In-Home Supportive Services  			 Program (IHSS). The study will compare outcomes associated with client-directed  			 modes of service provision (independent provider and supported independent  			 provider) and professionally managed (agency) services. Outcomes measures  			 include consumer satisfaction, health status, consumer safety, and consumer  			 empowerment. This study builds on related research, now nearly completed, that  			 was sponsored by the State of California and conducted by Carol Barnes at  			 Sacramento State University. </p>
<p>In 1993, ASPE has funded a Task Order contract (with SysteMetrics,  			 Inc., Cambridge, MA) to examine the criteria that State home and  			 community-based services programs use to determine whether or not clients do or  			 do not need case management and at what levels of intensity. Case studies  			 focused on State-administered, statewide programs in Maine, Connecticut,  			 Washington, and Oregon as well as localized programs in Ohio (two county-funded  			 programs) and California (a hospital-affiliated program). This study is nearing  			 completion. </p>
<p>The WID and a few other programs have done some adaptation of  			 independent living skills training programs to make them appropriate to elderly  			 users of PAS. </p>
<p>With respect to liability concerns, the Commonwealth Fund sponsored  			 some preliminary research several years ago by Marshall Kapp at Wayne State  			 University and Charles Sabatino at the American Bar Association (Committee on  			 Legal Problems of the Elderly). Through a Task Order contract with  			 SysteMetrics, Inc., ASPE examined existing concerns about and methods of  			 addressing liability in eight States (Flanagan 1994). Nearing completion is a  			 study of liability issues affecting consumer-directed PAS. It is directed by  			 Simi Litvak of WID and Charles Sabatino and funded by the Retirement Research  			 Foundation. The study addresses tax law, personal injury, and  			 licensure/certification liability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>How can we gauge consumer preferences for consumer-direction or for  			 professional case management or quality monitoring, given that existing  			 programs tend to offer little choice? </p>
<p>Are there other ways of conceptualizing  			 consumer-directed PAS besides the independent provider  			 mode? Do other models already exist that could be evaluated? Or would it be  			 preferable to develop models that could be demonstrated and find sites where  			 they might be implemented? </p>
<p>What priority should be given to evaluating the effectiveness of PAS  			 management training? If such research seems worthwhile, what existing training  			 programs might be good candidates for evaluation? </p>
<p>Can ASPE facilitate clarification of Federal tax and labor laws that  			 pertain to employers of independent providers? Should guidelines for States and  			 employers be developed? </p>

</ol><h3>C. Assistants: Paid and Unpaid </h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>Most persons with disabilities of all ages receive PAS predominantly  			 from informal helpers--i.e., unpaid family, friends, and neighbors. According  			 to the 1990 SIPP, which is the only source of comparative data available,  			 younger persons with disabilities rely even more heavily on informal supports  			 than do older persons. Informal caregiving accounts for 92 percent of  			 caregiving to the nonelderly and 83 percent for the elderly. (Adler 1994). </p>
<p>It is not clear, however, to what extent such heavy reliance on  			 informal support is due to lack of access to--including inability to  			 afford--paid assistance versus a genuine preference for relying on family  			 members. Advocates point out that persons with disabilities who have no choice  			 but to depend on family for unpaid assistance may be hampered in their efforts  			 to develop or to maintain levels of independence and self-direction that might  			 otherwise be achievable. This can be so at any age, but is particularly true of  			 individuals who are born with disabilities or who develop disabilities prior to  			 adulthood and rely on their parents for PAS. Dependence on parental assistance  			 poses additional problems in cases where children with disabilities can expect  			 to outlive their parents-- which is becoming more and more the norm. </p>
<p>The appropriate public role in helping persons with disabilities  			 gain access to paid assistance--at least in regard to long-term care for the  			 elderly--has traditionally been seen as largely limited to assisting and  			 providing respite to family caregivers. Substitution of formal for informal  			 services is seen as legitimate only in those situations in which disabled  			 elders lack close family or their family caregivers have died or become  			 incapacitated or where there appears to be serious potential for abuse. </p>
<p>However, for a child to continue being dependent on parental support  			 into adulthood runs counter to cultural expectations in our society. Thus,  			 accessing help from nonfamily members--which for persons who need extensive  			 assistance must include substantial paid assistance--is increasingly being seen  			 by many advocates for younger persons with disabilities as an important  			 developmental step and rite of passage. That is, obtaining paid  			 assistance is viewed as part of the normal maturation process for a person with  			 disabilities seeking to negotiate the transition from child to adult. </p>
<p>Moreover, concerns are increasingly being raised about the  			 feasibility and the fairness of maintaining traditional expectations for family  			 members to provide informal assistance, especially now that most women are in  			 the paid workforce as much out of economic necessity as by desire. Many  			 advocates believe that if persons with disabilities prefer to have family  			 members provide the assistance they require, they should be able to pay them.  			 Whereas some public programs permit family members to be employed as paid  			 caregivers; others do not. </p>
<p>At the same time, many persons with disabilities and their advocates  			 are troubled by a prevailing market for PAS in which persons with disabilities  			 cannot readily obtain the assistance they need without becoming involved in  			 what seems to many to be the exploitation of service workers who  			 are poorly paid and often lack access to pension, health insurance,  			 unemployment compensation, and other employee benefits. In addition, the  			 current structure of the job market for PAS workers leaves many assistants  			 unemployed or only able to find part-time employment for significant periods of  			 time in any given year. Opportunities for promotion and advancement are rare.  			 These and other unattractive features of PAS work create problems for  			 recruitment and retention of individuals with the appropriate skills and  			 attitudes to provide high quality PAS services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>There is an extensive literature on informal elder care that, from a  			 polity perspective, has focused especially on aspects of stress and burden  			 among family caregivers and on the usefulness of respite services. Much less  			 work seems to have been done around family caregiving in relation to younger  			 persons with disabilities. </p>
<p>Nathan Linsk, et al. (1988) have done seminal work in regard to  			 public policies toward payment of family caregivers and some recent studies are  			 examining such policies in international comparative perspective. </p>
<p>Bill Crown at Brandeis University and SysteMetrics, Inc. and his  			 colleagues (Crown, et al. 1991, 1992; Crown 1992) have used data collected by  			 U.S. Labor Department surveys to profile the existing labor market for PAS  			 workers. </p>
<p>ASPE recently sponsored a small-scale study looking at the  			 mechanisms that State programs use to ensure that the employment of  			 consumer-directed PAS workers complies with Federal and State requirements  			 regarding tax withholding for Social Security and coverage for unemployment and  			 workers compensation insurance. (Flanagan 1994) </p>
<p>ASPEs contract with A.E. Benjamin of UCLA (described earlier)  			 has a subsidiary purpose of examining the use of family caregivers as paid  			 assistants in Californias IHSS program. This study also will include a  			 telephone survey of some 500 PAS workers (whose employers will also have been  			 interviewed) to obtain information on worker characteristics associated with  			 higher consumer satisfaction as well as workers own levels of job  			 satisfaction. </p>
<p>A number of well-regarded studies on enhancing the availability and  			 performance of paraprofessional providers of personal assistance services have  			 been carried out. These include Bayer, Stone and Friedland 1993; Feldman 1994;  			 Feldman, Sapienza and Kane 1990; Cantor and Chichin 1990. Additional work along  			 these lines is being carried out by Robert and Rosalie Kane at the University  			 of Minnesota, and Bill Crown and colleagues at SysteMetrics, Inc. </p>
<p>Some interesting work has also been done in the areas of job  			 training (e.g., training welfare recipients to become PAS workers) and  			 alternative recruitment strategies. For example, ACTION (recently renamed the  			 National Corporation for Community Service) has sponsored demonstrations and  			 evaluations of its senior companion program. Approximately 12,000 low-income  			 volunteers are paid stipends of $2.50 per hour to provide at least 20 hours per  			 week of escort and other PAS that do not involve hands-on  			 assistance. Recipients of these volunteer services may be older persons or  			 younger adults with disabilities. The Corporation is interested in greatly  			 expanding the number of senior companion volunteers. Currently, PAS has also  			 included as a service option for younger people under the newly created  			 National Service Corp. The Administration on Developmental Disabilities  			 Americorp projects are training and placing 70 PAS volunteers for service in  			 three States (Alabama, Georgia and Pennsylvania). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>What kinds of research needs to be done specifically around family  			 caregiving relationships involving younger--as distinct from elderly--persons  			 with disabilities? What data sources might be used? </p>
<p>What kinds of cooperative research might be pursued with the  			 Department of Labor around paid PAS workforce issues? </p>
<p>Are there States that are undertaking or considering innovative  			 programs involving the recruitment, training, and retention of PAS workers that  			 merit evaluation? </p>
<p>Are there alternative models of organizing PAS employment (that is,  			 alternatives to the independent provider and certified  			 agency modes of employment) that merit demonstration and evaluation? </p>
<p>Should we consider evaluating programs that recruit, train, and  			 place volunteers as well as paid workers? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>D. Cash Versus In-Kind Benefits Versus Tax  		Subsidies</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>Many persons with disabilities express a preference for cash  			 payments or vouchers which enhance consumer control over spending of their  			 personal assistance dollars. </p>
<p>In the United States there is a bias toward providing services and  			 in-kind benefits, rather than cash (Keigher and Stone 1993), and  			 few cash programs exist. Exceptions include the Department of Veterans Affairs  			 (VA) Housebound Aide and Attendance Allowance program, voucher programs offered  			 by some counties in some States, and a few State programs which provide cash  			 supplements. Colorados Home Care Allowance Program, Wisconsins  			 Community Options Program, Pennsylvanias Family Support Services (for  			 families of people with mental retardation) are examples of States offering  			 cash payments (Cameron 1993). A primary obstacle to public acceptance of cash  			 benefits is the issue of accountability. Policy makers are concerned about  			 misuse of cash payments (e.g., to buy liquor, drugs, etc.) and doubt  			 consumers ability to make appropriate choices among providers and  			 services in a fragmented and confusing system. </p>
<p>Cash or disability allowances, however, are prevalent in European  			 countries. In Germany, the German Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs  			 estimates 80 percent of eligible participants in a government program chose  			 cash payments over in-kind benefits (Cameron 1993). Forty-five percent of  			 clients given a choice opted for cash instead of services in a demonstration  			 program in the Netherlands (Miltenburg 1994). </p>
<p>President Clintons long-term care reform proposals included  			 the creation of special tax credits to help defray the costs of PAS for  			 employed persons with disabilities. Critics of this approach argue, however,  			 that tax credits favor high earners. Some advocates--such as Drew Batavia, a  			 PAS user who has also done research on PAS and currently works on the staff of  			 a conservative Republican Senator--believe that the traditional distributional  			 biases of tax credits can be overcome by making PAS tax credits refundable.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>An ASPE-sponsored evaluation of the VA Housebound Aide and  			 Attendance Allowance program compared 139 recipients of cash to 610 persons  			 receiving in-kind services using data from the National Long-Term Care Survey.  			 The results indicated that recipients of cash were no worse off in terms of  			 acute care utilization, and that cash benefits may be more cost effective than  			 in-kind services for many beneficiaries (Grana and Yamashiro 1987). </p>
<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has sponsored an 18 month  			 investigation of cash and counseling programs that is being carried out by  			 James Firman and Kathy Cameron at United Seniors Health Cooperative. This  			 research will produce primarily qualitative descriptions on existing cash and  			 counseling programs in Europe (Austria and Germany) and the United States.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>What would be a useful strategy for combining demonstration and  			 evaluation components in order to study a program of cash grants to consumers?  			 </p>
<p>What possibilities exist for designing and evaluation demonstration  			 programs that would permit public program beneficiaries to choose between cash  			 payments and in-kind services? </p>
<p>How can we address similarities and differences between cash  			 payments to persons with disabilities and family allowances--concepts that are  			 analytically distinct but often overlap in practice? </p>
<p>Would it be useful to conduct preference surveys to gauge the  			 potential popularity of cash versus in-kind services, that characteristics of  			 those who would prefer each type of benefit, and the extent to which persons  			 with disabilities would plan to use cash benefits to purchase PAS or would tend  			 to rely on unpaid help within the household and to use cash benefits to  			 supplement household income? </p>
<p>How might we attempt to gauge the potential impact of tax credits or  			 other tax subsidies on the employment of persons with disabilities or the  			 affordability of PAS to persons with disabilities? What methods could be used:  			 simulations? surveys? demonstrations? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>E. Assistive Technology</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>Assistive technologies--especially those that could substitute for  			 human assistance--appear to have significant potential to reduce the costs of  			 PAS. They also hold out the promise of making persons with disabilities more  			 truly independent by reducing their reliance on other persons whose possibly  			 conflicting needs and wishes have always to be taken into account. </p>
<p>There has been significant growth in use of assistive technology in  			 the last decade (LaPlante, Hendershot, and Moss 1992). However, some unmet  			 needs for technology were reported in the 1990 NHIS Supplement on Assistive  			 Devices (Adler 1994; LaPlante 1992). </p>
<p>Promoting access to assistive technology involves more than the  			 simple purchase of a piece of equipment. Persons with disabilities may also  			 require assistance in selecting appropriate devices, help with installation,  			 training in the proper use of equipment, as well as access to maintenance and  			 repair work and replacements when equipment becomes nonfunctional or obsolete  			 (Enders 1988). Environmental adaptations/modifications to homes as well as  			 public places may also include under a broad definition of assistive  			 technology. </p>
<p>One major set of policy issues concerns mechanisms for financing  			 assistive technologies. Both Medicare and Medicaid can provide funding for some  			 forms of assistive technology but the implications for access posed by coverage  			 rules related to medical necessity are not entirely clear.  			 Differences across States in interpretation of medical need limitations raise  			 equity concerns (Seelman 1993). The Tech Act provides Federal funding for  			 technical assistance, information, training and public awareness programs with  			 regard to the provision of assistive devices and services. This is done through  			 Federal grants to States (Title I) and Programs of National Significance (Title  			 II). </p>
<p>Third party payers must impose some forms of gatekeeping  			 to prevent fraudulent and abusive marketing of ineffective technologies to  			 persons with disabilities as well as to control costs more generally. But what  			 criteria are appropriate? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>Research in the area of assistive technology has been largely  			 clinically oriented, pertaining to specific devices and assessments of their  			 ability to meet physiological long-term care needs (Agree 1994; Batavia and  			 DeJong 1990). </p>
<p>The National Council on Disability conducted a study, involving  			 significant consumer input, whose purpose was to identify problems with the  			 current system of financing assistive devices. Respondents reported on the  			 complexity of the system, poor information on how to access devices, lack of  			 coordination between funding agencies, lack of training and maintenance  			 resources, lack of individual choice over assistive technology services, and  			 the significant numbers of people who remained unserved or under served  			 (National Council on Disability 1993). Seelman (1993) notes the following  			 additional access barriers: the deficiency of consumer information on  			 technology, lack of ties to the technology culture, language differences, and  			 institutional living situations. </p>
<p>NIDRR has funded a number of projects focusing primarily on access  			 issues in connection with the Tech Act. These include grants for several new  			 rehabilitation and research training centers (RRTCs). An RRTC on Aging with a  			 Disability has been established at Los Amigos Research and an RRTC on Aging  			 with a Spinal Cord Injury has been established at the Education Institute. An  			 RRTC on Families of Adults with Disabilities has been set up at Through the  			 Looking Glass in Berkeley, which has a study underway to identify, develop, and  			 evaluate assistive technology for parents with disabilities. The RRTC on  			 Independent Living at the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research has been  			 awarded a five year grant to develop and evaluate an independent living center-  			 based model program that will offer assistive technology repair and  			 maintenance. The program also offers counseling on sources of purchase of  			 equipment and seeks to improve the delivery of rehabilitation engineering  			 services. </p>
<p>In addition, NIDRR has funded a research and demonstration project  			 at RESNA to develop quality assurance guidelines for assistive technology  			 delivery. This includes the development of content for criteria, outcome  			 measures, and provider qualifications. A NIDDR grant to the State University of  			 New York/Buffalo focuses on dissemination and utilization programs for  			 assistive technologies and environmental intervention for older people with  			 disabilities. </p>
<p>ASPEs role in sponsoring research on assistive technology has  			 been quite limited to date. Several years ago, ASPE conducted a small  			 intramural research project on assistive technologies that was primarily a  			 literature review and think piece (Elliott 1991). In connection  			 with ASPEs sponsorship of analyses of 1982, 1984 and 1989 National  			 Long-Term Care Survey data, Ken Manton and his colleagues at Duke University  			 have explored the question of substitutability of technology for human help.  			 Their findings indicated that use of assistive technology is growing and that  			 some substitution of technology for human assistance is taking place (Manton,  			 et al. 1993). However, work by Agree (1994) suggests that use of assistive  			 technology by older persons tends more often to supplement than substitute for  			 human assistance. Most of the research on patterns of use of assistive  			 technology to date has focused on the over 65 population of persons with  			 disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Questions </b></i></p>
<p>How can we move forward in determining the potential  			 substitutability of assistive technologies for human assistance? </p>
<p>What kinds of research partnerships might be possible between ASPE  			 and other HHS agencies such as the Agency for Health Policy Research (AHCPR,  			 FDA) with responsibilities for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of  			 medical devices (a mandate which presumably also includes some assistive  			 technologies)? </p>
<p>What are alternatives to medical necessity as a  			 criterion for needing assistive devices and for constraining costs? To what  			 extent do sources of funding for PAS allow for purchase of assistive devices,  			 and more generally, can funds for PAS and assistive devices be pooled to  			 facilitate substitution as appropriate? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>F. PAS Financing and Service Delivery System  		Infrastructure </h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>PAS or home and community-based long-term care services programs are  			 typically administered at the State and local level by organizations associated  			 with welfare programs (e.g., county social services departments) or  			 by State agencies and non-profit organizations (e.g., State units on aging,  			 area agencies on aging) that were established to address the needs of disabled  			 elders or other narrowly defined groups (e.g., the mentally ill or mentally  			 retarded). As a result, persons with disabilities under age 65 who are not  			 mentally retarded or mentally ill are typically referred for purposes of  			 assessment, case management and service provision to programs and organizations  			 designed for and used to dealing with persons age 65 and older. In recent  			 years, for example, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) have been increasingly called  			 up to serve disabled children and their parents, young adults with AIDS, adults  			 under age 65 with disabilities resulting from spinal cord and head injuries  			 (including victims of violence who may previously have been involved in the  			 criminal drug culture) and other individuals whose backgrounds and perspectives  			 on life are undoubtedly quite different from that of the prototypical  			 frail elders who were the original target population for AAAs and  			 other elements of the aging network. The question arises whether  			 AAAs and other such programs and organizations are capable of attending to the  			 distinctive, age-appropriate PAS service needs of younger persons with  			 disabilities. Or, in effect, do they simply deal with younger clients as if  			 they were prematurely aged and develop the same kinds of service  			 plans and recommend the same kinds of service modalities that they would for  			 elderly clients? </p>
<p>Some models of service delivery have been developed for specific  			 target populations. For example, supported living services is an  			 approach that was designed by MR/DD professionals for this particular target  			 population. The questions arises whether the development of generic  			 financing and service delivery systems designed to accommodate persons with  			 disabilities of all ages, all types of conditions and diagnoses will promote  			 more rapid diffusion and cross-fertilization of new models? Or will  			 generic systems tend to dampen innovation and promote  			 one-size-fits-all approaches? </p>
<p>Case managers and counselors who work with younger persons who are  			 mentally retarded or mentally ill tend to see their jobs rather differently  			 than those who work with elderly clients. Those who work with younger clients  			 see their role as maximizing the clients participation in the community  			 and training him or her to assume greater independence and self-direction. Case  			 managers for frail elders focus on needs assessment, care planning, and the  			 authorization of payment for specific services to be made to specific  			 providers. </p>
<p>Case managers for frail elders tend to develop a service plan based  			 on one or two home visits, then make periodic visits to see whether the plan is  			 working or needs to be revised. In contrast, case managers for younger disabled  			 persons with cognitive impairments seem to provide more direct personal support  			 to their clients. </p>
<p>Case managers for mentally disabled clients also tend to work more  			 intensively with clients in helping them plan their futures--via exercises in  			 developing short and long-term care goals and laying out the steps to achieve  			 those goals. They often help arrange housing (including housing outside of  			 specialized disability settings). They help arrange volunteer work for clients  			 and to place them in paying jobs when possible. They go with clients to help  			 them learn how to use public transportation to get to their volunteer or paid  			 jobs. It is not clear, however, whether or to what extent the funding  			 mechanisms, rules and regulations, and existing organizational structures in  			 existing home and community-based care programs designed  			 principally for frail elders can accommodate the broader conceptions of case  			 management that are used in programs designed for the MR/DD and mentally ill  			 populations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Conducted or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>ASPEs recently funded contract with A.E. Benjamin of UCLA to  			 survey clients in the California IHSS program (described in greater detail  			 earlier) will permit comparison of the attitudes and experiences of older as  			 compared to younger clients. Californias IHSS program, more than many  			 State programs, appears to have been designed to meet the needs of clients  			 across the age spectrum (although some critics believe that it is not well  			 designed to meet the needs of persons with cognitive as opposed to physical  			 disabilities). </p>
<p>ASPE funded research on community supported living arrangements  			 (CSLA) under a Task Order contract with Brian Burwell at SysteMetrics, Inc.  			 This work is now being followed up with a project to develop a strategy for  			 information dissemination about CSLAs. </p>
<p>ASPE also has a collaborative project on infrastructure  			 underway with the Administration on Aging. The purpose of this project is to  			 look at the organizational capacity at State and local levels, particularly in  			 State units on aging and AAAs, to administer home and community-based services  			 programs along the lines of the new benefit proposed in the Presidents  			 health care reform initiative. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>Should we undertake research that compares consumer preferences and  			 outcomes for particular types of clients in generic versus  			 specialized (i.e., target population specific) programs? If yes,  			 what programs might make good candidates for study? </p>
<p>Should we be developing benchmarks for evaluating State  			 and local program infrastructure from the perspectives of several different  			 target populations? If so, how should we go about developing such measures?  			 </p>

<h2>December 1994</h2>
<p>Goals of the Expert Meeting on Personal Assistance and Related Supports  		included: to select high priority policy-relevant research topics; to define  		research strategies in the context of existing research, resources, and data;  		and, to specify projects appropriate to ASPE. Our emphasis was on strategies  		that move toward a consumer- directed and generic (age and diagnosis neutral)  		system of personal assistance services (PAS). </p>
<p>Participants placed highest priority on research to measure service  		needs, use and costs; quality assurance; and infrastructure/implementation  		issues in discussion and written comments (see <a href="research-agenda-personal-assistance-services-and-related-supports.html#table">Table</a>).  		This document is a summary of suggested studies in areas discussed. </p>
<p>We welcome feedback on this summary, particularly on the relative  		importance of the studies listed and on data sources for conducting the  		research. </p>
<p>The substance of the meeting will help us elaborate research projects  		contained in the draft 1995 research plan of the Office of Disability, Aging,  		and Long-Term Care Policy (DALTCP) as well as identify additional research  		strategies. The following summary of the meeting reflects the discussion on  		each section of the Background Paper as well as written comments provided at  		the end of the meeting or subsequently. </p>

<p>Participants placed high priority on understanding patterns of expressed  		need and use of personal assistance services. For example, we need simple  		descriptive information about how people with varying levels of disability or  		different ages currently use PAS and what additional services they also use.  		</p>
<p>The group also emphasized a need for better understanding of agency  		costs in providing services. What are the relative costs of various components  		of agency services, and of different types of agencies? How might policy  		changes affect these costs? </p>
<p>In addition, it was noted that data collection should measure variation  		by ethnicity, rate, and gender as well as take into account differences in  		rural and urban PAS service settings. It was noted that the homeless are  		undercounted in surveys. </p>
<h3>A. Service Needs and Use</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Document how personal assistance or similar services are used with  			 or without other services by the elderly and younger people with disabilities.  			 Document what services consumers buy for themselves (i.e., what they pay for  			 out-of- pocket). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare use of services by persons with similar disabilities. For  			 example, PAS needs are similiar for persons with similar types of spinal cord  			 injury. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify PAS tasks by function and measure average length of time to  			 accomplish each task. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study the degree to which reimbursement policies and existing  			 service settings rather than consumer need determine the types of services  			 delivered. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study needs for PAS by disabled parents to perform parenting tasks;  			 conduct a follow-up of disabled parents in Disability Supplement to the  			 National Health Interview Survey. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Cost Studies</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Develop a methodology for disaggregating the costs of providing  			 agency directed services; e.g., for supervision, RNs, scheduling, overhead, and  			 indirect costs. Include specification of home office costs. Any  			 study should be consistent with how agencies account for costs and should  			 identify ways to engage organizations in the inquiry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare costs and outcomes between: different modes of agency-  			 administrated services; certified home care agencies and noncertified agencies  			 that provide PAS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study cost-effectiveness of supervisory requirements associated with  			 Medicare home health benefits. Compare costs of different types of supervisory  			 visits. Compare outcomes of supervisory visits conducted with or without worker  			 present. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide Medicare waivers so home health agencies could deliver care  			 differently and study consequences for costs and outcomes. For example, we know  			 little about what models of nurse instruction and supervision on an  			 as-needed basis would cost. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study PAS costs for persons who need 24-hour-per-day services; use  			 New York experience. </p>
</li>
</ul><h2>II. QUALITY ASSURANCE</h2>
<p>Participants placed high priority on approaches to assuring quality  		using an independent provider or consumer-directed approach to PAS. There was  		considerable emphasis on further specification of a fiscal or supportive  		intermediary, such as a third party (public or private) that may perform such  		tasks as paying taxes, screening or training workers. Protections for both  		consumers and workers were covered in this discussion. </p>
<p>Participants also proposed costs effectiveness comparisons of various  		modes of providing PAS as well as research regarding measuring outcomes. </p>
<h3><a name="SP-IIA" id="SP-IIA">A. Facilitating Quality for  		Client-Directed PAS</a></h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Examine supportive brokerage and supportive intermediary  			 models as flexible ways to ensure that people of all ages and disabilities get  			 support and as much control as they choose and can handle. Analyze the cost  			 effectiveness of the supportive intermediary model verses the traditional  			 agency model. Also compare this approach with other approaches; e.g.,  			 Independent Living Center referral and training services or those identified  			 below. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the effectiveness of various types of care management to  			 facilitate client-directed services such as background checks, occasional  			 monitoring, and arrangements for backup. Assess effect on consumer  			 satisfaction. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze the impact of government subsidized emergency back-up  			 systems in terms of need, projected costs, and effectiveness. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop model contracts for use between PAS providers and consumers,  			 and between consumers and payer agencies to reduce risk and enhance quality.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess the feasibility of developing models for consumer and  			 employee training around PAS. Use the training process to assess clients  			 ability to direct their workers. Look at Massachusetts and Maine for examples.  			 Research how assistive technology can be used in training consumers of PAS. For  			 example, MedCom Video, Inc., in California has videos for training consumers of  			 PAS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify regulations that are minimally necessary to ensure health  			 and safety of consumers and workers (OSHA, tax, labor). Develop a model for use  			 by States that clarifies IRS and Department of Labor requirements pertaining to  			 the PAS independent provider. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Cost-Effectiveness Studies</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Compare costs and outcomes between agency and independent provider  			 modes in States other than California. Possible sites include Wisconsin and  			 Virginia. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate service use, cost and consumer satisfaction for PAS under  			 managed care, and fee-for-service programs under Medicaid, Medicare, and other  			 State funded programs (for both SSI population under 65 and for frail elderly  			 population). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate consequences for costs and consumer satisfaction before and  			 after changes in nurse practice acts to allow less skilled personnel to perform  			 tasks formerly done by nurses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform randomized testing of different models of quality assurance;  			 e.g., case management, an ombudsman-type complaint mechanism, and regulations  			 enforced through survey mechanisms. For each, document problems and how well  			 they were solved. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>C. Quality Indicators</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Study quality indicators and relevant outcomes from the consumer  			 perspective, and develop a process to measure quality. Possibly pursue a  			 quality study in selected Medicaid personal attendant programs that would focus  			 on consumer measures of quality. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop alternative frameworks for conceptualizing needs and  			 outcomes for PAS. Do this across disability subpopulations. Consumer  			 satisfaction measures should ask how do you want to live? how are you living?  			 For policy purposes, it is necessary to consider the extent to which consumer  			 preferences and satisfaction should drive a program. What is good enough?  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><h2>III. WORKFORCE ISSUES</h2>
<p>The group discussed research to evaluate new sources of personal  		assistance workers, including use of volunteers, alternative sources of paid  		providers, and issues regarding immigration policies. </p>
<p>This discussion also covered research on supports to agency employed and  		independent providers to improve working conditions. Note that much of the  		above discussion on quality assurance is also relevant; e.g., fiscal and  		supportive intermediary mechanisms. </p>
<p>Several studies on family caregiving were also proposed, particularly to  		examine its use in comparison with, or in addition to, paid PAS. </p>
<h3>A. Worker Supply</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Study longitudinal trends in worker supply, including number of  			 workers and hours worked. Data sources, including the Home Health and Hospice  			 Survey and Bureau of Labor Statistics (for paraprofessional statistics). Also  			 consider doing more work with the Current Population Survey. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study use of volunteers, from the Senior Companion program for  			 example, to supplement/complement paid workers. Conduct a study to test the  			 cost effectiveness of Senior Companions in the PAS context. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study use of alternative sources of PAS workers such as immigrants,  			 deadbeat parents who pay back with long-term care services, AFDC  			 mothers who want to care for families, or former hospital employees who have  			 been laid off. With regard to employing immigrants, investigate immigration  			 policy and practice regarding making exceptions or a special category for PAS  			 workers. Evaluate impact of Prop 187 in California on supply of workers.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Improving Working Conditions (see also  		<a href="research-agenda-personal-assistance-services-and-related-supports.html#SP-IIA">Section IIA</a> above)</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Conduct a comparison of turnover, wages, benefits, and job  			 satisfaction of workers employed by agencies and of workers directly hired by  			 consumers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With regard to independent providers, identify approaches to and  			 best practices in training, providing compensation and benefits, and other  			 support systems in the field now. Study impacts on availability and quality of  			 providers, as well as worker satisfaction. What is the best model to improve  			 employment of workers? Study Wisconsins experience. Explore possibilities  			 of a national group health insurance plan that could be purchased by persons  			 with disabilities for their personal assistance workers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With regard to agency employed workers, survey innovative agency  			 practices or projects to enhance productivity, including use of technology or  			 scheduling according to location. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Survey States regarding requirements for and approaches to training  			 workers. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>C. Family Caregiving</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Study the use of paid family members in unique settings/situations  			 (e.g., geographic isolation, language), or for relief. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research the quality and costs of PAS given by compensated family  			 members compared to nonfamily members, possibly in the State of Oregon. Study  			 the frequency of choosing a family member when real choice is given, and  			 reasons for choosing family to provide personal assistance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a valid methodology for examining informal service  			 arrangements and the interrelationship of informal with formal arrangements.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><h2>IV. PROVIDING CASH OR VOUCHERS TO PURCHASE PAS SERVICES </h2>
<p>Several participants called for clarification of terms, including:  		voucher, cash out, family allowance, tax credit, and so forth. Recommendations  		focused on studies to compare costs and benefits of cash or vouchers and other  		modes of financing PAS. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Fund a comparison study (preferably with random assignment) of  			 various modes of financing PAS: cash out, vouchers, fiscal agent, case  			 management, and agency. Such a study might include a tax credit option as well.  			 Use Medicaid waiver or State funds to finance benefits. Issues to address  			 include: consumer preferences and satisfaction, incentives to work,  			 accountability, the woodwork effect, elasticity of demand, and  			 appropriate amounts of money for benefits. With regard to accountability, there  			 is need to study how cash benefits are used and the extent to which consumer  			 needs are neglected by responsible family members. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study costs and outcomes of cash support programs in Colorado,  			 Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or other States. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study costs and benefits of cash support provided by the Department  			 of Veterans Affairs (VA) system. The large number of cases should allow for  			 subgroup analysis among types of disabilities as well. </p>
</li>
</ul><h2>V. ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY </h2>
<p>Several participants asserted that use of assistive technology is not a  		substitute for PAS. While there can be some substitution, it was argued that  		PAS and assistive technology are complementary and that both are needed.  		Consumers need access to assistive technology and flexibility in combining it  		with PAS. </p>
<h3>A. Use of Assistive Technology</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Evaluate how restrictions of medical necessity in public  			 funding of assistive technology impact the independence of consumers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screen Medicare home health claims for occupational, physical and  			 speech therapies where supplies are charged in addition to  			 services, and then analyze how the assistive supplies may have reduced numbers  			 of providers needed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research what assistive technology and home modification is  			 purchased by Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicaid/State funded home and  			 community-based services programs. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Combined Funding of PAS and Assistive Technology</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Conduct a demonstration that combines assistive technology, PAS and  			 housing modifications into a single funding stream so trade-offs can be  			 realized. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct studies of currently combined funding streams in Medicaid  			 waiver programs (that include both assistive technology and PAS), in the VA  			 Housebound Aide and Attendant Allowance program, and in other countries.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><h2>VI. SERVICE SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE </h2>
<p>Participants placed high priority on research concerning infrastructure  		or implementation of PAS programs. Suggestions related to research on care  		planning; the extent to which one generic system can serve several  		client groups of different ages or having different disabilities (e.g.,  		cognitive versus physical); and on accomplishing greater flexibility for  		administrators by consolidating various funding streams. </p>
<p>Note that many of the suggestions in previous sections relate to  		infrastructure and implementation issues. </p>
<h3>A. Service Planning</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Describe, demonstrate and evaluate how to develop a person-centered  			 plan of care; research alternative ways to create a person-centered package of  			 services for people with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop models of person-driven support for persons with  			 cognitive limitations. Look at the competencies, financing, etc., that would be  			 required and the policy implications of such models. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Generic Systems</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Research consolidation of funding streams for various support system  			 components. Research the impact of allowing States more flexibility in blending  			 funds and programs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research impacts on administrative costs and client satisfaction of  			 a system that serves all age groups and types of disabilities and of using a  			 uniform eligibility assessment protocol versus impacts of age or disability  			 specific systems. Study how well such a system deals with differences; e.g.,  			 cultural, rural residence, and so forth. For example, examine how well aging  			 network works with younger disability populations, and the extent of  			 redundancy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a selected group of States, survey various publicly funded PAS  			 programs to obtain information about how needs, eligibility, service  			 authorization levels, and outcomes are conceptualized and measured. Analyze the  			 data to determine the extent of consistency. Seek to explain the variation on  			 the basis of such factors as disability specific considerations, Federal  			 program definitions, and State specific factors. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a uniform eligibility assessment tool that combines data  			 items from different agencies, then implement the tool in various agencies to  			 examine differences between agencies in service eligibility and amount of  			 services allocated. Current efforts for developing uniform assessment tools are  			 underway at the Health Care Financing Administration, the Trace Center at the  			 University of Wisconsin, and the Long-Term Care Resource Center at the  			 University of Minnesota. </p>
