</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Post-acute care (PAC) refers to care received after an acute  		hospitalization, which is typically provided in skilled nursing facilities  		(SNFs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), home health (HH) agencies,  		and/or outpatient (OP) rehabilitation settings. In 2002, approximately  		one-third of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from hospitals utilized some  		form of PAC within one day of leaving the hospital. Although care received in  		different PAC settings varies to some extent, many experts believe that  		patients with similar care needs may be treated in different PAC settings and  		that the choice of discharge destination is often driven by factors other than  		patient characteristics (e.g., availability of beds, physician or family  		preference, practice patterns).</p>
<p>In an effort to contain rapid growth in Medicare PAC expenditures during  		the late 1980s to mid-1990s, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  		that required the development and implementation of prospective payment systems  		(PPS) for all types of PAC. The PPSs have been phased in over the past eight  		years, beginning with SNFs in July 1998, followed by OP hospital care in August  		2000, HH agencies in October 2000, and IRFs in January 2002.</p>
<p>This study, funded by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  		and Evaluation, had three primary aims, including:</p>
<p>1) To compare quality, outcomes, and costs of PAC episodes involving  		single and multiple-providers (e.g., IRF care followed by HH care, IRF care  		followed by OP care) provided to Medicare beneficiaries with stroke after PPS  		implementation.</p>
<p>Using stroke as a tracer condition, this study examined PAC outcomes and  		costs for single and multiple-provider episodes of care. Outcomes studied  		included return to community residence, functional outcomes (including  		activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living  		(IADLs), social/role function, and function related to walking), self-reported  		health, and satisfaction. Costs included cost to the Medicare program and to  		beneficiaries. Few prior studies have examined outcomes and costs of  		multiple-provider episodes, particularly those involving OP rehabilitation  		care, and no major studies have been conducted subsequent to PPS implementation  		in all PAC settings. This study, therefore, represents a unique opportunity to  		explore these various facets of PAC during the post-PPS era.</p>
<p>2) To compare and contrast various quality of care and outcome measures  		that can be used across PAC settings.</p>
<p>This study explored whether a core set of measures can be identified  		that captures outcomes and quality of PAC episodes involving both single and  		multiple-providers. Given the current policy interest in uniform assessment for  		quality monitoring and comparing outcomes across settings, this research  		provides invaluable information in moving toward this goal.</p>
<p>3) To examine the effect of PPS implementation on patterns of PAC  		utilization (including IRF, SNF, and HH agency) for stroke patients.</p>
<p>This objective involved analysis of national claims data to complement  		the in-depth primary data analysis conducted for the first objective. Recent  		research on the use of IRF care before and after the implementation of the IRF  		PPS was conducted by RAND; however, this work was limited to only the early  		stages of the IRF PPS (the first year of IRF PPS implementation). No studies to  		date have assessed the effects of PPS in terms of PAC utilization and patterns  		of care following PPS implementation in all PAC settings. Given the financial  		incentives that exist under the different PPSs, PAC utilization patterns are  		likely to be altered, with the potential to influence cost and quality of  		care.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>This study of PAC included a national sample of 88 PAC providers  		comprised of 35 IRFs, 33 SNFs, and 20 HH agencies in 20 states. Subject  		eligibility was limited to Medicare beneficiaries admitted to PAC from the  		hospital for an acute stroke, who were at least 65 years of age and enrolled in  		the Medicare fee-for-service program rather than managed care. Excluded were  		individuals who were comatose, those residing in a long-term care facility  		prior to this stroke, and those without a proxy if cognitively impaired or with  		severe speech/language impairment. The sample included a total of 674 subjects  		enrolled between late 2002 and early 2005: 555 whose first admission was to  		IRF, 62 whose first admission was to SNF, and 57 whose initial admission was to  		HH.</p>
<p>Patient characteristics analyzed in the study included demographics, and  		pre-stroke condition in available supports, function, and global health rating.  		Acute stroke characteristics included stroke characteristics and comorbidities.  		At the time of admission to PAC, the assessment included cognition, visual  		neglect, speech/language, function, and depression. Cognition and depression  		were assessed by direct interview with the patient (or proxy), whereas PAC  		admission function was obtained from the Minimum Data Set for SNFs, the  		Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument for IRFs, and  		the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for HH agencies. In  		addition, a range of facility characteristics and community characteristics  		were collected.</p>
<p>Outcome and quality measures included: location at 90 days; functional  		recovery in four domains; recovery in self-rated overall health; and  		patient/proxy satisfaction. Location measures examined both nursing home vs.  		community residence and whether the 90-day residence was an equally independent  		living situation to the setting prior to the stroke. The functional recovery  		measures included the domains of ADLs, IADLs, ambulation, and social/role  		function. Function was assessed for multiple activities within each of these  		domains by an on-site data collector by interview for the baseline period prior  		to stroke, and by telephone for the 90-day follow-up.</p>
<p>Cost analyses included the costs to Medicare and to beneficiaries for  		all types of care. These costs were obtained from Part A and Part B claims  		data. Utilization data were obtained from Medicare claims for services covered  		by Medicare.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p><b>Patterns of Post-Acute Care:</b></p>
<ul><li>Nearly 170 different PAC patterns were identified in 90 days.</li>
<li>Volume of direct stroke admissions from the hospital for Medicare  		  patients not enrolled in managed care decreased markedly in both SNFs and HH  		  agencies from the period prior to PPS.</li>
<li>Patterns were predominately multiple-provider episodes beginning with  		  IRF. Length of initial IRF stays decreased by two days between 2003 and  		  2004.</li>
<li>Sixty percent of IRF admissions used a second PAC provider and 30  		  percent used three or more in 90 days.</li>
<li>About a third of direct admissions to SNFs used a second PAC provider  		  after the SNF and 29 percent used three or more in 90 days.</li>
<li>Only 20 percent of direct admissions to HH agencies used a subsequent  		  PAC provider in 90 days.</li>
</ul><p><b>Patient Characteristics:</b></p>
<ul><li>SNF patients were the most disabled prior to the stroke; most  		  cognitively and physically impaired following their stroke; and had the  		  greatest speech/language impairments and symptoms of depression after their  		  stroke.</li>
<li>On the other end of the spectrum, HH patients were more functional  		  with less cognitive impairment than IRF patients, although they were more  		  similar to IRF patients than SNF patients.</li>
<li>Among patients admitted directly to IRF, IRF to SNF  		  (IRF&gt;SNF) patients had the greatest cognitive impairment, visual  		  impairment, speech/language impairment, and functional impairment upon  		  admission to PAC. Their characteristics were similar to the patients discharged  		  directly from acute hospital to SNF.</li>
<li>Patients admitted to HH from IRF were similar to patients admitted to  		  OP from IRF with respect to pre-morbid status, cognition, and most functional  		  measures following their stroke, but they had lower incomes.</li>
</ul><p><b>Outcomes:</b></p>
<ul><li>Descriptive outcomes for all patients admitted to IRF, HH, or SNF  		  followed the patterns one would expect based on patient characteristics: the  		  best recovery of function occurred among HH patients, the worst recovery  		  occurred among SNF patients, and IRF patients were in the middle. Due to the  		  differentiation in patient characteristics based on initial provider setting,  		  it was not feasible to equitably compare outcomes for all patients.</li>
<li>IRF&gt;SNF patients had comparable outcomes to patients  		  discharged directly to SNF in 90-day residence and in functional recovery.  		  Satisfaction appeared to differ between these two options, with greater  		  satisfaction in terms of goals and progress in the IRF&gt;SNF group, and  		  greater satisfaction with discharge preparation and family preparation in the  		  direct SNF group.</li>
<li>Relative to patients discharged to HH following IRF, outcomes for  		  patients admitted to OP care following IRF were comparable with respect to  		  90-day residence and significantly better in two dimensions of functional  		  recovery, even after risk adjustment.</li>
</ul><p><b>Costs and Service Utilization:</b></p>
<ul><li>Descriptive cost comparisons among direct discharges to IRF, SNF, and  		  HH followed the patterns one would expect based on reimbursement systems. Costs  		  of care for stroke patients discharged directly to IRFs were generally twice as  		  high as cost for SNF patients in the PAC episode and eight times as high as  		  costs for HH patients for PAC services during 90 days.</li>
<li>Relative to direct discharges to SNF, PAC costs for IRF&gt;SNF  		  patients were three times higher, and 90-day costs for IRF&gt;SNF  		  patients were twice as high. Total PAC length of stay for the IRF&gt;SNF  		  group was about 73 days in contrast to 46 days for the SNF group.</li>
<li>Relative to IRF&gt;OP costs, total cost per PAC episode was  		  $2,200 higher and total cost per 90 days was $5,200 higher for IRF&gt;HH  		  patients. Despite the lower costs, IRF&gt;OP patients received about 40  		  therapy visits in contrast to 21 therapy visits for IRF&gt;HH patients in  		  PAC episodes with comparable duration. However, average PAC beneficiary costs  		  were $400 higher for the IRF&gt;OP group.</li>
<li>The 90-day costs were also comparable between IRF&gt;OP  		  patients and IRF patients who were discharged to a residence because the latter  		  group required more acute and additional PAC services after they were  		  discharged to the community and the initial PAC episode was complete.</li>
</ul><p><b>National Trends:</b></p>
<ul><li>Admissions of stroke patients to SNFs directly from hospital have  		  been steadily declining since 1998, and admissions to IRFs and acute long-term  		  care hospitals have been increasing.</li>
<li>The number of high-volume SNFs and IRFs is declining, with patients  		  more evenly distributed among providers.</li>
<li>Even basic characteristics, such as age, differed significantly  		  between SNF and all IRF patients. However, the 25 percent of IRF discharges who  		  received care in SNF following IRF have characteristic similar to patients who  		  went directly to SNF.</li>
<li>Length of stay significantly declined in IRFs and also freestanding  		  SNFs since PPS was implemented.</li>
</ul><p><b>Measures:</b></p>
<ul><li>A core group of self/proxy-reported functional measures exist that  		  address different dimensions of function and are useful for comparing outcomes  		  across both single and multiple-provider episodes.</li>
<li>These measures are hierarchical in terms of how stroke patients  		  recover function.</li>
<li>Location at 90 days and return to an equally independent setting were  		  also valid global outcomes for PAC.</li>
</ul><h3>Policy Implications</h3>
<p>Declining lengths of stay in the IRF setting and discharge to subsequent  		PAC providers, resulting in multiple-provider episodes, are natural  		consequences of the IRF per discharge PPS. That is, the incentive exists to  		admit patients to IRF, contain costs with a shorter stay in the IRF, and then  		discharge patients to a second type of PAC provider, which could be a SNF, HH  		agency, or OP care. This response is similar to declining acute hospital  		lengths of stay and the increased use of IRF, SNF, and HH care following the  		implementation of the per discharge acute hospital PPS. As per discharge  		payments for IRF care are readjusted based on length of stay trends, savings in  		IRF payments may help to offset the costs of the additional care in subsequent  		providers. However, the impact on quality of care, outcomes, and costs as a  		result of this discontinuity is important to monitor.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of stroke, the increased use of IRFs and decline in  		use of SNFs immediately following the hospitalization suggests that IRFs have  		an increasing incentive to admit stroke patients under PPS, which may be  		accompanied by a decreased incentive in SNFs for admitting stroke patients.  		This could occur because payment rates for stroke patients in IRFs are among  		the most profitable based on the case mix groups and because other policies  		such as the 75 percent rule may encourage IRFs to admit patients with diagnoses  		such as stroke. SNFs may have difficulty covering the costs of the therapy  		services for stroke patients requiring substantial rehabilitation (which is the  		case for many stroke patients discharged directly from the hospital). Because  		the highest Resource Utilization Group rehabilitation category includes  		patients with 12 hours of therapy per week, and under PPS SNFs have no  		incentive to provide more than 12 hours of therapy per week, patients requiring  		more therapy are likely to be admitted to IRFs. </p>
<p>The HH PPS includes a substantial payment rate increase if ten therapy  		visits are provided; however, there is no payment incentive to admit patients  		who require any more than ten therapy visits. In combination, the PPS could  		result in greater differences in the patients admitted to each PAC provider  		from the hospital because of their need for and ability to tolerate  		therapy.</p>
<p>For the subgroup of stroke patients discharged to IRF and subsequently a  		SNF (about 25 percent of discharges to IRF from hospital), substitution with  		patients discharged directly to SNFs appears to exist. The major difference was  		that the IRF&gt;SNF episodes were almost twice as likely in communities  		with high IRF use rates and occurred more frequently in urban areas, suggesting  		differences in practice patterns. Overall, 60 percent of these patients had  		cognitive impairment, 75 percent had significant functional impairment, and 25  		percent met strict criteria for depression. Nevertheless, outcomes were  		comparable between the IRF&gt;SNF group and those admitted directly to  		SNFs, whereas costs were 2-3 times higher for IRF&gt;SNF patients. From a  		policy perspective, if these individuals can be identified upon acute hospital  		discharge, then direct discharge to SNF would be more cost-effective. One way  		to encourage more cost-effective care would be to pay IRFs at a reduced payment  		rate equivalent to the SNF level of care for IRF days in cases when the patient  		is ultimately discharged to a SNF. A similar policy is currently in place  		whereby Medicare pays IRFs a lower rate for patients with stays of less than  		four days. Under this scenario, even if patients were to receive a very brief  		trial of rehabilitation in an IRF, as soon as it is apparent they require  		longer term, less intense rehabilitation, they would be discharged to a  		SNF.</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of OP services subsequent to IRF care was very  		apparent in this study. Stroke patients who received OP care subsequent to an  		IRF stay had better outcomes, received more therapy visits, and at lower cost  		to Medicare relative to patients discharged to HH agencies subsequent to an IRF  		stay. The comparability between these HH patients and OP patients raises  		questions about why some patients are considered "homebound" and others are  		not. While most of the patients receiving more HH or OP care following IRF may  		meet the relatively loose definition of "homebound," OP services were more  		likely to be used by stroke patients with higher incomes. Not surprisingly, the  		IRF&gt;OP pattern resulted in higher beneficiary costs because of the  		larger coinsurance. Reducing the cost to beneficiaries by reducing the OP  		coinsurance might increase the utilization of OP services relative to home care  		services following the IRF stay, which would be offset by fewer patients using  		higher cost HH services. Even if more patients in total were to use OP services  		(i.e., those previously discharged home with no further care), total cost would  		not be impacted for such patients due to the costs of Medicare services  		(increased hospitalizations and subsequent PAC services) that would have been  		needed by these patients if they had not received OP care. The difficulty in  		paying the coinsurance associated with OP service and the potential lack of  		reliable transportation may encourage people to use the more expensive HH care  		rather than OP services. From a policy perspective, we need to begin to  		recognize the important role of OP care in PAC used either immediately  		following the acute stay or subsequent to other PAC providers. It may offer the  		most cost-effective benefit for patients in many circumstances. </p>
<p>A uniform set of core measures is required to assess PAC outcomes for  		patients admitted to single or multiple PAC settings. The current  		setting-specific assessment tools cannot be used for this purpose because they  		use different elements, only some of which can be cross-walked, and have  		different follow-up intervals, making it impossible to compare change over  		fixed time periods. For outcome measurement, a baseline time point and a fixed  		follow-up point are required, regardless of the number of PAC providers that  		are utilized by a patient. An ideal baseline is pre-morbid function so that one  		can determine the extent to which prior function was recovered, and 90 days  		represents a follow-up point at which most PAC is completed. Functional  		measures across a range of domains, such as ADL, IADL, ambulation, and  		social/role function, are critical to assess because they are unique functional  		dimensions that recover at different rates. Changes in residence and global  		health ratings from baseline to 90 days are excellent general markers of  		rehabilitation success.</p>
<p>From this national study of PAC prospective payment between late 2002  		and early 2005, we observed major changes in patterns of PAC utilization for  		stroke patients. Overall, providers were strongly responding to the PPS  		incentives. Substitution between patients directly discharged to SNFs and those  		discharged to SNF following IRF, and between patients discharged to OP  		following IRF and discharged to HH following IRF, showed that  		cost-effectiveness of PAC may be improved through changes in incentives.  		Continued collection of uniform outcome and cost data is essential if we intend  		to maximize opportunities for improving PAC provided to Medicare  		beneficiaries.</p>
<h2><a name="issue" id="issue">1. POST-ACUTE CARE POLICY ISSUES</a></h2>
<h3>A. MEDICARE POST-ACUTE CARE TREATMENT SETTINGS</h3>
<p>Post-acute care (PAC) refers to care received after an acute  		hospitalization, which is typically provided in skilled nursing facilities  		(SNFs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), home health (HH) care,  		and/or outpatient (OP) rehabilitation care. SNFs are nursing homes that are  		certified by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide  		Medicare-reimbursable skilled nursing services on an inpatient basis. They  		consist of both hospital-based and freestanding facilities, and nearly 80  		percent of their Medicare admissions receive physical, occupational, and/or  		speech therapy.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.1">1</a></font></sup> IRFs  		are hospitals that provide intensive inpatient rehabilitation care; they are  		required to have a certain proportion of their patients require intensive  		rehabilitation for one of 13 broad medical conditions, one of which is stroke.  		IRFs are also characterized by much greater physician presence, particularly  		from rehabilitation specialists. HH care is provided to Medicare beneficiaries  		who are homebound (unable to leave their residence without considerable and  		taxing effort) and require intermittent or part-time skilled nursing care and  		therapy services. Hospital OP rehabilitation care generally consists of therapy  		and physician services of physical medicine and rehabilitation services. </p>
<p>In 2002, approximately one-third of Medicare beneficiaries discharged  		from hospitals utilized some form of PAC within one day of leaving the  		hospital.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.2">2</a></font></sup> Although  		care received in different PAC settings varies to some extent as described  		above, many experts believe that patients with similar care needs may be  		treated in different PAC settings and that the choice of discharge destination  		is often driven by factors other than patient characteristics (e.g.,  		availability of beds, physician or family preference, practice patterns). This  		issue is further discussed in <a href="#section1.C">Section C</a>. </p>
<h3>B. PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS FOR PAC</h3>
<p>In an effort to contain the rapid growth in Medicare PAC expenditures  		during the late 1980s to mid 1990s, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of  		1997 that required the development and implementation of prospective payment  		systems (PPSs) for all types of PAC. The PPSs have been phased in over the past  		seven years, beginning with SNFs in July 1998, followed by OP hospital care in  		August 2000, HH in October 2000, and IRFs in January 2002. </p>
<p><b>1. Reimbursement Under PPS </b></p>
<p>Under a PPS, instead of being tied to an individual providers cost  		of delivering services, fixed payments are established in advance of the  		service delivery and vary only by regional wage differences. This fixed payment  		is based on patient characteristics, called case mix, which determines the  		average resources required to meet the patients service needs. The case  		mix is determined by an assessment in each PAC setting. The payment algorithm  		and payment units for each PAC setting are different. The units of payment may  		be for the service, the day, an episode of care, or the entire stay. Brief  		descriptions of the PPS for each of the four PAC settings follow.</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>SNF PPS</b>: Under the PPS for SNFs, facilities are paid a  			 predetermined rate for each day of care based on the patients service  			 needs, including all nursing, therapy, and ancillary services. Patients are  			 assigned to 44 groups, referred to as resource utilization groups, version III  			 (RUG-III), which are intended to classify patients according to their needs for  			 nursing and therapy care. Assessments at five, 14, 30, 60, and 90-day intervals  			 are based on the Minimum Data Set (MDS) patient assessment (which is further  			 described in <a href="#section1.E">Section E</a>). Medicare payment rates for  			 each of the groups consist of three components: (1) a fixed amount for routine  			 administrative expenses; (2) a variable amount based on intensity of nursing  			 care required; and (3) a variable amount based on intensity of therapy services  			 required. CMS recently revised the RUG-III classification system, increasing  			 the number of RUG groups from 44 to 53. For beneficiaries needing skilled care  			 following a hospital stay of at least three days, Medicare covers a maximum of  			 100 days of SNF care per episode of illness. The first 20 days of care are  			 covered at 100 percent, and for the 21st through 100th day, the beneficiary is  			 responsible for coinsurance equal to one-eighth of the inpatient hospital  			 deductible per day. In 2006, the SNF coinsurance rate was $119 per  			 day.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.3">3</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>IRF PPS</b>: The IRF PPS pays facilities a predetermined rate per  			 discharge for the entire stay based on the patients condition (diagnoses,  			 functional and cognitive status, and age). Stays are categorized into one of  			 385 case mix groups (CMGs), which are derived based on information collected  			 through the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument  			 (IRF-PAI), which is described in more detail in <a href="#section1.E">Section  			 E</a>. Medicare coverage for IRF care is handled like other inpatient hospital  			 stays in that Medicare beneficiaries are required to pay daily copayments that  			 begin on the 61st day of the stay. They are not required to make copayments for  			 the first 60 days after an inpatient hospital deductible that in 2006 was $952.  			 The Medicare inpatient hospital benefit covers 90 days per episode, with a  			 60-day lifetime reserve (which the beneficiary may elect to use after the 90th  			 day). The coinsurance for the 61st-90th day of care is a per day charge equal  			 to one-fourth of the inpatient hospital deductible, and the coinsurance for 60  			 lifetime reserve days is equal to one-half of the inpatient hospital  			 deductible. In 2006, the inpatient hospital coinsurance rate for days 61-90 was  			 $238 per day, and for the lifetime reserve days, the coinsurance rate was $476  			 per day.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.3">3</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>HH PPS</b>: Several years prior to implementation of PPS in HH,  			 an interim payment system (IPS) was established to constrain per visit Medicare  			 payments until the HH PPS was implemented. The PPS for HH pays agencies a  			 predetermined rate for each 60-day episode of HH care. The payment rates are  			 determined by the patients condition and anticipated service use, based  			 on the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), which is further  			 discussed in <a href="#section1.E">Section E</a>. In instances when fewer than  			 five HH visits are provided, agencies are paid on a per visit (rather than per  			 episode) basis. Patients receiving five or more visits are allocated to one of  			 80 home health resource groups (HHRGs), which are determined by diagnosis,  			 functional capacity, and service use information gathered through the OASIS. HH  			 episodes that require at least ten therapy visits receive substantially higher  			 payments than those not meeting the threshold. Medicare Beneficiaries are not  			 required to make copayments or pay coinsurance for HH services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hospital Outpatient PPS</b>: The hospital OP PPS is established  			 as a fee schedule that sets payment rates for individual services and  			 procedures. Services and procedures are grouped into 570 ambulatory payment  			 classifications (APCs). This PPS payment unit is based on services provided  			 rather than patient case mix. As with the grouping systems under the previously  			 described PPSs, however, each APC consists of services that are clinically  			 similar and require comparable resources. Under Medicare, the coinsurance  			 amount for OP care is determined by the APCs. Over the past several years,  			 there has been substantial pressure to reduce coinsurance in the OP PPS to a  			 target of 20 percent.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.4">4</a>,  			 <a href="#ref1.5">5</a>, <a href="#ref1.6">6</a>, <a href="#ref1.7">7</a></font></sup> OP therapy services are excluded from the  			 APCs and are covered by a fee schedule in which Medicare covers 80 percent and  			 the beneficiary is responsible for 20 percent, which is paid out-of-pocket or  			 from supplemental insurance. Therapy services require a physician order, a  			 specific treatment plan, and must be provided by skilled, qualified providers.  			 No limits exist for provision of therapy services in OP hospitals; however, an  			 annual limit of $1,740 exists for combined OP physical therapy (PT) and speech  			 therapy (ST) with a $1,740 limit for occupational therapy (OT) when services  			 are provided outside a hospital in the year 2006 (certain exceptions to this  			 policy are allowed). The caps on OP therapy services were originally  			 implemented in 1999. However, moratoriums on enforcing the caps have delayed  			 final implementation until 2006. The exception process to the caps allows  			 Medicare beneficiaries meeting certain conditions to receive therapy above the  			 caps. </p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>2. Incentives and Preliminary Evidence of Changes Under PPS</b></p>
<p>Different types of payment systems (per discharge, per day, per episode,  		per service) create different financial incentives for the provision of care,  		often resulting in variation in practices and utilization across PAC settings.  		</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>SNF PPS</b>: Under a per diem payment system, financial  			 incentives exist to increase the number days over which service is provided. In  			 their 2003 Medicare Data Book, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  			 (MedPAC) indicated that the average length of stay in SNFs decreased by more  			 than five days from 1996 to 1998 (prior to SNF PPS implementation), but  			 progressively increased by approximately one day per year during the early  			 years of the SNF PPS (between 1998 and 2001) -- providing initial evidence in  			 support of the notion that the per diem SNF PPS provides an incentive for  			 longer SNF stays.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A study by Hutt et al. assessed the impact of the SNF PPS on the  			 amount of therapy provided and community discharge rates in a six state  			 demonstration of the SNF PPS in comparison to non-participating  			 states.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.9">9</a></font></sup> Under the SNF  			 PPS demonstration, facilities were reimbursed using the RUG-III system, which  			 assigns patients to one of seven hierarchies. The rehabilitation  			 hierarchy, in which the payments are generally the highest, requires that  			 patients receive therapy, and payments are determined by the quantity of  			 therapy provided, the number of therapy specialties provided, and the  			 patients functional status. Therefore, there is an incentive in the SNF  			 PPS to provide therapy and to provide the amount of therapy that places  			 patients in the most profitable groups. However, there is no incentive to  			 provide more therapy than the minimum required to qualify for that payment  			 group. Hutt and colleagues found that patients with the highest levels of  			 function in participating sites received approximately 40 percent more therapy  			 during the PPS demonstration than they had prior to the demonstration, while  			 the volume of therapy received by similar patients in the non-participating  			 sites remained constant. Interestingly, they found that the more intense levels  			 of therapy in participating states were not associated with improved community  			 discharge rates.</p>
<p>Further evidence of SNFs changing practices under the PPS was  			 provided in an August 2002 Report to Congress by the General Accounting Office  			 (GAO), which examined the mix of patients treated and Medicare services  			 received across and within payment groups. The reports findings indicated  			 that two years after implementation of the SNF PPS: (1) the mix of SNF patients  			 across categories of payment groups had shifted; and (2) the majority of  			 patients in rehabilitation groups received less therapy than in early 1999  			 (shortly after implementation of the SNF PPS).<sup><font><a href="#ref1.10">10</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>IRF PPS</b>: Per discharge payment systems (such as the one  			 implemented under the IRF PPS) provide a fixed payment per patient discharge  			 regardless of the patients length of stay. Therefore, under a per  			 discharge payment system, it is in the providers best financial interest  			 to discharge patients as quickly as possible, limiting the cost of services  			 provided. Even prior to IRF PPS implementation Ottenbacher et al. found a  			 significant decrease in IRF length of stay between 1994 and 2001 for patients  			 within five impairment groups: stroke, brain dysfunction, spinal cord  			 dysfunction, other neurologic conditions, and orthopedic conditions.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.11">11</a></font></sup> Recent research by RAND Health  			 examining the early stages of IRF PPS implementation found a decline in average  			 IRF length of stay of 13 percent between 1999 and 2002, and 5.8 percent between  			 2001 to 2002.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.12">12</a>, <a href="#ref1.13">13</a></font></sup> This research also found that the rate of  			 decline in length of stay varied across hospitals, with those with relatively  			 long lengths of stay in 1999 having greater percentage declines between 1999  			 and 2002. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>HH PPS</b>: Prior to implementation of the HH PPS, an IPS was  			 implemented in HH agencies that applied reimbursement caps to the previously  			 established fee-for-service (FFS) system. Unlike the HH PPS, the IPS did not  			 include outlier payments for high cost patients, and incentives existed for HH  			 agencies to admit patients needing fewer, less expensive visits.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.14">14</a></font></sup> Research by McCall et al. examining  			 Medicare HH utilization and spending before and after implementation of the IPS  			 for HH revealed a dramatic decrease in use of HH services following IPS  			 implementation (i.e., 55 percent and 52 percent drop in visits and payments,  			 respectively).<sup><font><a href="#ref1.15">15</a></font></sup>  			 Overall, the proportion of beneficiaries using HH services following the IPS  			 implementation dropped by more than one-fifth and many HH agencies closed their  			 doors. The HH PPS replaced the IPS in October 2000. Given that the HH PPS pays  			 a fixed rate per 60-day episode regardless of the number of visits (as long as  			 the episode includes at least five visits), an incentive exists for providers  			 to reduce the number of visits provided. However, the additional payment  			 associated with HH episodes consisting of ten or more therapy visits provides a  			 strong incentive for provision of ten and no more than ten therapy visits.  			 According to the MedPAC, the average number of HH visits and minutes per  			 episode and have decreased (by 47 percent and 37 percent, respectively) between  			 1997 and 2002, but the amount of therapy delivered as proportion of those  			 visits has increased by 17 percent.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.2">2</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Changing Patterns of Care and Use of Multiple-Provider  			 Episodes</b>: Due to the substantial changes in Medicare PAC reimbursement  			 under PPS and the varying incentives under each system, interest has grown in  			 whether PAC utilization patterns have changed subsequent to PPS implementation.  			 A recent study by Direct Research LLC, which compared episodes of PAC use in  			 1996 (prior to implementation of any PAC PPS) and 2001 (after PPS  			 implementation in SNFs and HH) found that the number episodes involving HH only  			 decreased by 46 percent; whereas episodes involving only SNF care increased by  			 28 percent and those involving care by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), IRFs,  			 or psychiatric hospitals increased by 33 percent.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.16">16</a></font></sup> Episodes consisting of SNF care followed by  			 HH care decreased by 13 percent, and those involving other combinations of  			 providers increased by 17 percent. </p>
<p>Another study by McCall et al. examined patterns of PAC utilization  			 for Medicare beneficiaries with stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  			 (COPD), heart failure, hip fracture, and diabetes during the period when the HH  			 IPS was in effect and the SNF PPS was being instituted.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.17">17</a></font></sup> They found substantial changes in patterns  			 of PAC, with use of IRFs increasing and use of HH services falling as both an  			 initial PAC setting and a subsequent setting following initial treatment in an  			 institutional setting. </p>
<p>Earlier research by Liu et al. in 1999 revealed that prior to  			 implementation of PAC PPS, 51 percent of PAC patients used HH care only, 26  			 percent used SNF care only, 4 percent used IRF care only, and 19 percent used  			 more than one PAC setting.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.18">18</a></font></sup> Now that PPS has been implemented in all  			 PAC settings, further research is needed to examine the effects of these new  			 systems on PAC utilization and patterns of care.</p>
<p>Given the varying incentives under the PPSs for different PAC  			 settings, one might expect that the number of PAC episodes consisting of more  			 than one provider would increase, especially when ownership or contractual  			 relationships play a role (e.g., when an IRF, SNF, and/or HH agency fall under  			 the same ownership, which is sometimes the case for hospital-based PAC  			 facilities). Few studies to date have directly addressed this issue. The  			 previously mentioned study by Direct Research LLC found a decrease in episodes  			 involving SNF care followed by HH care, but an increase in other types of  			 multiple-provider episodes.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.16">16</a></font></sup> A study by Coleman et al., the goal of  			 which was to describe patterns of post-hospital care transitions from  			 1997-1998, found 46 distinct types of care patterns during the 30 days  			 following acute hospital discharge, 61 percent of which were limited to a  			 single transfer, 18 percent of which involved two transfers, and 13 percent of  			 which involved three or more transfers -- with an additional 8 percent that  			 resulted in death.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.19">19</a></font></sup>  			 Concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative effects of poorly  			 executed transitions between health care settings, with patient safety issues  			 and medication errors of particular concern.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.20">20</a>, <a href="#ref1.21">21</a></font></sup> Further  			 investigation is needed to determine the impacts of PAC PPS on the occurrence  			 of multiple-provider episodes, as well as the outcomes associated with multiple  			 care transitions within a PAC episode.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3><a name="section1.C" id="section1.C">C. SUBSTITUTION OF PAC  		SETTINGS</a></h3>
<p>Evidence suggested that prior to PPS at least some degree of overlap  		existed in the characteristics of patients treated across SNFs and IRFs, with  		controversy over the overlap between HH agency and institutional PAC. Work by  		Kramer et al. involving a database of 518 hip fracture patients and 485 stroke  		patients treated in SNFs or IRFs utilized propensity score methodology to  		predict placement into SNFs vs. IRFs by stratifying on the probability of  		assignment to one type of PAC setting.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.22">22</a></font></sup> Kramer et al. found a number of overall  		differences between patients treated in IRFs and in SNFs; on average, IRF  		patients had more functional independence upon admission, better pre-morbid  		function, better cognitive function, and were more likely to have an able and  		willing caregiver than SNF patients. However, stratification for probability of  		SNF placement using propensity scores demonstrated that certain patient  		subgroups were treated in both settings, whereas other subgroups were treated  		predominately in one setting or the other. For example, hip fracture patients  		with caregivers and good physical and cognitive function were represented in  		both SNFs and IRFs, whereas hip fracture patients with no caregiver, and  		particularly those with cognitive impairment, were prevalent in SNFs and  		extremely rare in IRFs. Stroke patients who had no caregivers and lower  		cognitive function were found only in SNFs, whereas stroke patients who had  		caregivers and higher cognitive function were prevalent in both settings,  		although more so in IRFs. Both hip fracture and stroke patients in IRFs were  		more likely to participate in social and recreational activities than patients  		in SNFs. Through this stratification process, five variables were found to  		determine the strata for hip fracture: availability of a caregiver, cognition,  		participation in social and recreational activities, functional independence,  		and pre-morbid walking ability. Three of these variables -- availability of a  		caregiver, cognition, and participation in social and recreational activities  		-- determined the strata for stroke. Given the differences between the two  		settings, these covariates could be considered critical for inclusion in any  		model controlling for selection bias between SNFs and IRFs. </p>
<p>Research by Neu, Harrison, and Heilbrunn of RAND explored utilization  		rates across different health service market areas to determine whether market  		areas with unusually high utilization of one type of PAC setting demonstrate  		relatively low utilization of other types of PAC settings. These authors found  		some evidence for substitution between SNF and HH care, an effect that was more  		pronounced for certain diagnoses than for others.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.23">23</a></font></sup> Less consistent evidence of substitution  		patterns was found through this research for care involving IRFs. Early work by  		Kramer et al. comparing nursing home and HH case mix found pronounced  		differences in functional and cognitive ability between Medicare patients  		treated in the two settings, with nursing home patients much more likely to be  		functionally dependent.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In a later study of PAC utilization, Gage found that use of different  		PAC settings varies to a great extent by geographic region, and the potential  		for substitution among settings varies by diagnosis.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.25">25</a></font></sup> Similarly, research by Bronskill et al.  		examined the extent to which factors beyond patient characteristics contribute  		to variation in post-acute service use in elderly Medicare patients with acute  		myocardial infarction.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.26">26</a></font></sup> After controlling for patient and hospital  		characteristics, researchers found that for-profit ownership of the acute  		hospital and the provision of HH services through the acute hospital or a  		subsidiary significantly predicted the use of PAC services, suggesting that the  		organizational structure of hospitals can influence the patterns of PAC service  		use for clinically similar patients. </p>
<p>Kane et al. found substantial geographic variation in both the overall  		level of PAC use and the patterns of PAC, which the authors believe are likely  		to reflect differences in PAC availability and practice styles across  		regions.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.27">27</a></font></sup> Similary,  		Lee, Huber, and Stason found wide geographic variation in the use of different  		PAC settings for stroke rehabilitation, indicating substantial variation in  		treatment practices and substitution between different PAC rehabilitation  		settings across different geographic regions.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.28">28</a></font></sup> Research by Liu et al. found that SNF and  		HH care may substitute for one another under certain circumstances.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.29">29</a></font></sup> Data sources included: the  		Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, which contained data on patient  		characteristics; Medicare claims, which included data on SNF and HH service  		use; and data from various sources on market area characteristics. They found  		that older patients and those with a history of Alzheimers disease were  		more likely to use SNFs than HH, and that patients with emphysema were more  		likely to use HH than SNFs. They also found that patients with a second source  		of health insurance (Medicaid or supplemental insurance) were more likely to  		use SNFs than HH, and that use of SNF care increased as SNF and IRF bed  		availability increased. </p>
<p>Taken together, these findings suggest that factors other than  		patients clinical characteristics -- such as geographic location, acute  		hospital ownership type, PAC provision through the acute hospital, availability  		of PAC services, and insurance coverage -- often played a role in determining  		the setting in which PAC was provided prior to PPS. In the pre-PPS era there  		was evidence of substitution among IRFs and SNFs for some subgroups of  		patients, but controlling for the patient characteristics that differed across  		these settings (such as cognition, pre-morbid function, and social support) was  		critical in any comparisons. The overlap between HH and institutional PAC was  		less clear, and patient characteristics beyond diagnosis seemed to be strongly  		associated with placement. The extent of substitution in the post-PPS era  		remains to be seen. </p>
<h3>D. OUTCOME AND COST DIFFERENCES ACROSS PAC SETTINGS</h3>
<p>In recent years, studies have compared outcomes and costs of PAC  		services received in different settings. Among the outcomes most commonly  		examined are mortality, physical function, rehospitalization, and return to  		community. Because care for certain clinical conditions such as stroke, hip  		fracture, and joint replacements is frequently provided in various PAC  		settings, these conditions are most frequently examined in research comparing  		outcomes and costs across sites of PAC. These studies all attempt to take  		advantage of the natural variation that exists in PAC treatment settings;  		however, they all struggle with the challenge of selection bias by setting,  		which confounds the comparisons. Thus, the strength of the evidence generated  		by these studies should be considered in the context of the overall design, the  		covariates that are investigated, and the analysis methods. Furthermore, none  		of the work to date takes into consideration the multiple-providers that  		contribute to PAC outcomes; rather, they focus only on the initial treatment  		setting.</p>
<p><b>1. Stroke</b></p>
<p>A retrospective study of 331 patients from an IRF and 97 from a SNF by  		Keith et al. found that IRF treatment resulted in greater functional  		improvement and a somewhat higher likelihood of discharge to community than  		treatment in a SNF.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.30">30</a></font></sup>  		However, the study had significant limitations in that 5 percent of the SNF  		group and 14 percent of the IRF group were admitted from a setting other than  		the hospital (including other PAC settings), SNF patients had 4.5 fewer days  		since their stroke upon admission to PAC, and the authors controlled only for  		demographic variables and amount of therapy in this comparison. Two measures of  		cost-effectiveness (charges per successful discharge to the community and  		charges per one-point gain in functional improvement on the Functional  		Independence Measure, or FIM) revealed SNF care to be a more cost-effective  		option than IRF care. </p>
<p>The aforementioned 1997 study by Kramer et al. in 92 sites found that  		stroke patients treated in IRFs had better outcomes at six months in terms of  		both community residence and function than those treated in SNFs, but at a much  		higher cost.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.22">22</a></font></sup> This  		study used an extensive primary database including pre-stroke function, social  		situation, stroke severity, and even uniform readings of CT/MRI studies. </p>
<p>In a study of 487 stroke patients from three cities discharged to home  		without HH (n=160), HH (n=125), SNF (n=123) and IRF (n=79), Chen et al. found  		that stroke patients discharged to HH showed more improvement in activity of  		daily living (ADL) function than those discharged to IRF, SNF, or home without  		home care at six weeks, six months, and one year post-discharge.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.31">31</a></font></sup> In addition, they found that patients  		discharged to IRFs demonstrated more functional improvement at these time  		points than patients discharged to SNFs. Data sources included patient and  		family interviews, hospital medical records, and Medicare billings. To adjust  		for selection bias across the various PAC settings, Chen et al. employed a  		two-stage instrumental variable estimation method. They also found that costs  		for patients receiving HH were considerably lower than those receiving care in  		an institutional setting (SNF or IRF). </p>
<p>A study by Kane et al. using the same data source found that stroke  		patients receiving PAC in SNFs had higher mortality rates at six weeks, six  		months, and one year than those in IRFs or HH, and that stroke patients  		discharged to HH had lower rehospitalization rates at one year than those  		discharged to SNFs or IRFs.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.32">32</a></font></sup> Independent variables examined came from  		interviews, the Medicare Denominator File, and medical records; they included  		patient characteristics such as functional independence, living arrangements,  		cognitive status, and informal supports, as well as various case mix variables  		to adjust for stroke severity.</p>
<p><b>2. Hip Fracture</b></p>
<p>Over the years, studies of outcomes and costs for hip fracture patients  		treated in different PAC settings have yielded mixed results. The previously  		mentioned study by Kramer et al. found comparable outcomes in both SNFs and  		IRFs, with IRF care at a substantially higher cost.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.22">22</a></font></sup> A study conducted by Deutsch  		et al. involving clinical data review of 29,793 Medicare FFS beneficiaries who  		received treatment for hip fracture in 1996 or 1997 found that SNF-based  		rehabilitation was a less costly alternative to IRF care, yielding similar or  		better improvement in motor functional status and community discharge outcomes  		in most areas assessed.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.33">33</a></font></sup> This study examined a number of covariates  		including motor and cognitive function, time from fracture to PAC admission,  		type of hip fracture repair, pre-hospital living arrangements, and geographic  		location, but did not include caregiver support or participation in social or  		recreational activities. The potential for sample selection bias was examined  		using propensity scores. </p>
<p>Other research suggests that SNFs may not be the best setting for  		provision of PAC for hip fracture patients. Kane et al. found that hip fracture  		patients treated in HH or IRFs had significantly more functional improvement  		than those treated in SNFs at six weeks, six months, and one year.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.32">32</a></font></sup> Independent variables examined  		included patient characteristics such as pre-morbid and PAC discharge  		functional independence, living arrangements, self-reported pre-morbid health  		status, cognitive status, and informal supports, as well as various case mix  		variables to adjust for stroke severity. However, pre-fracture walking ability  		and participation in activities, two covariates that Kramer et al. found to be  		critical, were not included. </p>
<p>In a study of 42 hip fracture patients admitted to IRF and 34 admitted  		to SNF from one hospital, Munin and colleagues found that hip fracture patients  		receiving IRF care were more likely to regain 95 percent of their pre-fracture  		function by 12 weeks post-hospital discharge than patients receiving SNF  		care.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.34">34</a></font></sup> IRF patients  		were also more likely than SNF patients to be discharged home, and SNF patients  		were more likely than IRF patients to be discharged to a nursing home.  		Covariates examined included depression, cognition, medical complexity,  		pre-fracture motor function, delirium, participation during rehabilitation, and  		social support. This study suffered from serious risks of selection bias in  		that SNF patients were more cognitively impaired, had worse social supports,  		had worse function immediately post-fracture, and 12.5 percent were admitted  		from personal care homes in contrast to 5 percent of IRF patients. Whether  		there was actual overlap between groups is uncertain, and if there was overlap,  		the authors ability to adjust for selection differences with these small  		samples is doubtful.</p>
<p><b>3. Joint Replacement</b></p>
<p>In a large-scale comparison of Medicare spending and outcomes for all  		elderly beneficiaries who underwent hip or knee replacements (with no preceding  		hip fracture) and were discharged from an acute hospital between January 2002  		and June 2003, Beeuwkes Buntin et al. found no differences in mortality between  		patients across different sites of PAC.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.35">35</a></font></sup> However, using an instrumental variable  		approach they found that patients receiving care in IRFs and SNFs were more  		likely than HH patients to be institutionalized 120 days after their initial  		hospitalization. They also found that Medicare payments for PAC episodes in  		IRFs and SNFs were far higher than for those receiving HH care, with IRF  		payments being the highest of the three. Data sources included Medicare claims,  		MDS and IRF-PAI patient assessment data, cost report and provider of service  		(POS) data, and hospital discharge records. Independent variables assessed  		included such items as individual predictors (e.g., age, gender, race, place of  		residence), clinical predictors (comorbidities and complexities derived from  		hospital discharge records), discharging hospital characteristics (e.g., size,  		teaching status, ownership status, Medicare patient percentage), PAC  		availability (distance from patients home to the closest provider and  		number of PAC providers within a specified radius around the patients  		home), and functional status (using a measure similar to the Barthel Index  		derived from the MDS and IRF-PAI). Important covariates such as availability of  		a caregiver, cognition, participation in activities, and pre-morbid walking  		ability were not included. </p>
<h3><a name="section1.E" id="section1.E">E. NEED FOR UNIFORM CORE DATA  		ELEMENTS FOR OUTCOME MEASUREMENT ACROSS PAC SETTINGS</a></h3>
<p>The Medicare, Medicaid, and State Childrens Health Insurance  		Program Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 mandated the Secretary  		of Health and Human Services to report, by January 1, 2005, on the development  		of health and functional assessments for various Medicare beneficiaries using  		PAC and other specified services. The legislation specified that information  		across providers be readily comparable and that only information necessary to  		meet program objectives be collected. The Secretary was also required to make  		recommendations regarding use of patient assessment instruments for payment  		purposes. </p>
<p>Currently, Medicare requires that patients be evaluated in three of the  		four PAC settings discussed in this chapter using different patient assessment  		instruments. The MDS is used in SNFs, the IRF-PAI is used in IRFs, and the  		OASIS is used in HH. Currently, no assessment instrument is required for  		patients receiving OP rehabilitation care. These assessment tools differ in  		terms of the elements they assess, their assessment periods, and their rating  		scales. A recent empirical comparison of the MDS, IRF-PAI, OASIS and the  		physical function scale of the Short-Form-36 (an assessment sometimes used with  		ambulatory care populations) revealed differences between and limitations  		within each of the instruments in terms of their content, breadth of coverage,  		and measurement precision.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.36">36</a></font></sup> In addition, the tools were designed to  		achieve different objectives (e.g., care planning, quality measurement, outcome  		monitoring, and patient classification) -- differences that limit their  		comparability for measuring quality of care. </p>
<p>In their June 2005 Report to Congress, MedPAC recommended that data  		elements be identified for use by CMS in establishing payments and evaluation  		of patient outcomes across PAC settings, asserting that the data elements  		predict resource use; capture relevant clinical data; be reliable, valid,  		and well accepted; and minimize the burden to providers and  		CMS.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.2">2</a></font></sup> The  		Institute of Medicine also recommends that the Federal Government  		accelerate, expand, and coordinate its use of standardized performance  		measurement and reporting to improve health care quality, and that  		current performance measurement mechanisms within and across government  		programs be replaced by standardized measurement and reporting  		mechanisms.<sup><font><a href="#ref1.37">37</a></font></sup> In  		working toward these goals, it will be necessary to determine the core outcome  		measures that accurately and reliably measure quality of care and outcomes both  		within and across PAC settings. </p>
<p>Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress required that CMS  		explore costs and outcomes across different PAC settings and episodes. This  		demonstration will involve examination of the use of a comprehensive assessment  		tool at hospital discharge to determine appropriate PAC placement.</p>
<h3>F. STUDY AIMS</h3>
<p>This study has three primary aims:</p>
<p><b>1. Compare Quality, Outcomes, and Medicare Costs of PAC Episodes  		Involving Single and Multiple-Providers for Medicare Beneficiaries with Stroke  		after PPS Implementation</b></p>
<p>Using stroke as a tracer condition, this study examines PAC outcomes and  		costs for single and multiple-provider episodes of care lasting 90 days after  		discharge from the hospital. Outcomes studied include mortality,  		rehospitalization, return to community residence, and functional outcomes  		(including ADLs, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), social/role  		function, and function related to walking). Few prior studies have examined  		quality and outcomes of multiple-provider episodes, particularly those  		involving OP rehabilitation care, and none have done so subsequent to PPS  		implementation in all PAC settings. This study, therefore, represents a unique  		opportunity to explore these various facets of PAC during the post-PPS era.</p>
<p><b>2. Compare and Contrast Various Quality of Care and Outcome Measures  		that Can be Used Across PAC Settings</b></p>
<p>This study explores whether a core set of measures can be identified  		that captures outcomes and quality of PAC episodes involving both single and  		multiple-providers. Given the current policy interest in identifying a uniform  		assessment for quality monitoring and payment purposes, this research will  		provide invaluable information in moving toward this goal. </p>
<p><b>3. Examine the Effect of PPS Implementation on Patterns of PAC  		Utilization for Stroke Patients</b></p>
<p>As previously discussed, the implementation of four different PPSs for  		PAC services has recently occurred. No studies to date have assessed the  		effects of PPS on PAC utilization and patterns of care following PPS  		implementation using recent data. Given the financial incentives that exist  		under the different PPSs and the way providers respond to these incentives over  		time, the findings of this study on such issues should prove to be particularly  		policy relevant.</p>

<h3>A. DESIGN OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>MedPAC reported in 2005 that one-third of the Medicare beneficiaries  		discharged from the hospital used at least one day of PAC services. As  		described in <a href="#issue">Chapter 1</a>, CMS has recently implemented PPSs  		for each of the PAC settings that are intended to curtail the rapid increase in  		the expenditures for PAC. While all PAC settings offer the rehabilitation  		needed by persons who have had a stroke, the assessment used, services  		provided, and incentives from the PPSs differ widely across PAC settings. To  		explore the role of various PAC settings for stroke patients, this study  		addressed the three primary objectives as described below.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><i>Compare Quality, Outcomes, and Medicare Costs of PAC Episodes  			 Involving Single and Multiple-Providers for Medicare Beneficiaries with Stroke  			 after PPS Implementation</i>. The first step in this analysis was to describe  			 the patterns of stroke care provided to elderly Medicare beneficiaries from  			 admission to an IRF, SNF, or HH agency until 90 days after admission. The  			 characteristics of patients admitted to each setting and to the major  			 multiple-provider PAC episodes were then compared to determine the potential  			 for substitution among providers. Further analyses were conducted that found  			 similarities in characteristics between patients receiving care in IRFs  			 followed by HH agency and IRFs followed by OP care, and between patients  			 admitted directly to SNFs and those admitted to IRFs followed by SNFs. These  			 similarities suggest possible substitution of PAC settings. Outcomes and costs  			 of care were then compared for each of these pairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Compare and Contrast Various Quality of Care and Outcome Measures  			 that Can Be Used Across PAC Settings</i>. Because of the lack of uniformity in  			 assessment items and time periods across PAC instruments, we relied on a  			 large-scale primary data collection effort to evaluate core measures. These  			 core measures within 90 days of admission to PAC included: residence in the  			 community; functional recovery in ADLs, IADLs, ambulation, and social/role  			 function; global self-reported health; and satisfaction. We developed indices  			 for the four functional domains and examined the likelihood of recovery in  			 each. We used all of these measures in comparisons across episodes of  			 PAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Examine the Effect of PPS Implementation on Patterns of PAC  			 Utilization for Stroke Patients</i>. We examined the effect of PPS  			 implementation on patterns of PAC utilization by studying the population of  			 Medicare stroke patients from 1998 to 2004. Medicare Provider and Analysis  			 Review (MedPAR) data provided records for every inpatient stay that were linked  			 into 90-day episodes of PAC. We analyzed trends in various aspects of PAC  			 utilization including: discharge destination, length of stay, and distribution  			 of stroke patients among providers. Examination of geographic differences was  			 also performed. Finally, regression models of the likelihood of selected  			 discharge destinations reinforced the trends observed, using the limited case  			 mix adjustment data available from the PAC data.</p>

</ol><p>This chapter describes sampling methods for PAC settings and patients,  		data and data collection, and the analysis variables. Details on the  		statistical methods used to address the three objectives can be found in the  		relevant chapters to avoid confusion on the methods employed to address each  		objective.</p>
<h3>B. DATA SAMPLE</h3>
<p><b>1. Provider Selection and Recruitment</b></p>
<p>The study objectives relate to PAC for Medicare FFS beneficiaries who  		were hospitalized for a stroke and subsequently received PAC services in  		differing patterns of care. The primary settings of PAC reviewed for this study  		were IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies. For the purposes of estimating the size of  		the universe of providers and patients for IRFs and HH agencies, we used 1999  		Medicare Part A claims data files constructed by the Research Data Assistance  		Center. These files excluded providers with ten or fewer beneficiaries in order  		to preserve provider confidentiality. For SNFs, we used a more refined national  		claims-based file designed specifically for tracking SNF care (DataPRO) from  		which providers with ten or fewer stays were also excluded.<sup><font><a href="#ref2.1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The primary stratifier for sampling in this study was provider type.  		However, the number of providers for each provider type is unbalanced and the  		patient loads for patients with stroke differ among provider types. To maximize  		the similarities of selected subjects across provider types for comparison  		purposes, while assuring a representative mix of facilities within the  		operational and budgetary limitations of the project, we conducted a secondary  		explicit stratification on two other factors. First, providers were stratified  		on whether they were located in a community with low or high use of IRFs. For  		each community (defined as CMSA, MSA, or state-specific non-MSA), we estimated  		the ratio of IRF admissions relative to acute care hospitalizations for  		Medicare patients. This ratio was inversely related to the SNF admission/acute  		care hospital ratio (correlation -0.29; P&lt;0.001). Stratifying on this ratio  		at 0.040 (4 percent of Medicare acute hospital stays admitted to IRF),  		approximately 62 percent of SNF patients and 29 percent of IRF patients were  		treated in low rehabilitation hospital use communities, whereas 38 percent of  		SNF patients and 71 percent of IRF patients were treated in high rehabilitation  		hospital use communities. By sampling in proportion to these two strata, more  		SNF patients were included from areas where fewer patients were admitted to  		IRFs and more IRF patients were enrolled from communities where fewer patients  		were admitted to SNFs. This stratification helped to ensure that both SNF and  		IRF patients were sampled from the same community, which improved the precision  		in the estimates.</p>
<p>A secondary explicit stratification was based on statewide availability  		of community-based services, which has a substantial influence on one of the  		primary outcomes for comparing the different modalities -- rate of community  		residence at 90 days after admission to PAC. States that were above the median  		on residential care beds per capita and below the median on nursing facility  		beds per capita were classified as high on community-based services and those  		with the inverse were classified as low. Thus, states that had high numbers of  		licensed assisted living facility beds and other types of residential care per  		capita and low numbers of nursing home beds per capita were high on  		community-based services. In the nine states that were either above or below  		the median for both of these criteria, the number of Medicaid recipients per  		thousand beneficiaries enrolled in a statewide home-based services waiver  		program was used to classify the state, recognizing that this was not a perfect  		classification method because these programs vary in their use and coverage  		across states. Facilities were then assigned a value of this stratifier based  		on the state in which they were located.</p>
<p>Only providers with a history of admitting at least 12 stroke patients  		per year were included in the study sample to reduce the project resources and  		burden that would be required to enroll facilities with a low volume of such  		Medicare admissions. Within each of the sampling cells, we initially selected  		the desired number of facilities using a probability-proportionate-to-size  		sampling technique so that larger facilities of the same type were given a  		higher probability of selection than the smaller ones of that type. A  		stratified sample of each type of facility (IRF, SNF, HH agency) was selected  		from the national census of Medicare facilities. Although this method resulted  		in a sample that was more likely to include large facilities, concerns about  		bias were tempered in that we did not believe that outcomes and quality would  		be tied systematically to facility size across facility types.</p>
<p>Each of the initial sampled facilities was contacted for enrollment in  		the study. Recruitment was performed through phone calls and written  		communication with facilities by research staff who continued to pursue each  		facility until a definite acceptance or refusal was proffered. Participating  		facilities were asked to complete a facility questionnaire to verify the  		address and contact information of the facility, as well as to obtain further  		information regarding the volume of Medicare stroke patients the facility  		admitted on a yearly basis and the names and telephone numbers of staff members  		who could serve as the facilitys data collector. We asked each facility  		to provide the contact information for at least one data collector. With the  		increased attention to protecting patient health information, many facilities  		required approval from internal Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). In those  		facilities, research staff proceeded to complete the requested forms in order  		to comply with the review process. With the need for IRB approval and the need  		to find and train data collectors who met the study standards, several months  		elapsed between initial contact and the first screened patient in some  		facilities. While an effort was made to enroll each of the facilities, there  		may be some non-response bias based on those not enrolled. However, we do not  		believe that responsiveness was tied to a facilitys predilection for  		secondary PAC, making it unlikely to create significant bias in our  		results.</p>
<p>A second stratified sample of IRFs and four additional stratified  		samples of SNFs were created using the methodology described above, as  		investigators determined a need to expand the number of enrolled facilities.  		<a href="#table2.1">Table 2.1</a> describes the facilities that participated in  		the study. A total of 88 facilities participated, comprised of 35 IRFs, 33  		SNFs, and 20 HH agencies in 20 states. For the 12 SNFs that screened patients  		but did not enroll any subjects, participation lasted an average of 11 months.  		For the seven HH agencies that screened patients but did not enroll any  		subjects, participation lasted an average of 12 months.</p>

<p>Using a screening form, the on-site data collector reviewed records of  		all new stroke admissions to identify stroke patients who were eligible for the  		study. Subject eligibility was limited to Medicare beneficiaries admitted to  		PAC for an acute stroke (either first or recurrent), with the diagnoses based  		on ICD-9 codes (study codes and their descriptions can be found in  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a> as part of the screening form that the data  		collectors filled out on each potential subject) and confirmed by chart review.  		Hospitalization for an acute stroke must have occurred within the 30 days prior  		to PAC admission without an intervening PAC episode. Subjects had to be at  		least 65 years of age and if cognitively impaired, or with severe speech and  		language impairment (for example, aphasia), must have had an able and willing  		caregiver/proxy available for interview. Because we targeted post-acute  		rehabilitation, we excluded individuals who were not able to receive therapy,  		were comatose, or resided in a long-term nursing facility prior to their acute  		stroke.</p>

Data collectors  		identified 3,630 hospital admissions for stroke admitted to a participating PAC  		provider. Confirming the diagnosis of stroke and admission to the PAC setting  		within 30 days of the hospitalization left a total of 3,175 cases to represent  		the population of stroke survivors in PAC settings of interest. Approximately  		31 percent of confirmed stroke patients receiving care in the study facilities  		were under 65 years of age and were eliminated from the study. Our population  		of interest included only Medicare patients who were subject to PPS (non-HMO)  		for whom the study facility was the first PAC admission for that stroke,  		eliminating approximately 30 percent of elderly stroke patients. These patients  		were then subject to exclusionary criteria necessary to acquire accurate data  		for our study and to focus on rehabilitation care. The exclusionary criteria  		included: not receiving therapy, non-English speaking, comatose, nursing home  		resident prior to hospitalization, and no identifiable proxy. One-hundred  		fifty-seven (157) patients (10 percent) were excluded, leaving 1,390 eligible  		for our study.</p>

</tr></table><p>The percent of total confirmed subjects who were excluded for age less  		than 65 years, received PAC services in a prior setting, or an HMO payer was  		highest in HH agencies (68.5 percent). The major reason for exclusion in HH was  		prior PAC (39 percent). Just less than half (48.5 percent) of SNF patients were  		excluded due to any of the three exclusion criteria. IRF patients were excluded  		largely due to age &lt;65 (35 percent). The volume of stroke admissions,  		particularly FFS with no prior PAC stay, was so low that 12 of 33 SNFs and 7 of  		20 HH agencies did not have a single patient who met these study criteria. This  		problem was compounded by the 20 percent of SNF patients and 15 percent of HH  		patients who were ineligible largely because they were not receiving therapy or  		had been residing in a nursing home. Thus, relatively few FFS Medicare stroke  		patients meeting study criteria were admitted directly from the hospital to  		participating SNFs and HH agencies.</p>
<p>Patient characteristics are described in <a href="#table2.3">Table  		2.3</a>. Participants were predominantly between 75-84 years of age, and  		roughly 56 percent were female. Most participants were married (47 percent) or  		widowed (43 percent), and the vast majority were White (87 percent).</p>
<h3>C. DATA SOURCES</h3>
<p>Data were acquired from three sources: (1) patient (or proxy) report  		from interviews conducted after PAC admission; (2) follow-up patient (or proxy)  		report from interviews conducted 90 days post-PAC admission; and (3) Medicare  		claims and electronic clinical data (i.e., MDS, OASIS or IRF-PAI) for the  		period from the index hospitalization to 90 days post-PAC admission for all  		study subjects. The 90-day time interval for follow-up was chosen because  		functional outcomes following stroke have largely peaked at 90 days, and  		because the intent of this study was to attribute differences in outcomes to  		the PAC episode. Longer periods of follow-up make attribution of outcomes to  		the PAC episode more difficult, and may overlap with subsequent PAC episodes  		because of the high rehospitalization rates associated with stroke.</p>
<p>Although similar in many respects, the admission and 90-day follow-up  		instruments were designed separately and for different purposes. The admission  		instrument was designed for administration within 7-10 days of PAC admission;  		it assessed baseline function (ADL, IADL, ambulation, and social/role function)  		<i>during the week prior to hospitalization</i>, as well as <i>current</i>  		mental health (depression and cognition). The follow-up instrument was designed  		for administration 90 days after PAC admission; it assessed the same functional  		measures, as well as residence, and some measures of satisfaction including  		satisfaction with care, adequacy of patient/family education, and degree of  		patient/family involvement in care. The admission and follow-up survey  		instruments are presented in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>. Medicare  		secondary data used in the study included electronic clinical data from patient  		assessments completed in each of the PAC settings that report assessments of  		patient condition and Medicare data from both Part A and Part B claims. Each of  		these data sources is explained in greater detail below.</p>

All on-site data collectors participated in a telephone training  			 session prior to beginning data collection at their respective facilities. The  			 training session covered the following areas: (1) study goals and objectives;  			 (2) patient screening and sampling procedures; (3) study protocols and  			 instruments; (4) protocols for locating and interviewing proxy respondents; (5)  			 general interviewing techniques; and (6) safeguarding data and confidentiality  			 guidelines. Prior to the training session, each data collector received a  			 training manual, which included general information about the study and study  			 objectives, all instruments and protocols, as well as training modules that  			 highlighted the various phases of data collection: screening and sampling;  			 initial patient contact; consent; and data collection. In addition to the  			 formal training session, each data collector completed one or more mock  			 interviews with research staff before performing his/her first interview for  			 the study. All specific questions about the instruments or interpretations of  			 responses were addressed by research staff via a series of memos, with copies  			 sent to all data collectors to help ensure that they were able to apply the  			 protocols and procedures uniformly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Administration</b>: The admission interview was administered  			 within 7-10 days of the study participants admission to PAC. Subjects  			 were interviewed face-to-face, either in the PAC facility for inpatients, or at  			 home for HH patients. Efforts were made to accommodate patient preferences as  			 to time of interview. If, during the screening process, it was found that the  			 patient had aphasia or severe dysarthria, data collectors located and contacted  			 a proxy, advised him/her of the study, and asked him/her to participate in the  			 study on the patients behalf. Additionally, proxies were used in cases  			 where the patient was not able to understand or give consent -- either in the  			 data collectors initial contact, or if the patients score was less  			 than 17 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)<sup><font><a href="#ref2.2">2</a></font></sup> during the administration of the admission  			 interview, indicating severe cognitive dysfunction that may have impaired a  			 subjects capacity to consent to participate in the study. Further, if in  			 the data collectors determination the patient appeared too fatigued,  			 confused, or agitated to complete the interview, the data collector  			 discontinued the interview with the patient and attempted to contact a proxy.  			 Proxies were identified according to the following priorities: (1) legal  			 guardian, if one was assigned; (2) close relative who lived with the patient,  			 such as spouse, son, daughter, sister, brother, or significant  			 other; (3) close friend/companion who lived with the patient; (4) close  			 relative/friend who lived in the same area, and was in frequent (at least  			 weekly) contact with the patient. In all cases, preference was given to  			 individuals who were most familiar with the patients health and health  			 care use. Overall, of the 674 study subjects, 463 were patient and 211 were  			 proxy interviews. Completed interviews were submitted to research staff on a  			 weekly basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Data Review</b>: For ongoing management, each on-site data  			 collector was assigned to a supervisor who maintained weekly contact and  			 reviewed all admission interviews received for consistency and accuracy,  			 addressing any data quality concerns with the data collector in a timely  			 fashion and asking for corrections or clarifications when needed. The  			 supervisor was also available on a daily basis to respond to any questions or  			 issues encountered by the data collector. Upon receipt, data collector  			 supervisors reviewed hardcopy baseline instruments for completeness and to  			 ensure that the interviewer instructions were correctly followed. If a critical  			 item was missing, a call was made to the on-site data collector to retrieve the  			 missing data and reinforce the need to provide complete information. Once the  			 editing process was completed and callbacks were made to retrieve critical data  			 items, the documents were entered by trained staff. Each document was data  			 entered a second time to reduce the number of entry errors, and at completion  			 of data entry the two databases were compared. Inconsistencies between the  			 databases were minimal, and differences were subsequently reviewed and  			 corrected.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>2. Follow-Up Interview</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Follow-Up Interview Administration</b>: The follow-up interviews  			 were conducted by research staff, which included a core of supervisors and  			 interviewers experienced in interviewing the frail elderly. We used contact  			 information provided by the subject for themselves and two other persons who  			 would be likely to know the whereabouts of the subject. During the follow-up  			 interview, responses were entered directly into a telephone interview database  			 with forms designed uniquely for this study. Because our goal was to conduct  			 the follow-up interviews approximately 90 days after PAC admission,  			 interviewers made an initial attempt to contact each patient 80-85 days after  			 his or her PAC admission, and completed the follow-up interview no later than  			 115 days after PAC admission. Interviewers accommodated subjects  			 schedules as much as possible, completing interviews in the evenings or  			 weekends when requested.</p>
<p>The interview began with a brief competency assessment comprised of  			 a series of simple questions (name, address, reason for hospitalization). Based  			 on the patients or proxys responses, telephone data collectors  			 determined whether the patient/proxy understood the questions being asked of  			 him/her. If, in the data collectors determination, the responses seemed  			 incoherent or illogical, he or she discontinued the interview and asked to  			 speak with a proxy (as defined by the priorities specified above). If at any  			 time during the telephone interview, the respondent seemed too fatigued,  			 confused, or agitated to complete the interview, data collectors either offered  			 to schedule the remainder of the interview at another time (in cases of  			 fatigue) or contacted a proxy to complete the remainder of the interview (in  			 cases of confusion or agitation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow-Up Interview Response Rates</b>: We were able to complete  			 follow-up interviews with 87 percent of those subjects alive at 90 days. There  			 were 39 subjects (5.8 percent) who died between admission and 90 days, 30 (4.4  			 percent) who could not be located, 39 (5.8 percent) who refused, eight who were  			 unable to complete the interview (1.2 percent), and five (&lt;1 percent) cases  			 for which there was a data collector error. This left 553 cases for which a  			 90-day follow-up interview was conducted. Of these cases, 483 (87 percent) were  			 conducted with the original respondent (70 or 13 percent were completed with a  			 different respondent). Also, there were 318 cases that were conducted with the  			 patient at both the baseline and 90-day period, 58 cases with patient at  			 baseline and proxy at 90 days, four cases with proxy at baseline and patient at  			 90 days, and 173 cases with a proxy at both time points. For the 173  			 proxy-proxy combinations, 165 kept the same proxy across time points (eight  			 changed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Data Review</b>: The database was periodically reviewed for  			 consistency, with unusual responses examined and corrections applied. Follow-up  			 interview responses were also compared to baseline interview responses to flag  			 subjects with unlikely recovery patterns, and responses were dropped when  			 concerns about their accuracy arose. As an example, if a patient was unable to  			 walk 20 feet before the stroke based on the admission interview, and then had  			 no difficulty walking 20/50/300 feet at 90 days, this would be considered  			 unlikely. For such cases, the suspicious items were set to missing for analysis  			 purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>3. Medicare Secondary Data</b></p>
<p>We requested claims data and electronic clinical data (MDS, OASIS, and  		IRF-PAI) for all study subjects from the beginning of the data collection  		period to 90 days after the last subject was enrolled in the study. We also  		requested national MedPAR discharge data for the years 1998-2004 on all stroke  		discharges and POS files for PAC providers. These secondary data sources  		provided additional covariates, as well as outcome, cost, and utilization  		measures.</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Electronic Clinical Data</b>: These data sources include: the MDS  			 for SNFs, the IRF-PAI for IRFs, and the OASIS for HH agencies. These data were  			 used in three ways. First, they provided a uniform method for comparing  			 characteristics at the time of PAC admission; obtaining such information from  			 secondary data sources reduced the overall burden imposed on patients. Data  			 corresponding to basic ADL function upon admission (or soon after admission) to  			 PAC from these sources that were obtained using a cross-walk to the Barthel  			 Index (discussed later in the chapter) were particularly useful. As previously  			 mentioned, the admission interviews assessed baseline function during the week  			 prior to hospitalization (before the stroke), but not upon admission to PAC.  			 Second, the uniform information from these assessment instruments was used  			 sparingly to risk adjust in comparing outcomes and costs between PAC  			 episodes.</p>
<p>Third, these data allowed us to correct Medicare numbers for a  			 number of patients for whom we were requesting Medicare claims data. When we  			 first matched available assessment data to our data, it was determined that  			 there were several leftover patients in the electronic clinical data for whom  			 we did not have a match. By reviewing names and dates of birth, we were able to  			 identify the correct person and obtain the correct Medicare number since all of  			 these assessments require this information for the beneficiary. This improved  			 our match rate to claims data, especially for cases in 2004. Our final match  			 rate was excellent, with a loss of only 4.9 percent of IRF cases, 4.8 percent  			 of SNF cases, and 3.5 percent of HH cases to missing claims data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medicare Claims</b>: Medicare Part A, hospital OP, and carrier  			 claims data were analyzed to obtain information regarding the relative cost to  			 Medicare for different types of PAC episodes. In addition, Medicare claims  			 provided information regarding primary and comorbid diagnoses. Claims data also  			 provided information on different PAC services provided and charges for  			 different types of services. Medicare claims-based data included: acute  			 hospital; PAC IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies; all OP; physician; and other Part B  			 data from the Carrier file. MedPAR data were used for national analysis of  			 institutional PAC trends. The MedPAR file contains all Medicare discharges from  			 inpatient hospitals (including rehabilitation hospitals) and SNFs. MedPAR  			 represents all services rendered to a beneficiary from the time of admission to  			 a facility through discharge, collapsing all claims for a stay into one  			 record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Provider of Service (POS)</b>: Facility questionnaire responses  			 were confirmed and additional provider-level covariates were extracted from the  			 POS files for the PAC providers participating in the study.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>D. MEASURES</h3>
<p><b>1. Outcome and Quality Measures</b></p>
<p>The outcome and quality measures in this study were derived from a PAC  		quality measurement instrument developed under an earlier, related Office of  		the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation contract.<sup><font><a href="#ref2.3">3</a></font></sup> Under that contract,  		investigators conducted an extensive review of the medical literature to  		generate a comprehensive list of potential quality indicators for stroke and  		three other prevalent PAC conditions. These lists of indicators were then  		reviewed by a panel of health care providers and researchers, experienced in  		PAC, who rated each indicator according to importance and feasibility for  		inclusion in a PAC quality assessment instrument for use in health services  		research. Based on these ratings, draft longitudinal quality measurement  		instruments were assembled, using validated measures wherever possible. These  		draft instruments were pilot tested on a local level for feasibility of  		administration and presented to a second panel comprised of content experts,  		methodologists, providers, and policy officials who commented on such issues as  		relevance and feasibility of administration, response burden, sampling issues,  		and redundancy with other requirements. Based on experience gained through the  		pilot testing and input from the second panel meeting, revisions were made to  		the instruments and a second wave of local pilot testing was conducted. The  		quality measurement instruments for the stroke condition were then adapted for  		use in the current study.</p>
<p>The process of developing these measures was guided by several  		principles. First, wherever possible, reliable and previously validated  		measures were included, particularly if they had been evaluated in older  		frailer patients and/or in PAC settings. Second, in developing the instruments,  		burden of data collection was minimized. When available, shorter versions of  		validated questionnaires were used; in some cases, when short forms of  		validated questionnaires were not available, the questionnaires were shortened  		for inclusion in the proposed instruments. Third, the measures included had to  		be applicable to PAC provided by all three provider types -- SNFs, IRFs, and HH  		agencies.</p>
<p>Measures included in this study fall within five dimensions, including:  		(1) residence location at 90 days; (2) functional loss; (3) functional  		recovery; (4) self-reported health recovery; and (5) patient/proxy  		satisfaction. <a href="#table2.4">Table 2.4</a> lists and defines each of the  		outcome measures that we compared across settings in latter chapters. All of  		these measures were based on primary data collected in the admission and 90-day  		interviews because this information is not available uniformly across PAC data  		systems. The development, refinement, and properties of these indices are  		reported in <a href="#measure">Chapter 3</a>. </p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>With our population of prior community dwellers, location at 90 days was  		a fundamental marker for return to pre-stroke lifestyle and function. We show  		the patient's reported location at 90 days based on the follow-up interview.  		The Equally Independent Setting variable is based on the following  		hierarchy of living situations from most to least independent: 1-own home or  		apartment; 2-home of relative or friend, or adult foster care; 3-assisted  		living or board and care; and 4-nursing home. Using this hierarchy, a "0"  		denoted a change to a less independent setting, whereas "1" indicated an  		equally independent setting at 90 days relative to pre-stroke residence. Deaths  		and patients in the hospital at 90 days were excluded. Thus, 0  		would denote a patient who went from living in his/her own home prior to  		his/her stroke to living with a family member at 90 days, and 1  		would denote assisted living both before and after the stroke. Anyone residing  		in a nursing home at 90 days would be considered a "0," because all subjects  		were in one of the first three locations (i.e., not nursing home residents)  		before their strokes.</p>
<p>Functional loss and functional recovery are two different ways of  		measuring change in function. Functional loss measures the ordinal change  		between 90 days and pre-stroke function in each of four functional indices:  		ADLs, IADLs, ambulation ability, and social/role function. The indices were  		refined based upon analysis of study data. The development, refinement, and  		properties of these indices are reported in <a href="#measure">Chapter 3</a>.  		The range of the index for each domain is included in <a href="#table2.4">Table  		2.4</a> (higher represents more independence) and the outcome is the difference  		between the 90-day and pre-stroke values. Thus, a larger number represents  		greater loss in function. Recovery is a dichotomous measure where "0" denotes  		that the 90-day function is not as good as the pre-stroke function and "1"  		denotes that the values are at least equal. Thus, for each domain we calculate  		a rate or percentage of patients recovered to pre-stroke function.  		Self-reported health recovery is a measure of recovery in global health using a  		five-point Likert scale prior to stroke and 90 days post-stroke. A patient is  		recovered if the 90-day value is at least as good as baseline.</p>
<p>Satisfaction outcome measures fell into two categories. Most measures  		related to satisfaction with the health care received in the PAC setting, but  		one measure referred to satisfaction with overall recovery. All of these  		measures were rated as: 1-dissatified; 2-satisfied; 3-very satisfied; and  		4-extremely satisfied. They were collected once at 90 days.</p>
<p><b>2. Cost and Utilization Measures</b></p>
<p>To compare the relative cost of Medicare PAC across settings, we used  		three types of cost measures: (1) total payments; (2) Medicare payments; and  		(3) beneficiary payments (<a href="#table2.5">Table 2.5</a>). The beneficiary  		burden of payment (deductibles and coinsurance) varies among the settings,  		impacting PAC utilization patterns. We obtained Medicare payment estimates from  		the Medicare claims data. Claims data used in the study include the Medicare  		payment amounts and Medicare charges in total and for different categories of  		services. Medicare costs were assessed for PAC episodes involving all PAC  		providers utilized and for the 90-day interval.</p>
<p>PAC episode cost measures were defined differently from 90-day cost  		measures. Methodologically, costs were assigned to PAC if claims occurred  		during the PAC episode. The PAC episode was defined as care beginning with the  		first PAC provider until a break of 30 days in PAC services; or a discharge to  		residence without rehospitalization or death in three days; or death or  		hospitalization from a PAC setting; or 90 days. PAC costs were also restricted  		to costs incurred for IRF, SNF, HH, OP services, or Carrier costs (durable  		medical equipment (DME), physician supplier). Ninety-day costs included all  		claims in the 90-day period from admission to PAC, such as PAC costs plus  		hospital costs, physician services in the hospital or an office, laboratory,  		x-ray services, DME, etc.</p>
<p>Medicare costs were distinguished from beneficiary costs; total costs  		were the sum of these. Costs paid by the beneficiaries included deductibles and  		coinsurance based on the figure from the claims, recognizing that providers may  		not have been able to collect full payment from beneficiaries. Medicare costs  		were the Medicare payments from the claims. Per episode costs reflected the sum  		of all costs over the PAC episode or 90 days, while per-day costs were these  		costs divided by the PAC length of stay. The latter accounted for attrition due  		to death or discharge.</p>

The total PAC episode ended when a  		patient was discharged from PAC services for 30 days, died or was discharged to  		hospital from PAC, or was discharged from PAC to residence and was not  		rehospitalized or did not die within three days. The latter decision was made  		to eliminate unsuccessful PAC discharges that resulted either in  		rehospitalization or death immediately following the discharge, but to avoid  		requiring 30 days without PAC in cases where individuals returned to the  		hospital or died beyond the control of the PAC provider. For HH or OP, a 30-day  		window of no services was required to define the end of the PAC stay.  		Therefore, each patient was assigned a number of days in PAC based upon the  		last service date in the last claim of the episode. These calculations required  		extensive investigation of the claims for all Medicare covered services during  		the 90-day episode. For example, consider a patient admitted to the  		rehabilitation facility on August 25. After ten days, he was discharged home  		and received HH care for the next two weeks. Finally, he received OP  		rehabilitation services three times a week with the last service date of  		October 10, 2004. The number of days in his episode of care was 47. We  		artificially truncated episodes potentially longer than 90 days to 90 days due  		to data restrictions with our claims data.</p>
<p>At the end of the PAC stay, if the subject did not die or was not  		rehospitalized, he/she was considered in a residence. This residence was  		classified as: (1) nursing home; (2) assisted living, boarded care, and  		residential care; or (3) home alone or with others including senior housing.  		Information on residence was based on the 90-day interview with the assumption  		that the 90-day residence was a reasonable indication of residence at the end  		of the PAC stay. For a subject who was home at 90 days, it is reasonable to  		assume he/she went home directly from PAC, and for a subject who was in a  		nursing home at 90 days, it is also reasonable to assume he/she went to the  		nursing home from PAC -- especially since the interval between the end of the  		PAC stay and 90 days was often relatively short. Because claims do not contain  		this information, the 90-day interview was the best available source of  		data.</p>
<p>PAC length of stay was the number of days from the first PAC admission  		to the end of the episode, or 90 days for those patients whose episode did not  		end before 90 days. In some cases, there were gaps between PAC providers for  		which we needed to account. For example, a patient may have received PAC in an  		IRF, and then no care at all for a week and then OP care several times per  		week. In such a case, we did not count these interim days as part of the PAC  		length of stay but instead, counted only days for which there was claim  		activity. If the days occurred between visits to an OP or HH provider, however,  		they were counted as part of the PAC stay because intermittent visits are the  		nature of these modalities.</p>
<p><b>3. Covariates</b></p>
<p>In addition to the above outcome and utilization measures, measures from  		the interview survey instruments and secondary data sources were needed to  		compare patients across settings and adjust for case mix across PAC settings.  		Covariates were selected for inclusion based on previous research with similar  		populations,<sup><font><a href="#ref2.4">4</a>, <a href="#ref2.5">5</a>, <a href="#ref2.6">6</a>, <a href="#ref2.7">7</a>,  		<a href="#ref2.8">8</a></font></sup> as well as feedback from clinical panels  		and the technical advisory group (TAG).<sup><a href="#note2.a">a</a></sup> The  		patient-level covariates employed in this study are defined in Table 2.6,  		categorized by time of assessment including pre-stroke conditions; acute stroke  		care stay; and PAC admission. A fourth group included facility characteristics,  		and a fifth group included community characteristics. A few of these covariates  		requiring further clarification are discussed as well.</p>

</tr></table><p>Despite the differences in the three PAC assessment instruments, we  		derived a comparable functional measure by mapping the items to a modified  		Barthel Index.<sup><font><a href="#ref2.9">9</a></font></sup> The  		modified Barthel Index measured basic function through performance of nine  		ADLs. The original Barthel also included stairs, which was not available in our  		data. A detailed description of the data items used from each instrument and  		their cross-walks to the Barthel can be found in <a href="#appendC">Appendix  		C</a>.</p>
<p>Several other functional measures at the time of admission to PAC are  		the FIM subscales based on the IRF-PAI data. These scales address different  		components of function, many of which overlap with the Barthel. Because the  		necessary data are collected only in IRFs and there is no way to map other  		assessment instruments to these measures, they are used only in comparisons  		where the episode begins with an IRF admission.</p>
<p>Community characteristics included both urban/rural defined based on  		MSA, and two community related utilization characteristics that had served as  		sample stratifiers. The first utilization characteristic was the volume of  		inpatient rehabilitation care (number of admissions) provided in the community,  		with high rehabilitation communities defined as those above the median and low  		as those below the median. The second community variable was based on statewide  		availability of alternatives to nursing homes, specifically the number of  		licensed residential care beds (e.g., assisted living facilities) relative to  		nursing home beds. States above median on residential care and below median on  		nursing home beds were high resources, and states with the inverse were low. If  		a state was above median in residential care and also in nursing beds or below  		median on both, then the number of home and community-based services recipients  		was used to determine high or low. The rationale for using this stratifier was  		that states in which community resources were high relative to nursing home  		beds would be expected to use nursing homes less.</p>
<p>Covariates were compared among patients admitted to the three primary  		PAC discharge settings from the hospital and among patients receiving selected  		patterns of PAC. Variables that evidenced strong differences across settings  		were considered for inclusion as risk adjustment variables for outcomes and  		costs in multivariate models.</p>
<p><b>4. Data Editing and Transformations</b></p>
<p>For all variables, we examined frequency distributions to evaluate  		missing data as well as extremely rare or skewed responses. Selected  		consistency checks were conducted within cases, seeking atypical response  		patterns. Sites and variables with a high rate of missing data or atypical  		responses were thoroughly reviewed for data quality, and if necessary excluded  		from the analyses. Transformations of the raw data elements into the analysis  		measures were completed for all case mix, outcome, and cost variables.</p>

<h3>A. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The clinical manifestations of stroke are varied and often result in one  		or more disabilities, defined as an inability or a restriction on performing an  		activity within normal ranges. Disabilities can occur in mobility, self-care,  		or the ability to manage higher levels of activities such as managing finances  		or medications, shopping, or driving. PAC rehabilitation services, including PT  		and OT, and speech, language pathology, seek to achieve the highest possible  		level of functional independence for patients through training, exercise, and  		physical manipulation. Patients may need to relearn simple motor activities  		such as walking, sitting, or standing as well as more complex skills.  		Rehabilitation may retrain the body to coordinate movements or may teach stroke  		survivors new ways of performing activities to compensate for residual  		disabilities.</p>
<p>For patients living in the community prior to their strokes, persistent  		functional disabilities may represent a barrier to returning to their former  		level of independence and may decrease their quality of life. As such,  		functional measures are frequently used as outcome measures in stroke recovery  		during the period following a stroke. Various functional measurement batteries  		exist that categorize function in different ways, yielding different  		indices.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.1">1</a>, <a href="#ref3.2">2</a>,  		<a href="#ref3.3">3</a></font></sup> The most traditional approach for  		classifying physical functions in older and chronically ill patients is to  		delineate basic ADLs, which pertain to fundamental self-care, and IADLs, which  		involve more complex functions that require a higher level of motor function  		than is needed for ADL function. IADLs are typically necessary for independent  		living within the community but are not necessarily performed on a daily  		basis.</p>
<p>The composition of ADL and IADL indices -- as well as the distinction  		between the two constructs -- varies to some extent in the literature. For  		example, the Katz ADL Index<sup><font><a href="#ref3.4">4</a></font></sup> includes six basic functions -- bathing,  		dressing, toileting, transfer, continence, and feeding; whereas the Barthel  		Index<sup><font><a href="#ref3.5">5</a></font></sup> includes the six  		Katz Index items plus grooming, walking, ascending/descending stairs, and bowel  		continence. Lawton and Brodys Physical Self-Maintenance Scale<sup><font><a href="#ref3.6">6</a></font></sup> includes IADL items related to  		using the telephone, shopping, preparing food, housekeeping, laundry,  		transportation, taking medication, and handling finances, while other IADL  		indices also include more socially-focused activities (e.g., playing games,  		keeping track of current events, and remembering appointments).<sup><font><a href="#ref3.7">7</a></font></sup> Some ADL and IADL indices  		include items related to ambulation and walking,<sup><font><a href="#ref3.5">5</a>, <a href="#ref3.8">8</a></font></sup> while other  		measurement instruments, such as the Walking Impairment  		Questionnaire,<sup><font><a href="#ref3.9">9</a></font></sup> assess  		walking independently of other functions.</p>
<p>Our study goals as discussed in <a href="#issue">Chapter 1</a> included  		the need to identify core measures for accurate comparison across settings. To  		this end, we addressed the issue of necessary domains of function for measuring  		stroke recovery. Based on input from expert panels (discussed in  		<a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>) and literature review, we determined that four  		domains of function were essential to measure in order to assess outcomes of  		stroke care. These four domains are ADLs, IADLs, social/role function, and  		ambulation. In subsequent sections of this chapter, we provide the overall  		methods for developing indices in each of these areas, and discuss the specific  		index that was developed for each domain. We also run comparisons of outcomes  		among the indices, noting whether they possess similar or dissimilar patterns  		in recovery. Variation in recovery suggests the need for all of the domains to  		be included when comparing outcomes across PAC settings, as opposed to the most  		commonly used ADL functions.</p>
<h3>B. METHODS</h3>
<p><b>1. Data</b></p>
<p>To measure functional items, data were collected at baseline, upon or  		soon after admission to PAC, and at 90 days after PAC admission for a range of  		functions covering all four domains. The data were self-reported by patients or  		proxies because self-reported information that is truly patient-centered is  		gaining acceptance as the preferred type of information on which to base  		quality and outcome assessments.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.1">1</a>,  		<a href="#ref3.3">3</a>, <a href="#ref3.10">10</a>, <a href="#ref3.11">11</a>,  		<a href="#ref3.12">12</a>, <a href="#ref3.13">13</a></font></sup> The structure  		of the questions was adapted from the Longitudinal Study on Aging.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.14">14</a></font></sup> The following two-stage  		question was used for each function.

<p>This type of question is easy for respondents to follow both in person  		and over the telephone. Data at baseline pertained to the period prior to the  		stroke so that we could measure recovery to prior functional state.</p>
<p><b>2. Index Creation</b></p>
<p>In each domain, we created a single measure of function that  		consolidated disability levels from multiple functions within the domain. We  		had three goals in constructing indices in the domains: (1) to create indices  		that were sensitive to clinical differences in recovery status; (2) to retain  		the most complete level of information from the study instrument; and (3) to  		create indices that meaningfully measured different components of stroke  		recovery.</p>
<p>Before collapsing the individual activities into indices, we computed  		simple means and correlations to identify potential functions that were  		outliers in each domain (i.e., any function that did not appear to follow the  		same baseline or recovery patterns or were not at all correlated with other  		functions in the domains). After dropping outlier functions, each function was  		converted into a four-point scale that incorporated the presence and level of  		disability. Combining the scales into indices retained the detailed information  		from each function into the final measure. As metrics, indices produced greater  		sensitivity and reduced the natural skew of the underlying individual recovery  		distributions. Finally, the constructed indices were compared to each other to  		determine if they provided statistically different measures of recovery and  		whether they generated patterns of recovery in our study subjects. An  		illustrative example of the mechanics of the index creation process is  		described under <a href="#section3.C.1">Section C.1</a>. </p>
<h3>C. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING</h3>
<p><b><a name="section3.C.1" id="section3.C.1">1. ADL Functions</a> </b></p>
<p>Selection of ADL measures for this study was guided by several criteria,  		including: the need for adaptation for use in person or by telephone; prior use  		with post-acute populations; and most importantly, relevance of question  		content. For the period prior to the stroke and at 90 days, patients or their  		proxies were asked to report level of difficulty in performing seven ADLs  		(bathing, dressing, grooming, eating, bed/chair transfer, toileting, and  		controlling bladder) using the question structure previously described. These  		responses were converted into the following score: 3-no difficulty, 2-some  		difficulty, 1-a lot of difficulty, and 0-unable. Thus, higher levels on the  		scores represented greater independence. To create an index measure of overall  		functional recovery in the basic ADLs, we examined the correlations among  		recovery measures for each of the seven functions. Recovery was defined as a  		90-day level of disability equal to or better than the level of disability  		prior to stroke. For example, a patient who had "some difficulty" eating prior  		to stroke was recovered in eating at 90 days if he/she had either "some  		difficulty" or "no difficulty." The ADL functions were reasonably correlated in  		all cases, with the exception of bladder control. Further investigation noted  		that the bladder control function could have been capturing recovery due to the  		presence of a catheter rather than through improvement in bladder control;  		therefore, this function was dropped from our ADL index. </p>
<p>Summing the scores of each activity created an ADL index with a range  		from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating a greater level of function. We  		dealt with missing items by dropping them from the index for a particular  		patient and rescaling the score to the 18-point index. Patients missing more  		than one-half of the activities were deemed to have too little information to  		create an adequate measure of function and their ADL indices were assigned to  		missing.</p>
<p><b>2. Self-Reported Baseline and Recovery in ADL Functions</b></p>
<p>Means and standard deviations of the pre-stroke and 90-day scores for  		each of the six ADLs included in the index are presented in <a href="#table3.1">Table 3.1</a> along with two outcome indicators: (1) the  		difference between the 90-day score and the pre-stroke score, measuring  		residual impairment; and (2) percentage of patients achieving recovery to  		pre-stroke function. Most patients were functionally independent in each of the  		individual ADLs pre-stroke, ranging from 81.4 percent who were able to transfer  		in and out of chairs and bed with no difficulty to 96.1 percent who were able  		to eat with no difficulty. Consistent with our subject population of community  		dwelling stroke patients, over two-thirds (70.9 percent) of subjects were  		functionally independent in all of the ADLs prior to having a stroke.</p>

</tr></table><p>At 90 days after PAC admission, a majority of patients were recovered to  		pre-stroke function in any given activity, with the lowest recovery rate in  		bathing, 57 percent, and the highest recovery rate in eating, 88 percent.  		However, only 41 percent of patients were recovered to pre-stroke levels in the  		index of all ADLs and the mean residual impairment was 2.74 points with a  		standard deviation of 4.78, indicating a broad range of recovery levels.  		Residual impairment mirrored recovery, with the largest mean impairment in  		bathing (0.72) and the smallest in eating (0.13). The degree of recovery skews  		these means, however, because the majority of individuals recovered and had  		residual impairment of 0. As an example, excluding subjects who recovered, the  		residual impairment in bathing increases from 0.72 to 1.87. One implication is  		that the dichotomous recovery indicator may be a better outcome indicator than  		residual impairment scores because of this skewed distribution. A few subjects  		in each functional ability queried reported 90 day function levels greater than  		prior stroke function, results that may be a form of measurement error or may  		be the result of prior disabilities improving from receiving rehabilitation as  		a result of stroke. (Personal mobility was assessed under a separate index,  		described in <a href="#section3.E.1">Section E.1</a>.)</p>
<h3>D. SELF-REPORTED INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY  		LIVING</h3>
<p>IADLs are indicators of functional well-being that measure the ability  		to perform more complex tasks that are necessary for independent living within  		the community but that are not necessarily performed on a daily basis. IADL  		functional recovery was assessed in a similar manner to the ADLs across seven  		separate functions.</p>
<p><b>1. IADL Functions</b></p>
<p>During the developmental stages of the study, expert panels strongly  		advocated for inclusion of IADLs as responsive measures of the quality of care  		delivered to persons with stroke. IADL measures selected for inclusion  		represented higher levels of function as recommended by the panels. However,  		IADLs with high non-response rates (i.e., those likely due to gender bias such  		as housework) based on our prior studies involving IADL measurement were  		excluded. The seven IADL functions contained in the study instrument were  		shopping, managing money, using the telephone, preparing/taking medicine,  		getting in/out of car, preparing meals, and climbing stairs. Scales for  		individual items and for the index were created in the same manner as for the  		ADL items.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>2. Baseline and Recovery in IADL Functions</b></p>
<p>As compared to ADL functions, subjects were more likely to have a  		disability prior to their stroke in IADL functions and less likely to be  		recovered to pre-stroke function at 90-days after PAC admission. Pre-stroke  		function ranged from 70 percent of subjects with full independence in climbing  		stairs to 91 percent of patients with full independence using the telephone.  		Unlike ADL function, the recovery patterns did not align completely with  		pre-stroke disability rates. Patients were least likely to recover in their  		ability to prepare a meal but most likely to recover in phone use. Less than  		one-third (31 percent) of subjects were fully recovered across all IADLs at 90  		days, and again, we observed a broad distribution of residual impairment, with  		a mean residual impairment level of 5.04 and a standard deviation of 6.14.</p>
<h3>E. AMBULATION</h3>
<p><b><a name="section3.E.1" id="section3.E.1">1. Ambulation Functions</a></b></p>
<p>The expert panels ranked ambulation among the most important outcome  		indicators for patients with stroke. Panels also recommended including  		assessments of transfer mobility (as assessed in the above ADL index), as well  		as home and community mobility. With this in mind, we referred to the Walking  		Impairment Questionnaire,<sup><font><a href="#ref3.9">9</a></font></sup> which was designed to capture self-reported  		degree of difficulty in walking varying distances. The original Walking  		Impairment Questionnaire assessed degree of difficulty in walking three, two,  		one, and one-half city block or less. In order to minimize response burden, we  		initially limited the distances assessed to three levels: around the house (20  		feet), one city block, and several city blocks. Pilot testing revealed that  		further revision to the scale was warranted to adapt the scale to an older  		post-acute population, rendering the following levels: around the house (20  		feet), 50 feet, and one city block (300 feet) -- using the same two-part  		question collapsed into the scale (3-no difficulty; 2-some difficulty; 1-a lot  		of difficulty; 0-unable). (Community mobility was assessed as part of the  		social/role function index, which is described in Section E.) Following the  		index calculation methods in the Walking Impairment Questionnaire,<sup><font><a href="#ref3.9">9</a></font></sup> we weighted the responses by the  		walking distance, rescaling the results to a 100-point scale for ease of  		interpretation.</p>

<p>Pre-stroke function declined progressively as the walking distance  		increased, ranging from 89 percent of subjects with no difficulty walking  		around the house to 64 percent of patients with no difficulty walking a city  		block. Residual impairment in each of the distances was low as compared to most  		of the ADL and IADL functions, and three-fifths of subjects recovered to  		pre-stroke function in ambulation.</p>
<h3>F. SOCIAL/ROLE FUNCTION</h3>
<p><b>1. Social/Role Function Activities</b></p>
<p>In their review of the outcome indicators, expert panel members  		emphasized the importance of assessing social/role function to capture  		important aspects of functional status for stroke patients not addressed by  		traditional measures of physical function. We reviewed numerous measures of  		health-related quality of life, and found that although these measures included  		items related to social and role function, many were not relevant to older  		post-acute patients and appeared to not fully capture the concept as it applied  		to this patient population. The RNL Index<sup><font><a href="#ref3.15">15</a></font></sup> was recommended by several expert panelists  		and was selected based on the relevance and wording of items for the population  		of interest, the development strategy employed in choosing the items, and its  		brevity.</p>
<p>The RNL was designed to assess global functional status by incorporating  		both objective performance indicators and patients perceptions of their  		own abilities.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.15">15</a>,  		<a href="#ref3.16">16</a></font></sup> These items combine traditional measures  		of physical function (i.e., difficulty performing various activities) with  		patients <i>feelings</i> about performing various activities (i.e.,  		difficulty performing activities <i>that were necessary or important to the  		patient</i>) -- with the goal of understanding more about patients  		social/role function and quality of life. In addition to acceptable  		psychometric properties, the RNL had been specifically tested in post-acute  		populations.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.15">15</a></font></sup> The  		authors of the RNL solicited input from three advisory panels made up of  		patients with chronic illness, healthy persons, health care providers,  		psychologists, and clergymen to ensure broad-based input and  		representation.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.16">16</a></font></sup> The  		RNL instrument is comprised of 11 items, uses a visual analog scale for  		response, and can be converted to a 100-point score.</p>
<p>To adapt the RNL for the purposes of this study, items of less relevance  		to measuring quality in the post-acute population were removed. In addition,  		because the follow-up interviews were administered by telephone, we initially  		adapted the visual analog scale for telephone using a five-point Likert scale.  		Pilot testing of the instruments revealed that the five-point scale was too  		cumbersome for subjects to answer, so the response scale was modified to a  		format similar to that used for the ADL, IADL, and ambulation items described  		above (i.e., presence or absence of difficulty, and if present, level  		difficulty encountered).</p>
<p>Subjects were asked if they could perform the following activities as  		they felt was necessary: (1) move around the house; (2) move around the  		community; (3) take trips; (4) take part in recreational activities; (5)  		perform work or other necessary activities; (6) take part in social activities;  		and (7) take part in family life. They were also asked if they: (8) had  		difficulty taking part in family life the way that their family wanted; and (9)  		whether they felt their personal needs were being met.</p>
<p>Correlations and recovery measures among the social/role functions  		revealed one function that did not appear to move in conjunction with the other  		activities: satisfaction with how personal needs were met with or without help  		from others. As with the bladder control function within the ADL index, this  		function contained different responses than the other functions in this domain.  		Further, the phrase with help from others led to counterintuitive  		responses. For example, a nursing home resident may receive significant  		assistance with personal needs, but is not able to perform any of their prior  		social functions in the community. This item was dropped from the index.</p>
<p><b>2. Baseline and Recovery in Social/Role Function</b></p>
<p>Pre-stroke social/role function disability levels were very similar  		across the eight functions included in the index, ranging from 77 percent  		(performing work or other necessary activities) to 86 percent (moving around  		house) reporting no difficulties. Return to pre-stroke function was least  		likely in performing work/other necessary activities (51 percent) and most  		likely in moving around the house (77 percent) and in taking part in social  		activities (77 percent). Although the mean residual impairment (3.69) and  		recovery rate (38 percent) were between the level of ADL and IADL function, the  		distribution of impairment was broader than both with a standard deviation  		6.44, indicating greater variation in recovery levels than either ADL or IADL  		function.</p>

<p>While each of these functional domains contributes to the ability of  		stroke survivors to return to living in the community and to quality of life  		after stroke, the extent to which they are associated is unknown. They involve  		different levels and combinations of motor skills, cognition, and social  		abilities and were designed to capture different components of stroke recovery.  		We focused on the dichotomous return to pre-stroke function measure for  		comparison as most appropriate given the relative differences in scales for the  		indices. </p>
<p><b>1. Components of Recovery</b></p>
<p>We expected that subjects would have various levels of global recovery  		and so the likelihood of recovery in a given domain was believed to be  		correlated with the likelihood of recovery in other domains, but not to be  		fully predictive of recovery in other domains. The observed correlations  		support these assumptions, as all indices were positively but not highly  		correlated with each other (as shown in <a href="#table3.5">Table 3.5</a>).</p>

</tr></table><p>To further ascertain whether, in fact, these indices were measuring  		identical components of recovery, we compared the likelihood of recovery in the  		indices to each other, controlling for within person recovery tendencies using  		a randomized block analysis of variance (ANOVA) design. Sensitive to  		differences in recovery within subjects, the ANOVA regression revealed  		significant differences in the likelihood of patients to be recovered across  		indices and presented in <a href="#table3.6">Table 3.6</a>. Post-hoc  		comparisons of the mean recovery rates for all pairs of indices suggested that  		recovery in each domain had a different likelihood, after adjusting for the  		correlations among domain recovery within subjects. These differences lended  		support to our third goal, creating indices to measure different components of  		recovery. </p>
<p><b>2. Patterns of Recovery</b></p>
<p>Several physical mechanisms are presumed to be involved in stroke  		recovery, such as resolution of neural edema, neural plasticity, and behavioral  		compensation strategies. Some general patterns of recovery are observed in  		stroke patients. Motor functions grow more smooth over the duration of  		recovery,<sup><font><a href="#ref3.17">17</a></font></sup> and  		patients move from recovery in gross motor to fine motor skills. Recovery of  		motor functions is earlier and often more complete in the lower extremities  		than recovery in the upper extremities.<sup><font><a href="#ref3.18">18</a></font></sup> Higher order cognitive functions may return  		in parallel or on a different path than motor functions. Rehabilitation is  		believed to enhance or modulate generally observed recovery patterns by  		interacting with these underlying processes, but we expect to find some  		evidence that individual functional indices or combinations of indices were  		more or less likely to be recovered. </p>

</tr></table><p>Excluding deaths and missing data, we were able to calculate index  		outcome measures in all four indices for 461 subjects. Approximately one-fifth  		of subjects were recovered in all four indices (90), while a larger proportion  		(125) were recovered in none of the indices. This left the majority of the  		patients with partial functional recovery (i.e., recovered in a single index or  		a combination of indices but not in all indices). All possible combinations of  		index recovery were observed; however, some patterns emerged.  		<a href="#figure3.1">Figure 3.1</a> graphically depicts the distribution of  		recovery by index and by the number of domains in which a patient achieved  		recovery. The height of the bars in the graph mirrors the ANOVA findings of the  		previous section. Overall, subjects were more likely to recover ambulation, as  		180 (or 75.3 percent) out of the 239 patients with return to prior function in  		some, but not all, indices recovered. ADL and social/role function recovery was  		similar, although ADL recovery remained more likely than recovery of  		social/role function and subjects were least likely to recover in IADL where  		only 60 (or 25.1 percent) of subjects with partial recovery of functional  		indices returned to their pre-stroke level of function.</p>

</tr></table><p>The bands of color indicate the distribution of recovery in a given  		index among the possible level of overall partial recovery: recovery in one  		domain, recovery in two domains, and recovery in three domains. The blue bands  		show that recovery in one domain was by far more likely to occur in ambulation  		than any other functional index, while the yellow bands show that recovery to  		pre-stroke function in IADL was only likely to occur in subjects that had  		recovered in at least two other domains. The likelihood of recovery may be due  		either to a time pattern of recovery or to the overall likelihood for long-term  		recovery. For example, IADL recovery may be less likely to be observed in our  		study because it is the functional index with the least chance of recovery or  		because it is often the last index to recover and recovery occurs after our end  		point of 90 days. </p>
<h3>H. INDICES AS OUTCOME MEASURES</h3>
<p>Our functional indices displayed desirable characteristics as outcomes  		measures. First, good dispersion in outcome values across subjects was found in  		each index, consistent with sensitivity to small differences in recovery.  		Second, recovery was positively correlated among all of the indices, suggesting  		that the indices do not provide contradictory information as recovery outcomes.  		</p>
<p>We also found evidence to support our design of indices to represent  		different domains of function. While recovery in any given index was positively  		correlated with each of the other indices, the simple correlations were less  		than 0.5, suggesting that no index was a pure substitute for another. Our ANOVA  		analysis provided evidence that each index had different likelihoods of  		recovery. The majority of subjects were recovered in one or more, but not all  		domains. These results emphasize the need to use each of the domains for a  		comprehensive comparison of recovery in PAC. </p>
<h3>I. SUMMARY</h3>
<p>Our study subjects provided self-reported levels of functional  		disability prior to their stroke and 90 days post-stroke in 26 separate  		activities under four domains of function. We constructed indices incorporating  		the individual functions to measure recovery under each of the four domains  		consistent with clinical meaningfulness and statistical findings. These indices  		proved to have different likelihoods of recovery in our subjects and to present  		some general recovery patterns across domains while displaying some attractive  		features as outcome measures. The literature of stroke outcomes often limits  		recovery to physical functions such as ADLs, while, variation in outcomes among  		indices suggests a strong need to incorporate all four domains when comparing  		outcomes across PAC settings.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="pattern" id="pattern">4. PATTERNS OF POST-ACUTE CARE FOLLOWING  		IMPLEMENTATION OF PPS</a></h2>
<h3>A. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>In an effort to contain the rapid growth in Medicare PAC expenditures  		during the late 1980s to mid-1990s, Congress established PPSs for IRFs, SNFs,  		and HH agencies under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The SNF PPS was  		implemented in July 1998, the HH PPS was implemented in 2000, and the IRF PPS  		was implemented in January 2002, with an OP care PPS implemented in August  		2000. The SNF PPS resulted in a per diem rate for each day of care based on the  		provision of specific services and patient condition. The IRF PPS rate is per  		discharge based on the patient's condition (e.g., diagnosis, function), and the  		HH PPS rate is for a 60-day episode based on patient condition and services  		provided. The OP PPS is a fee schedule setting rates per visit for individual  		services and procedures.</p>
<p>Just as each PAC setting has its own patient assessment instrument, the  		PPS for each PAC care setting has its own case mix classification system and  		reimbursement incentives. The incentives under these PPSs are likely to have  		substantial effects on both the patterns of PAC use and the characteristics of  		patients admitted to different PAC providers.</p>
<p>The SNF and HH PPS classification systems use therapy services as a  		basis for categorizing patients for payment. The RUG-III case mix  		classification system for SNFs has five rehabilitation RUG categories  		determined by the amount of therapy provided. In general, rehabilitation RUGs  		are paid at the highest rates. Due to legislation enacted in November 1999,  		three rehabilitation groups received a 20 percent add-on payment: high  		rehabilitation (325 minutes) functional category C; medium rehabilitation (150  		minutes) functional category C; and medium rehabilitation functional category  		B. The effect was an immediate increase in the admission of patients requiring  		therapy at these levels and a major decrease in the admission of patients in  		the very high (500 minutes) and ultra-high (720 minutes) therapy  		groups.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.1">1</a></font></sup> Because many  		stroke patients require more than 325minutes of therapy per week, there was a  		disincentive to admit stroke patients to SNFs until this add-on was  		redistributed across all rehabilitation payment groups in 2001.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.2">2</a></font></sup> Furthermore, many stroke  		patients can benefit from even more therapy than the 720minutes and  		twotherapies that is the minimum for the ultra-high group. Because SNFs do not  		receive additional payment if more than the minimum therapy to qualify for the  		RUG category is provided, they are under a disincentive to admit stroke  		patients with rehabilitation needs that exceed these minimums.</p>
<p>The HH PPS provides a higher reimbursement rate per 60-day episode of  		care for patients who require at least ten visits of therapy. Thus, HH agencies  		have an incentive to accept patients who require the minimum of ten therapy  		visits. However, there is no incentive to accept patients who require  		substantially more than the ten visits.</p>
<p>The per discharge system developed for IRFs has the same type of  		incentive as the acute hospital PPS implemented in 1983 based on  		diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), a classification system under which  		reimbursement is provided based on patient condition regardless of time spent  		in the facility. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into one of 385  		CMGs based on diagnosis and functional status, resulting in an incentive to  		discharge patients in as few days as possible to reduce costs of care relative  		to the payment. For most IRFs, this would provide an incentive to rapidly  		discharge patients to subsequent post-acute providers for additional needed  		care. Thus, we would expect to see declining IRF lengths of stay and an  		increase in multiple-provider episodes for individuals admitted initially to  		IRFs.</p>
<p>Prior to PPS, Kramer et al. (1997)<sup><font><a href="#ref4.3">3</a></font></sup> found overall differences between IRF and SNF  		patients for stroke and hip fracture, but identified subgroups of patients  		through propensity score analyses who were treated in reasonably high  		proportions in both settings. Identification of these subgroups, however,  		required information on cognition, availability of caregivers, and pre-morbid  		function -- none of which are available in larger administrative databases.  		Comparisons between HH patients and patients receiving institutional  		rehabilitation under the Medicare program have shown significant differences in  		function, cognition, and social supports, whereas studies using administrative  		data have argued that substitution between HH care and IRF or SNF care may have  		existed for some subgroups of patients.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.4">4</a>, <a href="#ref4.5">5</a>, <a href="#ref4.6">6</a></font></sup> Gage et al. argued that because of the  		importance of patient factors in the placement of patients with stroke, it is  		unlikely that the advent of PPS for PAC will increase substitution across  		settings.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.7">7</a></font></sup> Substitution  		of provider types may persist because of variations in PAC provider  		availability and practice patterns among geographic areas. However, to the  		extent that the payment systems result in incentives and disincentives for the  		different PAC settings to admit certain types of patients, providers may  		further differentiate with regard to the types of patients they admit, thus  		reducing the degree of substitution across settings.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to examine patterns of PAC for stroke  		patients following implementation of PPS for all PAC provider types. We  		hypothesize a dominance of multiple-provider episodes, at least for patients  		admitted initially to IRFs. Through an analysis of the characteristics of  		stroke patients admitted from hospital to different PAC settings and among  		those receiving various multiple-provider care patterns, we also plan to assess  		the extent of substitution that now exists across settings.</p>
<h3>B. METHODS</h3>
<p><b>1. Sampling</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Providers</b>: A total of 88facilities participated in the study,  			 including 35 IRFs, 33 SNFs, and 20 HH agencies from 20 different states.  			 Characteristics of these facilities are provided in <a href="#table2.1">Table  			 2.1</a>. Providers were required to admit at least 12 stroke patients per year  			 in the prior year to be eligible for the study based on screening from  			 secondary data sources and then confirmation upon recruitment. Thus, the  			 average number of stroke admissions in the prior year was 122 to IRFs, 18 to  			 SNFs, and 118 to HH agencies. These stroke admissions were not necessarily  			 direct admits from hospital to the PAC provider, meaning that these providers  			 were not necessarily the first PAC provider for the enrolled patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Subjects</b>: Subjects were enrolled largely between 2003 and  			 early 2005 (eight enrolled late in 2002). In total, 3,175 Medicare subjects  			 with a confirmed stroke diagnosis who had been hospitalized in the past 30 days  			 were screened for inclusion in the study. Of the 3,175 confirmed stroke  			 patients who were screened upon admission to a participating IRF, SNF, or HH  			 agency, the majority were admitted to IRFs (74 percent), with the remainder  			 split almost evenly between SNFs and HH agencies (<a href="#table2.2">Table  			 2.2</a>). Despite attempts to enroll the highest volume SNFs and HH agencies  			 into the study, the 33 SNFs admitted an average of 11.4 stroke patients (0.9  			 per screening month) during the study period and the 20 HH agencies admitted an  			 average of 23.2 stroke patients (1.9 per screening month), in contrast to 66.7  			 stroke patients admitted per IRF for the 35 IRFs (4.9 per screening month).  			 Patients younger than 65 years of age and Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a  			 health maintenance organization (HMO) or anything other than traditional FFS  			 Medicare were excluded, as were patients who received care in a prior PAC  			 setting. The percent of total screened subjects who were excluded for these  			 criteria was highest in HH agencies (68.5 percent) due particularly to prior  			 PAC (39 percent). Just less than half (48.5 percent) of SNF patients were  			 excluded due to any of three exclusion criteria, with 34 percent excluded due  			 to HMO enrollment and prior PAC. IRF patients were excluded largely due to age  			 &lt;65 (35 percent).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eligibility Criteria Included</b>: receiving therapy, English  			 speaking, not comatose, did not reside in nursing home prior to  			 hospitalization, and availability of an identifiable proxy (if needed). The  			 patient eligibility criteria eliminated more patients from SNFs, particularly  			 due to prior nursing home residence and lack of therapy (<a href="#table2.2">Table 2.2</a>). Of patients meeting these criteria (n=1,390),  			 8 percent were dropped at random to moderate data collection burden on  			 individual providers; 25 percent of the remainder refused; 5 percent of these  			 were eliminated due to deaths, transfers, or various delays; and 25 percent of  			 the remainder were dropped because data collectors could not complete the  			 interview. Of the remaining 674patients for whom interview data were available,  			 Medicare claims were matched for 642 (IRF n=528; SNF n=59; HH agency n=55).  			 IRFs admitted an average of 16patients to the study (range 1-48); SNFs admitted  			 an average of threepatients (range 1-17), and HH agencies admitted an average  			 of fourpatients (range 1-15).</p>

<p>The variables included patient characteristics, utilization measures  		from hospital and PAC services, facility characteristics of PAC services  		providers, and community characteristics. Patient characteristics were  		collected prior to the stroke, during acute hospitalization, at admission to  		PAC setting, and 90 days after the stroke. Pre-stroke conditions related to  		pre-morbid ADL function, IADL function, walking ability, and social/role  		function (described in <a href="#measure">Chapter 3</a>). In addition,  		pre-stroke variables included a five-point Likert Scale of self-reported health  		ranging from poor to excellent (range 0-4), social support assessments, and  		demographics (<a href="#table2.6">Table 2.6</a>). Acute stroke care stay  		variables related to stroke type and individual comorbidities (e.g., atrial  		fibrillation), as well as the Deyo Comorbidity Index.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.8">8</a></font></sup> PAC assessment measures obtained close to  		admission pertained to cognition, vision, speech/language, function, and  		depression. To assess cognition, the 30-item MMSE was used.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.9">9</a></font></sup> For individuals who required  		proxy respondents, the MMSE was approximated using the Cognitive Performance  		Scale.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.10">10</a></font></sup> As an  		assessment of ADL function, the Barthel Index was mapped from the MDS, IRF-PAI,  		and OASIS instruments using an algorithm that approximated each function,  		excluding stairs, which is not included in these instruments (range 0-90;  		described in <a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>). Data from the IRF-PAI and OASIS  		were collected on the second day after hospital discharge on average, whereas  		MDS data were collected 11days after hospital discharge on average. The result  		is that the Barthel Index from SNFs was measured after a period of recovery  		lasting more than a week, so we can assume that this assessment would have been  		lower -- representing greater impairment -- if collected on the second day  		after hospital discharge. The GDS was utilized in the patient interview to  		screen for symptoms of depression for individuals who could respond.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Utilization variables included length of stay for the most recent acute  		hospitalization in the prior 30 days, length of stay for the initial PAC stay  		occurring immediately following hospitalization, and the total PAC stay ending  		with the conclusion of all Medicare PAC services or 90 days, whichever came  		first. Length of stay determination rules are defined more fully in  		<a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>. Facility and community characteristics are  		reported at the patient level. For example, proprietary ownership refers to the  		number of patients in each group who were admitted to proprietary facilities,  		not the number of proprietary facilities in each group (reported in  		<a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>). Facility characteristics relate to Medicare  		volume, ownership, organizational type and affiliations. Community  		characteristics include urban vs. rural and then the two community stratifiers  		of high IRF use rate and high community resources. As described in  		<a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>, high IRF use rate refers to where the  		community stands relative to the median national IRF use rates. High community  		resources refers to availability of assisted living facility beds relative to  		nursing home beds in the state and secondarily home and community-based  		services availability. These are defined further in <a href="#method">Chapter  		2</a>. Also in <a href="#method">Chapter 2</a> are descriptions of the data  		collection instruments and methods.</p>
<p><b>3. Analysis</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Patterns of PAC in 90 Days</b>: For each patient included in the  			 study, we captured Medicare claims to delineate the pattern of service provider  			 utilization that included IRF, SNF, HH, OP, and hospital and determined when  			 the patient was in a residence with no Medicare PAC services. To do this, we  			 combined all of the claims for the 90-day episode for each patient in a single  			 file with admission dates and service end dates. Provider numbers were compared  			 for patients with multiple claims for a particular setting and patients were  			 assigned a transition to another site if the provider number changed and the  			 dates of care did not overlap. Therefore, a secondprovider of the same type as  			 the initial provider was specified as a subsequent provider when the provider  			 number changed. A period of 30days in which no services were delivered was  			 determined to be indicative of the end of stroke rehabilitation, which  			 coincides with the Medicare payment requirement to qualify for PAC  			 rehabilitation care. When a period of 30 days with no services occurred,  			 residence was the denoted location. The type of residence was determined from  			 the 90-day interview because this information is not available in claims (see  			 <a href="#method">Chapter 2</a> for further discussion). In addition to  			 determining the sequence of providers for each patient, the proportion of  			 patients receiving care in a subsequent provider was determined for patients  			 admitted to each setting as the first admission. Subsequent providers could be  			 used anytime within the 90-day episode and multiple subsequent providers could  			 be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Comparisons of Patient Characteristics among Settings</b>: We  			 compared characteristics of patients admitted to a SNF, IRF, and HH as the  			 initial provider. For patients initially admitted to an IRF, we also compared  			 patient characteristics among the various patterns of multiple-provider  			 episodes upon discharge from the IRF. These multiple-provider episodes were  			 defined based on the transferring PAC setting. Comparisons were conducted using  			 the t-test or Mann-Whitney for non-normally distributed variables, and the  			 Chi-Square Test for dichotomous variables.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>C. RESULTS</h3>
<p><b>1. Patterns of PAC</b></p>
<p>Nearly 170 different patterns of PAC in the first 90 days following  		hospitalization for stroke were found among 642 patients for whom PAC pattern  		information was available (<a href="#figure4.1">Figure 4.1</a>,  		<a href="#figure4.2">Figure 4.2</a>, and <a href="#figure4.3">Figure 4.3</a>).  		Residence represents the point at which no further Medicare PAC services were  		provided for a period of 30 days. The type of residence (e.g., nursing home,  		home) was based on the 90-day interview information because this information is  		not available from claims. Most of these patterns occurred only rarely (1-2  		patients), and only a few patterns were noteworthy. From IRF, direct PAC  		discharges occurred most frequently to HH agencies, then OP, then SNFs (<a href="#figure4.1">Figure  		4.1</a>). The following care patterns in 90 days accounted for 49 percent of  		IRF admissions in total:</p>
<ul><li>IRF-HH residence (n=90; 17 percent) -- residence was 89 percent  		  private home; 11 percent assisted living.</li>
<li>IRF-OP residence (n=66; 13 percent) -- residence was 92 percent  		  private home; 5 percent assisted living; 3 percent nursing home.</li>
<li>IRF residence (n=36; 7 percent) -- residence was 93 percent private  		  home; 7 percent assisted living.</li>
<li>IRF HH (n=34; 6 percent).</li>
<li>IRF OP (n=34; 6 percent).</li>
</ul><p>These latter two patterns represent situations where HH and OP were  		ongoing at the 90-day time point. For the 14 patients with the IRF&gt;SNF  		residence pattern, 46 percent went to a private home, 45 percent went to a  		nursing home, and 9 percent went to an assisted living facility.</p>
<p>For hospital discharges to SNFs (<a href="#figure4.2">Figure 4.2</a>),  		only one pattern was prevalent: SNF residence (n=13; 22 percent). Of these,  		90-day residence was home in 33 percent, assisted living in 25 percent, and  		nursing home in 42 percent. For hospital discharges to HH (<a href="#figure4.3">Figure 4.3</a>), a single pattern accounted for 67 percent of  		the HH admissions: HH residence (n=37). Ninety-five percent (95 percent) of  		patients went to a private home and 5 percent went to an assisted living  		facility.</p>

</tr></table><p>Distilling the patterns down to a first provider and any subsequent PAC  		providers used by a patient within the 90 days provides a simpler view of the  		patterns (<a href="#table4.1">Table 4.1</a>). Subsequent PAC providers could be  		used any time in the 90 days and more than one could be used, so the percent of  		patients using the various subsequent providers (rows) summed to greater than  		100 percent. These subsequent providers did not include rehospitalizations. For  		stroke patients discharged to IRF, almost 90 percent used more than one PAC  		provider in 90 days (i.e., not IRF only). Usually, the subsequent providers  		were either HH or OP, but use of SNFs occurred in one in five IRF admissions  		for stroke. Use of two separate IRFs in 90 days was unusual but did occur (6.4  		percent). Sixty (60 percent) of IRF patients used two PAC providers, and 30  		percent used three or more PAC providers in 90 days.</p>
<p>For direct SNF admissions from hospital, no additional PAC provider in  		90 days was the most prevalent (37.3 percent), but OP, HH and/or another SNF  		were each used in around one-quarter of cases. About a third of SNF patients  		used a total of two PAC providers and 29 percent used three or more PAC  		providers in 90 days. Thus, multiple-provider episodes were clearly dominant  		for stroke patients admitted to institutional rehabilitation, particularly to  		IRFs.</p>
<p>In contrast, only 20 percent of HH admissions from hospital used some  		other type of provider, which was usually OP, but sometimes another HH agency.  		Overall, HH agencies and OP were the most frequently used subsequent providers,  		43 percent and 36 percent respectively, following the initial PAC  		admission.</p>
<p><b>2. Comparison of Stroke Patients Discharged to IRFs, SNFs, and HH  		agencies</b></p>
<p><a href="#table4.2">Table 4.2</a> provides a comparison of the  		characteristics of stroke patients in which the first or initial provider was  		IRF, SNF, or HH agency. Demographic characteristics were relatively similar  		across the three settings, with the exception that HH patients were more likely  		to be women, and SNF patients were less well educated than both HH and IRF  		patients. SNF patients had worse pre-morbid function in ambulation, ADLs,  		IADLs, and social role function than IRF patients, as well as worse pre-morbid  		function in ADLs and IADLs than HH patients. SNF patients also had worse global  		self-reported health, meaning they were more likely to rate their health as  		fair or poor, relative to IRF and HH patients.</p>

</tr></table><p>Compared to IRF patients, HH patients were more likely to have  		hemorrhagic and other strokes rather than occlusion (arterial blockage). These  		hemorrhagic and other strokes could have been more focal causing less  		generalized neurological impairment, but this would depend more on the size of  		the area affected rather than the type of stroke. There was no difference in  		comorbidities. Of interest is the lower rate of PT and OT in the hospital for  		SNF patients relative to IRF patients despite comparable acute hospital lengths  		of stay, and a lower rate of ST and OT in HH agencies relative to IRFs.  		Cognition, speech and language, ADL function (Barthel Index), and depression  		(among those patients who did not require a proxy) were all worse upon  		admission to SNFs than IRFs or HH agencies. The Barthel Index for SNF patients  		is inflated relative to IRF and HH because the assessment is nine days later,  		so these functional differences are probably even greater. In addition, ADL  		function and cognition upon admission to IRF was worse than in HH care.</p>
<p>In combination, these profiles suggest substantially different  		characteristics of stroke patients admitted from the hospital to SNFs relative  		to IRFs and HH agencies. SNF patients were less well educated; more disabled  		prior to the stroke; more impaired following the stroke cognitively, physically  		and in speech and language; and had greater symptoms of depression. HH  		patients, while more similar to IRF patients in some areas, were more likely to  		be women, less likely to have occlusive strokes, and were more functional with  		less cognitive impairment than IRF patients.</p>
<p>Lengths of stay in the acute hospital, the initial PAC stay, and the  		total PAC stay across all survivors differed among admissions to the three  		settings (<a href="#table4.2">Table 4.2</a>). HH patients tended to have  		shorter acute hospital lengths of stay, suggesting lower severity of the acute  		stroke and related conditions, and the shortest total PAC stays relative to  		either of the other provider types. IRF patients had the shortest initial PAC  		stay, but the longest total PAC stay, which is not surprising based on the  		pattern analysis previously presented showing that multiple-providers were used  		after IRF. Of particular note is a decline in the initial IRF length of stay  		from 21.8 to 19.7 days (p&lt;0.05) between subjects enrolled in 2003 (n=224)  		and those enrolled in 2004 (n=261). Median lengths of stay were lower than the  		mean values because of the effect of outliers on the means; however, the median  		dropped from 21 to 18 between 2003 and 2004.</p>
<p>Relative to the means, median acute hospital lengths of stay for the  		whole sample were shorter by about a day or more (IRF=5, SNF=5, HH agency=4).  		Relative to the means, median initial PAC stays were a day shorter in IRFs and  		about eight days shorter in SNFs and HH agencies (25 days) because of the  		effects of outliers. For total PAC lengths of stay, medians were 53 days, 41  		days, and 29 days for IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies, respectively.</p>
<p>The number of Medicare stroke admissions that were reported by  		facilities in the prior year was much higher than we found in SNFs and HH  		agencies during screening (<a href="#table4.2">Table 4.2</a>), showing a  		decline in number of stroke admissions. IRF patients were largely from  		non-profit, hospital-based units, although for-profit hospitals were also well  		represented. The sample included a disproportionate number of non-profit,  		hospital-based SNF patients because these facilities were more likely to have  		an adequate volume of stroke admissions and were more likely to admit stroke  		patients during the study period. Similarly, HH patients were  		disproportionately from hospital-based agencies because they treated a higher  		volume of stroke patients; these agencies were more likely to be non-profit. As  		might be expected, relative to SNF and HH patients, IRF patients were more  		likely to be located in high IRF use communities. Relative to SNF patients, IRF  		and HH patients were also more likely to be located in urban communities.</p>
<p><b>3. Comparison of Stroke Patients Discharged to IRFs by Subsequent PAC  		Setting</b></p>
<p>With most patients admitted first to IRFs, comparisons of  		multiple-provider settings after the initial IRF stay were of interest. Because  		complete patterns of PAC are far too numerous to contrast (<a href="#figure4.1">Figure 4.1</a>), characterizing patients based on the second  		PAC setting following IRF care provides valuable insights regardless of the  		care that follows. <a href="#table4.3">Table 4.3</a> provides the  		characteristics of stroke patients receiving subsequent care in four options:  		SNF, HH, OP, and residence with no further PAC.</p>
<p>Patients admitted from IRF to SNF were more likely to be unmarried women  		with lower incomes. IRF to SNF patients also were more likely to have atrial  		fibrillation than IRF to OP patients, but no differences existed in overall  		comorbidity (Deyo Index). Patients admitted from IRF to SNF had greater  		cognitive impairment, visual impairment, aphasia, and functional impairment  		upon admission to PAC based on both the Barthel Index and FIM Scales,  		consistent with direct admits to SNF. The groups were relatively similar with  		respect to demographics and pre-stroke function and self-reported health. Thus,  		patients who were admitted to SNF following IRF, relative to other options,  		were more impaired after their strokes. These patients had many characteristics  		that were similar to patients discharged directly from acute hospital to SNF  		(<a href="#table4.2">Table 4.2</a>). </p>
<p>Modest but statistically significant functional differences,  		particularly in mobility, were found between IRF patients who went to HH and  		those who received OP, and also between patients who went from IRF to HH and  		those who went from IRF to residence. Interestingly, those who went directly to  		residence from IRF care without further PAC had slightly worse pre-morbid ADL  		and social/role function than those who subsequently received OP care. Many  		similarities existed between patients who received HHA and OP following IRF  		care, and to a lesser extent those who were discharged to their residences with  		no further care.</p>

<p>The only significant demographic difference between patients admitted  		directly to SNFs vs. patients first admitted to IRF and then SNF was that the  		IRF&gt;SNF group averaged twomore years of education (<a href="#table4.4">Table 4.4</a>). IRF&gt;SNF patients were more  		independent in ambulation, ADLs, IADLs, and social/role functioning prior to  		their stroke than patients admitted directly to SNF on average. They were more  		likely to have atrial fibrillation and received more PT, OT, and ST in the  		hospital. At the time of post-acute admission following the stroke, however,  		patients in the twogroups were relatively comparable with respect to cognition,  		visual problems, speech and language problems, function, and depression. They  		had similar acute lengths of stay and initial PAC stays, but the total PAC  		length of stay was much greater for the IRF&gt;SNF patients because it  		involved the IRF stay, the SNF stay, and any other subsequent stays.</p>

</tr></table><p>The relatively small difference between the Barthel upon admission to  		IRF and the initial Barthel for direct admits to SNF (27.4 vs. 33.7) may in  		part have been due to the lag in Barthel scores for SNF patients. Thirty-four  		(34) of the MDS assessments used to estimate the Barthel were five-day  		assessments and 26 were 14-day assessments, with an average of 11 days  		post-admission for the date of the SNF Barthel, in contrast to the average of  		two days following admission for IRF patients. Thus, SNF patients would have  		had an opportunity to recover function (and raise their Barthel) for about nine  		days or more prior to the functional assessment relative to IRF patients. The  		Barthel Index was almost identical upon SNF admission for the subjects admitted  		directly to SNFs and at the time of SNF admission following the IRF stay (33.7  		vs. 34.1) based on the SNF MDS assessments. However, it was also interesting to  		note that between admission and discharge, the IRF Barthel increased from 27.4  		to 46.2 according to the FIM functional items that were mapped to the Barthel.  		The reason that the discharge FIM score was so much higher than the admission  		SNF score is unclear, but the incentives under PPS are to downcode function at  		admission because higher payments are provided for IRF and SNF patients with  		worse functional status at time of admission. In contrast, quality review  		incentives exist to demonstrate improvement by the time patients are discharged  		and thus encourage upcoding at discharge.</p>
<p>Patients in the IRF&gt;SNF group were discharged from acute  		hospitals to facilities with higher Medicare stroke volumes that were less  		likely to be for-profit. The number of patients admitted to hospital-based  		units vs. freestanding units was comparable in the IRF&gt;SNF vs. direct  		SNF admit group. The most striking difference was that more than twice as many  		of the IRF&gt;SNF patients were in communities with high IRF use rates  		relative to the median as compared to direct SNF patients (85 percent vs. 42  		percent). The direct SNF patients were more likely to be in communities that  		were high in nursing home beds relative to residential care beds. Furthermore,  		93 percent of IRF&gt;SNF patients were in urban areas. These factors  		suggest that geographic availability played a major role in determining the PAC  		setting to which these patients were discharged.</p>
<h3>D. DISCUSSION</h3>
<p>The results of this national study of Medicare FFS PAC under PPS  		suggested four major findings: (1) the number of direct stroke admissions to  		many SNFs and HH agencies appears to have dropped in the period since PPS was  		implemented; (2) stroke patients are generally treated by multiple PAC  		providers within a 90-day episode; (3) with respect to initial PAC admission  		for stroke, IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies have become more differentiated with  		minimal substitution across settings; and (4) potential substitution exists  		across certain multiple-provider combinations, particularly between IRF to HH  		and IRF to OP episodes, and between direct SNF and IRF to SNF episodes.</p>
<p>The study targeted SNFs and HH agencies with high-volumes of stroke  		admissions in 1999 based on secondary data and confirmed by site administrators  		upon recruitment in 2001. Nevertheless, relatively few stroke patients were  		admitted to SNFs and HH agencies in 2002-2005; less than one per month to SNFs  		and less than two per month to HH agencies. Of these, 34 percent of SNF  		patients and 52 percent of HH patients either had a prior PAC stay or were in  		an HMO. These data suggest that either a smaller percentage of non-HMO Medicare  		stroke patients are admitted directly to SNFs and HH agencies as the first PAC  		setting following implementation of PPS, or that these patients are less  		concentrated in such high-volume providers. IRFs, in contrast, admitted about  		five stroke patients per month on average, were the first PAC provider in 95  		percent of these cases, and admitted a smaller proportion of HMO patients  		(about 9 percent). The modest use of IRFs by HMOs is consistent with pre-PPS  		findings showing that large Medicare-risk HMOs tended to use SNF care more than  		IRF care for older stroke patients.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.12">12</a></font></sup><a href="#trend">Chapter 6</a> uses  		national data to elaborate on these issues for SNFs and IRFs to better  		understand the impact of PPS on use of institutional PAC.</p>
<p>The second major finding emerging from these analyses is the large  		proportion of multiple-provider episodes beginning with IRFs. Ninety percent  		(90 percent) of IRF admissions used one or more subsequent providers and while  		the initial PAC stay averaged 21 days in the IRF, the total PAC stay averaged  		55 days -- longer than PAC stays beginning with SNF or HH. Subsequent providers  		were predominately HH or OP rehabilitation, but use of SNFs occurred in  		approximately 21 percent of admissions to IRF. Thirty percent (30 percent) of  		IRF patients used three or more PAC providers in 90 days. Thus, use of  		multiple-providers for a single PAC episode beginning with IRF was the norm,  		and frequently this involved three or more settings in 90 days.</p>
<p>The widespread use of multiple-provider episodes following per case  		payment for IRF care is a natural consequence of PPS. This study also found a  		two-day drop in mean length of stay (three-day drop in median IRF stay) in the  		year following PPS implementation, which is more than twice the decline in IRF  		stays leading up to implementation of PPS.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.13">13</a></font></sup> Presuming that IRFs are discharging  		patients as rapidly as possible, the use of a second PAC provider is logical.  		If the IRF is owned by the same entity that owns the subsequent provider, the  		incentive is even stronger. This response is similar to declining acute  		hospital lengths of stay and the increase in the use of IRF, SNF, and HH care  		following implementation of the acute hospital PPS.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.14">14</a>, <a href="#ref4.15">15</a></font></sup>  		Although it may seem appropriate that patients receive care in each setting for  		only as long as a level of care is required, potential downsides exist for use  		of multiple-providers in a single episode. First, several studies have shown  		the increased risk of care problems such as medication errors during transfers  		from one provider to the next, because of poor communication and coordination  		between providers.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.16">16</a>,  		<a href="#ref4.17">17</a>, <a href="#ref4.18">18</a>, <a href="#ref4.19">19</a></font></sup> Second, the cost of treatment for the  		episode can be greater if Medicare makes multiple payments for different PAC  		providers and/or care transitions result in rehospitalizations. The daunting  		170different patterns of PAC 90days following stroke for these 642patients  		reinforce these concerns.</p>
<p>The third finding suggested by these results is that under Medicare PPS  		further differentiation exists between direct admissions to IRFs, SNFs, and HH  		agencies, as the first PAC provider. SNF patients were significantly less well  		educated, more disabled prior to the stroke, more impaired following the stroke  		cognitively, physically and in speech/language, and had greater symptoms of  		depression. On the other end of the spectrum, HH patients were more likely to  		be women and were more functional with less cognitive impairment than IRF  		patients, although they were more similar to IRF patients than SNF patients.  		These differences were substantial and pervasive across a range of  		characteristics that were measurable by the rich primary database included in  		this study. In combination with the small number of Medicare FFS patients  		admitted directly to SNFs and HH agencies, the results suggest that the extent  		of substitution across IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies may be less than prior to  		PPS for elderly Medicare FFS stroke patients. Unfortunately, larger secondary  		data studies will not be very helpful for confirming this finding in that most  		of these characteristics are not available in these data sets.</p>
<p>While less substitution may generally be the case, substitution appears  		to exist between multiple-provider episodes with the pattern of IRF to HH and  		IRF to OP. These patients had no meaningful differences in pre-morbid status  		and were extremely similar with respect to cognition and many functional  		measures following their strokes. Even total PAC length of stay was comparable  		across these two types of multiple-provider episodes. HH patients are expected  		to meet the homebound criteria, which is not the case for OP patients; this may  		be reflected in the modest difference in the mobility/transfer FIM item and  		Barthel Index, but there will most certainly be overlap in these populations  		given the small magnitude of these differences. One explanation for whether a  		patient is discharged to a HH agency or OP facility might be which of these  		settings the IRF owns or manages because this would be the most natural  		referral and would result in continued revenues to the same entity. Thus,  		comparison of outcomes and costs would seem appropriate for patients admitted  		from IRF to OP care with those admitted from IRF to HH.</p>
<p>Evidence was also found that the stroke patients admitted directly to  		SNFs were similar to patients receiving care first in an IRF and then  		transferred to a SNF. IRF&gt;SNF patients were better educated and more  		functional prior to their stroke, but following their stroke were very similar  		to direct SNF admits in terms of cognition, function, speech/language, and  		visual symptoms. Although the sample sizes were not large and the power to  		detect differences was relatively modest, differences in patient  		characteristics were small in comparison to the extremely large differences in  		geographic characteristics, including IRF use rates in the community, statewide  		nursing home beds relative to residential care beds, and urban location. Thus,  		the determining factor in whether patients go directly to SNF or to an IRF and  		then SNF appears to be more related to availability of providers in the  		community and other geographic practice patterns as opposed to patient  		characteristics following a stroke. This implies there is substitution across  		geographic areas, suggesting comparisons of outcomes and costs are warranted  		for the subgroup of patients admitted to these two types of PAC episodes. The  		PAC episodes clearly differ, with total PAC length of stay much longer for the  		IRF&gt;SNF group (72.6 days vs. 46.4 days).</p>
<p>The dominance of IRFs as the first PAC provider and the greater  		differentiation in patient characteristics across PAC settings when SNFs and HH  		agencies are used as the first provider may result from PPS as well as other  		factors. Under SNF PPS reimbursement, SNFs may not be willing to provide more  		than the minimum amount of therapy in the ultra-high and very high therapy  		categories.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.20">20</a></font></sup> The  		Medicare reimbursement for the ultra-high categories was as much as $441 per  		day beginning in October 2001, but 720minutes of therapy per week are necessary  		to qualify. Reimbursement for the very high categories was as much as $343per  		day but at least 500minutes of therapy per week are required. Many stroke  		patients admitted from the hospital require higher levels of therapy.</p>
<p>For HH agencies, the per case payment includes an incentive to admit  		patients requiring ten or more therapy visits because of an additional payment.  		Although this increase is about $2,000 per case, the cost of providing many  		more than ten therapy visits may be difficult for the HH agency to cover with  		Medicare per case payment.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.21">21</a></font></sup> Tentherapy visits are unlikely to be  		adequate for patients discharged from the hospital with stroke who have very  		significant functional disabilities like those admitted to SNFs and IRFs. In  		contrast, the per case payment for stroke patients in an IRF is based on a case  		mix index of 1.2 or greater, depending on functional status, and the payments  		were derived from costs that included three hours of therapy per day and the  		much higher cost structure of IRFs. Thus, IRFs have an incentive to admit  		disabled stroke patients from the hospital, which is not the case for either  		SNFs or HH agencies.</p>
<p>Other factors may also have contributed to an evolution toward admission  		of stroke patients directly to IRFs. Several studies in the mid-1990s showed  		better outcomes for stroke patients admitted to IRFs than SNFs, albeit at  		substantially higher cost.<sup><font><a href="#ref4.22">22</a>,  		<a href="#ref4.23">23</a>, <a href="#ref4.24">24</a>, <a href="#ref4.25">25</a>, <a href="#ref4.26">26</a></font></sup> This evidence  		may have influenced providers to refer stroke victims to IRFs whenever possible  		despite higher costs in order to maximize both short- and long-term outcomes.  		Furthermore, the number of IRFs has increased from 1,001 to 1,206 (20 percent)  		in the last decade, which has increased the availability of IRF beds. With  		improved access to IRFs, higher payment rates in IRFs, and these outcome  		findings, patients with the greatest rehabilitation potential may be more  		likely to be admitted to IRFs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, during the period after PPS, the number of stroke  		patients admitted to previously high-volume SNFs and HH agencies appears to  		have declined. SNFs and HH agencies appear to treat a more circumscribed  		population and play a major role as subsequent providers along with OP care.  		IRFs have responded to the per discharge PPS by shortening stays and  		discharging to other PAC settings. These findings raise important questions  		regarding the impact of these changes on quality and costs of care for Medicare  		beneficiaries in the PPS era.</p>

<h3>A. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The effectiveness of rehabilitation in different PAC settings, including  		IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies, is of major interest because of the substantial  		differences in Medicare costs for different provider settings and the potential  		resulting disability for patients who are not rehabilitated in the period  		following an acute event. In the 1990s, prior to implementation of PPSs for  		PAC, research suggested that outcomes such as community residence, functional  		improvement, and mortality were generally better for stroke patients discharged  		to IRFs relative to SNFs, but at substantially greater cost.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.1">1</a>, <a href="#ref5.2">2</a>, <a href="#ref5.3">3</a></font></sup> Outcomes for stroke patients discharged to  		home were found to be better than all other options in one study.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.4">4</a></font></sup> These studies relied on  		geographic variation to conduct natural experiments<sup><font><a href="#ref5.5">5</a></font></sup> using various methods to control  		for selection differences, which in some cases were very large. All of these  		studies were conducted more than a decade ago -- prior to implementation of  		PPSs for PAC -- and took into consideration only the initial PAC provider  		following hospitalization, even for episodes involving multiple-providers.</p>
<p>With the advent of a PPS for SNFs that was implemented in 1998, for HH  		agencies that was implemented in 2000, and for IRFs that was implemented in  		2002 under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, substantial changes in utilization  		patterns, rehabilitation costs, and outcomes are entirely possible. The IRF PPS  		rate is per discharge based on the patients condition (e.g., diagnosis,  		function), the HH PPS rate is for a 60-day episode based on patient condition  		and therapy services, and the SNF per diem rate is based on patient condition  		and provision of therapy and skilled services. In August 2000, an OP PPS was  		implemented on a fee schedule, setting rates for individual services and  		procedures. The PPSs were designed to reduce the rapid growth in Medicare PAC  		expenditures that occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s. The incentive under  		the IRF PPS is to shorten length of stays, under the HH PPS is to reduce  		numbers of HH visits, and under the SNF PPS is to minimize services within  		payment groups. The costs and outcomes following implementation of these  		wholesale changes in Medicare reimbursement, which could be substantial, have  		not been previously studied for any conditions.</p>
<p>Several findings related to patterns of PAC following implementation of  		PPS have implications for costs and outcomes (<a href="#pattern">Chapter  		4</a>). First, PAC involved multiple-providers in the first 90 days for about  		90 percent of IRF admissions and about two-thirds of SNF admissions. About 60  		percent of IRF patients used two PAC providers and 30 percent used three or  		more PAC providers in 90 days; the most prevalent combinations were IRF to OP  		and IRF to HH.</p>
<p>Second, substantial differentiation was found among stroke patients  		discharged directly to IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies in the post-PPS era. SNF  		patients less well educated; were substantially more disabled prior to the  		stroke; were more impaired cognitively, physically, and in speech/language  		following their stroke; and had greater symptoms of depression. SNF patients  		were also more likely to be admitted from nursing homes or be comatose (both of  		whom were excluded from the study). HH patients, while more similar to IRF  		patients in some areas, were more likely to be women and were more functional  		and less cognitively impaired than IRF patients. These results suggested that  		the extent of overall substitution across settings may have been diminished  		under PPS.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, stroke patients admitted directly to SNFs were relatively  		similar to stroke patients admitted to SNF following an IRF stay. The greatest  		differences were in community characteristics such as IRF use rates, nursing  		home beds, and urban vs. rural location. These patients differed quite  		substantially from patients discharged from IRF to HH or to OP care with  		respect to greater cognitive impairment, greater visual neglect, more aphasia,  		and greater functional impairment following their stroke. In addition,  		relatively modest differences were found between patients discharged from IRF  		to HH and those discharged from IRF to OP care, suggesting substitution may  		also exist between those patient groups.</p>
<p>The purpose of this analysis is three fold. First, we describe outcome  		and cost patterns for stroke patients discharged to different post-acute  		settings and multiple-provider episodes. Second, we compare outcomes and costs  		between episodes of IRF followed by OP care and those involving IRF followed by  		HH care. Third, we compare outcomes and costs between direct admissions to SNF  		and patients admitted to IRF and then SNF.</p>
<h3>B. METHODS</h3>
<p><b>1. Subjects</b></p>
<p>The subjects of this study, as described in <a href="#method">Chapter  		2</a>, consisted of 555 patients admitted directly to IRF, 62 patients admitted  		directly to SNF, and 57 patients admitted directly to HH. The IRF to HH group  		included 209 patients, the IRF to OP group included 134 patients, and the  		IRF&gt;SNF group contained 80 patients. Patients with these  		multiple-provider episodes may have received care in additional PAC providers  		as part of the PAC episode.</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Outcome Measures</b>: Fivecategories of outcomes were analyzed:  			 (1) location at 90days, (2) functional loss, (3) functional recovery, (4)  			 self-reported health, and (5) satisfaction. These measures are defined in  			 <a href="#method">Chapter 2</a> (<a href="#table2.4">Table 2.4</a>), with more  			 detail on the properties of the functional measures (Categories 2 and 3) in  			 <a href="#measure">Chapter 3</a>. All of these outcome measures were based on  			 primary data collected on admission to PAC (pertaining to the period before the  			 stroke, or baseline) and at 90 days post-PAC admission.</p>
<p>In summary, location at 90 days represents the subjects  			 residence at 90 days where he/she was reached for the 90-day follow-up  			 interview. "Equally independent setting" is a summary variable for change in  			 location, yielding the percent of subjects who were residing in an equivalent  			 setting with respect to provided assistance at 90 days relative to baseline  			 (more details in <a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>). The functional outcome  			 variables are measures of change between the period prior to stroke (baseline)  			 and 90 days following stroke. Functional loss represents the difference between  			 the 90-day value and the baseline value for scales of ADL, IADL, ambulation,  			 and social/role functioning. Higher numbers, therefore, represent greater loss  			 in function. Functional recovery denotes the percentage of patients who  			 recovered to their baseline functional level in each function by 90 days. A  			 similar recovery scale was included for recovery on a five-point Likert scale  			 related to self-reported health. Satisfaction measures were collected only at  			 one point in time (90 days), reflecting patient/proxy satisfaction with the PAC  			 episode rated on a four-point Likert scale with "1" denoting dissatisfied and  			 "4" denoting extremely satisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cost and Utilization Measures</b>: After combining claims  			 information from all sources, several cost and utilization measures were  			 created for comparison among settings (<a href="#table2.5">Table 2.5</a>). PAC  			 costs were computed for the period beginning with the first PAC provider until  			 the end of the PAC stay (defined as a break of 30 days in PAC services; or a  			 discharge to residence without rehospitalization or a death in threedays; or a  			 death or hospitalization from a PAC setting; or 90days). PAC costs also  			 included costs for PAC services and carrier costs such as DME or physician  			 supplier. All service costs for 90days, however, included all costs over 90days  			 from admission to PAC (e.g., PAC, hospital, labs). Cost variables were  			 calculated on a per-episode basis and a per-day basis. Per-episode costs summed  			 the costs across the entire period, whereas per-day costs divided the  			 per-episode costs by the number of days in the period. We estimated mean total  			 costs, and also calculated the mean Medicare component and the mean beneficiary  			 component costs. For some comparisons, we broke out costs into the various  			 provider costs (e.g., IRF, acute hospital) and also examined utilization.  			 Utilization variables included days (IRF days, hospital days) and visits (HH  			 visits, OP therapy visits). All of this information was obtained from  			 claims.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>2. Analysis</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Bivariate Comparisons</b>: All outcomes and costs were compared  			 between pairs of PAC settings using the most appropriate bivariate method for  			 the type of variable: t-tests for continuous normally distributed variables,  			 Mann-Whitney for non-normally distributed variables, and Chi-square tests  			 (Fishers Exact test for small sample size comparisons) for dichotomous  			 variables. Setting comparisons were patterned after those performed on patient  			 characteristics in <a href="#pattern">Chapter 4</a>. Initial setting  			 comparisons examined each pair of primary settings, IRF vs. SNF, SNF vs. HH,  			 and IRF vs. HH. Within the group of IRF patients, the subsequent settings were  			 also compared. A subsequent setting was defined as the setting to which a  			 patient was transferred from the IRF. Fourpossible transfers occurred: (1)  			 IRF&gt;SNF, (2) IRF&gt;HH, (3) IRF&gt;OP, and (4)  			 IRF&gt;residence. We also compared patients who were discharged directly  			 to SNF with patients in the IRF&gt;SNF group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Multivariate Models</b>: Based on the bivariate comparisons, we  			 targeted further analysis on the episodes with the largest sample of patients  			 where substitution seemed likely to occur: IRF&gt;HH vs. IRF&gt;OP.  			 Sample sizes were too small for multivariate modeling in the SNF vs.  			 IRF&gt;SNF comparisons. Regression models were estimated to control for  			 case mix differences between treatment settings while assessing relationships  			 between setting and cost and outcome measures. The effect of OP vs. HH care for  			 this group of patients was determined using a dichotomous variable for  			 subsequent OP care vs. HH. Ordinary least squares regression was used for  			 continuous functional recovery measures and costs, whereas logistic regression  			 was performed on dichotomous functional recovery variables and utilization  			 variables. Many models were tested using different covariates, but we report  			 the meaningful and consistent findings that emerged. For example, regression  			 models for functional loss supported the functional recovery models that we  			 report.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>We designed the covariate selection process with the goal of deriving  		outcome and cost models that incorporated the most influential case mix  		variables but limited the number of covariates in deference to sample size  		considerations. A correlation matrix of the outcome and cost measures against  		all of the potential covariates in our data was produced (enumerated in  		<a href="#table2.6">Table 2.6</a>). Factors with strong univariate  		relationships to outcomes and/or the cost of treatment were selected based on  		variable reduction activities taking into account clinical considerations and  		differences between the groups being compared. <a href="#table2.6">Table  		2.6</a> presents definitions for the variables that were considered for the  		models. In the final models presented in the Results section, we removed  		variables that did not improve the model fit.</p>
<h3>C. RESULTS</h3>
<p><b>1. Outcomes and Costs for Stroke Patients Based on Initial Discharge  		Location</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Outcomes</b>: Unadjusted outcome results generally followed the  			 pattern that would be expected given the case mix differences presented in  			 <a href="#pattern">Chapter 4</a> (<a href="#table5.1">Table 5.1</a>). Over  			 one-third of discharges to SNF were residing in a nursing home at 90 days,  			 reflecting their high rate of post-stroke functional and cognitive impairment;  			 in contrast, about 13 percent of IRF patients, who had less cognitive  			 impairment and less pre and post-stroke disability, resided in a nursing home  			 at 90 days. No HH patients were residing in a nursing home at 90 days,  			 consistent with the lack of significant cognitive impairment and ADL impairment  			 following their stroke. Changes in location to more dependent settings (e.g.,  			 from assisted living to nursing home; from home alone to with friend or  			 relative) followed this same pattern, such that most HH patients (98 percent)  			 and fewest SNF patients (41 percent) were residing in an equally independent  			 setting at 90 days. The higher mortality rate among SNF patients was also  			 consistent with signs of stroke severity including aphasia/dysarthria, and  			 greater cognitive and functional impairments.</p>
<p>Lack of functional recovery between the pre-stroke period and 90  			 days was substantial, with less than half of patients recovering their  			 pre-stroke functional status on average in ADLs, IADLs, and social/role  			 function and slightly more than half recovering in ambulation. SNF patients  			 were least likely to recover in all domains relative to HH, but not  			 significantly less than IRF patients (<a href="#table5.1">Table 5.1</a>). HH  			 patients also were more likely to recover their pre-stroke function than IRF  			 patients in IADLs and ambulation. These findings were highly consistent with  			 the types of patients who were admitted directly to HH -- those with more  			 modest post-stroke rates of cognitive, speech, and functional impairment.</p>
<p>The impact of stroke was also apparent from the self-reported health  			 recovery in the range of 60 percent, suggesting that two out of every five  			 patients with stroke experienced a decline in their global health, even at 90  			 days. This was further supported by the satisfaction with recovery score of  			 2.1-2.3 out of four, reflecting a rating of satisfied, which is low  			 for satisfaction measures. The satisfaction with care scores generally  			 reflected 3-very satisfied across the different settings, with  			 somewhat higher levels of satisfaction for individual aspects of care.  			 Satisfaction measures so often cluster at the very high end of a scale (e.g.,  			 extremely satisfied) that we would expect at least ratings of 3.  			 Overall satisfaction with care and satisfaction with instruction and training  			 were somewhat less for SNF patients than IRF patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Costs</b>: Total PAC costs per episode and Medicare payments were  			 substantially higher for patients admitted to IRFs than SNFs (<a href="#table5.2">Table 5.2</a>), resulting from both the cost of IRFs and the  			 use of subsequent PAC providers. PAC episode costs included all the costs of  			 subsequent PAC providers until the point where no further PAC was being  			 received by the beneficiary, which was longer for IRF than SNF episodes as  			 previously reported (55.2 vs. 46.2 days, respectively). Direct admits to HHs,  			 not surprisingly, had the lowest cost to Medicare because HH care is less  			 intense, was shorter in duration (36.7 days), and does not include room and  			 board costs. The cost to beneficiaries was highest in SNFs because of the large  			 copayments in SNFs after the 20th day. All service costs for the 90 days  			 followed a similar pattern of differences; however, the addition of hospital  			 and other costs increased costs for all provider types, particularly for frail  			 SNF patients who were more likely to use these additional services.</p>

<p><b>Outcomes</b>: About half of patients who went from IRF to SNF  			 were still located in a nursing home at 90 days, which was substantially higher  			 than the rate of nursing home placement for other types of multiple-provider  			 episodes starting with IRF (<a href="#table5.3">Table 5.3</a>). Residence in an  			 equally independent setting at 90 days occurred for about 90 percent of IRF  			 patients discharged to HH, OP, and residence in contrast to 24 percent of those  			 admitted to IRF then SNF. These differences were highly consistent with  			 post-stroke differences reported in <a href="#pattern">Chapter 4</a> in which  			 IRF&gt;SNF patients had greater post-stroke cognitive impairment, visual  			 neglect symptoms, speech impairments, and functional impairments. Relative to  			 other combined episodes, IRF&gt;SNF patients also experienced greater  			 functional losses and were less likely to recover pre-stroke function in ADLs,  			 IADLs, ambulation, and social/role functioning. IRF&gt;SNF patients were  			 also less satisfied with discharge and family preparations, which probably  			 reflected on the SNF discharge, but may have been influenced by the multiple  			 transitions.</p>
<p>Relative to patients admitted to OP therapy from IRFs, patients  			 receiving HH following their IRF stay had greater functional losses and lower  			 rates of recovery in ADLs, IADLS, and ambulation. These differences might be  			 attributed to the modest case mix differences in the Barthel Index or the  			 mobility/transfer subscale of FIM noted in <a href="#pattern">Chapter 4</a>.  			 However, following risk adjustment for factors associated with the outcomes of  			 IADL, ambulation, and ADL recovery, and those that differed between the groups,  			 patients admitted to OP care had significantly higher odds of recovery than  			 patients admitted to HH agencies following the IRF admission (<a href="#table5.4">Table 5.4</a>, <a href="#table5.5">Table 5.5</a>, and  			 <a href="#table5.6">Table 5.6</a>, respectively). When the FIM scale was  			 substituted for the Barthel Index (they were collinear and therefore could not  			 be used in the same model), the model fit and the significance of the  			 differences did not change. Thus, patients admitted to OP therapy following an  			 IRF stay appeared to have greater recovery in the domains of IADL and  			 ambulation (borderline significance in ADL) than those admitted to HH following  			 IRF, even after controlling for patient differences in demographics, function,  			 cognition, and selected stroke and provider characteristics. Similar results  			 were found after using regression to adjust the functional loss variables in  			 these domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Costs</b>: During the PAC episode, total, Medicare, and  			 beneficiary costs all differed significantly among the fourdifferent types of  			 episodes beginning with IRF (<a href="#table5.7">Table 5.7</a>). For total and  			 Medicare costs, patients admitted to SNFs following IRF had the highest cost,  			 followed by those admitted to HH, then OP, with the lowest cost per episode for  			 the IRF&gt;RES group. SNF services, which require the highest copayments,  			 resulted in the highest beneficiary costs. OP therapy copayments resulted in  			 higher beneficiary costs for IRF&gt;OP patients in contrast to  			 IRF&gt;HH patients (as no copayment is required for HH care).</p>
<p>PAC costs per episode and 90-day all service costs differed  			 significantly between IRF&gt;HH and IRF&gt;OP patients after  			 adjustment for patient and facility characteristics associated with cost and/or  			 differences between these patient groups (<a href="#table5.8">Table 5.8</a>).  			 Total cost per PAC episode was $2,202 higher for IRF&gt;HH patients after  			 risk adjustment relative to IRF&gt;OP (p=0.003), and total cost per 90  			 days was $5,211 higher for IRF&gt;HH patients relative to IRF&gt;OP  			 (p=0.001). These models explained a large amount of the variation in cost  			 (R<sup>2</sup>=0.67 and 0.37, respectively), and were not sensitive to using  			 different functional measures (e.g., FIM) in the model, for example. Thus,  			 these cost differences appear to exist independently of case mix and facility  			 characteristics.</p>
<p><a href="#table5.9">Table 5.9</a> provides profiles of Medicare cost  			 categories and utilization over the 90-day period for the IRF&gt;HH and  			 IRF&gt;OP groups. IRF costs were somewhat higher for patients going to HH  			 in contrast to OP settings, consistent with the difference in IRF length of  			 stay. The HH group averaged about 28 HH visits at a higher cost to Medicare  			 ($3,879) than the 45 OP visits in the OP group ($1,689). IRF&gt;HH  			 patients also received an average of ten OP visits, which must have occurred  			 subsequent to HH care, and OPs received more than one HH visit, which must have  			 occurred subsequent to OP care. However, the HH group only received a sum of 21  			 therapy visits (17 HH and four OP) in contrast to 40 in the OP group (39 OP and  			 one HH). In other utilization, the HH group averaged more hospital days (2.0  			 vs. 0.5 days), a higher hospitalization rate (21 percent vs. 15 percent), and  			 higher hospital costs. Thus, the total cost per stay difference resulted  			 largely from IRF costs, the higher cost of HH care relative to OP care, and the  			 additional hospitalization costs for IRF&gt;HH patients.</p>

Although  			 IRF&gt;SNF patients had a higher rate of nursing home placement, this was  			 offset by a higher death rate in the direct discharge to SNF group, suggesting  			 that the somewhat more frail SNF patients died before 90days in the nursing  			 home. The higher rate of direct SNF discharges residing in an equally  			 independent setting was most likely the result of the higher mortality rate for  			 direct SNF discharges, because deaths were excluded from this variable. When we  			 recoded deaths as residing in the nursing home, a combined outcome variable,  			 then the rate of nursing home residence and equally independent settings was  			 very similar between the two groups. While we can't be sure with the small  			 numbers and the differences in mortality rates, the evidence suggests that the  			 IRF&gt;SNF group and the direct discharge to SNF group had comparable  			 location outcomes.</p>
<p>The selection bias with the significantly higher mortality rate  			 among direct discharges to SNF also influenced the functional outcome  			 variables, where deaths were by necessity excluded. The result was that the  			 greater mean IADL functional loss in the IRF&gt;SNF group may have  			 resulted from the fact that patients with the greatest functional losses in the  			 direct SNF discharge group died by 90 days. Similarly, the higher mean loss in  			 ambulation in the IRF&gt;SNF group may have resulted because the direct  			 SNF discharge group patients with the greatest loss in ambulation ability also  			 died. When we combined the death outcome with the functional loss outcome such  			 that all deaths were rated "0" on the functional scale at 90 days, the  			 difference in IADL loss was diminished (11.6 vs. 8.2; p=0.03) and the  			 ambulation change was more comparable (45.1 vs. 27.2; p=0.14). The pattern  			 across all indices for this small sample suggests comparability in functional  			 recovery between the IRF&gt;SNF patients and the direct SNF  			 discharges.</p>
<p>The satisfaction measures present a mixed picture. Satisfaction with  			 care and explanation of goals/progress seemed to favor the IRF&gt;SNF  			 group, whereas discharge preparation and family preparation seemed to favor the  			 direct SNF group. These differences may highlight some of the strengths of the  			 two different provider types, wherein IRFs may engage patients and families  			 more in goals and progress discussions, and SNFs may focus more on the  			 discharge process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Costs</b>: Per-episode costs and costs to the Medicare program  			 for IRF&gt;SNF patients were approximately threetimes higher than costs  			 for direct SNF patients during the PAC episode (<a href="#table5.11">Table  			 5.11</a>). Beneficiary costs were also significantly higher for  			 IRF&gt;SNF patients. Per-day costs were closer than total episode costs  			 because IRF&gt;SNF patients had significantly longer lengths of stay in  			 PAC, but still were significantly different.</p>
<p>While the difference between IRF&gt;SNF episodes and direct  			 discharges to SNFs in all service costs for 90 days was less, they were still  			 approximately twice as high for the IRF&gt;SNF episodes. The substantial  			 increase in the direct SNF discharge costs was not surprising due to the  			 frailty of these individuals and associated hospitalization and physician care  			 that they received following the shorter PAC episodes. However, the total  			 costs, costs to Medicare program, and costs to beneficiaries of the combined  			 IRF&gt;SNF episodes far outweighed the cost of direct discharges to SNFs  			 and was highly statistically significant even in this small sample.</p>

<p>This national outcome and cost study of PAC for elderly stroke  		beneficiaries yielded three overriding conclusions pertaining to  		cost-effectiveness. First, outcome patterns for direct admits to IRFs, SNFs,  		and HH agencies from the hospital reflect the major differences in case mix  		that were previously noted and cost differences reflect the services, and PPS  		payment rules and incentives. Because unique stroke populations are discharged  		directly to these PAC settings for the most part, outcome and cost comparisons  		for comparable patients are not possible based solely on the initial PAC  		provider. Second, relative to direct discharges to SNF, discharges to IRF  		followed by SNF care (a subgroup of the IRF group with similar characteristics)  		cost substantially more with apparently comparable outcomes. These care  		patterns were found in different communities, whereas patient characteristics  		were comparable, suggesting that this identified subgroup might be treated most  		cost-effectively in SNFs. Third, among IRF admissions who mostly receive care  		in multiple-provider episodes, comparisons suggest OP care following an IRF may  		be more cost-effective than HH care following IRF, and perhaps preferable even  		to IRF care with no immediate follow-up after discharge. Cost in this case  		refers to Medicare payments; however, higher costs to beneficiaries of OP  		services raise policy issues if this is to become a more desirable option.</p>
<p>The first of these findings is anticipated by the previously reported  		differences in characteristics between elderly Medicare stroke victims admitted  		directly to IRFs, SNFs, and HH agencies from the hospital (<a href="#pattern">Chapter 4</a>). SNF patients were significantly less well  		educated, more disabled prior to their stroke, more cognitively and physically  		impaired following their stroke, and had greater speech/language impairments  		and greater symptoms of depression. On the other end of the spectrum, HH  		patients were more likely to be women and had less post-stroke functional and  		cognitive impairment than IRF patients. Given these differences, associated  		differences in outcomes between settings would be anticipated. That is, the  		higher rate of nursing home residence at 90 days among discharges to SNFs than  		either IRFs or HH agencies and the lowest rate of residence in equally  		independent settings is a logical outcome of these differences. The highest  		rates of functional recovery found for direct HH admissions would also be  		anticipated. While a trend toward less functional recovery was found in SNFs  		relative to IRFs, these were not statistically significant. The combination of  		the large selection bias in direct discharges to these settings and the lack of  		statistical power to reject the null hypothesis in view of the small sample  		sizes in direct admits to SNFs and HH agencies rendered rigorous outcome  		comparisons of all direct discharges to the three settings unfeasible and  		inappropriate.</p>
<p>The cost data demonstrate the high cost in total and to Medicare of  		using IRFs in the post-PPS era, both during the PAC episode and over 90 days.  		This occurs because of the high cost per discharge of IRF services and also the  		use of other providers in the PAC episode. In the Medicare program, one patient  		can receive PAC in an IRF for the cost of treating two in a SNF and for the  		same cost as treating eight in an HH agency; however, given the difference in  		the patient populations and associated outcomes, the cost-effectiveness of all  		episodes beginning with IRF vs. SNF vs. HH subsequent to PPS implementation  		cannot be compared. The HH agencies are treating a healthier population, with  		functional and cognitive characteristics that enable them to go home, and the  		SNFs are treating the most disabled population who receive less therapy and  		physician care in a different staffing environment.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.6">6</a></font></sup> The lower cost in both SNFs and  		HH agencies is consistent with prior work suggesting that patients who are most  		independent and those with the greatest dependence generally receive and need  		fewer therapy resources than those in the middle who can benefit the  		most.<sup><a href="#ref5.7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The second set of findings relate to the subgroup of patients discharged  		directly to SNFs, who were found to be extremely similar to patients discharged  		to IRF and then subsequently transferred to an SNF (<a href="#pattern">Chapter  		4</a>). Even though IRF&gt;SNF patients were more independent in ADLs,  		IADLs, social/role functioning, and ambulation, had higher global health  		ratings, and were better educated prior to their stroke than direct SNF  		patients, the two patient groups were very similar after their stroke. They had  		comparable cognitive status, with an average MMSE of 19-20; about 60 percent  		were below 23 on the MMSE (suggesting likely cognitive impairment) and 25  		percent were below 17 (suggesting more significant impairment).<sup><font><a href="#ref5.8">8</a>, <a href="#ref5.9">9</a>, <a href="#ref5.10">10</a></font></sup> They had average Barthel scores of about 30  		out of 90, with 75 percent of patients with Barthel scores of 40 or less,  		representing significant functional impairment. Thirty (30) to 45 percent had  		speech or language impairments. Over half had depressive symptoms according to  		the GDS Short Form, with 25 percent meeting more strict criteria for  		depression.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.11">11</a>, <a href="#ref5.12">12</a></font></sup> The major distinguishing characteristics  		between the IRF&gt;SNF group and the direct discharges to SNFs were  		community characteristics, suggesting that PAC care patterns may have occurred  		in large part because of provider availability. IRF&gt;SNF episodes were  		almost twice as likely than direct SNF episodes to be in communities with high  		IRF use rates, and SNF episodes were significantly more likely to be in states  		with high rates of nursing home beds and low rates of residential care.  		IRF&gt;SNF episodes were also more likely to occur in urban areas. Thus,  		for this patient subgroup, the study provided an opportunity for a natural  		experiment.</p>
<p>A mortality rate that was three times higher in the direct SNF group vs.  		the IRF&gt;SNF group made outcome comparisons difficult because the most  		frail patients with the greatest functional losses were likely residing in  		nursing homes. Nevertheless, even if we scored all of these patients with the  		worst possible value for location at 90 days (i.e., nursing home) and function  		at 90 days (i.e., 0), then location outcomes and functional outcomes were  		similar between the two groups. Total and Medicare PAC costs were three times  		higher for the IRF&gt;SNF patients, and all service costs for 90 days  		were twice as high for the IRF&gt;SNF group. This difference in PAC costs  		is not surprising given the PAC length of stay difference of 72.6 vs. 46.4 days  		and the fact that so many IRF patients use three types of PAC, not just two.  		Thus, direct discharge to SNF appears to be a more cost-effective alternative  		for this subgroup of patients.</p>
<p>Several issues surround restructuring incentives to treat these patients  		in SNFs without first admitting them to IRFs. The first issue is whether they  		can be accurately identified upon hospital discharge without a trial in an IRF  		setting. Some would argue that it is not the IRFs intent upon admitting  		these patients to discharge them to a SNF, but because they do not progress as  		expected, the need for this additional institutional care becomes apparent.  		However, if it is possible to identify these patients at the time of acute  		hospital discharge, then discharge to an IRF is not appropriate. In such cases,  		an SNF with adequate rehabilitation resources needs to be available in the  		community. Alternatively, a policy mechanism might be designed to encourage  		either immediate or early discharge from IRF to SNF in the appropriate  		situations. One possibility is to develop some type of transfer CMG policy  		whereby the IRF would receive a reduced payment equivalent to SNF level of care  		for IRF days if the patient is ultimately discharged to a SNF. A similar policy  		is currently in place whereby Medicare pays IRFs lower rates for patients with  		stays of less than four days. While further study of this issue is needed  		because of the subgroup sample size in this study, the IRF&gt;SNF group  		appears to be a relatively homogenous set of patients who are distinct from  		other patients typically admitted to IRFs. Their admission to IRFs may be based  		more upon practice patterns and their pre-stroke function rather than their  		post-stroke disability.</p>
<p>The third finding relating to IRF care episodes followed by HH, OP, or  		direct discharge to residence raises some important policy considerations. The  		first concern is what distinguishes patients who follow these different PAC  		pathways. To qualify for HH care, a beneficiary must require intermittent  		skilled nursing, PT, or ST (fewer than eight hours per day and 28 hours per  		week); be under the care of a physician; have the services furnished under a  		plan of care prescribed and periodically reviewed by a physician; and be  		confined to his/her residence (i.e., homebound).<sup><font><a href="#ref5.13">13</a></font></sup> A beneficiary is homebound  		when he/she has a condition that results in a normal inability to leave home  		except with considerable and taxing effort, and absences from home are  		infrequent or are of relatively short duration or attributable to receiving  		medical treatment. The definition of homebound has been controversial, which is  		not surprising in that terms such as considerable and taxing effort and  		infrequent or of relatively short duration are quite subjective. In fact, one  		might imagine twocomparable individuals living in their homes, one who receives  		her medical treatment in an OP facility and the other who is visited by HH  		staff because he differs in what he considers considerable or taxing effort.  		</p>
<p>Our case mix findings suggest relative comparability between  		IRF&gt;HH and IRF&gt;OP patients. Over 65 percent of IRF admissions  		went to one of these two options, with more than half of these going to HH  		agencies. Between stroke patients admitted to these two settings, very modest  		post-stroke case mix differences were noted, including a difference of about  		five points in the Barthel Index on a 90-point scale, and a difference of about  		one point on the FIM mobility/transfer subscale, which is 21 points.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.14">14</a></font></sup> Among those who could respond,  		there was also a modest difference in the abbreviated GDS Short Form.  		Twoimportant socioeconomic status differences were that patients who went from  		IRF to OP were better educated by about oneyear on average and had higher  		incomes, with 10 percent fewer in the less than $15,000 income bracket and more  		in the $15,000-$30,000 and $30,000 and above bracket. No differences were found  		in availability of social supports nor in pre-stroke function.</p>
<p>So why did some patients use HH care following rehab while others used  		OP services? One answer may be the cost to beneficiaries, which was higher for  		the episode and across 90 days for patients admitted to OP settings due to the  		copayments for OP services. No copayment or coinsurance is required of  		beneficiaries for HH services, which makes HH attractive to persons with lower  		incomes. For OP services, a coinsurance amount is required that for most  		services is determined by the APCs. Over the past several years, there has been  		substantial pressure to reduce coinsurance in the OP PPS to a target of 20  		percent.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.15">15</a>, <a href="#ref5.16">16</a>, <a href="#ref5.17">17</a></font></sup> OP therapy  		services are excluded from the APCs and are covered by a fee schedule in which  		Medicare covers 80 percent and the beneficiary is responsible for 20 percent,  		which is paid out-of-pocket or from supplemental insurance. Therapy services  		require a physician order, a specific treatment plan, and must be provided by  		skilled, qualified providers. No limits exist for provision of therapy services  		in OP hospitals; however, an annual limit of $1,740 exists for combined OP PT,  		and ST with a $1,740limit for OT when services are provided outside a hospital  		for the year 2006.</p>
<p>These coinsurance costs result in a cost to Medicare patients for each  		visit in contrast to lack of any beneficiary cost for HH patients. Thus, a  		clear financial incentive exists for a beneficiary who does not have  		supplemental insurance that would cover the coinsurance to use HH services.  		Reducing the cost to beneficiaries due to this coinsurance for OP services, or  		requiring a copayment for HH services, might increase the utilization of OP  		services relative to home care services following the IRF stay. As the findings  		in this report suggest, this could ultimately reduce the cost of PAC to  		Medicare for stroke victims over the 90 days following the PAC episode.</p>
<p>Another possible incentive for patients to use HH agencies instead of OP  		care is the cost of transportation. Although we did not collect data on  		transportation abilities at discharge from the IRF, the 90-day use of car IADL  		variable showed that about 55 percent of the HH group had difficulty getting in  		and out of a car in a contrast to 28 percent of the OP group and that a third  		of these persons were unable in contrast to 20 percent of the OP group. This  		may be the argument for being homebound; however, some patients in the OP group  		had difficulty and were unable to use cars as well. If handicapped  		transportation services were provided, either through Medicare or another  		payment program, more stroke victims might avail themselves of OP services  		instead of HH services.</p>
<p>The evidence on outcome differences across different types of  		multiple-provider episodes suggests that even after adjusting for baseline  		differences that were relatively modest, IRF patients who went to OP care had  		better outcomes with respect to functioning in the community (IADLs),  		ambulation, and to some extent ADLs at 90 days. One possible explanation for  		the difference in outcomes is that OPs received a total of 40 therapy visits  		(39 OP and one HH) in contrast to about 22 (17 HH and five OP) for HH patients.  		The HH PPS that provides an incentive to deliver ten therapy visits (which  		increases the HHRG payment substantially) without an incentive to provide any  		more than ten visits may be working against optimal care for stroke  		patients.</p>
<p>The other issue is whether HH rehabilitation, which is aimed at treating  		a heterogeneous group of Medicare beneficiaries, is optimally suited for highly  		specialized treatment of stroke victims. Earlier studies that have demonstrated  		the benefits of IRFs and specialized stroke units<sup><font><a href="#ref5.18">18</a>, <a href="#ref5.19">19</a></font></sup> argue for the  		benefits of more specialized rehabilitation for a complex multifaceted disease  		such as stroke. Returning to an OP rehabilitation setting with specialized  		stroke services may provide the greatest benefit for stroke victims after  		discharge from an IRF. In this study, 60 percent of the IRF&gt;OP group  		received OP care in an OP program that was affiliated with the IRF from which  		they were discharged, and the remainder went to freestanding facilities.  		Although about 60 percent of OPHH patients received care in a hospital-based HH  		agency; only 36 percent of these received their care in an HH agency that was  		affiliated with the treating IRF. While important restrictions exist for  		referrals to jointly-owned settings (StarkII legislation), benefits may exist  		for referral to a specialized rehabilitation facility for OP care where there  		is greater care continuity, reducing the likelihood of problems in care  		transitions.<sup><font><a href="#ref5.20">20</a>, <a href="#ref5.21">21</a></font></sup> Obviously, this is a double-edged sword  		from a policy perspective, opening the door for selective referral to providers  		where there is shared financial interest.</p>
<p>Not only does the IRF&gt;OP option appear to lead to enhanced  		outcomes, but costs are significantly lower during the PAC episode and over 90  		days. The $2,500 per episode cost difference for the PAC episode and the $4,300  		difference per 90 days are substantial, after taking into consideration case  		mix characteristics that explained a large amount of the variation in costs.  		These models that experienced substantial variation also suggested that  		modeling costs per total PAC episode using patient characteristics and selected  		facility characteristics may not be as difficult as some have argued.  		Interestingly, even the 90-day cost for the small sample of individuals who  		were discharged directly from the IRF to their residence without either HH or  		OP care in 30 days, were comparable to patients discharged directly to OP  		services due to hospital costs, associated services, and OP and HH costs  		received later. This provides further support for the benefit of immediate OP  		services following discharge from IRFs.</p>
<p>Because all the data from this study are in the post-PPS era, the study  		does not address the change in patient outcomes and costs due to PPS. However,  		the incentives under the current systems encourage discharge of most stroke  		victims to an IRF (resulting in a per discharge payment), and then a minimal  		IRF length of stay followed by discharge to a subsequent setting. The two-day  		decline in length of stay between 2003 and 2004 (<a href="#pattern">Chapter  		4</a>) suggests that IRFs are responding to this incentive, which may lead to  		an adjustment in per discharge payments relatively soon. One result is the use  		of IRF&gt;SNF episodes that are more costly than direct SNF discharge for  		comparable patients, yielding similar outcomes. Other incentives appear to  		result in greater differentiation among settings in direct discharges from the  		acute hospital; this change reduces the opportunities for natural experiments  		in which outcomes and costs can be compared across settings. Our findings  		suggest that it is important to continue monitoring the relatively substantial  		impacts of PPS on PAC.</p>
<p>Policy options recommended by this report such as reducing the  		coinsurance for OP services, including coverage for handicap transportation  		services under Medicare, and reducing IRF payments for the subgroup of patients  		who are discharged to SNFs, may ultimately lead to lower cost rehabilitation  		with improved or comparable outcomes for elderly stroke victims under PPS.  		Ultimately, new CMS initiatives on the horizon such as the Section5008  		Post-Acute Care Payment Reform Demonstration and the Pay-for-Performance  		Demonstration (if rehabilitation measures are included) may stimulate providers  		to create innovative, cost-effective solutions for achieving optimal patient  		treatment outcomes across the spectrum of care under PPS. </p>

<h3>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>PPSs were implemented for Medicare PAC over the past seven years in the  		two primary inpatient destinations: SNFs in July 1998, and in IRFs in January  		2002. PPS implementation also occurred for OP hospital care in August 2000, and  		for HH care in October 2000. Initial data suggest that PPS has dramatically  		affected the economics of the targeted PAC settings. </p>
<p>In our national study of PAC for stroke patients following PPS from late  		2002 to early 2005, we made several observations from our primary data. First,  		we found it increasingly difficult to locate sufficient numbers of stroke  		patients receiving rehabilitation who were admitted directly to SNFs under PPS.  		Second, we observed significant differences in characteristics of stroke  		patients admitted to various PAC settings following acute hospitalization.  		Third, we found declining lengths of stay over the period of study for IRF  		patients. However, our sample was limited to 674 patients in 69 facilities for  		whom we collected primary data. Thus, analysis on a larger national sample is  		needed to confirm these findings.</p>
<p>PAC settings include inpatient settings of IRF, long-term acute care  		hospitals, and SNFs, and community settings of HH and hospital and  		community-based OP services. We chose to use the MedPAR file for national data.  		The limitation to using the MedPAR file is that it contains only inpatient  		records. However, given the importance of analyzing national data, we  		determined that the MedPAR data would provide further insight into the use of  		SNF and IRF settings for beneficiaries who were hospitalized with a stroke.</p>
<p>In particular, we will address the following research questions:</p>
<ol><li>Do trends in PAC discharge destination of stroke patients show an  		  increase in discharges to IRF and a decrease in SNF admissions? </li>
<li>Do the SNF and IRF stroke populations appear to have different  		  clinical characteristics? </li>
<li>Did facility-level volume of admissions change in response to PPS  		  (i.e., did the distributions of patients among providers change in ways  		  consistent with the trends in national discharges or did individual facilities  		  respond differently)? </li>
<li>What are differences in characteristics, such as the length of stay  		  changes, among hospital-based and freestanding SNFs and IRFs? </li>
</ol><h3>B. METHODS</h3>
<p><b>1. Data</b></p>
<p>We extracted data from the MedPAR files for calendar years 1998-2004,  		after the start of implementation of the PPS for PAC. The MedPAR file contains  		inpatient hospital (including inpatient rehabilitation stays and LTCH stays)  		and SNF records. Each MedPAR record represents a stay in an inpatient hospital  		or SNF collapsing all claims for that stay into a final action record. MedPAR  		presented an opportunity to examine the entire population of Medicare stroke  		patients over 1998-2004. In addition to its restriction to inpatient records,  		the biggest drawback to MedPAR data is the limited information included in the  		file. Since clinical data from PAC assessments are not included in the records,  		it did not allow for comprehensive case mix adjustment or comparisons of  		patient characteristics among patient populations. We cannot observe any direct  		information for HH or OP use, and reported discharge destination information is  		notoriously suspect in all administrative data. </p>
<p>Starting from the full MedPAR file, we identified stroke patients in the  		MedPAR dataset using stroke DRGs 14 and 15. We selected all records for these  		beneficiaries because some records that are part of a stroke episode may not be  		coded by DRG, particularly in IRF or SNF records. Over 7,000,000 records were  		identified in this manner. We then collapsed the records into sequenced  		episodes of inpatient stays similar to the episodes created for our study  		subjects. Episodes were required to begin with an acute hospital stay including  		a primary diagnosis matching those in the screening form for our study subjects  		as noted in <a href="#method">Chapter 2</a>. Each PAC episode included 90 days  		following the discharge date of the first acute hospital stay. To be considered  		part of the 90-day episode, subsequent admissions had to occur within 30 days  		of the prior inpatient stay. A new episode for a given beneficiary was  		triggered by any gap of at least 180 days between inpatient discharges. </p>
<p>Each episode became a record in our final data set. Maryland patients  		were removed from the data for the majority of the analyses as outliers since  		they are not subject to prospective payment and their PAC patterns are  		distinctly different. To match our study population of interest, we dropped  		patients under age 65. In our time period, admissions from 1998 to 2004, we had  		1.88 million episodes. </p>
<p><b>2. Analysis</b></p>
<p>Descriptive analyses were completed by collapsing episodes into  		categories and profiling the SNF and IRF discharges over time or by other  		variables of interest. Bivariate comparisions followed the same methods  		described in prior chapters. Comparisons were conducted using the t-test or  		Mann-Whitney for non-normally distributed variables and the Chi-Square test for  		dichotomous variables.</p>
<p>For the trend analyses, the discharge date for the acute hospital stay  		was used and discharges were joined into quarterly averages, smoothing out some  		of the random variation which emerged using monthly averages. Because we are  		interested in full 90-day episodes, acute hospital discharges were dropped for  		the last three months of 2004 for all trend analysis. We utilized logistic  		regression to examine the trend in the likelihood of discharge to IRF and the  		likelihood of discharge to SNF, controlling for case mix. Case mix variables  		were generated to match those used in the outcome analyses from  		<a href="#outcome">Chapter 5</a>, where at all possible.</p>
<h3>C. RESULTS</h3>
<p><b>1. Trend in Primary Discharge Destination</b></p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure6.1" id="figure6.1">FIGURE 6.1</a>:  			 Discharge to Inpatient PAC Over Time</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68941/strokePAC-fig6-1.JPG" alt="Line Chart: Discharge to Inpatient PAC Over Time" /></td>
</tr></table><p><a href="#figure6.1">Figure 6.1</a> depicts the trend in primary  		discharge destination for inpatient PAC from 1998 to 2004. The overall  		percentage of stroke patients receiving inpatient PAC remained fairly steady  		across the time period, at close to 50 percent. The distribution of  		destinations changed over time as IRF and LTCH use increased while SNF use  		decreased. The drop in SNF usage and increase in IRF usage appeared more  		dramatic in 2004. Although LTCH discharges remained a small percentage of  		inpatient care over time, they increased by nearly 90 percent (from 0.82  		percent to 1.53 percent). We also looked at the trend of using SNF after an  		initial discharge to IRF over this time period. While the use of this  		combination did increase over the time period, it appears to be associated with  		the overall increase in IRF usage, and the percent of patients discharged to an  		IRF that also use a SNF within 90 days of hospital discharge fluctuated around  		25 percent.</p>
<p>While <a href="#figure6.1">Figure 6.1</a> represents the national  		averages in discharges, strong geographical disparities exist in the use of  		PAC. We found a large variation in discharge destination by state, both in the  		usage of inpatient PAC and in the distribution of inpatient PAC between IRF and  		SNF (<a href="#table6.1">Table 6.1</a>). The states are ordered from highest  		(Nevada) to lowest (Maryland) use of IRF. The numbers in parentheses in columns  		2-4 represent the state rank in that category from highest to lowest. States  		that have high IRF usage tended to have low SNF usage (see Nevada, Arkansas,  		Louisiana, and Oklahoma). Conversely, only some states with low IRF usage  		tended to have high SNF usage (see Connecticut and Oregon), which created broad  		differences in the ratio of IRF to all inpatient care received across states,  		from a low of 22 percent in Connecticut to a high of 59 percent in Nevada. </p>

Note that Maryland, which  		is exempt from PPS, uses far more SNF care than IRF care and is one of the  		states with a smaller percentage going to inpatient care. While we also looked  		at the change in IRF and SNF usage over time for all of the states, no patterns  		emerged. Some states increased and some states decreased their use of IRF and  		of SNF over the time, but the size and direction of the change did not appear  		to be associated with the distribution of discharge destinations in 1998, nor  		did it cause the variation in use among states to expand or contract over the  		time period. </p>
<p><b>2. Comparison of Patient Populations Post-IRF PPS </b></p>
<p>Within our study subjects, IRF and SNF patients generally showed  		different clinical profiles, a finding supported in the MedPAR population to  		the limited extent that we were able to compare the populations. MedPAR did not  		provide assessments of the level of function in the discharges, but we did find  		some interesting differences between SNF and IRF patients in the period of our  		study, the post-IRF PPS period 2002-2004. SNF patients were significantly older  		(SNF mean=82.3 (STD 7.7), IRF mean=78.2 (STD 7.30)); female (SNF=66.4 percent,  		IRF=57.1 percent); less likely to have an occlusive stroke (SNF proportion=66.5  		percent, IRF proportion=73.1 percent); and had a longer mean length of stay in  		their first PAC stay (SNF mean=24.8 (STD 28.8) vs. IRF mean=16.6 (STD 9.3)).  		</p>
<p>The profile of the acute hospital stay in each of the groups was also  		markedly different. SNF patients stayed longer, with an average length of stay  		almost 30 percent longer (7.0 days (STD 5.2) vs. 5.5 days (STD 3.5)). The IRF  		patients, on the other hand, were more likely to have spent time in a  		specialized unit, either ICU (33.1 percent vs. 27.1 percent) or CCU (12.3  		percent vs. 10.5 percent) and to have received ST (63.2 percent vs. 58.5  		percent), PT (94.0 percent vs. 85.6 percent), and OT (71.9 percent vs. 56.4  		percent) while in the hospital. Finally, IRF patients were more likely to be  		living in an urban area, 76.4 percent as compared to 72.0 percent. No  		difference was found in the likelihood of having a prior stroke within the last  		calendar year. </p>
<p>Age appeared to be strongly related to the discharge destination for  		stroke patients. <a href="#figure6.2">Figure 6.2</a> shows the likelihood of  		discharge to IRF and to SNF by age, separated into pre-IRF PPS and post-IRF  		PPS. The likelihood of discharge to SNF increased steadily as age increased  		until age 94, when it plateaued. Discharge rates to IRF remained generally  		constant until the mid-seventies, when they began to decrease steadily. The  		similar curves for pre- and post-PPS indicate that the average age in each  		facility type remained similar after implementation of the IRF PPS; however,  		older stroke patients were always more likely to go to SNF relative to IRF.  		This age pattern may also be responsible for the gender differences we observed  		between the SNF and IRF populations as older patients are much more likely to  		be women.</p>

<p><a href="#table6.2">Table 6.2</a> presents highlights of the  		distribution of discharges across facilities for SNF and IRF. Over 1998-2004,  		the number of IRFs increased by 8 percent, but the facilities had gradually  		decreasing numbers of discharges. SNFs also showed declining stroke volume, and  		the average dropped to nearly one discharge every two months. The SNFs at the  		90th percentile volume, although at the upper end of the distribution of  		discharges, only averaged about one discharge per month in 2004, a decline from  		1.5 per month in 1998. For both SNFs and IRFs, the largest drop in volume  		appeared to be in the high-volume facilities, which is consistent with the  		lowering of the coefficient of variation over time.</p>

<p>The next two tables, <a href="#table6.4">Table 6.4</a> and  		<a href="#table6.5">Table 6.5</a> present the models for likelihood of  		discharge to IRF if discharged alive and likelihood of discharge to SNF if  		discharged alive. We tested a number of different models and these represent  		our best approach. The change in both IRF use and SNF use appears to be a  		continuing trend over the 1998-2004 time period, an average of 1.5 percent  		increase annually of likelihood of going to IRF and a nearly 1 percent decrease  		annually in the likelihood of going to SNF, controlling for case mix variables.  		Other variables of interest showed that living in an urban area made one more  		likely to use an IRF and less likely to use a SNF. Hospital length of stay was  		positively associated with going to SNF and negatively associated with going to  		IRF. ICU and CCU use in the hospital were positively associated with going to  		IRF. </p>
<p>Age was positively associated with going to SNF and negatively  		associated with going to IRF. Age was left as a continuous variable rather than  		collapsed into levels based on the observed relationship between age and  		discharge destination in <a href="#figure6.1">Figure 6.1</a>. Fit, in terms of  		C-statistic, was modest, reflecting the limits of the data in terms of case mix  		variables and the fact that placement is driven in part by factors such as  		practice patterns, as shown previously.</p>

<p>Four general conclusions emerged from the analysis of MedPAR data.  		First, admissions of stroke patients to SNFs directly from the hospital have  		been steadily declining since 1998 -- around the time the SNF PPS was  		implemented and admissions to IRFs and acute LTCHs have been increasing.  		Second, the distribution of stroke patients in SNFs and IRFs is becoming less  		variable due to declines in the number of high-volume providers. Together,  		these factors help to explain why it was so difficult to enroll stroke patients  		from SNFs that were historically high-volume providers. Third, characteristics  		such as age were quite different between SNF and IRF patients for the most  		part; nevertheless, geographic variation still existed across states in use of  		SNF and IRF, with an inverse relationship between the two. Fourth, consistent  		with PPS incentives, length of stay declined in IRFs, but length of stay also  		declined in freestanding SNFs.</p>
<p>In the years following the implementation of the IRF PPS, a sharp  		increase occurred in Medicare spending in IRFs, with total Medicare spending  		increasing 15 percent per year between 2002 and 2004, as opposed to 3 percent  		per year between 2000 and 2001.<sup><font><a href="#ref6.1">1</a></font></sup> MedPAC estimated that increased margins for  		IRFs during this period were in the range of 11.1-17.7 percent, in contrast to  		the range of 1.1-2.9 percent prior to PPS. The rapid increase in profitability  		created incentives for IRFs to sharply increase their patient volumes. This  		rapid increase was not found after PPS for stroke patients. A more rapid  		increase may have occurred for other patient types that were more profitable  		under PPS. </p>
<p>The shift in the likelihood of SNF vs. IRF discharge that was observed  		for stroke occurred over many years, not just between 2002 and 2004, consistent  		with RANDs findings for stroke over the shorter term (through July of  		2003).<sup><font><a href="#ref6.2">2</a></font></sup> This could mean  		that the change was prompted by implementation of the SNF PPS and further  		stimulated by the IRF PPS. Such a change may occur slowly due to capacity  		constraints. Adding beds and certifying new facilities takes a long time, so  		such shifts are likely to occur gradually. Industry skepticism regarding the  		long-term profitability of Medicare in IRFs could contribute to a gradual  		response. Potential investors and existing IRF owners may be reluctant to build  		or expand facilities with the uncertainty of revisions to the current IRF PPS  		system design that affect payment rates and other regulations such as the  		definition of a facility to qualify for being paid higher IRF rates.</p>
<p>Instead, facilities may choose to respond in less capital intensive  		ways, by changing treatment patterns for admitted patients. Shortening length  		of stay may be one example. Freestanding IRFs showed a steeper decline in  		length of stay following IRF PPS and their estimated margins shifted from being  		very similar to unit IRFs in 2001 (1.5 and 1.4 percent, respectively) to being  		much greater by 2004 (24.2 to 12.0 percent).<sup><font><a href="#ref6.1">1</a></font></sup> Additional work with more detailed  		facility-level variables would be of interest, to see if PPS response changed  		based on other characteristics such as an association with a SNF or HH agency  		and ownership status. </p>
<p>The pronounced decline in high-volume providers for both SNFs and IRFs  		and redistribution of stroke patients to low or moderate volume facilities  		could result from either greater competition for stroke patients or a tendency  		for facilities to want to balance their case mix with other types of cases. SNF  		volume for stroke PAC is extremely small in most facilities; 85 percent of  		facilities in 2004 had less than ten stroke admissions for primary PAC.  		Although these numbers are boosted slightly if we include the admissions from  		IRFs for additional PAC, they remain small enough to give rise to concerns  		about the ability to maintain sufficient expertise in stroke rehabilitation for  		many SNFs. Stroke causes deficits in areas not found in typical joint and  		fracture rehabilitation, requiring specialized physician and nursing knowledge  		and a multidisciplinary therapy staff with stroke expertise.</p>
<p>The MedPAR data reinforced some of our study findings regarding  		differences in the IRF and SNF patient population. The limited bivariate  		comparisons suggested that IRF and SNF patients had some differences in  		characteristics. Age appears to be a prime indicator of whether a stroke  		patient goes to an IRF or a SNF and merits further investigation to determine  		whether it is simply a marker for functional status that leads to PAC  		placement, or whether it is a unique determinant. Our primary data analysis  		suggested that other characteristics such as cognition, function, and speech  		and language differed significantly between IRF and SNF patients. However,  		patients discharged directly to a SNF were found to be very similar to patients  		who went to a SNF subsequent to an IRF stay.</p>
<p>The degree of geographic variation in discharge destination indicated  		that some substitution between settings was possible and practice patterns  		likely influence destination. The geographic disparity observed prior to  		PPS<sup><font><a href="#ref6.4">4</a></font></sup> continued after  		implementation of PPS in all three major PAC settings. Use of PAC has been tied  		to its availability of setting types.<sup><font><a href="#ref6.3">3</a>, <a href="#ref6.4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>We observed strong length of stay trends in inpatient PAC for stroke  		from 1998 to 2004. Length of stay fell in freestanding IRFs and SNFs, although  		the financial incentives to shorten length of stay are not obvious in the SNF  		case. Perhaps SNFs began to discharge patients more to other settings,  		resulting in shorter average lengths of stay over time. This is an area that  		may benefit from further study, particularly into changes in the discharge  		destination of these patients. </p>
