<p>This inventory of long-term care, aging and disability research has been  		prepared by the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy (DALTCP),  		in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE),  		within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It summarizes  		the status of current research, the results of research projects sponsored from  		1992 through 1996, and highlights future research plans. Previous editions of  		this inventory were issued in 1988 and 1992. DALTCP research products can now  		also be found through our Internet home page (<a href="../_/office_specific/daltcp.cfm.html">http://aspe.hhs.gov/_/office_specific/daltcp.cfm</a>).  		This inventory will be incorporated into our home page and will be updated  		there as needed.</p>
<p>DALTCP is responsible for the development, coordination, research, and  		evaluation of HHS policies and programs which support the independence,  		productivity, health, long-term care, and economic security of children,  		working age adults, and older persons with disabilities. The Office is also  		responsible for policy coordination and research to promote the economic and  		social well-being of the elderly.</p>
<p>In particular, the Office is responsible for policies concerning:  		long-term care and personal assistance services, including informal caregiving;  		linkages among the acute, post-acute and long-term care systems; long-term  		rehabilitation services; children's disability; and the encouragement of  		mechanisms for coordinating the housing, health, income supports, and  		education, training and employment needs of people with disabilities. These  		responsibilities are carried out through policy planning, policy and budget  		analysis, regulatory reviews, formulation of legislative proposals, evaluation,  		and policy research.</p>
<p>In these matters, DALTCP works closely with the Health Care Financing  		Administration (HCFA), Administration on Aging (AoA), Administration on  		Developmental Disabilities (ADD), National Institute on Aging (NIA), National  		Institute on Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD), National Center for  		Health Statistics (NCHS), Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR),  		and the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p>
<p>DALTCP pursues a rigorous research agenda, aimed at providing  		comprehensive information to address policy questions for Federal, State, and  		local policy makers and program managers. In turn, entities offer help in  		formulating the questions, data systems, and sites for study.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>In an era marked by rapidly growing health care expenditures, the public  		and private sectors are increasingly looking toward <b>managed health care  		systems</b> to control health care costs and improve access to a coordinated  		continuum of services. People with disabilities account for a disproportionate  		share of overall health care expenditures, and until payers can contain the  		costs and more effectively manage the care of people with disabilities, savings  		in overall health care expenditures will be difficult to realize. Yet designing  		managed care systems for the disabled has proven to be extremely difficult to  		achieve. The development of cost-effective, outcomes-oriented, and  		consumer-sensitive managed care systems for people with disabilities continues  		to be extremely challenging for both the private and public health care  		sectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither the public nor private sectors have much  		information on: (a) the experience of disabled populations in the traditional  		health care system, and (b) what happens to these populations when they are  		enrolled in managed care plans. In an effort to better understand the impact of  		managed care on disabled populations, DALTCP has developed a series of research  		and evaluation projects focused on managed care and people with disabilities  		(sometimes in collaboration with HCFA and other parts of HHS). Specific  		projects investigate the experiences of disabled populations in managed care in  		public health care systems such as Medicaid and Medicare, as well as in  		employer-based and self-insured plans. </p>
<p>In addition to managed care arrangements, projects supported by DALTCP  		are also monitoring other developments in the health care system. Among them  		are the emergence of <b>subacute care</b> and the growth of <b>Medicare nursing  		facility and home health care</b>. </p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p41" id="p41">ISSUE PAPER AND EXPERT  		MEETING ON MANAGED CARE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The purpose of this paper, written by DALTCP  		staff, was to provide background information for a meeting of experts brought  		together to discuss managed care for people with disabilities and to assist in  		the development of a research agenda on managed care for DALTCP to pursue. At  		the meeting, which was held on December 5, 1994, experts were asked to: (1)  		discuss the benefits and risks that managed care may pose for people with  		disabilities; (2) identify key policy concerns that the Federal Government and  		States must consider in designing managed care initiatives for people with  		disabilities; (3) highlight relevant completed research or research that was  		underway; and (4) suggest policy relevant projects and studies which ASPE might  		pursue.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The policy and research areas  		identified in the paper include: functional and demographic characteristics of  		people with disabilities in managed care; the impact of managed care on access,  		quality, affordability, costs, satisfaction, health status, and functioning;  		targeting of managed care to people with disabilities; financing and  		reimbursement; service coverage and organization of the delivery system; and  		quality assurance. Under each of these areas, policy issues, research completed  		and underway, and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  In spite of the rising level of interest by  		public and private payers in expanding managed care enrollment to include  		people with disabilities, there are few systematic data available about plans  		that successfully serve individuals with complex health care needs. The purpose  		of this project was to gather qualitative data about public and private managed  		care plans that provide efficient yet clinically appropriate care to working  		age adults with disabilities. Data was gathered through site visits to  		approximately six plans and telephone interviews with another ten plans.  		Research questions focused on consumer participation, provider training and  		recruitment, quality of care, risk adjustment and risk sharing arrangements,  		service delivery models, disease specific practice guidelines, and outcome  		measurement.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Site visits were completed in  		February 1996. Plans visited included: Health Alliance, Intermountain Health  		Care, Group Health of Puget Sound, Community Medical Alliance, Arizona's  		Physician IPA, and others. Sites on which information has been collected on  		include: Fallon Community Health Plan, FHP, Harvard Community Health Plan,  		Kaiser Permanente--Colorado, MCARE, Pacificare, United HealthCare Corporation,  		and others. A written report will be available in February 1997 and was  		presented at DALTCP's national managed care conference held in November  		1996.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p21" id="p21">COSTS AND QUALITY OF  		SUBACUTE CARE</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Barbara  		Manard, Lewin-VHI, Inc., Fairfax, VA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Medicare expenditures for post-acute and  		acute care are expected to rise substantially as both the number and proportion  		of persons over age 65 grows. As an effort to reduce costs, "subacute care" is  		being promoted by many providers as a cost-effective alternative to inpatient  		hospital care with potential savings of 40%-60%. While there is no specific  		definition of subacute care, there is general agreement that subacute care  		encompasses a wide range of medically complex and/or technologically advanced  		services at the lower end of acute care but at a higher level of care than  		traditionally provided in non-acute care settings. Services previously provided  		in acute care hospitals are more frequently delivered in non-acute care  		hospital settings (i.e., long-term care and rehabilitation hospitals, nursing  		homes, and home health agencies). This project was designed to provide an  		understanding of subacute care in select market areas. In addition to examining  		a variety of subacute care providers, patients, and payers (both public and  		private), the project identifies incentives and barriers to the provision of  		subacute care and reports the impact of subacute care as perceived by key  		stakeholders in targeted markets. The project also develops methodologies that  		can be used to assess the costs, savings, and quality of subacute care.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Site visits were conducted in four  		targeted market areas (selected in consultation with experts from the subacute  		care industry) to 19 institutional state-of-the-art, self-declared subacute  		care providers including hospital-based and freestanding skilled nursing  		facilities, rehabilitation hospitals and units, and long-term care hospitals.  		Telephone interviews were conducted with several home care agencies, and  		discussions were held with key stakeholders in the targeted markets. </p>
<p>Findings from the study indicate that subacute care has emerged as a  		result of Medicare payment policies (including hospital DRG payments and  		cost-based post-acute care payments that permit exceptions for other providers  		such as SNFs) and the pursuit of low cost, appropriate alternatives to hospital  		care by managed care payers. Much of what is labeled as subacute care appears  		to refer to patients previously identified as "high-end Medicare patients."  		Most subacute care providers in the study were implementing some but not all of  		the "ideal" characteristics of a subacute acute care program. Additional  		information is needed about the costs of and outcomes associated with subacute  		care before conclusions about its cost-effectiveness can be reached.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p67" id="p67">TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONALS  		CARING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Christopher DeGraw, George Washington University  		Center for Health Policy Research, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Because people with disabilities generally  		use more health care services than those without disabilities and more often  		require the use of a continuum of care which includes long-term care and  		supportive community services, effective health care for persons with  		disabilities requires the services of both health care and human service  		professionals. At a time when increasing numbers of disabled persons may be  		served by managed care programs, the ability of professionals to work in an  		interdisciplinary manner is important. The purpose of this project was to  		identify and describe particular programs where professionals and students in  		the health care and human service professions receive interdisciplinary  		instruction and practicum experience in the provision of care to people with  		disabilities. The project included a literature review, site visit reports, and  		a final report on interdisciplinary training in relation to care for people  		with disabilities.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  There is a growing consensus that  		meeting clients' needs cannot be accomplished effectively and efficiently by  		one discipline alone. While not every client with a disability may require  		assessment and service delivery by a team, professionals from a variety of  		disciplines will be increasingly called upon to work interactively. If training  		is one of the bases for quality managed care, managed care may be building on a  		precarious base as far as clients with disabilities are concerned.  		Interdisciplinary training programs are addressing managed care only  		peripherally, and managed care organizations (MCOs) have little appreciation  		for the specific knowledge, attitudes and skills needed by providers to  		appropriately serve people with disabilities. The final report recommends (1)  		promotion of opportunities for dialogue between MCOs and persons with  		disabilities, the professionals who serve them, and educators and trainers; (2)  		development of incentives to encourage pre-service and in-service  		interdisciplinary training; (3) support of research to investigate connections  		between interdisciplinary education and care and access, quality, and positive  		outcomes for people with disabilities; and (4) dissemination of information  		regarding interdisciplinary curricula and approaches, innovative use of  		community sites for training, how managed care can be infused in curricula, and  		sources of funding and support for interdisciplinary training.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The purpose of this grant is to assess how  		different organizational and financial characteristics of managed care  		organizations (as measured by physician and other provider payment methods,  		financial incentives, risk sharing, benefit package design, and management of  		referrals) affect health care use, functional status, families out-of-pocket  		expenses, and per capita expenditures for children with special health care  		needs. A total sample of 750 children will be included.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Preliminary data analysis compares  		families' out-of-pocket expenses for commercially insured special needs  		children enrolled in HMOs and Medicaid insured special needs children in  		fee-for-service arrangements. Children in the commercially insured program were  		in families with higher incomes and had higher functional status scores than  		the children covered by Medicaid. The commercially insured families incurred  		smaller out-of-pocket expenses in terms of both absolute amounts and percentage  		of family income than families of Medicaid fee-for-service enrollees. A  		detailed report is available.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p36" id="p36">IMPACT OF MANAGED CARE ON  		MEDICARE DISABLED BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE AGE OF 65</a></i></b>  		<i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Leonard Gruenberg, DataChron,  		Inc., Cambridge, MA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The overall purpose of this project is to  		learn more about utilization patterns, health status, access to care and  		patient satisfaction for disabled Medicare beneficiaries under age 65 in both  		the fee-for-service and managed care systems. The project is a collaborative  		effort of DataChron Health Systems, Inc., the Center for Health Research at  		Kaiser Permanente, and the Fallon Clinic. Data regarding utilization patterns  		of 2,300 under 65 disabled Medicare members of two TEFRA (risk) HMOs will be  		analyzed and compared with similar data regarding 2,000 disabled  		fee-for-service Medicare recipients who participated in the Medicare Current  		Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). This project will provide descriptive and  		comparative information about utilization, costs, patient characteristics,  		satisfaction and access in both TEFRA plans and fee-for-service arrangements  		for this population. In addition, this project will include an examination of  		the HMO casemix issues and of HMO costs for these populations.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The purpose of this study is to learn more  		about the effects of managed care on persons with disabilities. Specifically,  		this study will address questions in five areas: (1) In what ways, if any, do  		providers reorganize the delivery of care to persons with disabilities under  		managed care? (2) When given a choice between capitated HMOs and  		fee-for-service reimbursement, what subsets of people with disabilities are  		attracted to HMOs? (3) What are the effects of managed care on health care  		utilization and on health expenditures for persons with disabilities? (4) What  		are the effects of managed care on health outcomes and patient satisfaction?  		(5) What conditions, health care consumption patterns, or other indicators are  		particularly good markers of severe disability in working age adults and  		children? How can this information be used to construct reimbursement systems  		that encourage health plans to serve severely impaired subsets of persons with  		disabilities?</p>
<p>The research will be conducted in four widely different settings: (1)  		The Community Medical Alliance, a health plan in Massachusetts that was created  		to develop specialized delivery systems for a small number of Medicaid  		eligibles with end-stage AIDS and with severe physical disabilities; (2)  		Detroit and surrounding areas in Michigan, where over 30,000 SSI recipients are  		receiving care in full at-risk HMOs and another 90,000 SSI recipients are  		receiving care in a primary care case management model; (3) Health plans in  		Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio, that are centered around academic health centers;  		and (4) a health plan in central Missouri that is attempting to develop  		delivery systems that serve the needs of persons with disabilities in a rural  		setting.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  Investigators have completed a major  		refinement of a disability diagnostic classification system and applied the  		system to claims from multiple plans. Service utilization and diagnostic  		profile data from Michigan and Colorado have been analyzed.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This research project is focusing on: (1) the  		inclusion of people with disabilities in employer-based managed care, and (2)  		an ongoing synthesis of policy relevant research results on the impact of  		managed care on people with disabilities. </p>
<p>The employer-based study includes the following components: (1)  		methodology development to identify people with disabilities in databases  		constructed from private insurance claims; (2) cost and utilization analyses to  		determine the health care utilization patterns and care coordination of people  		with disabilities in private health care plans; (3) data on the impact of  		managed care on total health care costs; (4) risk adjustment methodologies used  		by employers to set rates with managed care plans; and (5) the employer-based  		study will examine issues related to the functional status of people with  		disabilities served in managed care plans (i.e., what functional data do  		employers collect? how do employers use this data to set rates? what types of  		outcome data do employers collect about persons with disabilities?, etc.)</p>
<p>In addition to the employer-based study, this project will attempt to  		synthesize ASPE-wide research related to managed care and people with  		disabilities with other similarly privately and publicly sponsored research.  		This synthesis will address some of the following questions: How does  		participation in managed care plans for people with disabilities vary by  		payment source, disability group, or geographic area? Are the health care needs  		of people with disabilities being met through managed care arrangements? What  		are financing arrangements that are most likely to lead to both consumer  		satisfaction and appropriate care management in managed care plans?</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  The investigators have developed a  		methodology to identify persons with disabilities through claims data in  		employer-based plans and have begun to identify potential employers willing to  		participate in the study.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  From 1989 to 1992, there was a 210% increase  		in Medicare expenditures for home health services. This increase in utilization  		has generated widespread policy interest in appropriate measures to control  		expenditures without compromising quality. Medicare home health has been the  		subject of considerable research, but the actual practice of home health care  		has not been extensively examined. This study will analyze "episodes" of care  		under the Medicare home health benefit, assess the actual practice of care, the  		extent to which there is variation in practice between acute and long-term  		patients, and the factors that account for that variation. This study will also  		examine decision-making processes between patients, providers and physicians.  		What takes place during a visit and between visits as "actual practice" has  		never been measured. Furthermore, the function of decision-making by various  		parties has not been observed in "actual practice." This effort to understand  		issues surrounding regional and practice variations of home health care  		delivery will aid the Department and the industry in combating fraud and abuse,  		as well as contribute valuable data to a future prospective payment system.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  The final research design is being  		developed. Actual recruitment of sites to the project will begin in January  		1997.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p47" id="p47">MANAGED DELIVERY SYSTEMS  		FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH DISABILITIES AND CHRONIC ILLNESS</a></i></b>  		<i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Craig Thornton, Mathematica  		Policy Research, Inc., Princeton, NJ</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The last decade has brought tremendous  		changes in the health care system as payers and providers struggle to bring  		health care expenditures under control. The momentum to achieve a reformed,  		more managed U.S. health care system, one which seeks to bring costs under  		control while improving access to, continuity and coordination of care, appears  		unstoppable. However, it remains unknown how this transforming health care  		system will affect the health and well-being of people with significant  		disability and chronic illness. <i> </i>For now, the Medicare program has  		lagged behind the private insurance market and even the Medicaid program in the  		proportion of its beneficiaries participating in managed care plans. In 1995,  		about 2.3 million older persons out of a total Medicare beneficiary population  		of 25 million were enrolled in the Medicare Risk Program implemented under  		TEFRA. There is little information on the experience of older persons with  		disabilities in these and other managed care plans. The purpose of this study  		is to address the characteristics of elderly persons with chronic illnesses and  		disability that need to be accommodated in designing and operating managed  		delivery systems (MDS), the issues that health care policy makers, plan  		administrators and providers need to consider in designing, operating, and  		monitoring MDS for the elderly with disabilities and chronic illness, how MDS  		actually perform in meeting the needs of the elderly disabled, and the factors  		that influence the success of MDS in meeting the needs of this population.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  This project began in Fall 1996. A  		Technical Advisory Group (TAS) was created and has met to provide advise and  		guidance on this project. TAG membership includes representatives from health  		plans, medical and nursing professions, experts in the needs of persons with  		chronic illnesses and disabilities, government officials with expertise in  		Medicare fee-for-service and managed care, and researchers with expertise in  		the disabled elderly and managed care.</p>

<h2><a name="home" id="home">II. HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AND PERSONAL  		ASSISTANCE SERVICES</a></h2>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>There is increasing recognition that people of all ages who have  		disabilities prefer to receive long-term care services in home and  		community-based settings. The projects listed in this section describe efforts  		to address estimates of the number of people potentially eligible for programs,  		issues regarding State and local administration of home and community-based  		services, the role of case management in home and community-based services, and  		consumer direction in acquiring and managing services. </p>
<p>To estimate the number of persons with disabilities conceivably eligible  		for home and community-based long-term care services, a project on the  		<b>Analysis of Eligibility Issues</b> examined national data to assess  		alternative measures of severity of impairment for use as eligibility criteria  		for services for various target populations. A follow-up project has taken a  		close look at the long-term care needs of individuals with mental illness.  		<b>People with Serious Mental Illness: How Do They Fit Into Long-Term Care</b>  		focused on how this population would use long-term care services and how  		eligibility criteria would be structured and operationalized.</p>
<p>"Personal assistance services" (PAS) is a broadly inclusive term used to  		refer to any and all forms of assistance that enable persons with disabilities  		to accomplish tasks that an individual would normally do himself or herself if  		he or she did not have a disability. In November 1994, DALTCP sponsored a  		planning meeting to identify high priority policy-relevant research questions  		related to PAS. The results of this workshop are available in the paper  		entitled <b><i>RESEARCH AGENDA: Personal Assistance Services and Related  		Supports</i></b> (described in this Section).</p>
<p>DALTCP is pursuing a major new initiative to study ways to expand  		consumer choice and empowerment in PAS. One major new study is evaluating  		<b>cash versus in-kind benefits</b> in the provision of Medicaid-funded PAS to  		the disabled. With co-sponsorship from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the  		demonstration and evaluation will involve the "cashing out" of Medicaid PAS  		services in two States. "Cashing out" of services is expected to save Medicaid  		monies, mainly by reducing State administrative costs.</p>
<p>Several other projects in the section concern consumer direction in home  		and consumer-based services including a <b>National Institute on Consumer  		Direction in Home and Community-Based Services</b>, a study of client-directed  		in-home care programs in California, and a project documenting approaches to  		implementing consumer-directed PAS.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p43" id="p43">KEY ASPECTS OF STATE/LOCAL  		ADMINISTRATION OF HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE SERVICES PROGRAMS</a></i></b>  		<i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Brina Melemed, National  		Association of Area Agencies on Aging, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This study examined some of the implications  		for States of block granting Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS).  		Five States (Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, and North Dakota) were  		selected for in-depth case studies of how they managed home and community-based  		service programs using uniform eligibility criteria and fixed funding.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The study highlighted the  		substantial variation in size, scope, and organizational features across States  		in home and community-based care. At the same time, most HCBS administrators  		indicated that they had considerable experience working within the constraints  		of capped funding levels because most of the funding sources they relied on  		involved fixed annual budgets. Indeed, they pointed out that, from a State  		perspective (that is, in regard to State matching fund requirements) the  		so-called "open-ended" entitlements such as Medicaid personal care tended to be  		treated as if they were fixed appropriations. Thus, most State and local  		officials interviewed felt that they would be able to meet the needs of  		beneficiaries under a capped HCBS benefit such as the one proposed in President  		Clinton's health care reform plan.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p42" id="p42">ISSUE PAPER AND EXPERT  		MEETING ON PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES AND RELATED SUPPORTS</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This paper provides background information on  		personal assistance services (on home and community-based services) and  		assistive devices for a working meeting of experts hosted by DALTCP to assist  		in shaping the Office's expanding agenda in disability research. Goals of the  		meeting, convened on November 10, 1994, were: to select high priority  		policy-relevant research topics; to define research strategies in the context  		of existing research, resources, and data; and to specify projects appropriate  		to ASPE. Our emphasis was on strategies that move toward a consumer-directed  		and generic (age and diagnosis neutral) system of personal assistance (PAS).  		The paper addresses the following topics: (1) need, use, and costs of PAS; (2)  		quality assurance and related issues of liability and risk; (3) paid and unpaid  		assistance; (4) cash payments to consumers in lieu of reimbursing providers  		directly; (5) assistive technology; and (6) service delivery system  		infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  At the meeting and in written  		comments, participants placed highest priority on research to measure service  		needs, use and costs; quality assurance; and infrastructure/implementation  		issues. For example, participants placed high priority on understanding  		patterns of expressed need and use of PAS and on need for a better  		understanding of agency costs. Participants also placed high priority on  		approaches to assuring quality using an independent provider or  		consumer-directed approach to PAS. The summary of the meeting also includes  		specific research projects for each of the topics discussed.</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Respond to States' needs for technical assistance to develop HCBS  			 programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of  			 various HCBS program components (assessment, care planning, service management,  			 provider selection, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synthesize and disseminate information about HCBS program and policy  			 strategies to States and communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance the ability of States and communities to respond to the  			 changing needs of the consumers of HCBS.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Two products were developed as a follow-up to the Expert Panel meeting.  		One is a summary of the meeting, along with a refined set of recommended  		strategies that could be undertaken in developing infrastructure capacity  		building. The second is the <i>Inventory of Research and Demonstration Projects  		on Consumer Direction in Home and Community-Based Care</i> funded by several  		Federal agencies and private foundations.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p56" id="p56">PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL  		ILLNESS: HOW DO THEY FIT INTO LONG-TERM CARE?</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Long-term services, which are needed by  		chronically disabled people to carry out activities of daily life, have  		traditionally been viewed as services for the elderly. However, increased  		attention has been given to other disabled populations who also need long-term  		services, such as individuals with mental retardation, developmental  		disabilities, and severe mental illness. In designing a program to provide  		long-term assistance, specifically in the home or the community. Issues arise  		in accurately defining the population needing services and identifying the  		benefits that different populations need.</p>
<p>The focus of this report was on how people with serious mental illness  		(SMI) would fit in the long-term service system, specifically in relation to  		eligibility criteria and benefits. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of  		establishing a long-term services program that provides benefits to individuals  		with SMI is dealing with the cyclical nature of mental illness, which can  		result in service needs that can change quickly and dramatically. Ensuring that  		a basic level of service is available to individuals with SMI when necessary,  		but that unnecessary services are not utilized, is a difficult balance to  		achieve and raises many policy questions regarding appropriate eligibility  		criteria and level of benefits.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The study highlights the inadequacy  		of currently available data and measures for estimating the size of the  		population of persons with serious mental illness in need of home and  		community-based long-term care. The study also underscores the differences  		between traditional "home care" programs for the elderly and disabled, which  		tend to focus on providing assistance with personal care and homemaking  		activities and home and community-based services for the seriously mentally  		ill, which tend to focus on psycho-social rehabilitation, including programs  		designed to increase the likelihood of clients' employability at some future  		point.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  As part of DALTCP's interest in home and  		community-based care, ASPE supported a two-year evaluation of the <i>Elderly  		Nutrition Program</i> (ENP). The program provides grants to State Agencies on  		Aging to support the provision of daily meals in either group or home settings  		to persons age 60 and older, specifically targeting elders who have the  		greatest economic and social need. The evaluation: (1) described the  		demographic, functional, health, and service-use characteristics of  		participants; (2) compared the characteristics of congregate meal and  		home-delivered meal program participants, and assessed how well the program is  		reaching special elderly populations, such as low income and minority elderly;  		(3) provided estimates of the impact of the program's nutritional components on  		the nutrition and social well-being of participants; (4) included a thorough  		"process" analysis of how the program is administered and operated, and the  		quality and effectiveness of those components; and (5) examines funding  		amounts, sources, and uses, and assesses the adequacy of funding. Data  		collection from nationally representative samples included: (a) telephone  		surveys of the 57 State Units on Aging, 350 Area Agencies on Aging, 100 Indian  		Tribal Organizations, and 200 Nutrition Projects; (b) in-person surveys of 200  		meal sites, 1,200 congregate meal participants and 800 home-delivered meal  		participants; and (c) in-person surveys of 600 nonparticipants eligible for the  		congregate meals program, and 400 nonparticipants eligible for the  		home-delivered meal program in areas served by nutrition projects.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Key findings of the evaluation  		include the following: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>People who receive ENP meals have higher daily intakes of key  			 nutrients than similar nonparticipants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ENP meals provide approximately 40%-50% of participants' daily  			 intakes of most nutrients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants have more social contacts per month than similar  			 nonparticipants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most participants are satisfied with the services the ENP provides.  			 </p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  DALTCP and AoA have jointly funded a new  		research, technical assistance and dissemination initiative designed to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Increase the awareness of people with disabilities (both the over 65  			 and under 65 populations) to exercise choice and control with regard to home  			 and community-based services, including the option to use independent providers  			 (rather than agency-employed workers) to furnish PAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate consumers or their representatives who want to use  			 independent providers about effective strategies for recruiting, training and  			 managing independent PAS providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate consumers, their representatives and program personnel  			 regarding consumer participation in care planning, on-site supervision of  			 agency-employed workers and ways to work with case managers and agency  			 personnel to modify care plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide information to States and communities to help them evaluate  			 the outcomes and costs of strategies involving consumer choice and  			 consumer-directed services, and to develop and implement cost effective  			 policies and programs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The initiative will be conducted by a newly developed National Institute  		on Consumer-Directed HCBS with special emphasis on adult disabled populations  		(over and under the age of 65).

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This project will employ a classical  		experimental research design (i.e., random assignment of participants to  		treatment and control groups) to test the effects of "cashing out"  		Medicaid-funded PAS for the disabled. The demonstration will include elderly as  		well as younger disabled consumers. Two States are expected to participate in  		the demonstration. In these States, control group members will receive  		"traditional" benefits--i.e., case managed home and community-based services,  		where payments for services are made to vendors--while treatment group members  		receive a monthly cash payment in an amount roughly equal to the cash value of  		the services they would have received under the traditional program. It is  		hypothesized that cash payments will foster greater client autonomy and that,  		as a result, consumer satisfaction will be greater. Consumers are expected to  		purchase a somewhat different mix of disability-related services and/or  		assistive technologies when they make the decisions and payments themselves  		than when case managers contract with vendors on their behalf. It is also  		hypothesized that States will save Medicaid monies (mostly in administrative  		expenses) from cashing out benefits. The analysis will consider the effects of  		the demonstration according to the varying characteristics of the consumers  		including age, disability, gender, family support, and other factors. The  		evaluation is being co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The  		evaluation subcontract has been awarded to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.,  		in Washington, DC; Barbara Phillips is the Principal Investigator.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  Arkansas and New York were selected  		from a pool of 17 States seeking to implement similar programs. These two  		States have received funds from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to carry out  		the demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This project develops approaches and  		solutions for implementing consumer-directed service models for the delivery of  		home and community-based PAS for persons with disabilities. It addresses issues  		arising from regulatory compliance requirements as well as issues concerning  		potential tort liability faced by payers, consumers, and providers of these  		services. Many of these issues were identified in previous research sponsored  		by this Office (Flanagan, 1994) and by the Retirement Research Foundation  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). Some of the tentative solutions proposed in that  		research will be explored in this project. Work on the current project is  		divided into three main activities: (1) case studies of up to twenty programs  		that use a variety of "intermediaries" (and the services these intermediaries  		provide) will be conducted to determine how the intermediary assists consumers  		and their providers to comply with tax, labor law, and other regulatory  		requirements, as well as supplying other supportive services (e.g., training,  		supervision) that serve the interests of consumer-employers, public and private  		payers and the providers themselves; (2) meetings with Federal officials (e.g.,  		IRS, DoL/FLSA and OSHA) to identify pertinent Federal tax and labor law and  		other legal requirements and to discuss clarification and streamlining of  		requirements arising from tax and labor regulations affecting PAS providers and  		consumers; and (3) development of up to three model contracts reflecting  		current Federal regulatory and other requirements in clear, simple and accurate  		terms for the benefit of all parties to these arrangements.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  All site visits have been completed,  		and a draft final report has been received and is currently being edited. The  		report identifies key administrative, organizational labor and tax issues that  		must be addressed by State program administrators as they develop  		consumer-directed PAS programs. The report also identifies and discusses  		strategies related to resolving those key issues.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>In 1994, DALTCP expanded its research efforts in the area of health and  		long-term supports for children and working age adults with disabilities. As a  		result of a grant announcement placed in the <i>Federal Register</i> in the  		spring, DALTCP funded seven grants to analyze existing data bases on various  		aspects of childhood disability. These projects range from an analysis of the  		Survey of Income and Program Participation on <b>Child Care and Children with  		Disabilities: Utilization, Costs and Family Labor Supply to Disabled Children  		and the AFDC and SSI Programs</b> to research into long-term care services, the  		Part H program, the use of medical services by children with disabilities, and  		functional disability definitions for children.</p>
<p>Some of DALTCP's work in other areas (e.g., health care and home and  		community-based services) related to children will be found in other sections  		of this inventory. For example, as reported in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1997/ResBook97.htm#managed">Section I</a>  		on Managed Care, DALTCP is supporting an initial inquiry into managed care  		arrangements that provide acute care (and, if possible, long-term care, too)  		for children with disabilities. DALTCP is also implementing or supporting a  		series of projects related to non-elderly adults with disabilities. As reported  		in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1997/ResBook97.htm#home">Section II</a> on Home and Community-Based Services, for the  		past several years we have supported research into personal assistance services  		(PAS). Projects are concerned with PAS clients, workers, and case managers as  		well as quality concerns and client and provider satisfaction.</p>
<p>Another project on adults, <b>An Exploratory Study of Barriers and  		Incentives to Labor Force Participation Among Persons with Significant  		Disabilities</b>, focused on barriers faced by people with disabilities who  		want to work, and how incentives and long-term supports can be structured to  		encourage people to work. A new project, co-sponsored with the Social Security  		Administration, will examine <b>Health Care Coverage and Employment of People  		with Disabilities</b>.</p>

This project examined this relationship; differences in cost and  		among small facilities (less than ten residents) were of special interest.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Results are based on data from the  		National Consumer Survey of Persons with mental retardation or other  		developmental disabilities (MR/DD) conducted by each State with a standard  		protocol as well as detailed analysis of two States--Connecticut and  		Pennsylvania. Overall, information from the National Consumer Survey indicate  		that generally people are more satisfied and better integrated in group homes  		with fewer than ten residents than in larger places. Data from the two States  		show that there appears to be more satisfaction in group homes with fewer than  		five residents. Cost data are mixed and more investigations need to be done.  		Larger group homes in Pennsylvania appear to cost less, while the opposite  		appears to be true in Connecticut.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Community supported living programs are a  		significant departure from traditional, continuum-based, developmental models  		of residential services for people with developmental disabilities. Several  		State mental retardation service systems, as well as national policy leaders  		have embraced supported living approaches, recognizing them as a vehicle to  		translate into reality the goals of independence, integration, and  		productivity. The Department encouraged the growth of these models in its home  		and community-based waiver program and in the "community supported living  		arrangements" (CSLA) Medicaid State plan option.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  This project took a closer look at  		how supported living programs work, identifying strengths and weaknesses of the  		approach. The project provided descriptions of five established community  		supported living programs for people with developmental disabilities. The  		project identified the elements of these programs that contribute to their  		success. In addition, national data on the strengths and weaknesses,  		cost-effectiveness and extent of the use of this model were collected and  		analyzed. The project staff worked with experts to develop a short and long  		range research agenda on community supported living services. The draft policy  		paper describes the programs that were visited, and outlines the policy issues  		in this new service modality. </p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p32" id="p32">FAMILIES WITH DISABILITIES  		IN THE UNITED STATES</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Mitchell LaPlante, University of California, San  		Francisco, CA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The purpose of the project was to determine  		how disability is clustered in families, the extent of clustering, and the  		characteristics of such families. Data came from the 1990 National Health  		Interview Survey.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Although much research has been done  		on individuals with disabilities, almost none had addressed disability in  		families. Using a broad definition of disability (any limitation in activity),  		20.3 million (29.2%) of all families have at least one disabled member.  		However, 13.7% of all individuals have a disability. The high family rate  		suggests that fewer people overall may be affected by disability (their own or  		a family member's) than previously expected. In general, since both disability  		and marriage are so highly associated with age, when one partner has a  		disability, the chance that the other partner also has a disability, is twice  		as high as expected. There are 3.4 million such families. For families with  		children, having a child with a disability is highly associated with poverty.  		Over half of single female-headed households with two or more children with  		disabilities are poor. The types of families which were analyzed (with and  		without children) included partnered families, male-headed families, and  		female-headed families. Characteristics included income, poverty, receipt of  		SSI and SSDI, race/ethnicity, education, and use of medical services.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  A growing consensus is emerging in the  		disability community that virtually all working age adults regardless of the  		severity of their disability should be assumed to be capable of work and have  		the opportunity to do so. The purpose of this project was to provide background  		information on barriers and incentives to improving the labor force  		participation of people with significant disabilities, particularly as related  		to HHS programs and policies. This exploratory study includes a concise review  		and synthesis of existing research on factors related to labor force  		participation by persons with disabilities and four analytical studies on  		special issues related to employment by persons with significant disabilities  		including: (1) the impact of disability on welfare reform strategies; (2) the  		role of PAS in the employability of persons with significant disabilities; (3)  		the use of assistive devices in increasing employment opportunities; and (4)  		comprehensive approaches and program models designed to coordinate or integrate  		the economic, health, vocational, and continuing support needs of working  		persons with significant disabilities.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The chapters of the report delineate  		the conceptual framework within which the research literature on labor force  		participation by people with disabilities is reviewed; review, in detail, the  		literature on the labor market for people with disabilities spelling out the  		strengths and limitations of each study; provide what information there is  		about the use of PAS and assistive technology by workers with disabilities;  		consider how welfare reform strategies affect people with disabilities by  		reviewing research literature and reporting on interviews with administrators  		of welfare programs; and describes four comprehensive employment-oriented  		services for people with disabilities. The report ends with numerous  		recommendations for further research on each of these topics. The results of  		the study are available in a summary as well as a full-length (300 page)  		report.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p13" id="p13">CHILDRENS DISABILITY  		RESEARCH ISSUES</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Charles Johnson, Texas Engineering Experiment  		Station, College Station, TX</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This project examined the costs, incentives,  		and outcomes for families, communities, and government for institutional care  		versus community care for children with disabilities. This study is based on  		data from a 1995 telephone survey of parents of medically fragile children in  		Texas. The study compared 197 medically fragile children under 21 in Texas  		nursing facilities, 576 medically fragile children receiving services at home  		through the Medically Dependent Children Program (MDCP), and 529 children on  		the MDCP waiting list (approximately 85% of children on the waiting list are  		eventually found to qualify for the MDCP program). Children in the MDCP program  		require at least four hours of skilled nursing care per week.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Study findings include the  		following: Families of medically fragile children with health insurance, either  		public or private, enjoy relatively comprehensive coverage while the uninsured  		have greater difficulty getting treatment. The majority of uninsured children  		have problems finding a pediatrician or other doctor to treat their special  		needs. Half of Medicaid recipients have a difficult time finding doctors to  		accept Medicaid payments. Children with private insurance are least likely to  		have trouble finding providers. Compared to the other two insurance groups,  		Medicaid recipients were more likely to report that services were well  		coordinated. However, parents providing in-home care were significantly more  		likely to view the service system as complex compared to those with children in  		nursing facilities. Families of uninsured children are more likely to delay  		care until high-cost emergency services are required. The majority of parents  		surveyed were pleased with their child's care, however, those with medically  		fragile children at home were significantly less likely to be "extremely"  		satisfied compared to those with children in institutions. Private insurance  		companies are much more likely to finance some of the costs of care if children  		remain in the community. Parents expressed a need for more information when  		faced with decisions about where to provide care: more information about  		available programs and services; how to meet qualifying criteria; how to get  		needed equipment; where to go for support groups or training. Parents also  		reported the need for various services including respite, home modification,  		and equipment.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This project examined the interaction of  		children with disabilities and public assistance programs, specifically: (1)  		factors responsible for the rapid growth in the SSI rolls especially  		transitions from AFDC to SSI; (2) impact of care for a disabled child on the  		labor force participation, welfare receipt and earnings in AFDC families; and  		(3) additional costs for low income families with disabled children. The data  		base for this study was Wave II of the California AFDC Household Survey, a  		stratified random sample of 15,000 recipient households selected from four  		counties in November 1992. The project analyzed information from the first  		1,320 households randomly selected from the larger survey.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Among the study's findings are the  		following: Over 40% of households had either a disabled mother or at least one  		child with special needs--30% of the mothers indicated that they had a physical  		or mental disability which limited their ability to work; 21% report the  		presence of at least one child with a chronic health problem or disability.  		Respiratory diseases, especially asthma, were the most common chronic condition  		for children in AFDC, affecting 5.7% of children. Behavior and learning  		problems together formed the next most common category (2%); 0.7% were affected  		by other chronic diseases or physical impairments. In terms of severity, most  		conditions were mild to moderate; however, 44% of children's conditions were  		severe because the child required substantial help with daily activities, the  		condition interfered with the child's attendance at school, or the child  		received SSI. Eleven percent of all families cared for at least one child with  		a severe disability or illness; 7% of families received SSI for their children.  		Five percent of families were caring for more than one child with chronic  		conditions. Half of the families with one or more special needs children had  		average out-of- pocket expenses related to the child(ren)'s needs in the  		previous month. Expenses averaged approximately $131 with a range from $6.00 to  		$665. Expenditures were for medical care and medications that were not covered  		by insurance, special child care arrangements, and special food and diets.  		Mothers of special needs children were less likely to be working.  		Three-quarters of the families who received SSI still had incomes at or below  		125% of poverty.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The goal of this project was to better  		identify what services are provided children under age 3 with severe  		disabilities, how the services are financed, and how diagnosis, socio-economic  		status, place of residence and other factors determine receipt of services.  		Data come from a statewide data system of The Early Intervention System (TEIS)  		and data of its nine regional offices. Data were available for two fiscal years  		1992-93 and 1993-94. The fact that Tennessee has enacted a statewide health  		reform using managed care is an important context for the study. Data analyses  		will address the following questions: (1) service utilization of children with  		disabilities; (2) service mix; (3) costs for services; (4) service combinations  		and related outcomes; (5) reimbursement patterns; and (6) the influence of  		managed care on reimbursement patterns.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Findings from the study include the  		following: Tennessee administers the Part H program through nine district  		offices staffed by professionals from among early childhood education, clinical  		psychology, occupational therapy, speech/language therapy, pediatrics, and  		early childhood development. Each office has service coordinators who make  		family visits, help obtain evaluations, help families determine eligibility for  		various programs, help identify appropriate services, organize IFSP meetings,  		develop IFSPs, and help monitor services. The project reviewed 550 case files.  		Of the sample chosen, 20% were diagnosed with congenital defects such as Down's  		Syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and other congenital conditions.  		Forty-one percent were diagnosed with developmental delays including delays in  		speech, language, or feeding; autism; and other delays. Twenty percent were  		diagnosed with prematurity. Boys were more prevalent than girls in all  		categories. The majority of children with congenital defects and prematurity  		were taken into the program before age 18 months while the majority of those  		with developmental delays were taken in at age 2 years and older.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The objective of this project was to describe  		demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and services for all children and  		adolescents who are identified as having a disability in Illinois, as well as  		to understand the stability of the care that they receive through childhood and  		adolescence. Specifically, their goals were to: (1) describe the trends in  		demographic characteristics of the disabled child population in Illinois; (2)  		examine the extent to which socioeconomic characteristics are related to  		children's disabilities; (3) describe the pattern of multi-service use of  		disabled children; (4) describe the pattern of movement and stability of care  		of disabled children across different service settings; (5) demonstrate the  		utility of administrative data for advancing the state of knowledge of children  		with disabilities; and (6) determine the policy implications of these findings.  		The project follows both birth cohorts and cohorts of children with newly  		identified handicaps from the late 1980s through the present. This project also  		studies the population of disabled children and youth for each year from 1987  		to 1994. The children will be tracked using the Integrated Database on  		Children's Services in Illinois.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The study is based on an integrated  		database on all children in Illinois identified as having a disability by the  		Department of Public Aid, the State Board of Education, the Department of  		Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, and Medicaid reimbursement files  		between 1989 and 1994. Some of the major findings include the following: the  		overall number of children identified as being disabled increased by 7% between  		FY 1990 and FY 1994. In FY 1994, 8% of all children in Illinois were identified  		as disabled from the combination of data sources. The number of children  		receiving SSI increased from 12,184 in FY 1990 to 43,941 in FY 1994. The  		percentage of SSI children in special education decreased from 51% to 42%  		between FY 1990 and FY 1994. In each fiscal year, the majority of the children  		participating in both special education and SSI were mentally retarded. Over  		time, learning disabled and severely emotionally disturbed children were  		increasingly likely to participate in SSI and special education at the same  		time. In FY 1994, the majority of children participating in Medicaid reimbursed  		services and either special education or SSI were being treated for mental  		disorders. In each of the fiscal years, boys were more likely than girls to  		have been identified as disabled.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The goal of the project was to know more  		about rates of services use (especially the use of case management services),  		costs, or patterns of services received over time for children receiving SSI  		benefits compared to children with similar conditions who are not receiving SSI  		payments. The project seeks to examine the use and cost of medical services for  		approximately 30,000 children with serious ongoing physical health conditions  		under age 18 enrolled in the Washington State Medicaid program who had a  		medical encounter in 1992 or 1993. The project intended to describe: (1) number  		and type of encounters and services received over a two year period; (2) actual  		costs of these services; and (3) longitudinal patterns of services received.  		Data are presented for children with and without chronic conditions and by age,  		gender, racial and eligibility categories (e.g., SSI, AFDC).</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  This study is based on 1993 Medicaid  		claims data from the Washington State Medical Assistance program for all  		children 18 and under. The study focused on children with at least one of ten  		chronic conditions--asthma, chronic respiratory disease, cerebral palsy,  		epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, mental retardation, muscular dystrophy, spina  		bifida, and cystic fibrosis. Data from the study can be used to plan health  		care services. Findings from the study include the following: 8% of the total  		sample of children were identified as having at least one of the conditions.  		They represent 34% of the total expenditures. Average costs per child with the  		selected conditions ranged from approximately $3,000 to $37,000, depending on  		the condition. Asthma had the second lowest mean cost among the conditions, but  		accounted for the highest total expenditure because of its significantly higher  		prevalence (46/1000 compared to 4.2/1000 for diabetes, for instance). The  		average cost per child who had at least one of these conditions is over six  		times greater than the average cost per children without one of the conditions.  		Payments for home health care ranged from 4.4 to 116 times higher for  		chronically ill children than payments for the average child.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  There is no simple way to define and identify  		children with disabilities. Different ways of identification for program  		purposes can lead to vast differences in how many and which children are  		identified. Three different ways of measuring functional disability were used  		in three data sets. The three different measures were: (1) functional measures  		based on the children's section of the 1994/96 National Health Interview Survey  		on Disability; (2) compensatory dependency or accommodations (i.e., dependency  		on medications, special diet, technology, assistive devices, and personal  		assistance); and (3) service use beyond routine care (medical, educational,  		psychological, related services above the usual given the child's age, need).  		The three data sets included: (1) a telephone survey of 1,200 children in the  		Bronx; (2) a telephone survey of a national sample of 1,350 children; and (3) a  		sample of 1,200 children in Arizona.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The purpose of this project is to consider  		the long-term care needs of people with HIV/AIDS (PWAs) and efficient and  		effective approaches for financing, organizing, and delivering long-term care  		services to this population. Specifically, the project will consider the  		appropriate role of home and community-based services (HCBS) in meeting the  		health care needs of PWAs in an effective and efficient manner, the estimated  		demand for HCBS and factors likely to influence demand, and the strengths and  		limitations of various approaches to organizing, paying for, and delivering  		HCBS services to PWAs. The project includes two major components: (1) 5-7 case  		studies of community-based HIV/AIDS programs providing HCBS and (2) analysis of  		data on health care service use and expenditures of PWAs enrolled in Medicaid  		in Maryland and New Jersey, which maintain statewide Medicaid data bases that  		are linked to HIV/AIDS registries.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  A literature review has been  		received and is presently being reviewed.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="resident" id="resident">IV. RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS</a></h2>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the frail elderly prefer to remain in their own homes  		rather than moving to a nursing home. However, in many cases, they are unable  		to receive the needed support in their own homes yet do not require skilled  		nursing in an institutional setting. As a consequence, community-based  		residential care models have emerged as a significant long-term care option.  		Residential care models are designed to enable the frail elderly and other  		persons with disabilities to receive personal care and other supportive  		services in a homelike environment. Over the past decade, DALTCP has been  		examining systematically various residential care models from a variety of  		perspectives. This body of research provides insight into the role of  		residential care models in the long-term care system; the appropriateness of  		such care arrangements for subgroups of the frail elderly population; and the  		quality, costs, and financing of care in residential care facilities. </p>
<p>One prominent residential care model is board and care. In 1991, ASPE  		funding was used to augment the <b>National Health Provider Inventory  		(NHPI)</b>, sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics. The 1991  		NHPI was used to develop a national inventory of nursing homes, home health  		agencies, and hospices. ASPE funds made possible for the first time the  		inclusion of licensed board and care homes in the inventory. As a result, there  		are now basic national data on the number and characteristics of licensed board  		and care homes as well as the characteristics of their resident populations.  		</p>
<p>ASPE also sponsored a landmark <b>Analysis and Comparison of State Board  		and Care Regulations and the Effect of Regulation on the Quality of Care in  		Board and Care Homes</b>. The project described the characteristics of the  		board and care industry in ten States and examined the quality of care in board  		and care homes, how it varies across States and between licensed and unlicensed  		homes, and the role of regulation in affecting quality of care outcomes. </p>
<p>Assisted living has grown in popularity as a residential care model. In  		1991, ASPE sponsored a <b>Policy Synthesis on Assisted Living for the Frail  		Elderly</b>, a review of the literature on a range of policy-relevant topics in  		assisted living (e.g., size and growth of the industry, public and private  		financing, role of regulation). More recently ASPE commissioned a <b>National  		Study of Assisted Living</b>, which will analyze the role of assisted living  		from the perspective of consumers, owners and operators, workers, regulators,  		investors, and other stakeholders. </p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p58" id="p58">POLICY SYNTHESIS ON  		ASSISTED LIVING</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Barbara B. Manard, Lewin-VHI, Inc., Fairfax,  		VA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The purpose of the project was to: (1)  		examine the range of housing and service options available to the frail  		elderly; (2) identify critical public policy issues in the financing, delivery,  		and appropriateness of supportive housing alternatives; and (3) assist ASPE in  		developing a policy-relevant research agenda in supportive housing. The report  		identifies a series of policy-relevant questions on public and private  		financing of assisted living, regulatory concerns, quality of care and  		appropriateness for special populations; e.g., persons with Alzheimer's Disease  		or related dementias.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Eligibility for assisted living is  		based on three factors: age, income and functional capacity. Important outcomes  		for assisted living include life satisfaction, nursing home placement,  		functional capacity and caregiver satisfaction. Public programs have played a  		limited role in financing the development of assisted living but this has begun  		to change in a number of States. The report lays out an agenda for further data  		collection and research in assisted living.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p2" id="p2">ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF  		STATE BOARD AND CARE REGULATIONS AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE QUALITY OF CARE IN  		BOARD AND CARE HOMES</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Catherine Hawes, Research Triangle Institute,  		Research Triangle, NC</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The primary objectives of this project were:  		(1) to determine the quality of care in board and care homes, and how it varies  		across States and programs and between licensed and unlicensed homes, and (2)  		to examine the effect of State regulations on the quality of care in board and  		care homes. To accomplish these objectives the project: (1) identified and  		examined the factors associated with differences in quality, with particular  		emphasis on the effect of regulation; (2) described generally the regulatory  		systems in 50 States and described in detail the systems in the ten study  		States; (3) described the key characteristics of the board and care industry in  		the study sample--the homes, the owners/operators, the staff, the residents,  		and the care and services that residents receive; and (4) compared the  		performance of licensed and unlicensed board and care homes. Data were  		collected from 600 board and care homes, including 600 operators and 900 staff,  		and from 3,780 residents.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The study found that board and care  		residents are significantly older and more frail than was true a decade ago.  		The mix of physically frail and cognitively impaired elderly, and residents  		with mental illness and developmental disabilities presents a complex  		caregiving challenge. The study found several factors that suggest that  		appropriate regulations and licensure requirements result in homes that are  		better prepared to cope with this challenge. These include: (1) greater  		availability of supportive services in licensed homes; (2) greater operator  		training in the care of the elderly and disabled; and (3) lower use of  		psychotropic drugs and medications contraindicated for use in the elderly in  		homes in extensively regulated States. The study also found that licensed homes  		were more likely to have in place a wider array of the safety features and  		supportive devices considered important to the well-being of residents.</p>
<p>The project also describes the utilization of Medicare services by this  		population, and models Medicare use and costs as a function of resident,  		facility, and regional characteristics. The research also compared the use of  		specific Medicare services by the board and care population with the use of  		these services among a nursing home population. This portion of the research  		will use data on approximately 1,300 board and care residents in ten States and  		2,000 nursing home residents in ten States.</p>

Kane, University  		of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN      Barbara B.  		Manard, Lewin-VHI, Inc., Fairfax, VA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  "Assisted living" refers to residential  		settings for people with disabilities which combine both housing and personal  		assistance services within a homelike or noninstitutional environment. The  		number of assisted facilities nationally is not known; estimates range from  		8,000 to 30,000. Similarly, estimates for the number of frail elderly and other  		persons residing in such facilities range from 350,000 to 1,000,000. This study  		will, among other things, generate a more reliable estimate of the number of  		these facilities and their residents. As assisted living options multiply, a  		challenge facing the Federal and State Governments is how to regulate such  		arrangements, balancing consumer protection concerns (especially if public  		funds reimburse costs) with resident rights for self-direction, taking risks  		and maintaining accustomed lifestyles.</p>
<p>The major purpose of this project is to analyze the role of assisted  		living within the current long-term care system from the perspective of  		consumers, owners/operators, workers, regulators, investors and other  		stakeholders, and to issue a report on its current status and future  		directions. The study will address several broad policy-relevant issues,  		including supply and demand trends; barriers; how closely practice parallels  		philosophy; the impact of key features on outcomes; and quality and  		accountability. The contractor will assist HHS and other Federal agencies in  		the formulation of regulatory and financing policy options for assisted living.  		A Technical Advisory Group has been established to provide guidance to the  		contractor.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Long-term care financing issues and the modeling of long-term care  		expenditures remain a key component of ASPE's long-term care research agenda. A  		major contribution to our cost estimating capacity is the <b>Long-Term Care  		Financing Model</b> which uses national survey data to simulate the utilization  		and financing of long-term care services by the elderly--both nursing home and  		home care--through the year 2020. The model is being updated to incorporate the  		results of recent surveys of disability, nursing home and home care  		utilization. Economic assumptions are being updated and the projection will  		extend to 2030.</p>
<p>Other projects have considered how Medicaid pays for long-term care  		services including the extent to which <b>Medicaid asset spend-down</b> occurs  		and the effects of <b>catastrophic acute and long-term care costs</b>. One  		analyzes data on use of nursing homes in Florida. Although many people enter  		nursing homes, eventually spend-down their assets, and become eligible for  		Medicaid, it is difficult to accurately estimate how often this occurs using  		existing data sets. Because some elderly people enter nursing homes more than  		once, it is essential to have longitudinal data over many years to study their  		lifetime financing pattern. The Florida Nursing Home Reporting System has such  		data available for analysis. These data will be merged with Medicare and  		Medicaid data which will permit studies of the combined burden of acute and  		long-term care financing.</p>
<p>New efforts are underway to estimate the impact of various reforms on  		children with disabilities and the working age disabled population. Another new  		project, <b>Health and Long-Term Care Expenditure Patterns of Children with  		Disabilities</b>, is examining two large claims data sets to gather information  		on the number of children with disabilities and their service use and  		expenditures. </p>
<p>How private long-term care insurance plays a part in the financing of  		long-term care is the focus of other projects. As of 1995, over 3.5 million  		private long-term care insurance policies have been sold and sales have  		increased, on average, about 20% each year for the past ten years. Most experts  		agree that long-term care insurance products must include both nursing home and  		home care if they are to be commercially acceptable. One new study,  		<b>Assessment of Home Care Benefits Used by Holders of Private Long-Term Care  		Insurance</b>, will collect detailed information on the experience of long-term  		care policy holders who have filed insurance claims to receive home care  		benefits and how their formal and informal service use compares to a comparable  		population of elderly persons without private insurance. A related project will  		organize a small seminar involving the Federal Office of Personnel Management  		and other Federal officials and selected State personnel who have implemented a  		public long-term care benefit for State employees. To encourage the formation  		of a Federal planning process to explore adding long-term care benefits to the  		Federal employees insurance plan or the Federal retirement program. </p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p46" id="p46">LONG-TERM CARE  		MICROSIMULATIONS MODEL</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  David Kennell, Lewin-VHI, Inc., Fairfax, VA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  ASPE uses the Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care  		Financing Model to simulate the utilization and costs of nursing home and home  		care by impaired elderly persons for the period 1986-2020. The model has been  		updated to include the results of the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey and  		the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey. The long-term care model begins with a  		nationally-representative sample of the adult population generated from the  		pension and retirement income model (PRISM) developed by ICF, Inc. These data  		include age, sex, marital status, labor force participation, income, assets,  		and other characteristics. The model then simulates changes in the population  		each year, including changes in each individual's economic status, disability  		status, utilization of long-term care, and methods of paying for care.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Two reports developed from this  		project describe the model and the simulations which have been performed with  		it. <i>Model Assumptions</i> provides pertinent details about the variables,  		data, and equations on which the model is based.<i> Designing and Using Model  		Simulations</i> presents a base case projection which assumes that current  		public programs and private financing remain unchanged. In addition, the report  		contains simulations of various measures to promote the growth of private  		long-term care insurance and to expand/create public programs.</p>
<p>The Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model is available to  		interested researchers. However, access to a mainframe computer and significant  		amounts of computer time are required. The computer tape containing the code of  		the model and associated input data can be purchased through NTIS. Two volumes  		of documentation have been prepared for those who have a serious interest in  		learning how to use the model. The <i>User's Guide to Specifying  		Simulations</i> discusses the parameters of the model and provides examples of  		how these parameters can be changed to simulate alternative scenarios of the  		utilization and financing of nursing home and home care by elderly persons for  		the period 1986-2020. The <i>Programmer's/Operator's Manual</i> provides  		additional information on the structure of the computer program.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p66" id="p66">SYNTHESIS OF MEDICAID  		SPEND-DOWN STUDIES</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Brian Burwell, MEDSTAT Group, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Medicaid spend-down is a topic of  		considerable interest in long-term care policy because it is an indication of  		the catastrophic impact of long-term care expenses on the economic status of  		disabled elderly persons. This paper provides an overview of research on  		Medicaid spend-down in nursing homes. It addresses major conceptual,  		methodological, and measurement issues, and provides a synthesis of findings.  		Implications for long-term care policy and directions for future research are  		discussed.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The report concludes that between  		one-in-four and one-in-five persons enter nursing homes as private pays and  		spend-down to Medicaid eligibility. The report also concludes that more  		longitudinal data bases are needed to determine whether the research results  		apply to other States. More information is also needed on the process of  		spend-down; e.g., do the elderly liquidate their home equity to pay for care,  		do they transfer assets to children?</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p33" id="p33">HEALTH AND LONG-TERM CARE  		EXPENDITURE PATTERNS OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Bill Crown, MEDSTAT Group, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Because childhood disability is relatively  		rare, most surveys and data sets have relatively little information on the  		number of children with disabilities, their service use and expenditures. This  		project examines two very large claims data sets which are likely to contain a  		significant number of children with disabilities. The first of these comes from  		the Medicaid Tape-to-Tape Project, and contains claims and enrollment data for  		every child covered by Medicaid in 1992 in selected States. The second comes  		from the MEDSTAT Market Scan data, and contains claims information from  		numerous employer-based private health insurance plans throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Using diagnosis codes and other criteria, an attempt will be made to  		identify all children in the data set with severe disabilities. Data on the  		amounts and types of services that they use will be tabulated. Every child who  		receives Medicaid services will be included in the study, not just those who  		receive Medicaid coverage through SSI.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  The Medicaid tape-to-tape data have  		been merged with information on principal disabling conditions, for those who  		receive Medicaid due to SSI enrollment. Initial analyses are nearly  		completed.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p3" id="p3">ANALYSIS OF DATA ON USE OF  		NURSING HOMES IN FLORIDA</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Brian Burwell, MEDSTAT Group, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Many people who enter nursing homes  		eventually spend-down their assets and become eligible for Medicaid. However,  		it has been difficult to estimate how often this occurs. Because some elderly  		people enter nursing homes more than once before they die, it is essential to  		have longitudinal data over many years to study their financing pattern. Only a  		few such data sets are available. Previous ASPE projects have utilized  		longitudinal data from the State of Connecticut on nursing home use. This  		project utilizes the Florida Nursing Home Reporting System, which contains data  		on all nursing home residents since 1986. Medicare and Medicaid data have been  		merged with the nursing home data. In addition to Medicaid spend-down issues,  		this project will study the use of hospital and home health services by persons  		who at some point also use nursing homes. This merged data base will permit  		studies of the combined burden of acute and long-term care financing, as well  		as studies of specific subgroups of persons; e.g., those who have hip  		fractures.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  The Florida Nursing Home Registry  		data, Medicaid data, and Medicare data have been merged, and the initial  		analyses have begun.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This five-year project will update and expand  		the capability of the Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model, which takes  		a national sample of persons, ages them over time, and estimates their  		long-term care use and financing when they become elderly. It will incorporate  		results from recent surveys of nursing homes and home care utilization; e.g.,  		the 1989 and 1994 National Long-Term Care Surveys. The model will be expanded  		to include acute care expenditures, and the period of simulation will be  		extended to 2030. The economic assumptions will be updated.</p>
<p>The model will continue to be used to project future trends and to  		perform policy simulations, including expanded coverage for nursing home and  		home care, changes in Medicaid eligibility and services, and private long-term  		care insurance.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  Work to date has concentrated on the  		conversion of the model's computer program from the mainframe computer to the  		personal computer. In addition, the 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey, the  		Medicare Current Beneficiary Surveys, and other data are being analyzed in  		order to revise the disability and home care use portions of the model.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Most experts agree that long-term care  		insurance products must include both nursing home and home care benefits if  		they are to be commercially acceptable. Yet private insurers as well as public  		payers are concerned about their ability to control home care claims,  		particularly given the potential substitution of formal home care services for  		care provided by families. The purpose of this study is to collect detailed  		information on the experience of long-term care policy holders who have filed  		insurance claims to receive home care benefits and how their formal and  		informal service use compares to a comparable population of elderly persons  		without private insurance. Primary data collection will involve face-to-face  		interviews with approximately 1,000 persons (500 disabled insurance claimants  		and 500 next-of-kin of those claimants) to collect information on functional  		and medical characteristics of claimants as well as formal and informal  		services use. The sample of claimants will be drawn from the files of insurance  		companies that account for the majority of private long-term care policies now  		in force.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>DALTCP has a longstanding commitment to improving basic data on  		disability, aging, and long-term care. Typically, ASPE works with other HHS  		agencies to augment planned or existing surveys. In particular, ASPE's staff  		expertise and funding are used to: (a) fill gaps in planned data collection  		activities; (b) make sure that surveys contain policy relevant questions; (c)  		make sure that samples are of sufficient size to represent small but  		policy-significant populations (e.g., mentally retarded and developmentally  		disabled persons); and (d) help set priorities for data analysis.</p>
<p>One of the most significant activities currently underway is the  		<b>1994/1996 National Health Interview Survey on Disability</b>. DALTCP staff  		were responsible for coordinating, planning, developing, and identifying  		sources of support for this Survey. For the first time ever, the resulting  		analyses will provide detailed information on the prevalence and  		characteristics of children, working age adults, and elderly Americans with  		disabilities; how they live, work, and go to school; health care utilization,  		income, assets, participation in Federal programs, and health insurance; and  		nonmedical services, including frequency of use, sources of payment, and  		out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p>Another project, <b>Americans with Disabilities</b>, provided funds to  		the Census Bureau to analyze the 1990 Census questions on disability. This  		project served as a much needed national baseline on people with disabilities  		and will be the only source of State and county level data on disability.</p>
<p>DALTCP provided support to the University of Michigan's Institute for  		Social Research, for the <b>Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old  		Survey</b> (AHEAD). This survey provides important information on the health,  		wealth, functional capacity, and service use of the population over age 70.</p>
<p>DALTCP has continued its support of the <b>National Long-Term Care  		Survey</b> (NLTCS), the major source of information on the frail elderly. For  		the 1994 NLTCS, support from DALTCP enabled the survey to include information  		on nutritional status of the elderly and plans for a next-of-kin survey. ASPE  		serves as cosponsor for the <b>1993 National Mortality Followback Survey</b>,  		sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics, and adds support to the  		<b>National Survey of Special Care Units in Nursing Homes</b>.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p40" id="p40">ISSUE PAPER AND EXPERT  		MEETING ON DISABILITY DATA</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  In early 1995, several major policy  		initiatives on persons with disabilities of all ages facing the Department  		included: (1) the comprehensive Review of Disability Policy initiated by the  		White House; (2) scrutiny of public benefits for children with disabilities and  		the newly-established Commission on Childhood Disability; (3) the national  		health reform debate and the aftermath of that debate; (4) State or private  		health and long-term care reform initiatives; and (5) welfare reform. To  		address the data needs on disability, DALTCP organized an invitational meeting  		of experts in March 1995 to advise DALTCP on its disability research agenda.  		The meeting focused on: (1) assessment of available data sets pertaining to  		persons with disabilities; (2) identifying usable State, area, and private data  		bases including data from large-scale demonstrations; (3) specifying next steps  		in accessing and analyzing available disability data; and (4) discussing a  		minimum set of disability-related variables for inclusion in surveys.</p>
<p>A background paper on disability data was prepared to inform discussion  		at the meeting. The paper discusses policy issues and available data related to  		several populations of persons with disabilities: working age adults, children,  		persons age 65 and older, and special populations (e.g., persons with  		developmental disabilities, persons with mental illness). An appendix contains  		one-page summaries of national data sets including household and person-based  		surveys, provider-based data sets, and administrative data for Federal benefit  		programs.</p>

Soldo, Georgetown University, Washington, DC  		     Regula A. Herzog, University of Michigan, Ann  		Arbor, MI</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  For health and long-term care reform  		initiatives, it is important to have current estimates of the health, wealth,  		functional capacity and service use of the elderly. In 1993, the National  		Institute on Aging awarded a two year cooperative agreement to the University  		of Michigan's Institute for Social Research to carry out the Asset and Health  		Dynamics of the Oldest Old Survey (AHEAD). This award was a supplement to a  		five year cooperative agreement to conduct the Health and Retirement Survey  		(HRS). AHEAD yielded current nationally representative information on the  		elderly aged 70+. It is particularly strong in the areas of income and assets,  		health status, physical and cognitive functioning, and service use.</p>
<p>There are plans to link the AHEAD data to Medicare files, National Death  		Index and, possibly, State Medicaid files. Among other things, the survey sheds  		light on estimates of the number of cognitively impaired elderly, Medicaid  		spend-down patterns, and intergenerational transfers.</p>
<p>ASPE funds were used for three purposes: (1) Maintain the necessary  		sample size for the survey. (2) Support of an early results workshop using  		preliminary AHEAD data. Over 20 papers on a variety of issues were presented at  		the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, September 21-22,  		1994. (3) Preparation of AHEAD data runs on issues pertaining to health care  		reform and other policy-relevant issues.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  An Early Results Workshop was held  		on September 21-22, 1994.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This project provided funds to the Census  		Bureau to analyze the 1990 Decennial Census questions on disability, in which  		data were collected for the population 16 and over on several types of  		disability--limitations in work, ability to work, mobility limitations, and  		self-care limitations. The tabulations are the only source of disability data  		for States, counties and metropolitan statistical areas, and the only source  		which includes persons with disabilities residing both in the community and in  		all types of institutions. The information serves as a national baseline. As  		such, the data will be useful for virtually every aspect of disability policy  		and for portions of health care reform and welfare reform which pertain to  		people with disabilities.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Results from this joint ASPE/Census  		Bureau project are now available on the Internet. Results are presented in  		tables, graphs, and maps. Tables for States, counties, and metropolitan  		statistical areas contain information by disability status and type of  		disability on a variety of characteristics including employment and labor force  		status, education, income, poverty, marital status, race and ethnicity.  		Separate tables are available for the elderly and nonelderly. In addition,  		national disability estimates from two other Census surveys: the Survey of  		Income and Program Participation and the Current Population Survey are  		presented.

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This report presents information on the size,  		characteristics, and prevalence of disability among American children. Data  		primarily come from the 1990 Survey of Income and Program Participation,  		supplemented by the 1990 Decennial Census.</p>
<p>The report contains basic counts of children with disabilities who live  		in the community and who reside in institutions. Comparisons are made between  		children in the community with and without disabilities in terms of age,  		gender, race/ethnicity, family characteristics, income, poverty, health  		insurance, and participation in AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. Information on  		the leading causes of childhood disability is also presented.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p18" id="p18">CONDITIONS AND IMPAIRMENTS  		AMONG THE WORKING AGE POPULATION WITH DISABILITIES</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This report presents descriptive information  		on a wide range of characteristics of the civilian noninstitutionalized working  		age (18-64) population with disabilities. Basic demographic and socio-economic  		characteristics were related to ten major health conditions and functional  		impairments including mental illness, mental retardation and other  		developmental disabilities, visual impairments, hearing impairments, spinal  		cord injury, heart disease, arthritis, bad back, cancer, and respiratory  		problems. Comparisons were made between people with and without disabilities as  		well as among the ten condition and impairment groups. These comparisons were  		based on demographic factors (income, poverty, employment), health status and  		health care utilization (health insurance coverage, general health status,  		hospital stays, physician visits), and program participation (participation in  		Food Stamps, Medicare, Medicaid, SSDI, SSI). Data came from Wave 3 of the 1990  		Survey of Income and Program Participation.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Within the disabled population,  		several condition/impairment groups were strikingly different. Persons with  		mental illness or MR/DD were significantly less likely to be employed, married,  		and need long-term care. They were also significantly more likely to live in  		poverty and rely on Federal programs. Health status and the utilization of  		health care was not significantly different for those with MR/DD than for all  		those with disabilities. However, health care utilization was significantly  		higher for persons with mental illness than for the entire disabled  		population.</p>
<p>Persons with chronic diseases typically did not significantly differ  		from the overall disabled population in educational attainment, poverty, or  		reliance on Federal programs (although a higher proportion of those with SSI  		received SSDI). However, persons with chronic diseases were much more likely to  		need long-term care, to be in fair or poor health, and to use health care.</p>
<p>People with visual impairments were more likely to be poor, to be  		African-American, to have not graduated from high school, to rely on food  		stamps (but not SSI or SSDI), and to be in fair or poor health.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p53" id="p53">NATIONAL MORTALITY  		FOLLOWBACK SURVEY</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The National Mortality Followback Survey  		(NMFS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, is a nationally  		representative sample of adults age 15 and over who died in 1993. Unlike other  		surveys, the NMFS data will provide a lifetime picture of lifestyle, health and  		socio-economic status and service use, as well as the use of health and  		long-term care services prior to death. The NMFS is a collaborative effort  		involving twelve co-sponsors, including ASPE. Since the frail elderly and other  		persons with disabilities are major users of health and long-term care  		services, it is important to have lifetime and prior-to-death estimates of  		their health, functional capacity, service use and expenditures and to be able  		to compare these data with data on the population as a whole. Information has  		been gathered on about 20,000 deaths. The NMFS supplements information from  		death certificates with information on important characteristics of the  		decedent.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  The data are collected through  		telephone and/or personal interviews with the next-of-kin of the decedent.  		Corroborative information is being collected from hospitals, hospices, and  		nursing homes. The survey is administered through a telephone screen and an  		in-person detailed interview. ASPE has helped in the development of questions  		included in the 1993 NMFS, so that they address issues like income, lifestyle,  		functional limitations and nursing home use. ASPE will receive a data tape.  		ASPE will also participate in an NMFS users group and help identify priorities  		for data analysis.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p55" id="p55">NATIONAL SURVEY OF SPECIAL  		CARE UNITS</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Joel Leon,  		Project Hope, Bethesda, MD</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Under an ASPE-NIA Interagency Agreement, ASPE  		helps support a census of special care units (SCUs) in licensed nursing homes  		in the United States. Special care units include: (a) SCUs targeted to persons  		with dementia, (b) subacute care specialty units, (c) special units for persons  		with AIDS, and (d) special rehabilitation units. It is important for health and  		long-term care policy development to have data on the growth and major trends  		in institutional long-term care. Nursing homes, in particular, have branched  		out to provide different types of services and to target specific subgroups of  		persons with disabilities. Many have established SCUs for persons with dementia  		or persons with AIDS, where some mix of subacute care, rehabilitative care and  		personal care are provided.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  Using data from the National Nursing  		Home Survey, approximately 17,000 nursing homes were identified. A screening  		instrument was developed to identify the characteristics of nursing homes that  		have developed SCUs and the nature of and populations served by those units.  		This instrument was mailed to all identified nursing homes. Approximately, 40%  		of nursing homes responded to the screener.</p>
<p>A follow-up to survey of a sample of nursing homes with subacute care  		programs will be conducted. The follow-up will identify the organizational,  		programmatic, staffing, and financing characteristics of nursing homes  		providing subacute care. The questionnaire for this follow-up survey has been  		developed is undergoing review by a technical advisory group.</p>
<p>Upcoming reports include: (1) a report on the characteristics of nursing  		homes that have developed SCUs and nature of and populations served by those  		units (March 1997); and, (2) a report on the organizational, programmatic,  		staffing, and financing characteristics of nursing homes providing subacute  		care (December 1997).</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The 1994/96 National Health Interview Survey  		on Disability, which was conducted along with the 1994 and 1995 National Health  		Interview Surveys (NHIS), has two parts. The Phase I interview will screen in  		the relevant populations and collect basic descriptive information about people  		with disabilities, including their disabling conditions and the nature,  		severity, and duration of their disabilities. Phase I interviews were conducted  		from January 1994 through December 1995. The Phase II interview (conducted  		about eight months after Phase I) will collect detailed information on how  		people with disabilities live (i.e., their housing, transportation, employment  		accommodations) and their service use and expenditure patterns--key information  		for policy analysis. Phase II interviews began in the Fall 1994 and will end in  		Fall 1997. Nationwide, about 225,000 people in 100,000 households participated  		in Phase I and approximately 45,000 in Phase II. The Survey will provide  		policy-relevant information on the extent and nature of disability among the  		American people. No such survey has been conducted or attempted since 1978 and  		no other survey will realistically occur before the end of the decade. The  		Survey will also be the only source of national comprehensive data on the  		developmentally disabled and children with disabilities.</p>
<p>A consortium of Federal agencies, along with a private foundation, are  		contributing funds to the survey. This is primarily a data collection effort,  		although a number of reports will be published. Preliminary data tapes have  		been released for the 1994 portion of Phase I. </p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  A data tape for the 1994 portion of  		Phase I is now available. Phase II data collection for the 1995 portion will  		end in the Fall 1997. Data tapes for the 1994 portion of Phase II and the 1995  		portion of Phase I will be released in the Spring 1997.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p51" id="p51">NATIONAL LONG-TERM CARE  		SURVEY</a></i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Kenneth  		Manton, Duke University, Durham, NC</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) is  		the major source of information on the frail elderly. The survey has been  		administered in 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1994. The survey provides nationally  		representative data on the characteristics, service use and long-term care  		expenditures of the frail elderly. </p>
<p>ASPE originated the NLTCS in 1982 and co-funded it with HCFA as part of  		an overall long-term care data collection strategy. ASPE has continued to  		provide supplemental funding since. Among other things, this involvement has  		given ASPE influence on the survey's data elements, production of public use  		tapes and analytical priorities. ASPE funds have provided Duke University with  		the resources to: add new questions dealing with the nutritional status of the  		frail elderly; and generate early analyses of 1994 data.</p>
<p>Three issues in particular were highlighted: (1) whether trends in  		disability rates among the elderly have continued to decline (as observed  		between 1982 and 1989); (2) whether assistive technology continues to  		substitute for hands-on care; and, (3) the role of private insurance in  		long-term care financing.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  Public use files of the NLTCS (1982,  		1984, 1989 and 1994) are available from Duke University. On the Internet, go to  		URL <a href="http://cds.duke.edu">http://cds.duke.edu</a> and click on the National Long-Term Care Survey  		Files.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Under an ASPE-NIA Interagency Agreement, ASPE  		funds will be used to support a Next-of-Kin Supplemental Survey as part of the  		1994 NLTCS. Approximately 4,800 persons who are selected for interviews under  		the 1994 NLTCS will have died between 1989 and 1994. The next-of-kin or other  		knowledgeable persons will be interviewed about the deceased person's use of  		medical and long-term care services. These data will become part of the 1994  		NLTCS data set. ASPE funding will permit the survey to obtain information on an  		estimated 80% of decedents. The information on decedents is needed in order to  		make a number of important estimates, such as total long-term care costs and  		the extent to which nursing home residents spend-down to qualify for Medicaid  		benefits. Because the 1989 NLTCS did not contain a survey on decedents, it was  		not possible to generate an estimate of total nursing home and other long-term  		care service use for the survey population. A Next-of-Kin Survey on decedents  		will help remedy this problem.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  Funds for this project were awarded  		in 1996. The supplement is in the design stage.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This project is a component of the Data  		Initiative--a broader HHS strategy to improve the Department's capacity to  		generate valid and reliable State level estimates, to measure the impact of  		social policy interventions, as HHS health and human services programs rapidly  		change their focus from the national to the State level.</p>
<p>This project focuses on three well known Federal surveys widely used for  		policy analysis: the Survey of Income Program Participation, the Current  		Population Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. In relation to  		these surveys, this project will: (1) closely evaluate statistical concerns to  		determine suitability and potential of using these surveys for State level  		estimates and to identify differences between states; (2) assess the current  		capabilities of these surveys to provide State level data; and, (3) present  		options for obtaining valid reliable State level data from relatively minimal  		enhancements and changes to the design of the surveys.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>The aging of the population worldwide has led to a number of  		international comparisons and collaborations by several countries to share  		information. Aging and health policy experts in other countries are interested  		in the U.S. long-term care experience; similarly, the U.S. can learn from other  		countries.</p>
<p>DALTCP is involved in two international aging efforts. The  		<b>International Collaborative Effort on Aging (ICE): Outcomes of Nursing Home  		Care in Five Countries</b> is part of an international study supported by the  		National Center on Health Statistics. The goal of this component of the  		analysis is to compare the number of people in nursing homes, their outcomes,  		and characteristics, across five countries.</p>
<p>The <b>U.S. and Japan Long-Term Care Data Comparability</b> project  		examined the comparability of the U.S. and Japan's long-term care data systems  		and surveys. Some preliminary analyses of comparable survey data from both  		countries were undertaken. Overall, the goal is to improve data coverage,  		collection, analysis and dissemination in both countries.</p>

</div>
<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i><a name="p45" id="p45">LONG-TERM CARE IN  		COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</a></i></b></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  This ongoing research involves tracking  		developments in long-term care financing and delivery in other countries. The  		current focus is on lessons to be learned from the implementation of Israel's  		new long-term care insurance law. Past research has focused on comparative  		cross-national institutionalization rates, the balance of medical to  		non-medical long-term care institutional use, effectiveness of funding home and  		community-based care to prevent or postpone institutionalization, relative  		reliance on public versus private financing and differences in public financing  		mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>FINDINGS/RESULTS</b>:  Early results appeared in a paper by  		Pamela Doty on comparative financing methods, presented at a Brookings  		Institution conference in May 1988. A general overview of long-term care in  		international perspective, highlighting comparative institutionalization rates,  		was published in the <i>Health Care Financing Review 1988 Annual Supplement</i>  		in an article by Pamela Doty. Additional results appear in the articles listed  		below.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  Japan is a rapidly aging society. By 2020,  		25% of all Japanese are expected to be age 65 or over. The Japanese have become  		very aware of the impact of their aging population, particularly with respect  		to long-term care. They are eager to learn from the United States experience.  		Conversely, the United States can learn much from Japan, since they are  		approaching the problem with a fresh perspective based on their analyses of  		other countries' experience in long-term care. </p>
<p>In order for U.S.-Japan comparative analyses to be valid and reliable,  		it was necessary to examine the two nations' data collection activities related  		to long-term care, identify areas of comparability, and recommend improvements.  		A report was issued that: (a) describes the long-term care data collection  		activities in the United States and Japan; (b) summarizes what is known from  		available data sets; and, (c) recommends improvements in measures and data  		collection strategies to improve comparability.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and  		Development (OECD) is an international organization based in Paris, France,  		whose membership is comprised of advanced industrial nations--including the  		United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and most of the countries  		of Western Europe. Since 1991, the OECD has been conducting comparative  		research on long-term care for the frail (i.e., functionally disabled) elderly  		across member countries. The study is under the overall direction of Patrick  		Hennessy, a consultant to the Directorate for Education, Employment, Labour,  		and Social Affairs. Three "expert" meetings have been held--in 1991, 1992, and  		1994--which were attended by ASPE staff. The 1994 meeting was attended by Robyn  		Stone, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for DALTCP. In addition, DALTCP has  		contributed a "country report" (written by Pamela Doty) describing long-term  		care policy in the United States. OECD's cross-national study of care of the  		frail elderly is now nearing completion. A follow-up study examining the  		broader effects of population aging on OECD countries is planned.</p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>:  <i>Caring for Frail Elderly People:  		Policies in Evolution</i> was published by OECD, which compiles similar reports  		from each of the OECD member countries. Chapter 14 covers the United  		States.</p>

<p><b>PURPOSE</b>:  The Outcomes of Nursing Home Care in Five  		Countries is one of a number of initiatives being conducted under the  		NCHS-sponsored International Collaborative Effort on Aging. </p>
<p>The aging of the population worldwide reveals the urgency of the issue  		of long-term care. The establishment of nursing homes is one way in which  		several societies have tried to meet the needs of a proportion of the dependent  		elderly. An international study including Australia, Canada, the Netherlands,  		Norway and the United States, supported by NCHS, makes available comparable  		data on the number of persons in nursing homes and the characteristics of  		nursing home care in these counties. </p>
<p>These data show how the different health care systems deal with the very  		dependent elderly receiving institutional care, including differences in  		nursing home outcomes using indicators like live versus dead discharges and  		place discharged to.

<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p><i>ASPE Research Notes</i> are two-page reports designed primarily to  		provide research information in a form which is useful for policy officials  		within the Department. They are not a substitute for research articles  		published in peer-reviewed professional journals, nor for the executive  		summaries prepared for research and evaluation grants and contracts. Instead,  		they are internal staff memoranda which highlight significant findings for  		policy, primarily from in-house research and ASPE-sponsored grant and contract  		studies (although syntheses of other research are sometimes used). Fourteen  		<i>ASPE Research Notes</i> have been published and there are several more in  		preparation.</p>
<p>The <i>ASPE Research Notes</i> articles published so far have been well  		received within the Department, and have now been cleared for distribution  		outside of HHS. Although initiated through the Office of Disability, Aging and  		Long-Term Care Policy, they are written by policy analysts throughout ASPE.</p>
<p><i>ASPE Research Notes</i> have now also entered the cyperspace age,  		through their availability on the Internet. Articles are listed and can be  		downloaded soon after originals are disseminated. Full copies of the articles  		listed below can be viewed at the <i>ASPE Research Notes</i> Internet address  		[<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/ASPErns.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/ASPErns.htm</a>]  		or requested from DALTCP at our address on Page 2.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><a name="r58" id="r58"><i>ELDERCARE: THE IMPACT OF  		FAMILY CAREGIVERS EMPLOYMENT ON FORMAL AND INFORMAL HELPER  		HOURS</i></a></b></p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  The 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey is  		the first nationally representative survey to collect data on weekly hours of  		assistance received by ADL and/or IADL disabled elders living in the community  		by individual caregivers, both formal and informal. Thus, it is now possible to  		investigate the effects of primary caregivers' employment status on the amount  		of help that disabled elders receive, while simultaneously controlling for  		disability status and other potentially confounding variables. Under an ASPE  		task order contract, Mary Elizabeth Jackson of the MEDSTAT Group carried out a  		series of regression analyses, using, as the dependent variables, four  		different measures of hours of care: hours provided by the primary informal  		caregiver, hours from all unpaid sources other than the primary caregiver,  		hours from paid caregivers, and total hours of care received by care recipients  		from both paid and unpaid caregivers. Primary caregivers who are employed were  		found to provide significantly fewer hours of help personally (7.6) than  		primary caregivers not in the labor force. However, there were no significant  		differences in the total hours of help received by care recipients associated  		with the employment status of their primary caregivers--except for part-time  		employees. That is, care recipients of part-time employed caregivers received  		significantly fewer total hours of care (8.4) than other caregivers (including  		both full-time employees and those not in the labor force). For care recipients  		of full-time workers, the lower number of hours that the employed caregivers  		personally provided was made up by comparatively greater use of a combination  		of other informal and paid help. The same was not true for part-time employed  		caregivers.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><a name="r115" id="r115"><i>POPULATION ESTIMATES OF  		DISABILITY AND LONG-TERM CARE</i></a></b></p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  A large minority of Americans (42.7 million  		or 17.2%) have disabilities, 12.7 million of whom need long-term care. About  		29.7% of all people with disabilities and 5% of the entire population need  		long-term care. Estimates of the number of people with disabilities or with  		long-term care needs are derived for both the community and institutionalized  		population for children, working age adults, and the elderly. Community  		estimates are based on the 1990 Survey of Income and Program Participation and  		estimates from institutions come from the 1990 Decennial Census, work from the  		University of Minnesota, and a Federal census of mental facilities.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  According to the 1990 Survey of Income and  		Program Participation and data from institutions, 4,536,000 children under 18  		were reported as having a disability, with 4,444,500 living in the community  		and 91,800 residing in institutions. The leading causes of disability among  		children were (in order) learning disabilities, speech disorders, mental  		retardation and other developmental disabilities, mental illness, and  		respiratory conditions. Compared to children with no disabilities, those with  		disabilities were more likely to be boys, over age 6, White, and to have  		Medicaid; less likely to have private health insurance; and, almost equally as  		likely to be poor.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><a name="r162" id="r162"><i>THE ELDERLY WITH  		DISABILITIES: AT RISK FOR HIGH HEALTH CARE COSTS</i></a></b></p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  According to the 1987 National Medical  		Expenditure Survey, elderly persons with severe disabilities (defined as  		needing assistance with one or more activities of daily living) had  		out-of-pocket health care expenses nearly four times greater than persons  		without disabilities. Approximately 9% of the elderly population was  		categorized as having a severe disability. Much of the difference in  		out-of-pocket expenditures is due to greater home health spending among those  		without disabilities, who also have far greater hospital and physician  		expenses. Older people with disabilities also spend a greater proportion of  		family income on health care than do older people with disabilities--12% versus  		3%. However, there is substantial variation in expenditures among persons with  		substantial disability. For instance, over 70% of the severely disabled elderly  		do not have any out-of-pocket expenditures for home health care. Elderly  		persons with severe disabilities who were enrolled in Medicaid for only part of  		the year had highest out-of-pocket expenditures (nearly 20% of family  		income).</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  The past decade or so has seen considerable  		growth in the number of Medicaid programs electing to cover personal care  		services--from only ten in FY 1979 to 29 in FY 1992. Substantial inter-State  		variation exists in Medicaid personal care services coverage. In 1988,  		participation rates per 1,000 aged/disabled Medicaid recipients ranged from a  		low of four (New Hampshire) to a high of 215 (South Dakota). Federal law and  		regulations place few limitations on States' discretionary authority. States  		that interpret Federal requirements more liberally are ones that have  		consciously sought to develop "consumer-directed" models of service  		delivery.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  Board and care homes are non-medical  		community-based facilities that provide at least two meals a day and routine  		protective oversight to one or more residents with functional limitations.  		Unweighted data from the 1991 National Health Provider Inventory (NHPI)  		indicate that there were about 30,000 licensed board and care homes in the  		United States serving over half a million persons. These data confirm that the  		board and care industry plays a significant role in the housing and care of the  		frail elderly and other functionally disabled populations.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  Three studies sponsored by HHS confirm  		previous research linking health impairment levels, advanced age, and various  		indicators of caregivers' physical burden and emotional stress with individual  		caregivers' decisions to stop giving care and increased likelihood of nursing  		home placement. In contrast, the lack of association between caregivers'  		employment status and withdrawal from caregiving or decisions to  		institutionalize fails to support some widely held theories about the effects  		of female labor force participation on informal eldercare. Finally, informal  		care networks add paid helpers to cope with more intensive demands for  		assistance and/or losses in membership. Over time, however, formal services  		become less effective in preventing nursing home use.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  A number of proposals have been advanced to  		establish a uniform home care benefit for the frail elderly. Measures of  		disability using the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) have been used to  		estimate the numbers of persons potentially eligible under such proposals. This  		article shows that, even with a common approach to eligibility based on ADLs,  		the estimates from national surveys vary widely--from 0.5 million to 3.8  		million persons. Such differences are affected by program targeting criteria  		but also by each survey's sampling frame, sample size, wording of questions on  		ADL status and the selection of variables for analysis.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><a name="r103" id="r103"><i>MEDICARE HOME HEALTH  		AGENCY SERVICES USE AMONG THE DISABLED AND NON-DISABLED ELDERLY</i></a></b></p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:  Between 1988 and 1994, Medicare home health  		agency expenditures grew by 550%. Many argue that most of this growth is not  		associated with post-hospital convalescence or rehabilitation but represents  		"long-term care" for chronically disabled elderly who primarily require  		long-term assistance with activities of daily living. This project is examining  		data from the 1989 and 1994 National Long-Term Care Surveys to compare Medicare  		home health service use of elderly Medicare beneficiaries with and without  		functional assistance needs. 1989-90 data indicate that disabled home health  		benefit users accounted for approximately two-thirds of all home health visits  		and two-thirds of total home health expenditures. Seventy- three percent of  		home health episodes experiences by Medicare beneficiaries were associated with  		a prior (or interim) hospital stay. Regression analyses show that severity of  		disability was a significant predictor of both home health use and more visits  		per episode, but indicators of medical need were also significant predictors.  		The study concludes that there is little evidence in 1989-90 that the Medicare  		home health benefit was a major source of long-term care for disabled elderly.  		Although nearly one in five disabled Medicare beneficiaries used Medicare home  		health services over the one-year period, only 3% had "long-term" episodes  		(defined as more than 120 visits).</p>
