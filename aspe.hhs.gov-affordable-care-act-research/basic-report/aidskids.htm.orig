</dl><h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<h3>A. Purpose of Project</h3>
<p>In 1981, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was first identified  		in adults, and a few years later it was identified in children. AIDS, and AIDS  		virus infection (or HIV infection), as a fatal disease of epidemic proportions  		in children, is quickly emerging as a major public health tragedy that places  		extreme demands on the already overburdened health and social service system of  		this country. The issues surrounding the care and treatment of children with  		AIDS, and their ramifications upon the health and social service systems are  		not yet fully known or understood.</p>
<p>Surveillance data that CDC has gathered show that as of December 31,  		1987 there were a total of 737 cases of AIDS in children (CDC Surveillance  		Report, 1987). CDC estimates 3,000 cases of pediatric AIDS by 1991, and there  		are estimates that 10,000 - 20,000 infants and children will be infected with  		HIV by 1991 (Report of the Surgeon General's workshop). The vast majority (73  		percent) of children who acquired AIDS come from families where one or both  		parents are intravenous (IV) drug abusers (Report of the Surgeon General's  		workshop). Most of the reported cases in the U.S. (58 percent) have been in New  		York City, New York; Newark, New Jersey; and Miami, Florida; three cities with  		large drug abusing populations (CDC Surveillance report, December 28,  		1987).</p>
<p>Legal, social and medical issues associated with the problem have  		attracted the attention of the media, Congress and local and federal policy  		makers, all of whom are grappling with the services needed by these children,  		the depth and quality of services currently delivered, and the present and  		future financial burden and sources of funds. Since the problem is relatively  		new, there are few studies and inadequate data to support, test, or verify  		approaches or hypotheses aimed at alleviating the problem.</p>
<p>There have been reports of AIDS babies abandoned in hospitals and  		shortages of foster care placements for these children. It is also generally  		believed that medical and other costs of caring for these children are higher  		than for children with other special conditions.</p>
<p>In light of these and other growing problems and the lack of sufficient  		information, The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  		(ASPE), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), commissioned Macro  		Systems, Inc., to conduct a brief, exploratory study to obtain an initial  		understanding of the prevailing issues. This study will provide suggestions for  		further lines of inquiry into specific problems and issues.</p>
<p>This study is timely in nature because issues concerned with pediatric  		AIDS are constantly emerging and evolving. Much can be learned from the early  		experiences in the three cities toward shaping future planning and effective  		responses for the nation. DHHS is taking a cross-cutting perspective of issues  		because service delivery to these children involves the linkage of several  		health and social service sectors of the overall service system. This study  		will enable DHHS to identify the issues that need further exploration in order  		to determine an efficacious and timely Federal response to this critical public  		health issue.</p>
<h3>B. Scope of the Project</h3>
<p>The goals of the study are to: define the issues related to providing  		care to children with AIDS; place parameters around the size and scope of the  		problem; and attempt to clarify some of the perceptions and approaches relevant  		to the problem. This project focuses on children with AIDS whose parents are,  		or have had sexual contact with, IV drug abusers. Their social service needs  		differ from the needs of the hemophilia and other blood transfusion  		populations. The study's focus is more on child welfare service problems,  		issues and needs than on medical treatment issues. However, the medical care  		system is intricately involved in providing both medical and social services to  		these children and, therefore, is included in this focus.</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the study are to:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Summarize what is known about the natural history of HIV infected  			 children and the types of non-medical services appropriate for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define service and financing policy issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how the three cities with the highest incidence of HIV  			 infected children are presently coping with the care of these children in terms  			 of types of care and financing, issues that result, including problems and  			 successes, and what they consider to be the prospects for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe exemplary practices, i.e. specific activities and responses  			 that appear to work in each city.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The number of pediatric AIDS cases continues to increase; knowledge  		about the medical aspects of the disease is still evolving; and responses to  		the problem are continuously formulated, tested and redefined. During the  		course of this study, a number of other studies and activities regarding  		children with AIDS were underway, or had recently been completed. Several of  		these are listed in <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p>Resources designated for the study were limited to the defined scope of  		the project and thus precluded in-depth exploration of any one issue. The  		observations presented in this report provide a snapshot of the rapidly moving  		and changing situation of AIDS in children as it effects three cities, and  		hopefully provide a glimpse into the future in terms of what to expect and how  		to formulate appropriate and effective responses.</p>
<h3>C. Methodology</h3>
<p>The project methodology included four components: designing an analytic  		framework, reviewing the literature, conducting telephone discussions with  		people involved in AIDS policy issues, and conducting site visits to the three  		cities with the highest prevalence of children with AIDS.</p>
<p>An analytic framework was created to outline a means of depicting  		information obtained about issues, barriers and responses. It provided a  		direction and focus to the project. A preliminary framework was designed at the  		onset of the study and then revised after the literature review and telephone  		discussions to help direct the site visits and shape the analysis. The revised  		analytic framework appears in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>The literature review included abstracts of papers presented at the  		Third International Conference On AIDS held in Washington, D.C., the report of  		the Surgeon General's Workshop in Philadelphia, and published papers in  		medical, public health and child welfare related journals. The literature  		review was not intended to be exhaustive, but to provide an overview of the  		salient cross-cutting issues. During the course of the project a number of new  		articles were published, and other unpublished reports were also brought to our  		attention. Time did not permit a written review of all of these materials;  		however, a bibliography of these resources is included in <a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a>, and summaries of the articles reviewed are  		included in <a href="#appendD">Appendix D</a>.</p>
<p>The literature review provided the background information necessary to  		conduct telephone discussions with key persons knowledgeable about the issues  		and policy implications. Time and limited resources did not permit us to  		contact every individual or organization with expertise or involvement in  		pediatric AIDS. we did attempt to contact a variety of organizations to obtain  		a complete picture of the different perceptions of the issues. Persons  		contacted had affiliations with national social service, AIDS service and  		minority organizations, Federal agencies, and congressional offices. A total of  		21 organizations were contacted (<a href="#appendE">Appendix E</a>). Issues  		discussed included trends in the incidence and spread of the disease, degree of  		illness in children, level of care required, financing issues/approaches to the  		care of these children, and policy implications. Summaries of the telephone  		discussions appear in <a href="#appendF">Appendix F</a>. The site visit  		approach was based on the literature review and prior telephone  		discussions.</p>
<p>Major issues and critical questions that were repeatedly mentioned in  		the literature and/or during the telephone discussions included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What is the extent of the "boarder baby" situation; are all boarder  			 babies also AIDS babies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many AIDS, ARC and HIV positive children are there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A child with AIDS usually has a parent with AIDS. What are the  			 health and social service needs of these families?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These children and their families experience problems and barriers  			 in obtaining needed health and social services. What are the barriers/problems  			 that are unique to AIDS and what are the barriers/problems that already existed  			 and are exacerbated by AIDS?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The analytic framework was revised accordingly, site visits were  		scheduled and discussion issues and questions were sent to the sites prior to  		the visit to familiarize them with the topics to be discussed (<a href="#appendG">Appendix G</a>). Persons contacted and visited included those  		involved in various aspects of the problem including child welfare officials,  		foster parents, voluntary organizations and other community groups, hospital  		personnel, public health officials, and State and local government officials. A  		list of persons contacted at each site is included in <a href="#appendH">Appendix H</a>, and summaries of each site visit are included  		in <a href="#appendI">Appendix I</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM</a></h2>
<h3>A. Natural History of AIDS</h3>
<p>AIDS is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Maternal  		transmission of HIV most often occurs perinatally; however, there is some  		evidence that it can also occur prenatally and postnatally (via breast milk)  		(Pyum, 1987). Infants can test positive for passively transferred maternal HIV  		antibody for up to 15 months of age without actually being infected  		(<b><i>MMWR</i></b>, April 24, 1987). It is estimated that as much as 65  		percent of infants born to infected mothers have HIV infection  		(<b><i>MMWR</i></b>, December 6, 1985).</p>
<p>The CDC has implemented an AIDS case reporting definition for use in  		national surveillance. To qualify as a case, there must be evidence of a  		damaged immune system and the presence of an "officially recognized" cancer,  		opportunistic infection, dementia or wasting. The pediatric AIDS case  		definition differs from adults. In children, multiple or recurrent serious  		bacterial infections and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia/pulmonary lymphoid  		hyperplasia are accepted indicators of AIDS. The laboratory criteria for HIV  		infection in infants less than 15 months of age are more stringent because of  		the potential that the detectable AIDS antibodies were passively acquired.</p>
<p>Clinical experience shows that children with documented HIV infection  		can also have symptoms of illness and yet not meet the strict CDC criteria for  		AIDS. On this account, the literature often refers to all HIV infected  		children, including those with AIDS, ARC and those who are HIV positive and  		symptomatic. Failure to thrive is a major feature of children with HIV  		infection. Downstate Medical Center in Now York City found that 80 percent of  		ARC/AIDS infants studied failed to thrive, and that 96 percent had neurological  		deficits. HIV infected children can also have a variety of other illnesses,  		including anemia, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, encephalopathy, recurrent  		bacterial infection, hepatitis and renal disease, to name a few.</p>
<p>Early medical intervention for the HIV infected infant is important.  		This can include nutritional support, treatment of infection and therapy with  		intravenous gamma globulin. Hospitalization is often required, but increasingly  		care and treatment can be provided on an outpatient basis. The mortality rate  		is high, especially if opportunistic infection is acquired in the first year of  		life.</p>
<h3>B. Magnitude</h3>
<p>As of December, 1987, CDC reported a total of 737 AIDS cases in children  		up to 13 years old (<a href="#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>). HIV infection in  		children is predominantly among blacks (54 percent), including children of  		parents coming from Haiti, and Hispanics (24 percent). In addition, HIV  		infection in children is also a problem closely linked to IV drug abuse.  		Nationally, 77 percent of the officially reported pediatric AIDS cases had a  		parent with or at risk for AIDS primarily through either IV drug abuse or  		sexual contact with an IV drug abuser.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the pediatric AIDS epidemic and its impact on the  		health and social service systems cannot be limited to the children meeting the  		CDC AIDS case definition. The three cities visited have found that the children  		needing services include those who have AIDS and ARC, and those that are HIV  		positive.</p>
<p>The cumulative total of cases in New York, Florida and New Jersey that  		met the CDC definition for pediatric AIDS was 429 in 1987. However, the total  		number of children who have been followed by the hospitals visited in three  		cities in these States has been 860, twice as many as the number of AIDS cases.  		This total does not include HIV infected children followed by the other  		hospitals in these cities that were not visited, other hospitals in the State,  		or those unknown to the system.</p>

</tr></table><p>Professionals who have been working closely with the problem feel that  		the magnitude is much larger than is currently known. For example, the New York  		City AIDS Surveillance Unit has estimated that there have been approximately  		500 ARC cases and 2,000 HIV infected children. An HIV seropositivity research  		study demonstrated that within one section of New York City two out of every  		100 women were HIV antibody seropositive. This finding was verified by a New  		York State seropositivity study of all births n the state for a one month  		period--very high risk areas were found to have approximately a 2.5 percent  		newborn seropositivity rate.</p>
<p>Other areas are experiencing similar disparities between the number of  		officially reported pediatric AIDS cases and the number of children in need of  		clinical and social services. For example, Washington, D.C. officially reported  		14 cases of pediatric AIDS, but has a cumulative total of 116 HIV infected, ARC  		and AIDS children. In Georgia, 16 pediatric AIDS cases have been reported, but  		there have been approximately 56 HIV antibody positive, ARC and AIDS children.  		Since there is no consistent or widespread testing of newborns and/or pregnant  		women, estimates of the disparity between reported pediatric AIDS cases and the  		number of children managed in any given municipality cannot be determined  		precisely.</p>

</tr></table><p>Projections for future numbers of cases in children and adolescents  		usually use the year 1991 as the target year. CDC estimates a cumulative total  		of 3,000 children with AIDS by that date. The New York City Health Department  		predicts that there will be 10,000 cumulative cases of AIDS, ARC and HIV  		positive children, and James Oleske, at Children's Hospital in Newark, New  		Jersey estimates 10,000 to 20,000 symptomatic HIV infected infants and children  		by 1991 (Report of the Surgeon General's Workshop). Although there are very few  		known cases of adolescents with ARC/AIDS at present, it can be reasonably  		predicted that they will begin to play a significant role in the future.  		Medical advances are extending the lives of children with AIDS, and children  		and young adolescents experiment with sexual activity and with drug use. In  		addition, the history of sexually transmitted disease control is that  		adolescents represent approximately 25 percent of those diseases, some of which  		are known precursors for subsequent HIV infection.</p>
<h3>C. Service Delivery Needs</h3>
<p>Caring for an HIV infected child poses special challenges. There are the  		demands of taking care of an ill child, including frequent visits to the  		hospital, special infection control precautions, managing special health needs  		and recurrent medical crises, and perhaps ultimately coping with the child's  		death. Because of the widespread fear of AIDS, it is sometimes difficult to  		obtain needed services such as dental care, day care, schooling, etc., and  		frequently there is ostracism by family and friends if the child's HIV status  		is known.</p>
<p>Most HIV infected children are from minority (black, Haitian and  		Hispanic) and impoverished families. It is not uncommon for the child to be the  		index case of AIDS in a family with other infected members. Often, one or both  		parents are or have been IV drug abusers and are themselves ill or dying with  		ARC or AIDS, and the child may have a sibling with AIDS.</p>
<p>In addition to dealing with medical and social service needs, parents  		often must cope with the emotional trauma of their own or each other's illness  		or death, and the guilt of having passed the HIV infection to their child.  		These families are also in need of income support, housing assistance,  		transportation, in-home care and assistance in obtaining these benefits.  		Historically, the minority and IV drug abusing populations have had difficulty  		accessing the health and social service systems.</p>
<p>For children whose parents are too ill to care for them, whose parents  		have died, or who have been abandoned by their parents, alternative  		guardianship arrangements are required. These arrangements have included  		extended families (most often a grandmother), foster families, and congregate  		care homes. If no alternatives are found, the child becomes a hospital "boarder  		baby," or a child who resides in a medical facility without medical  		justification.</p>
<p>The number of boarder babies nationwide and the percentage of boarder  		babies who have AIDS are unknown. Of the sites visited, New York City has had  		the most extensive problem. There were 42 boarder babies during one month in  		1987, 35 of whom were HIV infected. The other sites have had only two to three  		boarder babies at one time. Many boarder babies' hospital stays are prolonged  		because of problems in finding foster care homes or in processing the necessary  		paperwork to place them in alternate care arrangements.</p>
<h3>D. Financial Aspects</h3>
<p>No published data were found on the total costs of providing care to  		children with AIDS. There are a number of different estimates on the costs of  		care for AIDS in general, or specifically for adults. Total lifetime costs were  		estimated at $4.85 billion in 1985 in 1985, $8.64 billion in 1986 and projected  		to increase to $66.5 billion by 1991 (Scitovsky, 1987). Estimates for hospital  		care only, from diagnosis to death, range from $27,571 per case in San  		Francisco, California (Scitovsky, 1986) to $50,000 per case (National Academy  		of Science, 1986) to $140,000 per case (Hardy, 1986).</p>
<p>An analysis of the cost of care for HIV infected children at Harlem  		Hospital reports an average cost of $500 per day per child. The per diem ranged  		from $300 to $2,400. The study also showed that 30 percent of the total length  		of stay and 20 percent of the total cost were for unnecessary  		hospitalizations.</p>
<p>The major sources of payment for adult AIDS patients are private  		insurance and Medicaid (Luehrs, 1986). Drug abusers and pediatric cases are  		more likely to rely on Medicaid as the payment source. Persons fitting the CDC  		case definition of AIDS are presumed to be disabled under Social Security  		Administration (SSA) regulation and therefore are eligible for Medicaid if they  		also meet the income eligibility criteria for supplemental security income  		(SSI). This eligibility criteria does not extend to children with ARC or HIV  		infection. Families that are already on Aid for Families with Dependent  		Children (AFDC) are automatically eligible for Medicaid in most States, which  		is often the case for children infected with HIV. AIDS costs will increasingly  		impact upon the Medicaid system because of the enormous expense in caring for  		these children and families. The potential exists for an overwhelming cost  		burden as the number of cases increase.</p>
<h3>E. Service Delivery Approaches and Problems</h3>
<p>Testing and screening of newborns for HIV is not done routinely in any  		of the sites visited. The HIV infected child is first known to the service  		system when he/she becomes symptomatic and enters the health care system. This  		may be at birth, if circumstances suggest the possibility of HIV infection and  		testing is done. Otherwise, recognition is delayed until later in infancy. In  		all three cities, the hospital is the initial provider of services to HIV  		infected children, although many are already known to the social service system  		because of other family situations.</p>
<p>The composition of the team of professionals delivering services to HIV  		infected children at the hospitals visited range from two overworked  		pediatricians at Harlem Hospital to care teams comprised of pediatricians,  		social workers, nurses and psychologists or psychiatrists. The most  		comprehensively staffed care teams are located at medical schools and  		affiliated hospitals that have been able to help support these positions  		through research grants.</p>
<p>Some hospitals have reported difficulties in hiring new staff to care  		for HIV infected children. Harlem hospital has several social work and nurse  		positions that they have been unable to fill. This is due in part to  		preexisting staff shortages, fear of AIDS among professionals, and insufficient  		salaries. Hospitals with additional grant resources have had better success in  		filling staff positions, but have also experienced more difficulty than usual  		in finding staff because of the fear of AIDS. Most of the staff visited at the  		hospitals in New York, Miami and Newark are those who became involved early in  		the epidemic and have dedicated themselves to providing services to HIV  		infected children.</p>
<p>The additional resources from the research grants have enhanced the  		development of medical and social service expertise in the recipient hospitals.  		Many of the services needed by HIV infected children are unavailable in the  		community, or community agencies are unwilling to accept these children because  		of a fear of AIDS. As a result hospitals have taken on new and expanded  		activities, including case management and outreach and some have begun to  		provide services such as day care, counseling and training and education of the  		community. They have evolved into pediatric AIDS treatment and case management  		centers.</p>
<p>The types of services provided to children with HIV infection at all  		hospitals visited are focused on the family needs as much as possible. One  		approach included home visits by a nurse and social worker to assess the  		family's needs. Another approach included referral to the visiting nurse  		association to provide in-home care.</p>
<p>The Children's Hospital of New Jersey, in collaboration with the New  		Jersey Department of Human Services, has described a continuum of care that  		includes training and education of staff and community service providers;  		medical consultation for emergency care, regular medical care, and medical case  		monitoring to ensure consistency in care. A range of social services is also  		described, comprised of: case advocacy in terms of assisting the family to  		obtain needed services; working with State agencies and communities to develop  		needed but unavailable services; providing individual and group support to  		address psychosocial and service needs of natural parents and foster parents;  		providing homemaker and in-home care services; providing transportation to and  		from medical appointments, and placement in alternative care for both respite  		care and regular long term placements.</p>
<p>The persons interviewed identified a need for a coordinated  		maternal-infant approach to medical care and social service delivery. Under the  		present system, mothers/parents are treated under different care systems than  		their children. One example of this is the referral and reimbursement mechanism  		for in-home care in Newark. When a home visit is made for the child, there is  		usually the need to provide services for the mother as well. Under the present  		system, in-home care for the mother takes place under a separate referral  		system, so that the mother's and child's care are not provided in the same  		visit. Since both the mother and the child are likely to be in need of medical  		care, the children's medical and social service providers should maintain close  		contact with the mother's medical and social service providers to ensure that  		appropriate services are being delivered to both, and that their care is  		coordinated. Prescribed medical care and other services for the child need to  		take into account the mother's health condition and home situation.</p>
<p>Service providers also identified social service/reimbursement  		eligibility problems and processing issues. An extreme example of this occurred  		at Harlem Hospital, where in addition to lack of funds and difficulty in  		recruiting personnel, the complexity and intricacies of coordinating Medicaid,  		AFDC, SSI and other financial support programs have posed serious obstacles to  		appropriate care and availability of social support for the children and  		families in desperate need. In one case, the bureaucratic intricacies in  		providing appropriate support for a grandmother to care for an AIDS infected  		youngster could not be surmounted, and the child has remained in the hospital  		for over two years. This unfortunate outcome occurred despite pleas made by the  		Chief of Pediatrics to high placed city, regional and Federal officials. One  		official returned to Harlem Hospital with $191 and a box of used toys that were  		the result of a collection taken up by office personnel in lieu of an ability  		to generate and make the system responsive to obvious patient and family  		needs.</p>
<p>Another example is the complicated process of obtaining Medicaid  		coverage in Hudson County, New Jersey, where three separate applications are  		required and eligibility must be renewed every three months. Service providers  		there report that 47 out of 100 high risk parents do not have Medicaid  		coverage. Personnel in Miami also report that the application process for SSI  		and AFDC is extremely complicated, the stipends are too low, and in some cases,  		processing has taken as long as six weeks. These problems were identified as  		intrinsic to the system as a whole, not as unique to AIDS/HIV infection.  		However, the immediacy of the needs of the AIDS/HIV infected population has  		highlighted these problems. Problems that are specifically AIDS related include  		finding agencies and community services willing to provide services to HIV  		infected clientele. Persons interviewed cited a need for extensive community  		education to put the realities of HIV transmissibility into perspective.</p>
<p>When a child is in need of a foster care home, the hospital usually  		contacts the city or state child service agency. Service providers interviewed  		in all three cities indicated a preference for placing a child with a member of  		the extended family, i.e., "kinship foster care." In fact, in some communities  		such as the Haitian community in Miami, the willingness and ability of extended  		family members to care for the children is so strong that few HIV infected  		children abandoned or without parents are in need of foster care homes.</p>
<p>There are a number of issues and barriers to the kinship foster care  		option. In many cases, the grandmother or aunt who assumes the care of the  		child does not have adequate financial resources to care for the child or cover  		the extensive medical expenses that are likely to occur. In some jurisdictions,  		an extended family member can qualify for foster care payments, and in some  		cases the family may qualify for AFDC and Medicaid. However, in order to obtain  		these income support services, the extended family member must assume legal  		guardianship of the child which involves going through a court process to  		declare the parent incompetent, abusive, or neglectful. Many families are  		unwilling to do this out of loyalty to their offspring or siblings.</p>
<p>Service providers at the sites visited report that kinship foster care  		is neither adequately reimbursed nor expeditiously available. They feel that  		the shortage of foster care homes would not be as acute if adequate provisions  		for this option were made.</p>
<p>In most areas visited the city or State agency contracts with a number  		of private agencies to provide foster care services. There is a reported  		shortage of foster care agencies willing to include HIV infected children in  		their caseloads. Two agencies in New York and Miami have developed special  		programs specifically geared toward placing HIV infected children, and in  		Newark, the Foster Parents Association has become involved in addressing the  		issues of foster parent recruitment. All three jurisdictions offer enhanced  		reimbursement rates for foster families that take HIV infected children. For  		example, in New York the reimbursement rate for HIV seropositive children is  		$1,134 per month as compared to the regular rate of $165-$342 per month,  		depending on age and a special rate of $748 per month for special needs  		children (handicapped, boarder babies, or other hard-to-place). There are  		additional allowances for clothing and other miscellaneous expenses that are  		determined on a per child basis by the contracting agency. In Miami, a foster  		parent receives $2,700 per month for an AIDS/ARC child, and no additional  		allowances are awarded. This compares to the regular rate of $183-$240 per  		month depending on age.</p>
<p>The Leake and Watts Children's Home, one of the contracting agencies in  		New York, has created a special division to handle foster care placement of HIV  		infected children. The agency social workers in this division receive an  		additional $3,000 per year. Leake and Watts has been able to place 24 HIV  		infected children over a 24-month period. Their best source of recruitment has  		been referrals from foster families already caring for HIV infected children.  		Recruitment efforts by other agencies visited included public service  		announcements, information dissemination and education.</p>
<p>All three cities report that children who are already in foster care  		homes when HIV infection is discovered are rarely turned away by the foster  		family. Many have already bonded with the child, and after some education about  		HIV infection and transmissibility, the families opt to keep the child. Persons  		involved in foster care in all three cities identified a number of foster care  		needs and issues. Extensive orientation, training and support services for  		respite care, day care, homemaker services, are needed, as well as attention to  		emotional needs. Several persons interviewed indicated that there weren't  		resources to study and qualify families quickly enough to meet the growing  		needs. Other issues raised included confidentiality, and how many HIV infected  		children should be placed in one home.</p>
<p>The use of congregate care homes for HIV infected children raises  		another set of issues. The personnel running the homes that we visited viewed  		this alternative as a temporary placement until an appropriate foster care home  		could be found. They felt that it was a better alternative than allowing the  		children to stay in the hospital when there was no medical need to be there.  		Others felt strongly that congregate care homes were not good alternatives  		because they do not provide an adequate family environment, the risk of illness  		is too high, and the concept may appear to condone the isolation of HIV  		positive children from their extended families and community. Congregate care  		is not an inexpensive option. St. Claire's Home for Children reports a cost of  		$240 per day per child ($100,000 per year). It is, however, half of some of the  		estimated hospital costs. Congregate care homes may also experience problems  		with community acceptance.</p>
<p>Each of the three cities visited had a different approach to the  		management and coordination of services. In Miami, a planning process that  		involved a variety of community interests was instigated early in the epidemic.  		Public health was notably absent from this process. As part of the planning  		approach, service needs were defined and a special management office was  		created to handle contracting with organizations to provide care and management  		services, education and training, and to conduct research. This office is the  		central receptacle for all AIDS related funding for South Florida. Newark has  		created a State level management group that includes representation from  		various State departments, the Foster Parents Association and community service  		organizations. New York does not have a centralized planning body, but does  		have a network of dedicated professionals who provide services and coordinate  		services to some extent by staying in contact with each other.</p>
<p>Service providers in all three cities were so engrossed in meeting the  		present pressing and undermet needs of children with AIDS that none had any  		plans for how to respond to the projected increases in HIV infected children.  		Although most hospitals visited appeared to be able to handle their present  		caseloads of children with HIV infection, they also appeared to be at their  		limit in terms of physical space, staff and resources.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>This study has identified a number of key issues and problems in  		attempting to deliver services that have been encountered by the three cities  		with the greatest prevalence of children with AIDS. Following is a discussion  		of the most pressing issues that were raised and implications for the  		future.</p>
<h3>A. Magnitude</h3>
<p>There is a large discrepancy between the reported number of AIDS cases  		in children and the number of HIV infected children in need of services.  		Characterization of the magnitude of the problem of AIDS in children has  		focused on the number of AIDS cases reported to CDC when in fact the number of  		children in need of services may be 2.5 to 15 times greater. The total number  		of pediatric AIDS cases reported to CDC by New York, New Jersey and Florida was  		429, which contrasts with a total of 860 cases of HIV infected children that  		have actually been treated by the hospitals visited during the site visits.  		This total also does not include children treated in other cities and hospitals  		not included in the site visits, or unknown cases. Other areas report similar  		discrepancies. Washington, D.C. reported eight cases of children with AIDS and  		116 HIV infected children, and Georgia reported 16 cases of children with AIDS  		and 56 HIV infected children.</p>
<p>Projections for the number of cases by 1991 range from 3,000 official  		AIDS cases to 20,000 HIV infected children. The mortality rate for AIDS is 61  		percent nationwide, so the number of children in need of services won't be as  		high. However, the mortality rates for ARC and HIV infection are unknown, but  		can be assumed to be lower. Projections have focused on the year 1991, and this  		has detracted from the reality that the problem will continue to grow in 1992,  		1993 and for some undetermined time into the future.</p>
<p>The concentration of AIDS cases in children in New York, New Jersey and  		Florida has lessened over the last few years. This is not an indication that  		their numbers have decreased or that their problems have eased, but instead is  		an indication that other states/cities are experiencing growing numbers and  		will soon need to deal with the same problems New York, Newark, and Miami have  		faced. In preparing service delivery approaches, cities and States that are new  		to the problem should consider the total number of HIV infected children to  		estimate demand for services.</p>
<p>The continual increase in the number of infants, children and  		adolescents with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS has greater impact on the health  		and social service system than adults with HIV/ARC/AIDS. Children are more  		dependent for obtaining access to the health care and social service system,  		they cannot manage their own affairs, and they have a more immediate need for  		medical management and social services. Studies have demonstrated that AIDS in  		children progresses more rapidly than in adults.</p>
<h3>B. Health and Social Service Care System Demands</h3>
<p>The site visits illustrated the demands that the AIDS epidemic has  		placed on the health and social service care systems. The population in need of  		services is an already needy population, typically black, Haitian or Hispanic,  		IV drug abusers and single parent families. Added to the problems perpetuated  		by these conditions is that, often with the discovery of an HIV infected child  		comes the discovery of an HIV infected parent and/or sibling, and ultimately  		social ostracism, illness and death. The immediacy of AIDS has highlighted the  		fragmented nature of the care systems, and the eligibility and processing  		problems inherent in these systems. The additional needs of this population  		stress an already overburdened health and social service delivery system and  		heighten the need for new perspectives on service delivery, including a family  		focus and better coordination of services.</p>
<p>There is a need to make available specialized services for this  		population. HIV infected/ARC/AIDS children and their families require frequent  		transportation to health care and specialized medical facilities--and these  		services are sorely lacking. Many of the children with ARC/AIDS suffer from  		neurologic symptoms which lead to developmental disabilities. These children  		require specialized early childhood education programs, which are in very short  		supply. The general population's fears about AIDS transmission exacerbates this  		problem by excluding the ARC/AIDS children from normal educational settings.  		Finally, the caretakers of children with HIV infection/ARC/AIDS, be they  		parents, foster parents, adoptive parents, or extended family members, need  		respite care--facilities that are prepared to accept and manage these children  		for short periods of time. Respite care facilities are almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>Other issues that need to be addressed include coordinated medical care  		for parents and children, day care for infected children and their infected  		siblings, assistance to parents in planning for guardianship arrangements in  		the event of their death, and psychosocial support in dealing with the stress  		of their situation. There are children infected with HIV who act out because of  		the disruption caused by the disease, or who will have to deal with the future  		situation of parental and/or sibling death and loss of a family and/or home.  		There is a need for early and close coordination between the hospital and the  		social service systems.</p>
<p>Even without the advent of the AIDS epidemic, the foster care system has  		been experiencing difficulties. The available pool of new foster parents has  		been decreasing, because of the increase of women working outside the home and  		because of inadequate reimbursement rates. A child with HIV infection, ARC or  		AIDS stresses the foster care system even further, because of the specialized  		needs, concerns and perceived stigma. It has been difficult to recruit foster  		parents for these children. There is a need for specialized training for  		potential foster parents in caring for these children, infection control  		procedures, and dealing with confidentiality of medical information to  		determine "who needs to know" about the child's HIV-infection. There is also a  		need to offer additional support and relief to these parents. Foster care  		reimbursement must be at a level that is appropriate for the childrens'/foster  		parents' needs, including social and respite care support. There is a need to  		expand the pool of potential foster parents by recruiting extended family  		members (grandparents, aunts, uncles) and by considering multiple child  		placements within a foster home. There is also a need for greater  		responsiveness of the system in qualifying families for services.</p>
<p>The use of the CDC AIDS case definition to determine eligibility for  		services and financial support has excluded a major portion of the population  		in need from obtaining services. The case definition was originally implemented  		for disease surveillance purposes, and its use for other purposes has proven to  		be inappropriate.</p>
<h3>C. Boarder Babies</h3>
<p>Much of the media attention and legislative response to the needs of  		AIDS in children has focused on the "boarder baby" problem. As illustrated  		during the site visits, boarder babies are one small part of the service needs  		of the population of HIV infected children. The extent of the boarder baby  		problem varies from city to city. New York has experienced the greatest  		problem, but some "boarder babies" may be waiting for arrangements for a  		parent, grandparent or other relative to assume responsibility and do not  		represent a long term problem.</p>
<p>Although the boarder baby problem is not large in sheer numbers, it is a  		continuing problem. As one child is placed, another may become medically ready  		for discharge and yet may have to stay in the hospital for lack of a foster  		home. The hospital cannot provide an adequately nurturing home environment for  		these children and the cost of care is excessive. Even a few boarder babies can  		place an undue burden on the system.</p>
<p>The boarder baby problem can become significant in the future because of  		the general lack of foster parents in the United States, the lack of foster  		parents willing to care for an HIV infected child, the increasing incidence and  		prevalence of children with HIV infection, and the increasing number of AIDS  		related deaths of parents who are still caring for their HIV infected children.  		The expense of handling a boarder baby can be as high as $200,000 per year and  		as medical expertise in extending the lives of HIV infected children increases,  		the costs for boarder babies in hospitals will increase accordingly. The  		boarder baby problem, however, should not detract from the other, more  		prevalent needs of HIV infected children and their parents.</p>
<h3>D. Financial Resources</h3>
<p>Several medical schools and their affiliated hospitals have sought and  		received federal research grants related to pediatric AIDS and HIV infection.  		Many of these research grants include the delivery of services related to the  		research protocols. This has allowed the medical school/affiliated hospital to  		acquire the services of nurses, social workers, and outreach workers and to  		provide better access to health and social services. The lack of availability  		of professionals in community organizations and agencies willing to provide  		services to HIV infected children has posed a problem to hospital care  		providers. This highlights a need for education and outreach to the community,  		as well as training and retraining of caregivers.</p>
<p>The grant dollars have allowed the recipient hospitals to become  		pediatric AIDS centers with medical and social service expertise. However, the  		grant monies are not a permanent solution. They provide short-term relief for  		selected populations served by the recipient hospitals. Furthermore, the grants  		will not be continued indefinitely and cannot begin to provide all the  		resources necessary for the services needed by the AIDS, ARC and HIV infected  		families.</p>
<p>This study also suggests the importance of enhanced reimbursement rates  		for foster families and enhanced salaries for professionals caring for HIV  		infected children. Reasons cited for enhanced rates and salaries included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Compensation for the added precautions necessary to reduce the  			 child's risk of infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compensation for the caregivers increased emotional stress and  			 demands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide a financial incentive to prospective caregivers</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>E. Planning</h3>
<p>Community planning of services for children with HIV infection should  		take into account the special needs of this population. It should consider that  		"AIDS in children is AIDS in families." These families have unique and  		expensive needs requiring specialized medical care, in-home services, and  		income and psychosocial support, to name a few. Some of the current population  		of HIV infected children will die, some will survive and eventually enter the  		school system, and others will manifest severe disabilities and require  		supportive services. All of these groups will pose new sets of issues for  		communities to address. In the future, as these children approach adolescence,  		some will experiment with drugs and sex, thereby placing others at risk. There  		are presently more than 200 adolescents with AIDS. Uninfected adolescents are  		also a potential reservoir for acquiring new infection because of sexual and  		drug abuse experimentation. Specialized educational and outreach programs are  		needed to reach this population. Communities will face the need to plan for  		primary and secondary prevention activities with special emphasis on groups  		that are difficult to reach. Communities need to be aware of the complex  		service needs posed by the AIDS epidemic in infants, children, adolescents and  		their families, and to focus specialized outreach and prevention programs to  		this group.</p>
<p>In addition to planning for the present needs of the current population  		of HIV infected children and their changing needs as they grow older,  		communities must also be prepared to plan for the increasing number of children  		that will be born with HIV infection.</p>
<p>Even in cities that have maximized resources and provided effective  		coordination of services for the present population of HIV infected children,  		any significant increase in AIDS stricken children may have an overwhelming  		impact upon resources and personnel. It may result in an increase of boarder  		babies and create a major additional burden on hospitals, foster care placement  		agencies, and other service providers. It could also magnify the financial  		drain upon Medicaid and other financial aid programs.</p>
<p>As the number of cases rises in cities that have not yet had to deal  		with large numbers of HIV infected children and their accompanying problems and  		needs, plans will have to be made to target resources to address these needs.  		The early experiences of New York, New Jersey and Miami can lend some guidance  		to these cities' planning processes to help alleviate potential problems in  		service delivery.</p>
<p>Miami's planning approach, which includes a centralized regional  		planning group with a broad range of community representatives and one AIDS  		services contracting source, appears to be the best equipped to handle the  		likely increased number of cases. Planning for AIDS in children should be  		included within a community AIDS planning process for all AIDS-stricken  		populations but should focus on the unique issues and circumstances of HIV  		infected children. The planning process should involve those providing direct  		services to children with HIV infection and their families. A planning process  		that is too far removed from the service deliverers may not have the  		appropriate interactions needed to design effective and coordinated responses  		to service needs.</p>
<p>The evolving nature of the epidemic of AIDS in children calls for  		continual monitoring of trends in case numbers, service demands and economic  		impact, as well as changing opinions about testing, screening, confidentiality,  		community acceptance and support. All of these result in shifts that may  		outdate present solutions. Such forces argue for periodically evaluating the  		situation, planning for change, and anticipating increasing or different  		pressures upon the system. It became apparent that these and other issues  		demanded further attention and study. These issues are outlined in  		<a href="#appendJ">Appendix J</a>. Each community planning process must have an  		element that relates these continued changes specifically to the service  		delivery approaches for children with HIV infection.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>A family with AIDS is usually poor and hispanic at black. They are  		subject to an atmosphere of stigma and condemnation. Caring for children with  		AIDS requires multifaceted assistance to the entire family, including helping  		parents cope with denial, sorrow, guilt; mobilizing family support; making  		child custody arrangements; changing sexual behaviors to prevent transmission;  		and obtaining income support, medical care, and housing assistance. Services  		and education must be given in a culturally sensitive way to be effective.  		Poverty and drug abuse are major contributors to the spread of AIDS and must be  		addressed. Ignorance, fear and discrimination can block the delivery of  		services, once social workers can identify their own concerns they will be  		better able to help other professions.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Pediatric AIDS occurs predominantly in children of poor and minority  		families, where one or both parents are drug abusers. Problems in foster care  		placement have arisen from agencies' reluctance or refusal to place a child  		with AIDS and difficulty in finding parents willing to take a child with AIDS.  		The foster care agency must communicate accurately the nature of the illness  		without overly frightening potential foster parents, yet cannot falsely  		minimize the risks. Foster parents caring for a child with AIDS face special  		challenges:</p>
<ul><li>ostracism in obtaining needed services (dental, school, etc.)</li>
<li>ostracism among friends and neighbors</li>
<li>frequent visits to medical centers and managing medication  		  regimen</li>
<li>recurrent and serious medical crises, and potential loss of the  		  child</li>
</ul><p><strong>Issues/Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<p>Child welfare agencies are caught between the legitimate needs to  		protect foster families and place children in need. Challenge for agencies to  		identify, train and intensively support foster parents.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Children with AIDS and their families present challenges to human  		service agencies and the multiple problems produced by AIDS require a high  		degree of collaboration and cooperation among agencies, workers and families.  		25% of children in Children's Hospital in Newark are already in foster care  		before AIDS is diagnosed. Foster care parents need special assistance. Agencies  		often refuse to provide services, and service workers in public and private  		companies often don't understand how AIDS is transmitted. Concealing the  		diagnosis may obtain service but does nothing to improve accessibility.  		Services needed include transportation, respite care, baby sitting, home care,  		help in obtaining benefits, emotional support and counseling, basic training  		and education for service workers, resource materials, recruitment and training  		for foster parents, use of consultants with expertise in Health care for AIDS  		children and support groups for workers and foster parents.</p>

<p>Until publication of this article, no standard definitions for  		manifestations of HIV infections in children had been produced. Since passively  		transferred maternal HIV antibody can persist for up to 15 months in the child,  		two definitions of AIDS were defined--one for infants and children up to 15  		months of age who have acquired the disease perinatally and another for older  		children with perinatal infections and children of all ages who acquired HIV  		through other means. An accompanying editorial states that the infected child  		is usually the first to be symptomatic and stresses the need to evaluate other  		members of the family--particularly the mother.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Ho <b>et. al.</b> offers an excellent, updated and comprehensive review  		of the mechanism of disease genesis by the Human Immunodeficiency virus. The  		primary clinical syndromes resulting from HIV infection are AIDS and AIDS  		dementia complex (also called subacute encephalitis and AIDS encephalopathy).  		The author's review of the literature demonstrates that approximately 60% of  		AIDS patients have neurologic symptoms, and 80-90% are found to have  		neuropathologic changes at necropsy. Subacute encephalitis is the most common  		neurologic problem in AIDS and is characterized by poor memory, inability to  		concentrate, apathy and psychomoter retardation. In addition, focal motor  		abnormalities and behavioral changes may occur, leading to a full-blown  		dementia complex.</p>
<p>The article also reviews the persistence of HIV, concluding that very  		little cell-free virus is found in infected persons and that less than 0.01% of  		circulating lymphocytes express detectable HIV messenger RNA. Thus, much of the  		HIV appears <b>not</b> to be susceptible to immune clearance!</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Guidelines regarding education have been established by NEA, CDC and  		AAP. All three recommend that only those most likely to infect others be  		excluded froin public school. NEA and CDC also have guidelines for foster care  		and day care. Many states have adopted policies on educational placement  		similar to CDC's and NEA's. A few have made sane significant changes (e.g.,  		requiring notification of school system and department of health when a case is  		diagnosed). By 1985, nine states had enacted some form of AIDS legislation, a  		relatively small number deal with pediatric AIDS. Some legal challenges have  		arisen; the NY court decision upholding the cities policy to allow AIDS  		children to attend school is summarized. This is an important case since tne  		policy was modeled after CDC's recommendation.</p>
<p>Issues about public care of children with AIDS have not received as much  		attention. Although CDC's recommendations address day care and foster care,  		they recommend restricted day care for preschool AIDS victims, and screening  		high risk children in foster care of adoption agencies. Several state agencies'  		policies are described.</p>
<p><strong>Issues/Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Foster and adoptive parents need to be aware of existence of AIDS to  		  ensure proper medical care and precautions</li>
<li>Agencies could be found liable if they fail to alert families</li>
<li>CDC's guidelines are being widely accepted</li>
<li>Welfare agencies seem to be recognizing the low level of risk of  		  transmission and policies are reflecting this</li>
<li>Policies are stressing public education and awareness</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Data on Medicaid costs are limited. Most cases are paid for by private  		insurance or Medicaid. Drug abusers are more likely to rely on public funding.  		The 1983 SSA directive; person with diagnosis of AIDS is presumed to be  		disabled, makes these persons eligible for Medicaid if they also meet income  		and resource standards for SSI. (Families on AFDC are automatically eligible  		for Medicaid). MI and MD have collected limited data on Medicaid expenditures.  		In MI, the average cost per patient was $52,230 with average of 20-month  		eligibility. In MD average was between $13,000 and $18,800 per patient with  		8-month eligibility. MediCal (CA Medicaid) reported $59,000 average cost per  		patient. Costs can vary between high risk groups and the infections they are  		likely to have. San Francisco General Hospital's low costs of $25-32,000 per  		patient may be attributable to their comprehensive case management approach.  		Two types of Medicaid waivers may improve Medicaid coverage for AIDS patients:  		Freedom of choice waivers and home and community-based model waivers. Both  		require data showing cost savings of alternatives as compared to traditional  		hospital care.</p>
<p><strong>Issues/Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Impact of AIDS on Medicaid costs is unclear</li>
<li>As more IV drug users, their spouses and children become infected  		  with AIDS, the Medicaid costs will rise and will impact on state budgets</li>
<li>States may need to use wavier programs more extensively to provide  		  alternative, cost-reduced care</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Celeste Carrion, age 9 and brother both have AIDS. Mother died of AIDS  		and the father also has AIDS. The children now live with their grandmother.  		They represent the typical pediatric AIDS case--poor, hispanic (or black), and  		drug addicted parent(s) who also have AIDS. Dr. James Okeske, from College of  		Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey estimates that the number of pediatric  		AIDS cases could reach 20,000 by 1991. In New York, an estimated 1,000  		HIV-infected babies will be born this year. In the past year there have been  		nine cases in New York in whicl neither parent abused drugs but the mother's  		former lover did, an indication that the problem could move into the  		heterosexual non drug abusing population.</p>
<p>Those dealing with pediatric AIDS predict that the system cannot handle  		the problem; there has been resistance among health care professionals to  		provide services, and the general public is overreacting with fear. Money is  		needed for medical research, treatment and foster care.</p>
<p>About half of the babies born to AIDS-infected mothers have been  		infected; symptoms often don't appear for 3-4 months. Early treatment is  		important because AIDS tends to cause bacterial infections and babies can die  		from the infection very quickly. Some doctors use gamma globulin treatment;  		others are skeptical of its success relative to its expense--about $18,000 per  		patient per year. Another experimental drug, AZT, is currently being tested in  		30 children. The Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the Newark  		Children's Hospital see many pediatric AIDS cases and sue multidisciplinary  		support teams to treat the many medical needs of the patients, including  		psychologists, physical therapists, speech specialists, and counselors.  		Counseling the family is as important as treating the child.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Personal medical costs estimated at $630 million (1985), $1.1 billion  		(1986) and $8.5 billion in 1991.</p>
<p>Nonpersonal costs (research, testing, education, support services $319  		million (1985), $542 million (1986) to $2.3 billion in 1991.</p>
<p>Loss of productivity (premature mortality) $3.9 billion (1985), $7  		billion (1986) to $55.6 billion in 1991.</p>
<p>Offer a very useful formula:</p>
<p>Cost = N<sub>(total cases above</sub> x [(a x b x c) + d]a =  		admissions/case b = # hospital days per admissionc = change/hospital  		dayd = outpatient charge per case</p>
<p><strong>Issues/Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<p><b>Overall</b>, cost is estimated at $66 billion in 1991. The subcost  		for children with AIDS must be higher, as (1) hospital stays are longer, (2)  		loss of productivity is greater.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Group calculates direct inpatient care for adult gay men in San  		Francisco General Hospital to be $27,571 from diagnosis to death (224 days on  		average). Number of hospital admissions, 3.2, days in hospital per admission  		was 34.7</p>
<p><strong>Issues/Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<p>Estimates for direct cost for children can be expected to be higher, as  		children live longer, and stay in the hospital longer.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This was one of the first publications linking AIDS to infants. The data  		is limited because it was before testing was available for AIDS antibody. The  		key finding is that a high proportion of infants were premature--38%  		(10/26).</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>The article reviews the clinical description of AIDS and its  		pathogenesis and transmission. New Jersey ranks 5th in the number of AIDS  		cases; the vast majority of which are located in the Newark area. The most  		typical AIDS patients in this area are IV drug abusers. It is estimated that  		among the 35,000 IV drug abuser populations, two out of three are HIV infected.  		Their sexual partners and offspring are at high risk of becoming infected.  		Infants are also at high risk for low birth weight, drug withdrawal and  		environmental and emotional deprivation. The median age of onset of AIDS is six  		months; very few survive over an extended period of time. Educating high risk  		women is important and presents a challenge.</p>

<p> Major issues identified by these contacts included:</p>
<ul><li>Cities/states denial of the problem (not affected yet)</li>
<li>Need for education</li>
<li>Affects all aspects of child welfare system</li>

<li>Major issues or barriers identified include guidelines for adoption,  		  funding for disability and confidentiality</li>
<li>AIDS problems are new; it is universally fatal, has stigma attached  		  to it and is venereally transmitted.</li>
</ul><h3>Summary--Congressional Staff</h3>
<p>A number of different bills have been introduced in both the House and  		Senate, some specific to children with AIDS and some in response to the AIDS  		problem in general with provisions that would impact on children with AIDS.  		There have also been several different hearings held.</p>
<p>A variety of issues were identified by the Senate, Representative and  		Committee staff contacted. These included:</p>
<ul><li>Problems with Medicare/Medicaid processing </li>
<li>Fragmented services, lack of coordination between social services and  		  health care</li>
<li>Future impact on Medicaid--AIDS is a high cost category--how will  		  this impact on basic health care covered by Medicaid?</li>
<li>Payment demands (nonreimbursed care)</li>
<li>Array of services required</li>
<li>Limited understanding of the disease--difficult to predict future  		  needs</li>
<li>These children are not only medically fragile, but already part of an  		  impoverished, minority, population. </li>
<li>Problems encountered are <b>old</b> problems/pitfalls in the  		  system--AIDS simply exacerbates and brings to the forefront these  		  problems.</li>
</ul><h3>Summary--Minority and AIDS Service Organizations</h3>
<p>The National Urban League felt that the public knows little or nothing  		about the pediatric AIDS problem and that there is very little information  		being disseminated to the general public. Minority organizations need  		resources--specifically dollars--for launching an information/education effort  		through their affiliated chapters. In addition, it was felt that the Federal  		Government should provide leadership in this area because of its potential  		magnitude. An invitation was extended to visit the local affiliates in New  		York, Newark and Miami during the site analysis phase of the project.</p>
<p>The Minority Task Force on AIDS of the Council of Churches, City of New  		York is fully involved in delivery of services to AIDS families. There is a  		strong desire to maintain family structure during the management of AIDS in  		families. Suggestions were made for welfare reform to allow case management for  		the family, as opposed to individuals. An "AIDS Care Corps" was recommended  		along the lines of the Peace Corps. The Corps would be federally operated and  		fund local personnel to act as homemakers, counselors, companions, and  		surrogate parents to AIDS families. The primary reason for federal management  		of the program is to bypass the union limitations and job categories which  		presently exist at the local level. In addition, the present system of support  		to AIDS families cannot be sustained by volunteers for an indefinite time  		period. Other suggestions included:</p>
<ol><li>Need to allow cross-race adoption</li>
<li>Need to work with and support women coming out of prison</li>
<li>Need specially allocated funds for providing appropriate nutrition  		  and food preparation training to women</li>
<li>Need to make telephone service a necessity</li>
<li>Need allowances for travel--hospital, day care, etc. </li>
</ol><p>The National Conference of Puerto Rican Women is in the planning stages  		for an adolescent pregnancy media campaign. They have been asked by the federal  		contractor to add in information about AIDS and pediatric AIDS. The  		organization felt very strongly that there is a great need for AIDS awareness  		to at risk females and their partners: at hangouts, methadone programs and via  		specialized media. In addition, there is not enough foster care services for  		children with AIDS.</p>
<p>COSSSMHO, an Hispanic coordinating organization noted that they are part  		of an advisory group for the Ford Foundation for analyzing the pediatric AIDS  		problem into the year 2000. The group has made projections, but no information  		can be released until the Ford Foundation Board of Trustees reviews and  		approves the material. However, site visits to organizations and facilities  		working on the pediatric AIDS problem has led the group to appreciate the fact  		that pediatric AIDS is a family issue, and that the health care system is very  		sympathetic to AIDS babies, but not to their HIV infected, or AIDS parents.  		COSSMHO believes that the system has generally not reached the groups at  		highest risk for health related problems--AIDS only magnifies the problem  		COSSMHO feels that there should be greater work with child abuse and sexual  		abuse groups as well as with the Justice Department which has, and funds, major  		outreach projects.</p>
<h3>Summary--Federal Agencies</h3>
<p>The Office of Minority Health of the Office of the Assistant Secretary  		for Health felt that finances were the critical issue related to pediatric  		AIDS. Pediatric AIDS also demonstrates major geographic differences, such that  		cities like New York will, face severe fiscal crises, including hospital  		closings and hospitals picking and choosing AIDS patients. Pediatric AIDS is a  		minority problem. It compounds the many other health related problems already  		facing this group. Pediatric AIDS will have many more survivors than with adult  		AIDS, most will be unprovided for. A recommendation was made to review and  		refer to Secretary Heckler's Report on Minority Health to appreciate the impact  		of other major health problems on the minority communities of the United  		States.</p>
<p>Health Resources and Services Administration has focused its activities  		on planning and holding AIDS meetings for constituency groups, specifically,  		AAP and ACOG. The Surgeon General's "Workshop on Children with HIV Infection  		and their Families" (April 6-9, 1987) offered a series of recommendations.  		Several of the key points are:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Need ongoing education and training of health professionals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education efforts should not be a "one shot" activity, need  			 ongoing repetitive efforts, which happen to be very manpower dependent (labor  			 intensive).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>HRSA outlined four areas of importance in pediatric AIDS:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The need for early detection for high risk women. Women should be  			 provided the opportunity for confidential testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a need to assist school communities in creating policies  			 for dealing with AIDS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must work out strategies for dealing with adolescents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look into the New Jersey program for dealing with boarder babies,  			 specifically the use and funding of group homes.</p>

<h2><a name="appendI" id="appendI">APPENDIX I. SITE VISIT SUMMARIES</a></h2>
<h3>A. New York City</h3>
<p>The New York City site visit took place from October 26-29, 1987. The  		site team included Mr. Martin Kotler, Dr. Stephen Margolis and Ms. Lela  		Baughman of MACRO and Mr. Jerry Silverman of ASPE.</p>
<h4>1. Organizations Visited</h4>
<p>Three hospitals/medical centers, in three boroughs of New York were  		visited, including Harlem Hospital in Manhattan, Einstein medical School/Center  		in the Bronx and SUNY Downstate/Kings County Medical Center in Brooklyn.  		Ninety-six percent of New York City's AIDS or AIDS related illnesses in  		children are managed by these units.</p>
<p>The Regional Administrator and staff members of the DHHS Region II  		Office were interviewed because of their interest in the "boarder baby" problem  		related to AIDS. The staff had prepared a report on "boarder babies" in New  		York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>New York City personnel interviewed included the Commissioner of Health,  		the Deputy Commissioner for Community Services, the Director of AIDS  		Surveillance, and the Director of Special Services for Children.</p>
<p>Staff of the State of New York Division of Substance Abuse were  		interviewed because approximately 79 percent of children with AIDS are related  		to a parent who is an IV drug abuser (AIDS Surveillance Update).</p>
<p>The President and Chief Operating officer of Hale House and Hale House  		Cradle, a home for totally abandoned or temporarily placed children and infants  		was visited. in addition, the Leake and Watt's Children's Home, which places  		children in foster care was interviewed by telephone.</p>
<h4>2. Magnitude of the Problem</h4>
<p>As of September 30, 1987, the City of New York reported a total of 221  		cases of AIDS in children, according to the official CDC case definition, of  		which 161 cases, 73 percent had died by the reporting date. Seventy-nine  		percent of the cases were the probable result of maternal transmission where  		one or both parents were IV drug abusers, or the mother was a former sex  		partner of an IV drug abuser. 59 percent of mothers of pediatric AIDS cases are  		black, 32 percent Hispanic and nine percent are white.</p>
<p>The City of New York does not routinely perform HIV antibody tests on  		pregnant women or neonates. All available HIV antibody seropositivity  		information were from small-scale studies currently in progress. According to  		the AIDS Surveillance Unit, there have been approximately 500 case of AIDS  		Related Complex (ARC) and a "guesstimate" of 2,000 seropositive infants and  		children, cumulatively. In addition, the reporting system in place in New York  		City has been checked and found to match in 94 percent of reported cases. Many  		studies are being developed, or have begun that will increase the database  		related to children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS in New York.</p>
<p>In a pilot, prospective prenatal care study with seropositive, pregnant  		women, only nine percent chose to terminate their pregnancy after counseling  		efforts. Only two measles related deaths in children with AIDS who have been  		immunized with live virus vaccines have been noted.</p>
<p>The City of New York has approximately a total of 18,500 children in  		foster care placement. There are approximately 100 ARC/AIDS children in foster  		care of which 14 died during the last year. During September, 1987, 35 infants  		and children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS who were medically ready for  		discharge from a hospital were still in residence or "boarder babies." This  		represents 80 percent of all boarder babies in New York City.</p>
<p>Predictions have been made concerning the future magnitude of the  		pediatric HIV/ARC/AIDS problem for New York City. The CDC predicts that by 1991  		there will be a cumulative total of 3,000 officially defined pediatric AIDS  		cases in the United States, approximately 1,000 of which will be in New York.  		The Health Department of the city of New York predicts approximately 10,000  		cumulative pediatric HIV/ARC/AIDS cases in the United States. The State of New  		York Substance Abuse Agency predicts that approximately 2,000 HIV/ARC/AIDS  		children will be born to IV drug abusing mothers by 1991. This projection is  		based upon 50,000 IV drug abusing women and 100,000 sexual partners of IV drug  		abusers in New York City.</p>
<h4>3. Description and Response of the System</h4>
<p>Children with AIDS, ARC or who are HIV antibody seropositive in New York  		City are first managed by one of the major hospital centers. The types of  		services offered to both the children and their parents is a function of the  		staff and resources of the hospital.</p>
<p><b>Harlem Hospital</b>. The Harlem Hospital pediatrics unit has a  		dedicated Chief of Pediatrics and an AIDS team composed of one physician for  		six to eight hospitalized HIV infected children. Harlem Hospital is dependent  		on tax levy funds and is underfunded, and this has led to periodic shortages in  		necessary pharmaceuticals. In addition, it has been very difficult to fill open  		positions for nurses and social workers.</p>
<p>The pediatric unit has 60 beds, and cumulatively, 60 HIV infected  		children have been managed on the unit since 1982. The maximum number of HIV  		infected children on the unit at any one time has been 12.</p>
<p>An analysis of the cost for caring for 37 children with HIV infection  		since 1982, has been $3,362,596, of which 30 percent of the hospital days and  		20 percent of the cost have been estimated as unnecessary for medical reasons.  		The per diem ranged from $300 to $2,400, with an average of $500.</p>
<p>The staff has not been able to plan for increases in HIV infected  		children or increases in boarder babies expected over the next four years. The  		Harlem Hospital AIDS Unit has attracted a lot of recent national attention,  		including a visit by the Administrator of HCFA and the Surgeon General of the  		United States.</p>
<p>Harlem Hospital, serving one of the poorest and most heavily drug  		infected areas in the country, has limited resources to apply to pediatric  		AIDS. In addition to lack of funds, difficulty in recruiting personnel, the  		complexity and intricacies of coordinating Medicaid, AFDC, SSI and other  		financial support programs pose serious obstacles to appropriate care and  		availability of social support for the children and families in desperate need.  		For example, the bureaucratic intricacies in providing appropriate support for  		a grandmother to care for an AIDS infected youngster could not be surmounted,  		and the child has remained in the hospital for over two years. This unfortunate  		outcome occurred despite pleas made by the Chief of Pediatrics to high placed  		city, regional and Federal officials. One official returned to Harlem Hospital  		with $191 and a box of used toys that were the result of a collection taken up  		by office personnel in lieu of an ability to generate and make the system  		responsive to obvious patient and family needs.</p>
<p><b>Albert Einstein Medical School</b>. The Albert Einstein Medical  		School/Center complex handles 34 percent of New York City's HIV infected  		children. There are four hospitals, geographically dispersed within the Bronx,  		that are involved in the Einstein consortium: Montefiore Hospital, Einstein  		College Hospital, Jacobi Hospital and North Central Bronx Hospital. Each  		hospital has different medical specializations and children/infants in need of  		hospitalization are placed in the appropriate facility.</p>
<p>The Einstein consortium has two major AIDS pediatric immunology grants  		from NIH which allow HIV infected children/infants to be enrolled in either an  		immunoglobin therapy study or a perinatal transmission study. They also receive  		funding from the State, and a Robert Wood Johnson Grant for Comprehensive  		Family Care. Physician, nurse and social worker positions are covered by the  		funding sources for the studies and for relevant service delivery.</p>
<p>Approximately 300 seropositive children/infants are presently enrolled  		in the immunoglobin therapy study on an outpatient basis, of which  		approximately 30 symptomatic children require short stay admissions on a  		biweekly basis. Today, if a child/infant is HIV seropositive, a nurse and  		social worker can evaluate the home situation. In addition, there is an AIDS  		pediatric hotline and specialized service delivery components available to  		families and their HIV infected children.</p>
<p>In 1984 there were four to six ARC/AIDS boarder babies, but all of them  		have since been placed in foster care.</p>
<p>The Einstein staff opposes the use of group/congregate care facilities.  		Their feeling is that foster care, with the easing of extended family member  		eligibility, and additional respite care and specialized day care for working  		foster parents could handle the boarder baby problem. They are also concerned  		that group care will increase the likelihood of transmission of opportunistic  		infection among AIDS infected infants.</p>
<p>The staff has planned for the projected increases in HIV infected  		children or boarder babies over the next four years.</p>
<p><b>SUNY Downstate Kings County</b>. The SUNY Downstate/Kings County  		complex has managed 110 pediatric HIV infected children since 1981, of which 44  		have died. Children are admitted to either the King County Hospital or the  		Downstate medical Center. There are three to four children hospitalized at any  		one time; however, there have been as many as eight to nine hospitalized. There  		has been a total of seven boarder babies. Daily costs are $552 per day.</p>
<p>The SUNY Downstate/Kings County group have major pediatric AIDS research  		grants which allows the staffing and servicing of their HIV infected children.  		A study carried out at the medical center revealed that 2 percent of the  		pregnant women coming for prenatal care are HIV seropositive, and 58 percent of  		those infected admitted or knew of any involvement in high risk behavior.</p>
<p>Another study of 28 ARC/AIDS infants, demonstrated that 27 had  		neurological deficits and 85 percent failed to thrive. The staff has not  		planned for the projected increases in the number of HIV infected children, or  		increase in boarder babies over the next four years. There was a general  		feeling on the part of the SUNY Downstate/Kings County Staff that voluntary  		child service agencies and New York City agencies were not actively and  		vigorously dealing with HIV infected, ARC or AIDS children, and that this  		needed to be corrected. In addition, there have been breeches of  		confidentiality within these agencies.</p>
<p>The group felt that there was a need for use of extended family members  		and community members as foster care parents and that there was a need for a  		day care/respite facility near the medical complex. The staff strongly opposes  		the use of congregate care homes.</p>
<p><b>Foster Care Services</b>. The City of New York has approximately  		18,500 children in foster care placement. There are approximately 100 ARC/AIDS  		children in foster care of which 14 died during the last year. The majority of  		HIV positive children in foster care were placed before their seropositivity  		was known. During September, 1987, 35 infants and children with HIV infection,  		ARC or AIDS who were medically ready for discharge from a hospital were still  		in residence or 'boarder babies." This represents 80 percent of all boarder  		babies in New York City.</p>
<p>Foster care is handled by New York City's Special Services for Children  		(SSC). SSC contracts with a number of agencies to assist in foster care  		placement. The primary agencies for foster care placement of children with AIDS  		are the Leake and Watts Children's Home, New York Foundling home, and the  		Archdiocese of New York. New York City has authorized the payment of $1,134 per  		month to foster parents of HIV seropositive children. This compares to the  		regular rate of $165-$342 per month depending upon age, and the special rate  		for special needs children (handicaps, boarder babies, other hard-to-place) of  		$748/month. There are additional allowances for clothing and other  		miscellaneous expenses which are determined on a per child basis by the  		contracting agency.</p>
<p>Two draft documents have been promulgated related to foster care for HIV  		infected children, namely: "New York City HIV Testing Policy for Foster  		Boarding Home Children" and the "Department of Health Protocol for Implementing  		HIV Testing: Policy For Foster Boarding Home Children." These policies mandate  		a training requirement for foster parents of HIV seropositive children; define  		a stringent mechanism for testing of foster children; outline the appropriate  		confidentiality issues related to testing; and ensure that seropositive  		children will be retested every three months.</p>
<p>The SSC is in the process of putting into place alternate models for  		managing families with AIDS, namely: recruiting homemakers for assignment to  		AIDS families; and creating congregate shelters for AIDS families. The City of  		New York is handling social service costs related to HIV infected children, but  		would like to see changes in New York State Medicaid reimbursement, homemaker  		services and foster care funding.</p>
<p>The Leake and Watts Children's Home has created a special division to  		handle foster care placement of HIV infected children. Twenty-four infected  		children have been placed in a 24-month period. The agency was originally  		utilized by the Einstein consortium, but is now under contract to New York  		City's SSC. It receives a stipend of $100/day/child from SSC for administrative  		activities. Each foster parent of a symptomatic HIV infected child receives  		$1,134/month which is a pass through from SSC. The agency determines an  		additional stipend ranging from $400-$800 per month for special needs and the  		placement of a home helper, under special circumstances. This comes out of the  		agencies' administrative reimbursements. The agency social workers dealing with  		HIV infected children are paid an additional $3,000 per year. Leake and Watts  		have been able to find people who are interested in becoming foster parents.  		Their best source has been referral from families who already are foster  		parents.</p>
<p>Hale House and the newly formed Hale House Cradle are designed as  		temporary homes for women and their children, or for the temporary housing of  		infants and children while the mothers are in drug treatment, incarcerated or  		recuperating. Mother Hale and her daughter Dr. Lorraine Hale are opposed to  		foster care because of a study showing the 60 percent of the studied children  		were sexually abused in foster homes. SSC funds Hale House at a rate of  		$161/day/child to manage up to 15 children, although they always have 20  		children in residence. The children range from newborn to three years of age  		and there are four HIV infected children in residence. Hale House does not lack  		finances or personnel, but it is desperately lacking an appropriate facility  		for future activities.</p>
<h3>B. Newark/Jersey City/Trenton</h3>
<p>The New Jersey visit took place on November 2 and 3, 1987 Ms. Lela  		Baughman and Dr. Stephen Margolis conducted the site visit.</p>
<h4>1. Organizations Visited</h4>
<p>Two hospitals in two major New Jersey cities were visited, including  		Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark and the Pediatrics Unit of the  		Jersey City Medical Center. In addition, interviews were conducted with  		personnel from the Community Health Care of North Jersey, a visiting nurse  		service which works very closely with the Children's Hospital of New Jersey and  		carries out home care management of HIV infected children.</p>
<p>The State of New Jersey has a pediatric AIDS committee that deals with  		social service, foster care and funding issues. The committee has the following  		membership who were interviewed: New Jersey Foster Parents Association; New  		Jersey State Central Region Administration; State of New Jersey Division of  		Youth and Family Services; the New Jersey Department of Health; the New Jersey  		Department of Education; and the Hyaninth Foundation.</p>
<p>The St. Claire's Home for Children in Elizabeth, New Jersey is a five  		child group home for HIV infected children. In addition, the organization  		operates the AIDS Resource Foundation for Children, in Newark, New Jersey. The  		personnel were interviewed at the Elizabeth facility.</p>
<h4>2. Magnitude of the Problem</h4>
<p>New Jersey, as of October 1, 1987, had 84 officially reported cases of  		AIDS in children. Seventy-five, or 89 percent of the pediatric AIDS cases were  		from a parent with, or at risk for AIDS. Sixty-two percent of the pediatric  		cases are black, 20 percent are Hispanic and 12 percent are white. The State of  		New Jersey is readjusting its reporting system to account for the expanded CDC  		AIDS definition and a review of the State's ARC registry, which contains  		approximately 3,000 adult and pediatric cases. As the State AIDS surveillance  		report concludes: "Because of the combined influence of these factors,  		predictions of trends are now extremely unreliable. When things settle down, we  		can estimate that there will be 50 percent more AIDS cases reported in any  		given time period than under the old definition. As we gather more data, we  		will be better able to expand our monthly surveillance reports to reflect the  		impact of the new changes."</p>
<p>There are 102 children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS known to the  		Division of Youth and Family Services. Twenty-two are in foster care, 62 at  		home, 12 in the hospital, five in a group home and one is missing or  		unknown.</p>
<p>The personnel of the Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark,  		calculate that there have been between 150-200 children with AIDS, ARC or  		symptomatic HIV infection treated at Children's hospital since 1981. The  		hospital is following 96 children, of whom 62 percent are black, two percent  		are of Haitian descent, 16 percent are Hispanic and 20 percent are white.  		Ninety percent of the 96 children had mothers who were IV drug abusers or  		sexual contacts to men at risk for AIDS. At any one time, 12-20 of the children  		from Newark with ARC or AIDS are managed by the visiting nurse service. The  		Jersey City Medical Center, the other primary management facility for HIV  		infected children, has registered 20 children with AIDS, of which three have  		died.</p>
<h4>3. Description and Response of the System </h4>
<p><b>Children's Hospital of New Jersey</b>. A great majority of AIDS  		patients in the Essex County area are handled by the Children's Hospital of New  		Jersey in Newark. The pediatric AIDS team of the Children's Hospital is  		composed of a pediatrician, a research nurse, a social worker, an  		administrative assistant and the visiting nurse service liaison.</p>
<p>The Newark hospital has a major AIDS treatment grant from the NIH, which  		supports the staffing of the unit.</p>
<p>There is no HIV testing at the primary delivery hospital, University  		Hospital, thus children are made known to Children's Hospital, mainly when they  		become symptomatic. Although Children's has seen between 150 and 200 children  		with HIV infection since the epidemic began, they are currently managing 90  		children and others are being managed by other facilities in the city. Five of  		the 90 children are HIV antibody positive and 85 have either ARC or AIDS and  		there have been 34 deaths (35 percent). Fifty-five of 60 children with ARC or  		AIDS were shown to have developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Children's Hospital Pediatric AIDS team has a very close working  		relationship with the Division of Youth and Family Services and the visiting  		nurse service, which allows for the coordination of medical and social  		services. In general children have rarely been abandoned (only 2-3 occasions),  		most stay with parent(s) or, if the parents are sick, then with extended  		family. There is need for an intermediate care facility, specifically a group  		home for mothers and their babies in need of medical care. In addition, the  		present pediatric facility at Children's Hospital is not large enough for the  		delivery of services.</p>
<p>The Community Health Care of North Jersey, the visiting nurse service,  		carries out an initial home visit with a hospital social worker to evaluate the  		status in the home. The Medicaid reimbursement for a home visit to pediatric  		patients is only $65 a visit. A non-AIDS home visit is usually of 30 minutes  		duration, but an AIDS visit can be 1.5 hours long. There is usually a need to  		offer services to the mother, but reimbursement can occur only under a separate  		referral mechanism and the parent and child home visits cannot be easily  		combined. Thus, there is need for a combined maternal and child health delivery  		approach. In addition, the visiting nurses require personal security because of  		the assault and robbery problems in the neighborhoods they visit. Further,  		hospital supply delivery services will not deliver to many sites without the  		visiting nurse's security guard accompanying them.</p>
<p>The City of Newark administration has until now virtually ignored the  		AIDS problem and the City Health Department has denied that there is a unique  		problem in Newark. These attitudes have a detrimental effect on the  		coordination and delivery of needed services to adults and children with AIDS.  		There is a new health commissioner, who has a community health background. The  		Health Department will be mounting a public education campaign which will be  		delivered with the water bill.</p>
<p>The AIDS Resource Foundation for Children is a Newark-based organization  		that carries on educational outreach in Newark, but has had to establish a  		transitional foster care residence for children with HIV in Elizabeth, Now  		Jersey. This residence, The St. Claire's Home for Children can handle up to  		five infants/children at any one time. There is always a waiting list. The Home  		receives moral and fiscal support form the St. Elizabeth Hospital, the New  		Jersey Department of Health and the Division of Youth and Family Services.  		Since the Home cannot increase above five children at any one time because of  		the prohibitive safety and alteration costs, there are plans to build several  		additional homes to handle children in Newark and in the Monmouth County  		section of New Jersey. It costs approximately $240/day/child ($60,000 per child  		per year). St. Claire's is not yet on a sound fiscal basis.</p>
<p><b>Jersey City Medical Center</b>. Hudson County, the home of the Jersey  		City Medical Center is second to Essex County (Newark) in reported AIDS cases.  		The Jersey City Medical Center handles approximately 3,000 deliveries per year  		and has a diverse patient population which is 40 percent black, 40 percent  		Hispanic and the remainder Indian, korean, Arabic speaking and white. Fourteen  		to 15 percent of this population receives no prenatal care and 60-70 percent  		are high risk deliveries (teenage mother, no prenatal care, drug use, infected  		with an STD). A study, ongoing since July 1985, has found 53 HIV antibody  		positive neonates. The boarder baby problem is not severe. There have been two  		children who spent up to five months in the hospital for non medical reasons.  		One of the children was successfully placed with a male gay foster couple. In  		addition, a media campaign to search for foster parents led to 60  		candidates.</p>
<p>Obtaining Medicaid coverage in Hudson County is a very complicated  		process. Three separate applications are needed and eligibility must be renewed  		every three months. This leads to the finding that 47 out of 100 high risk  		parents do not have Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>The medical center is involved in a gamma globulin therapy protocol for  		HIV positive children; however, it receives no special compensation or  		additional personal.</p>
<p>The staff of the Jersey City Medical Center felt that there was a lack  		of social service outreach activities, and transportation capabilities for  		their patient's' families.</p>
<h3>C. Miami/Dade County</h3>
<p>The site visit took place on November 17-19, 1987. The site visit team  		included Dr. J. William Flynt, Dr. Stephen Margolis, and Ms. Lela Baughman of  		Macro, and Ms. Ann Segal of ASPE.</p>
<h4>1. Organizations Visited </h4>
<p>The AIDS Program Manager for Dade County and the Executive Director of  		the primary community-based AIDS organization, "Health Crisis Network" were  		interviewed because of their involvement in community outreach programs. The  		Florida State Contracts Office and the South Florida AIDS Network were  		interviewed because of their involvement in the funding and management of AIDS  		programs for Dade County and South Florida. The primary health care facility,  		Jackson Memorial Hospital, and the primary child care/placement organization,  		Children's Home Society were visited to review the status of service delivery  		to children with HIV infection, ARC and/or AIDS. In addition, during the site  		visit, the team became aware of the activities of the Health Council of South  		Florida, and a special visit was arranged.</p>
<h4>2. Magnitude of the Problem </h4>
<p>Florida ranks third in the United States in officially reported  		pediatric AIDS cases. Although the official number of pediatric cases was 82  		(of which 32 have died) as of November 1987, the primary health care facility  		of South Florida has dealt with 190 HIV antibody positive, ARC or AIDS  		children, of which 60 have died. This primary hospital has approximately 14,000  		births per year and a projection of one to two percent HIV antibody positivity  		among pregnant women. AIDS boarder babies are not a major problem--there have  		been five, but one has been in the hospital for 2.5 years.</p>
<p>The vast majority of pediatric AIDS cases are among women of Haitian  		descent, living in Miami. There is very little AIDS related outreach and  		education taking place in the Haitian areas of Miami and many women do not  		understand, or refuse to appreciate their risk for AIDS virus infection and the  		potential for transfer to their offspring. This will have significant impact on  		the number of pediatric AIDS cases in Miami in the future. In addition, today,  		there does not appear to be a significant problem of pediatric AIDS where the  		parent is a drug abuser, or sexual partner of an IV drug abusers. Of the total  		caseload seen at Jackson Memorial, 25 percent are born to IV drug abusing  		women. This finding is somewhat surprising considering that 79 percent of the  		cases in New York are related to IV drug abuse and that Miami is reported to  		have a large IV drug abusing population.</p>
<h4>3. Description and Response of the System </h4>
<p>Jackson Memorial Hospital is the primary medical facility for managing  		children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS. There is a separate inpatient and a  		shared outpatient facility for the management of this patient population.  		Staffing is not a problem, partially because of the funds available from the  		many research studies which have been awarded to Jackson Memorial and its  		affiliated medical school, the University of Miami. There are 15 active  		projects underway, four of which are related to the pediatric AIDS population.  		Approximately 100 Miami high risk families are followed through one of the  		studies, and one family per week is entered into these studies. A social worker  		and nurse routinely make home visits for recruitment and support purposes.  		Hospital social work staff report significant problems in applying for Aid For  		Dependent Children.</p>
<p>The South Florida AIDS Network is the primary funding and coordinating  		unit for AIDS in South Florida and is responsible for (1) care and management  		of patients; (2) education and training; (3) research management; and (4) legal  		and ethical issues. Funds are funneled through the South Florida AIDS Network  		and include: a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant ($400,000), a HRSA Clinical  		Demonstration Site grant ($600,000), and funds from the State of Florida  		($6,800,000). The Network is housed at Jackson Memorial Hospital, which  		facilitates close coordination between the funding management source and the  		service delivery facility.</p>
<p>The South Florida AIDS Network handles all subcontracts for services,  		including foster care and child care. A foster parent is paid $2,700 per month  		for foster care for an AIDS/ARC child. This amount includes all activities and  		is not supplemented, as is the case in other jurisdictions. A foster parent is  		paid the regular foster care rates directly from the State and receives an  		enhanced rate from the South Florida AIDS Network. The State is approximately  		four months behind in issuance of checks to foster parents. There is general  		belief that the success of the Miami pediatric and adult AIDS service  		activities is based upon the planning activity undertaken by the Health Council  		of South Florida. This group facilitated the development and accomplishment of  		a six month planning process which included the input from more than 150 people  		with varied interest in the AIDS problem.</p>
<p>The Health Crisis Network is a community-based outreach organization  		that began its activities in 1983. Its original focus was to the Miami gay  		community, but it has expanded its counseling and outreach activities to the  		heterosexual communities of Miami, specifically to women and to Haitians. It  		receives some of its funding through the South Florida AIDS Network. The  		organization operates a hotline, including a Creole speaking operator, and  		funds a community outreach nurse for a half day per week at a local community  		center in the Haitian part of Miami. A primary concern of the organization is  		the need for counseling and outreach to siblings of HIV infected children. The  		problem of AIDS so devastates a family's structure and functioning that  		multiple social services outreach is needed. The organization operates a  		support group for 28 high risk women, but does not have the staff for  		psychosocial outreach to families with AIDS.</p>
<p>The Dade County AIDS Unit is primarily focused upon providing voluntary  		and confidential testing and counseling. Although the County operates six  		health clinics, any HIV seropositive/ARC/AIDS child coming to these facilities  		is sent to Jackson Memorial Hospital for management. The staffs of these  		clinics do not perceive the black communities to be at risk for AIDS, and this  		has affected their prevention and education activities. There is very little  		AIDS prevention outreach occurring, especially in the Haitian community.</p>
<p>A system is being developed that would link by computer the County  		community health centers to the Jackson Memorial Hospital. This would allow  		better tracking and management of patients.</p>
<p>There have been a variety of foster care approaches in Miami. Foster  		care placement of HIV positive children was initially handled by the State, but  		now the South Florida AIDS Network has contracted with the Children's Home  		Society to handle the foster care placement for this population. As of the site  		visit, no children had actually been placed with foster parents by this agency.  		However, two nurses from Jackson Memorial Hospital have left their nursing  		positions to become foster parents to HIV/ARC/AIDS infants and children, and  		each has several placements living with them. The Society also operates a  		shelter for children and will be handling HIV positive/ARC and AIDS clients.  		The Society is worried about the problem of infected teenagers and how they  		will be handled in the future.</p>
