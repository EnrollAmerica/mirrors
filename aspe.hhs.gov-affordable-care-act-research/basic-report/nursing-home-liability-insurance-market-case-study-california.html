</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The market for professional liability insurance for nursing home  		operators has been in a state of flux in recent years, beginning in the late  		1990s. The cost of professional liability insurance has increased dramatically  		in all areas of the country, though much higher increases have occurred in some  		regions than in others. Concurrently, the availability of insurance coverage  		has decreased, as many admitted insurance carriers incurred significant losses  		in this product line, and decided to exit the market altogether. Those carriers  		that decided to stay in the market have changed the terms and conditions of  		liability coverage, taking on less risk at higher prices.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#notea">a</a></font></sup> The high cost and limited  		availability of professional liability insurance has resulted in a growing  		number of nursing home operators being forced to operate without any  		professional liability insurance coverage whatsoever.</p>
<p>A major factor contributing to the recent turbulence in the nursing home  		liability insurance market is increased litigation activity against nursing  		home operators. However, the nature of the link between nursing home litigation  		and the cost and availability of professional liability insurance is a matter  		of considerable debate in the policy arena. </p>
<p>This report is one of five case studies prepared as part of a larger  		study sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services on trends and  		issues in the nursing home liability insurance market. Additional case studies  		are being conducted of the nursing home liability insurance market in the  		states of Ohio, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. The case studies are designed to  		provide greater insight into the dynamics of the problem by examining the  		experiences of states with differing long-term care, economic, political,  		legal, and insurance landscapes. This report presents the case study on nursing  		home litigation and insurance issues in the State of California.</p>
<p>The case study was conducted through in-person and telephone interviews,  		and a literature review specific to the experience in California. In-person  		interviews took place during a site visit conducted in June 2003. Telephone  		interviews with key stakeholders preceded and followed the on-site meeting.  		Interviews included a broad range of stakeholders including consumer advocacy  		organizations, insurers, brokers, plaintiff attorneys, defense attorneys,  		representatives of both the for-profit and not-for-profit nursing home  		industry, assisted living facilities and nursing home medical directors and  		physicians. Meetings were also convened with individuals representing the  		Department of Health Services, the Licensing and Certification Program, and  		legislative staff.</p>
<h2><a name="state" id="state">STATE ENVIRONMENT</a></h2>
<p>California was selected as a case study because, from a distance, it  		appeared to be a state of contradictions. On the one hand, California is  		considered a model state in regard to medical malpractice tort reform. In 1975,  		in response to a medical malpractice crisis, California enacted the Medical  		Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) which limited medical malpractice awards  		brought against licensed health care providers, including nursing homes, to a  		$250,000 cap on non-economic damages. State and federal medical malpractice  		reform initiatives often use MICRA as the best legislative model for tort  		reform across all states. On the other hand, analytical studies conducted by  		Aon Risk Consultants identified California as a state with a relatively high  		frequency of nursing home litigation activity, and loss costs well in excess of  		the national average.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref1">1</a></font></sup>  		These apparent contradictions in the nursing home litigation environment led to  		the selection of California as one of the five case study states.</p>
<h3>California Nursing Home Industry</h3>
<p>Californias nursing home environment is distinctive in many ways  		that might affect liability trends, facilities ability to deal with them,  		and the reform debate more generally. First, for-profit companies and regional  		and national chains control a larger than average share of the states  		1,303 nursing facilities. California ranks third in the country in the  		percentage of nursing homes that are for-profit (79%). While the percentage of  		chain providers in California decreased from 63% in December 2001 to 55% in  		June 2005, this percentage is still above the national average (52%).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Second, nursing home supply and utilization rates in California are well  		below the national average. The state has 123,920 certified nursing home beds,  		32 for every 1,000 people age 65 or older. This ratio is well below the  		national average of 46. The bed supply appears just as low when considering  		people age 85 and older, the age group most likely to use nursing facility  		care. Californias ratio of 241 beds per 1,000 people age 85 or older is  		the ninth lowest in the nation and 30% below the national average of  		345.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref3">3</a></font></sup> Californias  		occupancy rate is equal to the national average (86%).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Third, both public and private reimbursement rates are close to the  		national average. In 2002, the states Medicaid program paid an average of  		$114 per day. This rate was 23rd among 46 states that responded to a survey of  		Medicaid payment policies.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref5">5</a></font></sup> The 2003 average private pay rate in urban  		areas, $161, ranked 20th among the 50 states and DC.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, nursing facilities in California are not more dependent on  		Medicaid than in other states. Medicaid is the primary payer for 66% of  		residents in certified facilities, the same as the national average (66%).  		Medicare is the primary payer for 11% of residents, slightly below the national  		average of 12%.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Fifth, California saw an increase in Medicaid-certified beds since 2001,  		while the percentage of these beds remained constant in most of the country.  		Medicaid-certified beds increased from 87% in December 2001 to 91% in June  		2005. Nationally, 91% of nursing facilities were Medicaid-certified at both  		dates. The percentage of Medicare-certified beds, most of which are also  		Medicaid-certified, increased from 58% in December 2001 to 81% in June 2005.  		This increase reflected the national pattern during the same time after changes  		in Medicare reimbursement. The national average increased from 60% to 82%.  		California also matches the national average for the proportion of  		non-certified beds (5%).</p>
<h3>Nursing Home Quality and Oversight in California</h3>
<p>Data from Medicare and Medicaid certification surveys indicate  		California has more deficiencies than nursing facilities across the country. In  		2004, surveys identified 15.6 deficiencies per California facility, which  		ranked second in the nation to the District of Columbia. A small portion of  		these quality concerns led to actual harm to residents or put residents at risk  		of death or serious injury (i.e., immediate jeopardy). While California  		facilities had more overall deficiencies than most places, they had  		<i>fewer</i> of the most serious deficiencies. California ranked fourth-to-last  		in the percentage of facilities with actual harm or immediate jeopardy problems  		(7%, compared to the national average of 15.5%).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Survey data may understate quality problems, however. A 1999 U.S.  		Government Accounting Office (GAO) Report offered strong criticism of the  		nursing facility enforcement system, and noted large variations among states in  		the survey process.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref9">9</a></font></sup>  		Although a more recent GAO report noted improvements, it identified continued  		nursing home oversight shortcomings in several states, including underreporting  		of actual harm in California surveys.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Californias nursing home staffing is consistent with at the  		national average. California facilities employed 3.7 licensed nurse and  		certified nursing assistant staff per resident day in 2004.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Litigation and Liability Insurance Trends  		in California</h3>
<p>Recent studies on lawsuits against nursing homes in California report  		contradictory results. A 2005 actuarial analysis conducted by Aon Risk  		Consultants reported rapidly rising liability costs among California nursing  		homes, as shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#table1">Table 1</a>.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref12">12</a></font></sup> Prior to the year 2000, claim frequency and  		severity in California, and therefore total loss costs, were below the national  		average. However, beginning in the year 2000, claim frequency increased  		significantly. Claim severity also increased continuously from 1999 to the year  		2004. By 2004, according to Aon, claim frequency in California was 15% higher  		than the national average, while claim severity was 48% higher. The analysis  		conducted by Aon was based on data representing 27,000 nursing home beds in  		California, approximately 20% of all nursing home beds in the state. The  		nursing homes represented in the study are generally from large, self-insured,  		multi-regional chains. </p>
<p>A second study by the Insurance Services Office (ISO) in 2002 also found  		that California nursing homes experienced higher loss costs than the national  		average, although total loss costs were much lower than reported in the Aon  		study.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref13">13</a></font></sup> The ISO study,  		conducted on a database of commercially-insured nursing homes representing  		about 400,000 occupied beds--about 27% of the nursing home market--estimated  		claim frequency, claim severity, and average loss costs over the three-year  		period from 1998 to 2000. For California, ISO estimated average claim severity  		of about $155,000 over this three-year period, relatively close to the Aon  		estimates presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#table1">Table 1</a>. Average claim frequency  		in California, however, as estimated by ISO, was only about 2.0 claims per  		1,000 beds--much lower than the Aon estimates--although higher than the  		national average of all beds included in the ISO study. Estimates of claim  		frequency in the 2005 Aon study for the 1998-2000 time period were five times  		higher than the estimates generated by ISO.</p>
<p>Two other recent studies attempted to measure litigation activity in  		California and found no increases in nursing home lawsuits in recent years. A  		study conducted by the University of California, San Francisco and the Hastings  		College of Law in 2003 for the California Senate Office of Research identified  		only 118 cases in California nursing home lawsuits between the years of 1993  		and 2001, with the number of lawsuits peaking in 1997, at 14 cases.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref14">14</a></font></sup> The researchers on the study  		identified nursing home cases through on-line searches of 14 public and private  		legal databases.</p>
<p>In a second study conducted in 2003, the California Advocates for  		Nursing Home Reform (CANHR) reviewed California Superior Court civil indices in  		16 California counties, representing 50% of all freestanding nursing homes in  		the state, for the three-year period of January 1, 2000 through December 31,  		2002.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref15">15</a></font></sup> During this  		three-year period, CANHR identified a total of 501 lawsuits against nursing  		homes for negligent care--157 in the year 2000, 180 in 2001, and 164 in 2002.  		With these findings, CANHR argued that the number of lawsuits filed against  		California nursing homes was neither excessive nor increasing dramatically,  		stating the industrys claim of an explosion of nursing home litigation as  		a myth. </p>
<p>The contradictory findings in the four studies cited above can be partly  		explained by their methodological differences. The Aon and ISO studies are  		based on liability claims reported by insurers and providers. The liability  		claims reported include both <i>general</i> and <i>professional</i> claims.  		Thus, not all liability claims relate to incidents of patient negligence or  		abuse. For example, these studies also include liability claims that involve  		employees of nursing homes as plaintiffs, or other non-resident litigation.  		Neither the Aon nor the ISO study differentiates between these types of  		liability claims. The samples of nursing facilities represented in the Aon and  		ISO studies also differ markedly from one another. The Aon study is largely  		based upon the liability experience of large, self-insured, multi-regional  		chains, while the ISO study is based solely on the experience of nursing homes  		that had insurance coverage through admitted commercial insurers. </p>
<p>The Hastings and CANHR studies tried to measure nursing home litigation  		through records maintained by the California judicial system. In that regard,  		they only identified liability claims that had proceeded to the point of  		entering the court system. Liability claims that were settled between the  		plaintiff and the insurer/defendant prior to entering the judicial system were  		not included in the Hastings and CANHR studies. Also, the Hastings and CAHNR  		studies only attempted to measure the frequency of nursing home litigation, and  		did not address the severity of nursing home claims (either settlement amounts  		or trial awards) and therefore provide no data on total liability costs  		incurred by the industry. An internal report by NORCAL, a mutual insurance  		company in California, reported that punitive damages were allowed in 46% of  		their elder abuse cases in 1999 and 2000, compared to less than 1% of their  		traditional medical malpractice cases.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Liability Insurance Market in  		California</h3>
<p>As recently as 1999, there were as many as 18 companies writing nursing  		home liability coverage in California. By 2003, most carriers, both admitted  		and non-admitted, had left the market. Unlike admitted carriers that adhere to  		state insurance regulation, non-admitted carriers do not follow state  		regulations. In 2003, insurance brokers reported that there were only three  		insurers still writing coverage in California: AIG, CAN, and American Empire.  		Farmers Insurance and St. Paul are two of the more notable carriers that left  		the California market altogether. One factor for the exit of carriers in the  		retail insurance market was reportedly the decision by most of the  		traditional reinsurers to get out of the long-term care business  		altogether.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#noteb">b</a></font></sup>  		Specifically, one insurance industry spokesperson indicated that the number of  		reinsurers writing reinsurance for the nursing home product line in 2003  		worldwide had declined from about 50 companies to only about eight companies.  		</p>
<p>One insurance representative who had worked in the long-term care market  		in California for over 15 years stated that 1999 was a watershed year because  		the California Supreme Court decision in <i>Delaney v. Baker</i> broadened the  		criteria for bringing a nursing home case under the EADACPA statute (which is  		described more fully in the next section). The insurance market responded to  		this added exposure by making coverage changes to lower risk, increasing  		premiums, adopting more selective underwriting criteria and, for many, exiting  		the market. During the time of the contractors site visit in 2003,  		providers and insurance representatives pointed to the following trends and  		examples as illustrative of recent changes in the California marketplace:</p>
<ul><li>Deductibles had increased, averaging $50,000, compared with the  		  first-dollar coverage that was routinely available before 1999.</li>
<li>Premiums had risen from around $100/bed in the mid 1990s to an  		  average of approximately $2,300 per bed in 2003.</li>
<li>Whereas the typical pre-Delaney policy might have offered $1 million  		  of coverage, policy limits of $250,000 to $300,000 of coverage were more usual  		  in 2003.</li>
<li>Insurers were adding endorsements to existing policies to limit  		  coverage. For example, policies might have lower coverage limits for claims  		  based on physical or sexual abuse (e.g., $100,000-$300,000 coverage  		  limits).</li>
<li>Only one carrier was still writing coverage on an occurrence basis;  		  the remaining carriers in the marketplace had switched to writing policies  		  strictly on a claims-made basis (see definition below).</li>
<li>For some facilities, particularly those with a poor claims history,  		  the only coverage they could obtain were policies written on a  		  finite coverage basis, where the policy may provide $250,000 in  		  coverage for a premium cost of $275,000. In essence, these policies involve no  		  transfer of risk between the insured and the insurer. This type of coverage is  		  typically provided when the facility has a legal or financial requirement to  		  obtain insurance but is otherwise uninsurable.</li>
<li>Although some policies allow for coverage of attorneys fees,  		  most policies do not insure for punitive damages. The California Department of  		  Health Services observed: Without such coverage, just one significant  		  lawsuit could mean bankruptcy or closure.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref17">17</a></font></sup></li>
<li>One 160-bed church-related non-profit facility had to seek a new  		  insurer when its existing insurer refused to renew coverage. Although the  		  facility had a good claims history, the insurer was concerned about negative  		  survey findings against the facility. The cost of changing insurers also meant  		  a premium increase from $8,000 to $17,500 annually. Given the high cost, this  		  provider decided to go bare once the term of the current insurance  		  expired.</li>
<li>A skilled nursing facility in Northern California went from an  		  occurrence form policy with a $5,000 deductible, to a claims-made policy with a  		  $100,000 deductible.</li>
<li>A Northern California chain paid $76 per bed two years ago for  		  a policy that was occurrence based with a $0 deductible....In 2003, the chain  		  paid $1,096/bed for a claims-made policy subject to a $100,000  		  deductible.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref18">18</a></font></sup></li>
<li>The board of a non-profit nursing home in northern California, due to  		  a huge increase in premium costs, decided to go without liability coverage  		  altogether. </li>
</ul><p>In June 2003, almost all nursing homes in California were either  		uninsured, self-insured or were obtaining liability insurance in the  		surplus market (i.e. from non-admitted carriers). Policies  		purchased in the surplus market are not subject to regulation by state  		departments of insurance. Carriers in the surplus market can increase premiums,  		terminate coverage, and/or impose changes in the terms of coverage without  		state regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Most surplus carriers were writing policies exclusively on a  		claims-made basis, meaning that the policy only covers adverse  		events which both take place <i>and </i>for which claims are submitted during  		the term of the policy. A claims-made policy limits risk for the  		carrier, while increasing risk for the insured. For example, if a carrier  		decides that its exposure to future lawsuits has increased, the carrier can  		cancel the policy, walk away from the business, and not be liable  		for any subsequent lawsuits, <i>even if </i>the lawsuit resulted from events  		which took place during the term of the policy. The premium costs of policies  		written on a claims-made basis typically start at a relatively low  		level and then increase over time as the term of the policy expands to cover  		multiple years of incidents and claims.</p>
<p>Given the restrictions and high costs of the surplus market, some  		California providers were considering alternative risk retention/captive groups  		as potential vehicles for insuring liability risk. Captives are basically  		self-formed risk pools of providers that decide to share risk among the members  		of the captive.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref19">19</a></font></sup> Some  		captives are written on insurance paper to satisfy bond requirements to  		have insurance and some are self-insured across the members of the  		captive. The traditional captive has joint liability as well as shared  		administrative costs among its members. </p>
<p>In a traditional captive, members are also responsible for their own  		underwriting. That is, the members of a captive must decide among themselves  		with whom they wish to share liability risk. There must be a sufficient number  		of members for the captive to be adequately capitalized, while at the same time  		limiting membership to facilities with low liability risk. A variation on the  		risk retention captive is a cell captive in which participants  		share administrative expenses but not liability risk.</p>
<p>Although a number of providers interviewed during the California site  		visit were considering the formation of a captive as an alternative insurance  		option, the use of captives in the California market was not significant in  		June 2003.</p>
<h3>Legal and Legislative Environment in California</h3>
<p>Nursing home litigation issues in California play out in a complex legal  		environment. Two different statutes define and drive the basis for claims, the  		legal requirements for making and supporting a claim, and the criteria for  		determining damage awards. Understanding these statutes, and the subsequent  		case law around them, is critical to understanding the dynamics of nursing home  		litigation and insurance issues in California. Moreover, California case law  		around the applicability of these two statutes to nursing home liability cases  		is still evolving, with a number of key issues still working their way through  		the California appellate courts.</p>
<p>The MICRA of 1975 defines criteria for civil action against any licensed  		health care provider. Nursing homes, but not assisted living facilities, are  		included in the definition of health care provider under the MICRA statute.  		MICRA was enacted in response to a medical malpractice insurance crisis in the  		mid 1970s, due to increases in the number and size of legal actions taken  		against physicians. Among the more significant components of MICRA were the  		following provisions:</p>
<ul><li>Limited awards for pain and suffering and other  		  non-economic damages to $250,000.</li>
<li>Reduced the time limit for filing malpractice cases to three years  		  (from four years previously).</li>
<li>Created a scale for limiting attorneys contingency fees for the  		  highest awards.</li>
<li>Imposed a notice requirement for the intent to sue of 90  		  days prior to the filing of a lawsuit. This last provision was intended to  		  serve as a mechanism for facilitating early resolution of grievances against  		  health care providers, possibly avoiding formal filings of lawsuits.</li>
</ul><p>It is important to note that California law also did not allow a claim  		for pain and suffering to continue beyond the claimants death. In brief,  		the right to compensation for pain and suffering died with the patient, and  		surviving heirs were not allowed to seek damages for their own pain and  		suffering. Since many nursing home claims are brought on behalf of a resident  		who has died, civil action on such claims was not possible within this context.  		</p>
<p>EADACPA, enacted in 1991, provides for expanded civil remedies to all  		elderly or disabled persons, alive or deceased, where injury or harm results  		from abuse or neglect.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref20">20</a></font></sup>  		EADACPA was passed in response to concerns with the treatment of nursing home  		residents following a series of studies on the quality of life for  		Californias elderly, including studies by the Little Hoover Commission on  		California State Government Organization and Economy, an independent state  		oversight agency.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref21">21</a></font></sup>  		EADACPA was enacted with the specific policy intention of increasing financial  		incentives for plaintiff attorneys to take on elder abuse cases, since the  		limitations of the MICRA statute provided little financial incentive for  		attorneys to take on lawsuits brought by nursing home residents, or their  		survivors, particularly if the nursing home resident was deceased.</p>
<p>Key provisions of EADACPA, providing remedies barred by MICRA, are:</p>
<ul><li>It permits actions for pain and suffering to continue after the death  		  of the claimant.</li>
<li>It creates new civil remedies for elder abuse of up to $250,000 in  		  non-economic damages (e.g., pain, suffering or disfigurement) <i>in addition to  		  </i>MICRA provisions.</li>
<li>It allows courts to award attorneys fees and costs to  		  successful plaintiffs, over and above compensation for damages.</li>
<li>It expands the statute of limitations for taking civil action from  		  one year (under MICRA) to two years. </li>
</ul><p>While EADACPA expanded remedies available in instances of elder abuse or  		neglect in long-term care facilities, it also required a higher burden of proof  		than a medical malpractice case brought under MICRA. Under MICRA, a  		preponderance of the evidence is required to show proof of  		negligence. EADACPA imposes a higher standard of proof, namely clear and  		convincing evidence of willful disregard for the rights of residents.  		(See <a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a> for a description of the legal process  		for litigating an EADACPA case.) </p>
<p>A critical issue raised by the EADACPA legislation is the applicability  		of the MICRA and EADACPA statutes to lawsuits brought against nursing homes for  		adverse outcomes. In brief, these two statutes raise the question of which  		adverse events in nursing homes are considered medical malpractice  		and should be litigated under the MICRA statute, and which adverse events are  		considered elder abuse and should be litigated under EADACPA. This  		issue was specifically addressed by the California Supreme Court in <i>Delaney  		v. Baker</i> in 1999. </p>
<p>One key outcome of Delaney v. Baker was the Supreme Courts finding  		that health care providers are <i>not</i> protected from the enhanced  		remedies of EADACPA and thus, the MICRA limits on claims against health  		care providers do not apply if the plaintiff can meet the requirements for  		bringing a case under EADACPA. <i>Delaney v. Baker</i> held that where  		the behavior was of an egregious nature committed with the requisite  		recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice, the enhanced remedies  		of EADAPCA Section 15657 could apply.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref22">22</a></font></sup> The case established EADACPA as a  		separate and wholly independent basis for liability from a cause of  		action for professional negligence as that term is applied in the  		context of MICRA.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref23">23</a></font></sup> Thus, rather than reading EADACPA as applying  		to different facts than MICRA, the court interpreted it to provide an  		alternative route to actions that are barred by MICRA. The case clarified a  		distinction between acts of custodial neglect to be applied under  		EADACPA from cases of professional negligence as a cause of action  		under MICRA. The Supreme Courts ruling in <i>Delaney v. Baker </i>served  		to expand the exposure of nursing homes to potential legal actions. In many  		cases, plaintiffs filing lawsuits against nursing homes seek remedies under  		both statutes, in order to increase the amount of total compensation  		awarded.</p>
<p>In July 2001, a legislatively-mandated task force was convened to study  		the cost and availability of nursing home liability insurance in California.  		Agencies participating in the study task force included the California  		Department of Health Services (DHS), the California Department of Insurance  		(CDI), the State Office of Health Planning, and the State Department of  		Finance. Although the task force report was originally due to the legislature  		in March 2002, its submission was delayed to June 2003. </p>
<p>The Task Force Report was released shortly after the June 2003 site  		visit. Constituencies on both sides of the nursing home liability and insurance  		debate expressed disappointment about the report. It did not report any  		compelling findings or make strong recommendations. The report documented what  		was already known--that although there was compelling anecdotal evidence of a  		significant crisis in this market, there was a lack of reliable and objective  		data to sufficiently characterize and assess the problem. The reports  		recommendations primarily focused on the need to collect better information  		about the nature of the problem, and the need for the state to study the  		problem further before initiating any kind of policy response.</p>
<p>Key recommendations to DHS in the Task Force Report included the  		following:<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>Increase DHS data collection regarding litigation and insurance  		  claims against nursing homes and regarding the cost and availability of  		  liability insurance. The task force believed that existing authority to collect  		  the requisite data from both admitted and non-admitted carriers in the states  		  already existed in the health and safety code. Non-admitted insurers would be  		  required to submit data since the requirement pertains to every insurer  		  providing professional liability insurance to a <i>licensed </i>health  		  facility. Additionally, nursing homes would be required to provide information  		  about their liability insurance as a condition for facility license  		  renewal.</li>
<li>Require nursing homes to implement an approved risk management plan  		  as a condition of facility licensure. Elements of the plan would include having  		  a full-time risk manager for a facility of 50 beds or more, a risk management  		  committee, training programs for new employees, corrective action plans, and  		  other features. </li>
<li>Conduct a study to assess the relationship between the states  		  enforcement of nursing home quality standards and legal actions in recent elder  		  abuse cases.</li>
<li>Continue to study the effect of liability insurance issues on  		  long-term care providers.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the Task Force Report outlined a number of additional  		policy initiatives that could potentially be implemented to address the  		liability insurance situation, without specifically endorsing any of them. For  		each initiative, the report discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each  		but did not recommend a specific course of action:</p>
<ul><li>Facilitate captive or alternative insurance arrangements such as a  		  Joint Underwriters Association. </li>
<li>Mandate an insurance rate roll-back. </li>
<li>Establish provisions related to arbitration or mediation during an  		  initial 90-day notice to file suit period.</li>
<li>Shorten the statute of limitations for MICRA.</li>
<li>Specify a method for defining reasonable attorneys  		  fees to help contain litigation costs, especially in high award cases.</li>
<li>Allocate a portion of punitive damage awards to go to quality care  		  improvements in nursing homes or place a cap on punitive damages. </li>
<li>Limit the admissibility of state and federal survey documents in  		  civil action, unless they contain information directly relevant to the specific  		  case. </li>
</ul><p>In 1997, DHS was charged with developing a standardized admission  		agreement for use in long-term care facilities. The goal was to have one model  		admissions agreement that would be used by all providers for all new  		admissions. The development of the model admissions agreement was stalled by a  		debate regarding whether providers could include binding arbitration  		agreements, on a voluntary basis, as part of the standardized admission  		agreement. Final regulations governing standardized admission agreements were  		published by DHS in July 2005, and took effect on January 2, 2006. </p>
<p>The final regulations specifically prohibit providers from presenting  		arbitration agreements as part of the standardized admission agreement.  		Specifically, the regulations state:</p>
<blockquote><p>The licensee shall not present any arbitration agreements to a  		  prospective resident as a part of the Standardized Admission Agreement. Any  		  arbitration agreement shall be separate from the Standard Admission Agreement  		  and shall contain the following advisory in a prominent place at the top of the  		  proposed arbitration agreement, in bold-face type of not less than 12 point  		  type: Residents shall not be required to sign this arbitration agreement  		  as a condition of admission to this facility, and cannot waive the ability to  		  sue for violation of the Resident Bill of Rights.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2006/NHliab-CA.htm#ref25">25</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two bills were enacted in the FY 2003 legislative session that affected  		the nursing home liability insurance issue. First, Assembly Bill 634 made all  		settlements of elder abuse claims public information. Although the amount of  		the settlement or verdict still remains confidential, all other details of the  		case would be public information. The bill also includes destruction of  		evidence in elder abuse actions within the definition of misuse of the  		discovery process and would apply penalties for such.</p>
<p>The second bill enacted during the FY 2003 legislative session was  		Senate Bill 686, which mandated that insurance companies report certain data on  		policies issued for all long-term care providers in California to CDI on an  		annual basis. The Bill also extended the notification period for an insurer who  		intends to withdraw from the California market from 60 days to 90 days.  		Finally, the Bill authorized CDI to establish a market assistance program for  		long-term care facilities if the Department finds that liability insurance is  		not readily available in the voluntary insurance market, including the  		formation of an unincorporated, non-profit, temporary joint underwriting  		association. </p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>While not at the level of severity observed in Florida and Texas,  		nursing home providers in California reported many of the same trends in the  		market for professional liability insurance: skyrocketing premiums for all  		providers, regardless of their claims histories; reduced coverage provided by  		available insurance products; increased risk shifted back to nursing home  		providers by insurers; market exit of most of the states regulated  		insurance carriers, leaving only a few surplus line carriers in the  		marketplace; increased use of insurance captives; a growing number of providers  		deciding to forego insurance coverage altogether; and a contentious  		relationship between the nursing home industry and consumer advocacy groups  		regarding the root causes of the crisis.</p>
<p>As in other states, efforts to assess the true magnitude of the nursing  		home liability insurance situation in California are hindered by the absence of  		objective and reliable data. Reliable information on professional liability  		losses incurred by providers and insurers, as well as comprehensive information  		on changes in the cost and availability of insurance, is not available. The  		studies that have been conducted on the issue have been sponsored by  		constituencies with strong self-interests, and with clear political agendas for  		influencing the policy debate. The annual Aon studies have reported an  		increasing frequency of liability claims for nursing home providers in  		California. However, this increasing frequency has not been found in the other  		studies, such as the study conducted by CANHR. </p>
<p>Although mandated to collect liability claims and insurance data from  		long-term care facilities, CDI has, to date, not been successful in achieving  		that goal. The exit of admitted carriers regulated by CDI has hindered the  		ability of the Department to collect data. Although the state legislature has  		demanded the collection of better information, this outcome is not guaranteed  		given the current volatility in the liability insurance market.</p>
<p>California is an example of a state where the nursing home liability  		issue is linked to residents rights statutes. The EADACPA statute, and  		subsequent California case law, expanded the liability exposure of health care  		providers to torts incurred on a special class of individuals--the elderly and  		disabled who are the victims of reckless neglect. It intentionally  		expanded civil remedies for individuals whose opportunities for redress would  		otherwise be limited by the constraints imposed under the MICRA statute. The  		existence of two independent but inter-related statutes governing civil  		remedies for damages incurred by nursing home residents in California has made  		the legal environment in that state extremely complex. The level of resources  		invested by both plaintiffs and defendants in litigating individual cases was  		far higher than observed in other states.</p>
<h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A: EXAMPLE OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH AN  		EADACPA CASE MIGHT BE LITIGATED</a></h2>
<p>A lawsuit filed under the California Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult  		Civil Protection Act (EADACPA) generally begins with a family member of a  		nursing home resident approaching an attorney with a complaint about the care  		provided by the nursing home, and inquiring whether the complaint is worthy of  		filing a lawsuit. The nursing home resident may be still living or deceased.  		The attorney must then decide whether the facts of the case, as reported by the  		family member, warrant moving forward with a more complete investigation of the  		incident. </p>
<p>First, the attorney must assess whether the incident reported by the  		family member constitutes elder abuse as defined under the EADACPA statute,  		that is, physical abuse, neglect, or financial abuse. Further, in  		order to be eligible for the enhanced remedies under EADACPA, the  		plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that  		the defendant was guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or  		malice in abusing the plaintiff. California case law has clearly  		established that the EADACPA statute requires a higher burden of proof for  		proving recklessness than the evidence required to prove neglect under a  		standard medical malpractice (MICRA) case. This difference is often  		characterized as the difference between professional negligence and  		reckless neglect. Professional negligence can include  		incidents in which health care providers commit a medical error that, given  		their professional training and qualifications, should not have been made.  		Reckless neglect, on the other hand, requires a higher degree of  		culpability than professional negligence.</p>
<p>In California case law, this higher degree of culpability has often been  		based on the concept of foreseeability, that is, that the defendant  		knew that its policies and practices would increase the likelihood that the  		incident would occur. In EADACPA cases involving nursing home residents, the  		foreseeability standard is often played out in a debate about  		staffing levels. Plaintiffs will often make the case that the plaintiff was  		harmed because the nursing home employed too few staff, below recommended state  		standards. Thus, the argument is made that the nursing home could foresee that  		its staffing levels were likely to increase the likelihood of an adverse event  		and failed to take remedial action. This argument is often characterized as the  		profits over people approach. A survey history that demonstrates a  		repeated pattern of deficiencies, particularly the same types of deficiencies,  		is also frequently used to support the foreseeability standard.</p>
<p>Finally, in the case of a corporate employer such as a nursing home, the  		plaintiff must be able to prove that the recklessness, oppression, fraud or  		malice was done or ratified by a managing agent of the corporation.  		</p>
<p>If the plaintiff can make a case for reckless neglect, then  		the enhanced remedies of EADACPA are available to the plaintiff.  		The enhanced remedies of EADACPA allow family members to sue for up  		to $250,000 in non-economic damages (pain and suffering) even after the person  		who was the victim of elder abuse dies. Under a standard medical malpractice  		case in California, the right to sue for pain and suffering dies with the  		victim. Second, EADACPA allows plaintiffs to recover attorneys fees and  		costs, separate from economic and non-economic damages.</p>
<p>An attorney will assess the merits of a potential EADACPA case by  		reviewing the available evidence. The attorney will generally request a copy of  		the patients medical records from the nursing home and other medical  		records, interview potential witnesses, such as former nursing home employees,  		and also review state survey and licensure data, which can serve as evidence  		that the negligent care alleged in the patients case was part of a  		broader pattern of substandard care, previously identified by state surveyors.  		If the attorney believes there is sufficient evidence to move forward with a  		case under EADACPA, the attorney will then proceed with the filing of a formal  		lawsuit. Plaintiff attorneys state that there is a good deal of investigative  		work that must be conducted prior to ever filing a suit under EADACPA, and that  		there are many cases that are initially investigated, but then dropped, for  		lack of sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>As the litigation of EADACPA cases has evolved over the years, the  		typical EADACPA lawsuit filed today includes multiples causes of action. That  		is, in addition to suing the nursing home for elder abuse under the EADACPA  		statute, the attorney may also sue the nursing home on other legal grounds. If  		the negligent care of the nursing home resident is alleged to have caused the  		death of the nursing home resident, the attorney may file a wrongful  		death claim in addition to an elder abuse claim. The plaintiff attorney  		may also file a standard medical malpractice claim for professional negligence  		under the MICRA statute. In some cases, the attorney may also believe there is  		sufficient evidence to file a claim for fraudulent activity. For example, if a  		nursing home represented itself to the plaintiff or a plaintiffs family  		as providing specialized care for people with Alzheimers disease, but  		failed to provide specialized training of its staff on the treatment of  		Alzheimers patients, then the attorney may decide to file a cause of  		action that the nursing home misrepresented itself in a fraudulent manner.  		There may be claim made under the Business and Professions Code (Section 17200)  		for unlawful or unfair business practices. Defense attorneys state that this  		claim is often used as a discovery device, since it allows for expanded  		discovery of the companys business operations. There may be Breach of  		Contract claim, a Violation of Patients Rights claim, and, in some cases,  		an Assault and Battery claim. Finally, the attorney may file additional causes  		of action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED) and/or  		Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.</p>
<p>The obvious advantage to the plaintiff of filing multiple causes of  		action is the opportunity to receive compensation from the defendant under each  		cause of action. However, each cause of action must be separately litigated,  		greatly increasing the legal complexity of these cases. It is very easy for an  		EADACPA case to wrack up legal fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, on  		both sides. Given that the enhanced remedies of EADACPA allow for the payment  		of attorneys fees, in addition to direct compensation to the plaintiff,  		there is a clear financial incentive for plaintiff attorneys to maximize  		litigation costs (at least in winnable cases). On the defense side, this  		provision creates an additional incentive to settle cases early in the process,  		before legal costs on both sides get out of hand. </p>
<p>An EADACPA lawsuit may name more than one party as a defendant in the  		case. In addition to the nursing home itself, the lawsuit may name the  		facilitys medical director, the patients treating doctor, or others  		as additional defendants. This is because the court may decide that the  		responsibility for the incident that led to the lawsuit is shared among  		multiple parties. This can potentially lead to situations in which a court  		decides that the plaintiff is entitled to $250,000 in non-economic damages for  		pain and suffering, but that the nursing home corporation itself is only  		responsible for 50% of the damages, the medical director is responsible for 40%  		of the damages, and the treating doctor is responsible for 10%. If the  		plaintiff attorney failed to name the medical director or the treating doctor  		as additional defendants in the original lawsuit, then the plaintiff may  		recover only 50% of the damages to which he or she is otherwise entitled. </p>
<p>Once a lawsuit is filed, the formal process of discovery begins. Both  		plaintiff and defense attorneys state that the discovery process in nursing  		home EADACPA cases, as opposed to straight medical malpractice cases, is  		considerably more massive. The patient may have been in the nursing  		home for years, and the alleged negligent action itself (e.g., inadequate  		feeding leading to weight loss and malnutrition) may have occurred over a  		period of many months. This means that there are many more records to review  		and more people to take depositions from.</p>
<p>The discovery process may lead to additional legal actions. If the  		defense believes that the plaintiff attorney is requesting information in the  		discovery process that is either protected information or is irrelevant to the  		case, the defense may object to making that information available. In response,  		the plaintiff attorney may file motions to compel discovery if he or she feels  		that the defense is not complying with proper requests for information, or is  		using failure to comply as a delaying tactic. A judge can also award sanctions  		if an attorney asks for money to compensate for the additional professional  		time involved in dealing with difficulties getting the opposing attorney to  		provide requested information during discovery. This can further add to the  		overall legal costs of the case. </p>
<p>The defense attorney in the case may elect to submit a demurrer to the  		court, which is a legal action requesting the court to strike one or more  		causes of action in a lawsuit. Importantly, the defense may argue that, even  		assuming that all of the alleged facts in the case filed by the plaintiff are  		correct, the case should be tried as a simple medical malpractice case rather  		than as an elder abuse case. For example, the defense may argue that the facts  		of the case (if true) show that the defendant may have been guilty of  		professional negligence (e.g., failing to prevent a resident from escaping the  		building and being hit by a car) but not reckless neglect. Since  		proof of reckless neglect under EADACPA often leads a case down the path  		towards the seeking of punitive damages, there is considerable incentive for  		the defense to limit the cause of action to a more simple case of professional  		medical malpractice. An additional incentive for the defense is that if the  		court agrees that the case should be tried as a general medical malpractice  		case and not an elder abuse case, than the enhanced remedies of the EADACPA are  		generally no longer available.</p>
<p>At some point in the litigation of an EADACPA case, the plaintiff  		attorney may decide whether he or she has sufficient evidence to seek punitive  		damages. The plaintiff attorney may sue for punitive damages if he or she can  		prove by clear and convincing evidence that a managing agent of the defendant  		has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. Note that the  		requirements for the seeking of punitive damages are quite similar to the  		requirements for the award of pain and suffering damages under EADACPA, with  		the exception that EADACPA includes the additional concept of recklessness, or  		as previously discussed, reckless neglect. </p>
<p>The definitions of oppression, fraud or malice necessary for the seeking  		of punitive damages generally require the plaintiff to prove despicable  		conduct on the part of the defendant. That is, the plaintiff must prove  		that the nursing home knew that what it was doing was potentially harmful to  		the patient and went ahead and did it anyway. For example, despicable  		conduct could apply if the nursing home was aware that an employee had  		prior convictions for sexual abuse, but failed to terminate that employee, or  		if a resident had a history of wandering from the facility and the nursing home  		failed to take any actions to prevent future escapes.</p>
<p>If a plaintiff attorney decides to seek punitive damages, he or she must  		file a motion to amend the original lawsuit, stating intent to seek punitive  		damages. This motion must be filed at least nine months prior to the scheduled  		trial date. The defense is provided the right to submit counter briefs and  		evidence opposing the motion, arguing why the case does not warrant the seeking  		of punitive damages. The judge assigned to the case will then make a ruling  		regarding whether the evidence is sufficient for the plaintiff to seek punitive  		damages. In addition, this ruling indicates whether economic and non-economic  		damages will be available under EADACPA. If the judge finds the evidence  		sufficient to allow the suit to be amended to include punitive damages, this  		alone often sends a powerful message to both parties that there is a good  		possibility that the plaintiff has a strong case. Conversely, if the motion is  		denied, it may weaken the plaintiffs case. This information, among other  		factors, is likely to play a role in the parties willingness to negotiate  		a settlement in lieu of going to trial.</p>
<p>Plaintiff and defense attorneys who work on EADACPA cases state that  		there is currently a complex legal argument ensuing around the award of  		punitive damages in EADACPA cases. There are a number of unresolved issues  		regarding the applicability of punitive damage awards in cases involving  		long-term care providers. These unresolved issues are currently being  		considered by the California Supreme Court in the Convenant Care case, and a  		decision is expected in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>At some point during the processing of the case, one or the other side,  		either the attorney representing the plaintiff or the attorney representing the  		defendant will usually call the opposing attorney and suggest settling the  		case. Very few cases go to full jury trial; most cases are settled out of  		court. If both parties agree to discuss the possibility of a settlement, then  		usually a professional mediator will be brought on to facilitate the  		discussions between both parties. If the case is settled, the parties usually  		agree to keep the terms of the settlement confidential, and not make them  		available to the public. This makes it difficult to conduct analyses of the  		outcomes of EADACPA cases.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary">GLOSSARY</a></h2>
<p><b>Admitted Carriers</b> are commercial insurers whose nursing home  		liability insurance products are regulated by state departments of insurance.  		These carriers enjoy some advantages over non-admitted carriers. They can  		participate in state guaranty funds, which help protect policyholders in the  		case of insurer insolvency. Also, they have a marketing advantage over  		non-admitted carriers because some brokers, facility providers and lenders  		value state oversight and participation in the guaranty fund.</p>
<p>The <b>Alternative Market</b> to nursing home liability insurance is  		composed of various forms of self-insurance, meaning the risk is borne by the  		participants and not an insurance company. The different forms of  		self-insurance include risk retention and risk purchasing groups (RPGs),  		captives, rent-a-captives, and sponsored captives (Joint Underwriting  		Associations).</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Agreements</b> are contracts, the terms of which are  		determined by an arbitrator, entered into by opposing parties. An arbitrator is  		a person or panel of people who are not judges and may be: (1) agreed to by the  		parties; (2) required by a provision in a contract for settling disputes; or  		(3) provided for under statute. Arbitration is designed to be a fair and  		equitable means of dispute resolution agreed to by both parties to avoid a  		court trial and the associated expenses and time investment.</p>
<p><b>Capitalization</b> means funding the reserves of an insurance or  		self-insurance program to pay claims.</p>
<p>A <b>Cell Captive</b> is a captive in which member providers share  		administrative expenses but not risk.</p>
<p>A <b>Captive</b> is a self-formed pool of providers who share risk among  		themselves, thus acting as their own insurance company. Members do their own  		underwriting, meaning they decide among themselves which providers to admit to  		the captive. Members will share liability risk with the providers they admit.  		</p>
<p><b>Claims Made Policies</b> provide coverage for insured events that  		both occur and <i>for which a claim is made</i> during the term of the policy.  		Thus, if an incident occurs, but the policy is terminated before a claim is  		made, liability for the incident is not insured.</p>
<p><b>Claims Occurrence Policies</b> provide coverage for all incidents and  		events that occur during the term of the policy, regardless of when a liability  		claim is made, or when a lawsuit is settled.</p>
<p><b>Collateral Damages</b> are damages incurred by the plaintiff that are  		already covered by other sources of payment. Collateral source  		offset rules reduce awards by denying plaintiffs compensation for  		losses that are recouped from other sources, such as health insurance. These  		rules aim to prevent plaintiffs from double dipping by  		recovering for losses for which the plaintiff has already been remunerated  		through other sources of payment.</p>
<p><b>Deductibles</b> are initial amounts of claims incurred by the  		policyholder not covered by the insurance policy. Insurance coverage begins  		only for losses incurred above the deductible amount.</p>
<p><b>Economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for financial losses caused by the wrongful actions of another party  		(e.g., awards for the medical bills of a nursing home resident caused by an  		abusive employee).</p>
<p><b>Estimated Liability Costs</b> are approximate calculations of  		expenses for damages to which a nursing home is exposed. Because estimates are  		derived from information provided by nursing homes and the cost of settlements  		of lawsuits is confidential information known only to the insurance carrier,  		plaintiffs attorney and defense attorney, these calculations are only  		estimates and are subject to change.</p>
<p><b>General Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages to a plaintiff due to  		bodily injury or property damage. </p>
<p>A <b>Joint Underwriting Association</b> is a state-sponsored  		organization that creates insurance pools and functions as an insurer in  		markets without a significant number of licensed insurers. It has the power to  		sell insurance policies, collect premiums, and purchase reinsurance and it can  		usually guarantee a certain level of premium rates to its members. It can also  		levy surcharges on policyholders and, in some cases, on licensed insurers  		selling liability insurance, to create reserves to pay claims.</p>
<p><b>Joint and Several Liability</b> in civil litigation is a situation in  		which the concurrent acts of two or more defendants bring harm to the  		plaintiff. Such acts need not occur simultaneously, but must contribute to the  		same event. In such a case, the damages may be collected from one or more of  		the defendants. If the court does not apportion blame in specific shares, the  		damages may be collected from any and all defendants. If a defendant does not  		have the financial wherewithal to pay, the others must make up the  		difference.</p>
<p><b>Non-admitted Carriers</b>, also called <b>Surplus Line Carriers</b>,  		are commercial insurers whose nursing home liability insurance products are not  		regulated by state departments of insurance. These insurers enjoy some  		advantages over admitted carriers. They have greater flexibility in designing  		and pricing products. Because they are not subject to state regulation, they  		can also change coverage forms and application protocols more quickly. However,  		they must pay an excess and surplus lines tax that is not levied on  		admitted carriers. They cannot participate in state guaranty funds, which help  		protect policyholders in the case of insurer insolvency</p>
<p><b>Non-economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for intangible harms (e.g., pain and suffering).</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Liability Insurance</b> is indemnification of nursing  		home providers against damages for negligent care and abuse.</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Residents Rights Statutes</b> are state and  		federal laws to protect each nursing home residents civil, religious and  		human rights.</p>
<p><b>Offshore Captives</b> are captives located outside the United States.  		The most popular host states for offshore captives include Bermuda, Guernsey  		and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p><b>Premium</b> is the charge paid by a policyholder for insurance  		coverage.</p>
<p><b>Professional Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages and associated claims  		and defense expenses to a plaintiff due to a negligent act, error or omission  		in a nursing home providers rendering or failure to render professional  		services.</p>
<p><b>Punitive damages</b> in civil litigation means monetary compensation  		awarded by a judge or jury which exceeds the losses suffered by the injured  		party in order to punish the defendant.</p>
<p><b>Regulated Insurance Carriers</b> are admitted carriers (see  		definition above).</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance</b> is the practice of insurance carriers ceding risk to  		other firms, called reinsurance companies, in order to limit their liability  		exposure. Reinsurance companies essentially provide insurance to insurance  		companies. Instead of assessing the risk of individual policyholders,  		reinsurance companies assess risk on a broader scale, such as on the basis of a  		particular product-line (nursing home liability insurance) or a geographic  		region.</p>
<p>A <b>Rent-A-Captive</b> is a captive, usually formed by an insurance  		company, broker or captive manager, and rented out to users (in this case  		nursing home providers) who avoid the cost of funding their own captive. The  		user provides some form of collateral so that the rent-a-captive is not at risk  		from any underwriting loss suffered by the user.</p>
<p><b>Risk Management Programs</b> are structured approaches to  		purposefully limit liability risk. They include systematic efforts to improve  		and maintain high standards for care quality, but can also include additional  		management techniques to minimize liability exposure, such as improving written  		documentation. They are often formalized within the management structure of  		nursing home providers in the form of Risk Management Committees, and/or a  		designated Director of Risk Management along with formal Risk Management plans  		that are implemented and monitored by senior management.</p>
<p>A <b>Risk Retention Group (RRG)</b> is an insurance company that is  		owned by its members. The members of an RRG come from the same industry. For  		instance, nursing home providers can form an RRG in order to obtain nursing  		home liability coverage.</p>
<p>A <b>Settlement</b> is an agreement reached between the legal counsel of  		the plaintiff and the defendant that terminates a civil litigation before a  		verdict is reached by the court.</p>
<p><b>Tort Reform</b> generally means a movement intended to curb  		litigation and damages in the civil justice system. With respect to nursing  		home liability insurance, many states have enacted tort reform through  		legislation and it has changed the legal framework under which residents and/or  		family members can seek damages for negligent or abusive care practices. States  		also placed limits on the amount of damages that could be awarded to plaintiffs  		and/or their family members, particularly non-economic damages for pain and  		suffering. </p>
<p><b>Underwriting</b> is the process by which an insurer assesses the risk  		of insuring a particular applicant for coverage. Risk retention groups also  		underwrite by assessing the risk of accepting a prospective member.</p>
