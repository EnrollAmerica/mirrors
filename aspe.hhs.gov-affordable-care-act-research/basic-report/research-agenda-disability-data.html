<h2>Revised August 1995</h2>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This paper provides background information for a meeting on data sets  		containing information on health care and long-term supports for persons with  		disabilities. The primary purpose of the meeting was to inform the research  		agenda of the Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care (DALTCP). The  		meeting was hosted by DALTCP in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in Washington D.C. on March 31,1995.</p>
<p>We asked participants to assist us to:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Assess disability-related national data sets pertaining to health  			 and long-term supports, particularly as related to the policy issues discussed  			 below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify useful State, area, private and international data bases,  			 including data from large federally-assisted demonstrations of managed care,  			 integrated health services, long-term care and welfare reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify next steps in analyzing available disability data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propose priorities for DALTCP's research agenda regarding disability  			 data.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Overview of Paper</h3>
<p>The paper begins with two general sections: Conceptual and Policy  		Framework and General Orientation to Disability Data, the latter of which  		contains an overview of the Disability Survey (1994-1995 Supplements to the  		National Health Interview Survey).</p>
<p>There follow sections which discuss policy and research questions  		ASPE/DALTCP is addressing and a critique of available data on four populations  		of persons with disabilities: working age adults; persons under age 18; older  		adults; and special populations.</p>
<p>The concluding section poses key questions in considering a disability  		data strategy and identifies possible next steps in developing a disability  		data strategy.</p>
<p>An <a href="research-agenda-disability-data.html#appendix">Appendix</a> provides one-page summaries of  		numerous national disability data bases.</p>
<h2>II. CONCEPTUAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK</h2>
<h3>A. Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>There are many ways to define "disability". The definition should be  		broad enough to cover all persons of interest, yet detailed enough that policy  		makers and program administrators can identify the target groups they try to  		serve.</p>
<p>For this paper, we consider a disability to be a limitation of activity  		due to chronic conditions. Such a definition, which is used by the National  		Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), is "slanted" toward a health perspective.  		This is in keeping with the Department's mission, which--with the departure of  		the Social Security Administration (SSA)--is likely to place greater emphasis  		on health and long-term care policy as they affect persons with  		disabilities.</p>
<p>In the World Health Organization's (WHO) manual <i><b>International  		Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH)</b></i>  		(1980), <i>impairments</i> represent disturbances at the organ level;  		<i>disabilities</i> reflect the consequences of impairment in terms of  		functional performance and activity by the individual; and <i>handicaps</i> are  		concerned with the disadvantages experienced by the individual as a result of  		impairments and disabilities. WHO is currently producing a revision and  		updating of this classification.</p>
<p>The starting point for this paper should not obscure the difficulty of  		reaching a broad consensus on one or more definitions of disability or  		identifying all the variables required to view disability from a variety of  		policy and program perspectives. In the process of developing a disability data  		strategy, the full range of conceptual, methodological and definitional issues  		around disability must be examined thoroughly.</p>
<h3>B. Basic Demographics</h3>
<p>According to the 1990 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),  		approximately 40.1 million Americans living in the community have one or more  		disabilities because of a physical or mental health condition. There are, in  		addition, about 2.6 million persons with disabilities who reside in  		institutions. This population is characterized in the first instance by its  		diversity. It includes the frail elderly, persons with mental retardation or  		other developmental disabilities (MR/DD), adults with physical disabilities or  		mental illness, children with disabilities and veterans. While the specific  		needs of these groups vary, they share common concerns and aspirations.</p>
<h3>C. Policy Context for ASPE's Interest in Disability  		Data</h3>
<p>ASPE provides data and analyses to inform policies of the Department of  		Health and Human Services (DHHS). Within ASPE, DALTCP has a mandate from the  		Assistant Secretary to expand its research agenda on persons with disabilities  		of all ages, focusing on health services and long-term supports. We are  		conducting and planning a number of disability-related research projects.</p>
<p>In addition, we have responsibilities regarding policy-relevant national  		survey data, including adding specific questions or entire sections to ongoing  		surveys (e.g., National Long-Term Care Survey), reviewing surveys sponsored by  		agencies in the Department, and developing new surveys in cross-cutting areas  		such as the 1994-95 Disability Supplement to the National Health Interview  		Survey (NHIS).</p>
<p>Given the cross-cutting nature of disability issues, we are coordinating  		our work with other departments and agencies, including the Department of  		Education and the new independent SSA as well as with operating agencies in  		DHHS and within ASPE itself.</p>
<p>National programs affecting persons with disabilities have developed  		considerably over the past quarter century. Currently many of these programs  		are undergoing scrutiny within the Administration and in Congress.  		Policy-relevant data are needed in a number of areas. Major disability-related  		initiatives which would benefit from more current data and data analyses  		include the following:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>President's Disability Policy Review</b></i></p>
<p>The White House has undertaken a broad review of Federal disability  			 policy through a group chaired by Carol Rasco and Alice Rivlin. This group will  			 review the direction of Federal disability policy and provide guidance for the  			 next steps. Specific Work Groups include: Guiding Principles, Accommodations,  			 Children's Issues, Employment of Working Age Adults, and School-to-Work  			 Transition. Judy Feder and Robyn Stone of ASPE are convening the group on  			 Children's Issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Children with Disabilities on SSI</b></i></p>
<p>Rapid growth in the number of children who are receiving  			 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) because of a disability has generated  			 concern and criticism at present. In consequence, a National Commission on  			 Childhood Disability has been mandated by the 103rd Congress. See  			 below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Health Care Reform Initiatives</b></i></p>
<p>Access to health insurance is a major concern for persons with  			 disabilities. States and private insurers are undertaking reform initiatives  			 despite lack of a major Federal health reform initiative. Proposals for  			 universal coverage and a ban on exemptions from coverage due to preexisting  			 conditions offered great promise to persons with disabilities. However, this  			 constituency has concerns about the consequences of managed care and various  			 cost containment measures.</p>
<p>In ASPE's studies of the effect of managed care options on persons  			 with disabilities--both children and adults--valid and reliable data have not  			 been readily available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Potential Changes in Medicare and Medicaid</b></i></p>
<p>Many States are using managed care plans to serve their Medicaid  			 beneficiaries. While people with disabilities have for the most part been  			 carved out of these initiatives, a number of States are beginning to enroll  			 their SSI (aged and disabled) populations in managed care plans.</p>
<p>There is serious consideration of placing a cap on Federal Medicaid  			 expenditures or turning the Medicaid program into a block grant. The Health  			 Care Financing Administration (HCFA) expects a doubling of nonelderly disabled  			 Medicare beneficiaries between 1980 and 2000. ASPE/DALTCP in conjunction with  			 HCFA is examining changes in the Medicare home health benefit. In general, we  			 need data to project consequences of different scenarios of changes in these  			 major programs for persons with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Long-Term Support Reform</b></i></p>
<p>Debate continues concerning the feasibility of a Federal program to  			 provide block grants to States for home and community-based services, including  			 personal assistance services (PAS), for persons with disabilities. Of  			 particular interest are issues around consumer-directed services. Perhaps a  			 more probable initiative is enactment of tax incentives for private long-term  			 care insurance. Data are needed regarding who buys such insurance.</p>
<p>Also of interest regarding home and community-based services are  			 criteria for assessing State service-delivery "infrastructures" and needs for  			 technical assistance.</p>
<p>In addition, State Governments and the private sector are developing  			 assisted living and other housing-with-services options. This gives added  			 importance to information on the living arrangements of persons with  			 disabilities, along with their preferences. Such information is needed on the  			 disabled population as a whole and various subpopulations of persons with  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Welfare Reform Initiatives</b></i></p>
<p>Approximately one-third of women receiving Aid to Families with  			 Dependent Children (AFDC) either have a disability, have a child with a  			 disability or may reside with another adult with a disability (Adler, 1993).  			 Furthermore, research reviewed by the Urban Institute (Acs and Loprest, 1994)  			 gives some indication that women with disabilities (especially those with  			 multiple disabilities) are less likely to exit from AFDC for paid employment  			 within a year.</p>
<p>It is unclear the extent to which job training, if enacted as a part  			 of welfare reform, will address the special needs of persons with disabilities.  			 DALTCP has in progress an exploratory study of impacts on persons with  			 disabilities of welfare reform initiatives in a small sample of  			 States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Assessment of the Americans with Disabilities Act</b></i></p>
<p>As reported in Federal Implementation of the Americans with  			 Disabilities Act (ADA), 1991-94 (West, 1994), the potential of the ADA for  			 defending the civil rights of persons with disabilities has only partially been  			 realized. ASPE/DALTCP is particularly interested in access to health and  			 housing facilities.</p>
<p>Our experience is that one cannot assume easy access to health  			 institutions, even though many hospitals and clinics receive Federal support  			 and therefore have been required by the Federal Rehabilitation Act to provide  			 access. Accommodation of persons with disabilities in existing privately-owned  			 rental housing is not directly addressed by the ADA. Documenting the impact of  			 the ADA has special policy significance in today's political climate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>The Changing Federal Role: (A) Devolution; (B)  			 Reinvention</b></i></p>
<p>A major theme of the current Congress is transferring responsibility  			 for social programs to the States, generally by means of block grants. In the  			 past there has been minimal Federal monitoring of who receives which benefits,  			 and even less information about program impacts. For example, there are few  			 data on which age groups receive services under the Social Services Block  			 Grant.</p>
<p>Although an increased Federal awareness of disability is suggested  			 by the ADA and the President's Disability Policy Review, implementation of  			 block grants potentially for nutrition, welfare, and Medicaid programs may  			 substantially deter any Federal effort to track impacts on persons with  			 disabilities unless provisions for so doing are explicitly incorporated.</p>
<p>The Reinventing Government effort--that is making government  			 "leaner"--has implications for disability data. In an era of diminishing  			 resources, there is consideration of how to consolidate surveys, establish  			 standards for data collection and better organize data collection  			 responsibilities within agencies. Undertaking new data collection initiatives  			 in this environment will require considerable justification.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>III. GENERAL ORIENTATION TO DISABILITY DATA</h2>
<h3>A. Federal Data Bases</h3>
<p>The United States has a wide variety of data bases on persons with  		disabilities--national, State and private. The collection of data on persons  		with disabilities has made considerable progress over the past decade.</p>
<p>In the near future, data sets will become available that will shed light  		on the characteristics, service use, expenditures and sources of payment for  		many groups of persons with disabilities. Most notable is the Disability  		Survey, which is being administered as a supplement to the NHIS in 1994 and  		1995. This survey will serve as the "work horse" of disability analyses for the  		foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Even with such promising developments, a number of data problems  		persist. The Department's experience in examining health and long-term care  		reform options highlighted some of these problems.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>While much is known about the frail elderly and their use of  			 services, relatively little is known about other groups of persons with  			 disabilities such as children, working age adults and special populations  			 (e.g., mentally ill, developmentally disabled) that cut across age groups.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though not ideal, the activities of daily living (ADLs) provide  			 reasonable measures of functioning for older persons with physical  			 disabilities; however, we lack equivalent measures for persons with cognitive  			 impairments or mental illness and for children regardless of their type of  			 disability. Self-reported ADL status is inherently a "soft" measure of  			 disability and one subject to a lot of variability in the short run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More consistent policies on measures and data systems on persons  			 with disabilities are needed. At the national level, the data systems are  			 largely decentralized and there remain significant gaps in coverage. Improved  			 coordination, planning and priority setting among Federal agencies are required  			 to make possible the best analytic uses of the data bases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be development of longitudinal data bases (including  			 panel studies) on the general population with disabilities and special  			 subpopulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased access is needed to subnational data bases, including  			 State and local surveys, data from federally funded demonstration programs, and  			 proprietary data systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be more frequent and routine linkage of survey data  			 with administrative records such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  			 Security.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Other specific recommendations for improving disability data collection  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Routine inclusion of disability measures in ongoing national data  			 collection systems (LaPlante in National Council on Disability, 1992,  			 p.35).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Federal statistical reports, tabulation of findings by disability  			 along with other standard demographic variables (e.g., age, race and income)  			 (LaPlante, ibid.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased focus on gaining congressional support for expanded data  			 gathering on disability (LaPlante, ibid.). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting information in the Current Population Survey (CPS) on  			 labor force participation by persons with disabilities every month rather than  			 only in March as is now the practice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Yelin,  			 1992, p.157).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Overview of the 1994/95 Disability Survey (Supplement  		to NHIS)</h3>
<p>The 1994/95 Disability Survey, the most comprehensive national survey on  		disability ever undertaken in this country, will provide information on  		research and policy issues related to disability. It is the first exhaustive  		survey of disability since 1978 and the first ever to collect national  		population-based data on children with disabilities and persons with  		developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>Data from the 1994/95 Disability Survey will enable us to understand  		more about people with disabilities--their numbers, characteristics (e.g.,  		demographic, socio-economic, health, participation in Federal programs),  		service use and expenditures, and aspects of their daily lives (housing,  		transportation, employment, personal assistance). Data from the survey are  		relevant to the following policy questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What are the characteristics of people with disabilities who rely on  			 DHHS programs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is growth in SSI and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)  			 enrollment (and the companion Medicaid and Medicare programs) and costs so  			 high?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is employment among persons with disabilities so low and why do  			 some people with the same disabilities work while others do not? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the extent of disability among children and why is SSI  			 growth so high, what role do recent changes in SSI eligibility (i.e.,  			 <i>Zebley</i> Supreme Court decision, new childhood regulations, expanded  			 mental impairment criteria) play?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do persons with MR/DD access community services and what is the  			 role of Medicaid? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do access to health care, health care utilization, and public  			 versus private health insurance coverage vary for people with  			 disabilities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the impact of racial/ethnic differences in disability?  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The 1994/95 Disability Survey grew out of a coordinated interagency and  		inter-Departmental effort at DHHS to obtain timely and complete disability  		data.</p>
<p>Under an ASPE contract, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. produced a  		design for a national survey of persons with MR/DD as well as detailed measures  		and data collection instruments. A supplement to the NHIS was proposed as the  		vehicle for the MR/DD survey. This work served as the foundation for a more  		comprehensive Disability Survey.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was extensively reviewed by the Federal disability  		community, advocacy groups, and academics. In addition, the questionnaire was  		voluntarily tested by people with disabilities and their families at the NCHS  		Cognitive Questionnaire Lab. Finally, a pretest involving 250 households was  		also conducted in the Washington, DC area.</p>
<p>The 1994/95 Disability Survey is actually a two-year supplement to the  		National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS has been collecting  		information on the nation's health since 1957. Samples are huge. About 100,000  		households representing 240,000 people in the civilian non-institutionalized  		population will be interviewed.</p>
<p>The 1994/95 Disability Survey has two parts or phases, each of which  		consist of personal interviews in respondents' homes. Phase I is administered  		to the 240,000 respondents selected in the NHIS sample. Phase I interviews  		began in January 1994 and will continue through December 1995. Phase I contains  		many in-depth disability measures, as well as information on severity, onset,  		duration, and disabling condition.</p>
<p>Phase I disability measures include standard limitation of activity  		measures and detailed measures of sensory impairments, functioning of specific  		body systems, six separate ADLs, six separate instrumental activities of daily  		living (IADLs), mental illness, assistive devices, childhood disability, and  		functioning for children under five. People with MR/DD (using the legislative  		definition) can also be identified.</p>
<p>Many disability measures are standard, while others--notably those on  		children, mental illness, and developmental disabilities--are new and were  		derived with this survey in mind. Besides information on disability, data on  		health care, demographic, socioeconomic, health insurance, and program  		characteristics of people with and without disabilities are also gathered in  		Phase I.</p>
<p>Phase II is administered about 6-9 months after Phase I to about 40,000  		respondents with serious disabilities. Phase II began in the Fall 1994 and will  		end in Fall 1996. Phase II collects data on service use and expenditures,  		housing, long-term care services, home care, personal assistance, respite care,  		transportation, employment, accommodations, work history, vocational  		rehabilitation, relationships, family structure, family impact (for children)  		and child care (for children).</p>
<p>Information from the Disability Survey can be linked to administrative  		disability records at SSA and Medicare records at HCFA. Furthermore, while the  		Disability Survey is a one-time or snapshot survey, provisions can be made to  		follow respondents back and re-interview them for longitudinal studies. Final  		results could be released in early 1997 and preliminary results by early  		1996.</p>
<h2>IV. DATA ON WORKING AGE ADULTS</h2>
<h3>A. Key ASPE/DALTCP Policy Concerns</h3>
<p>In developing the long-term care proposal in the Health Security Act and  		defining a benefits package, analysts in ASPE and elsewhere lacked data about  		working age persons with disabilities and their use of services. We relied  		primarily on data from the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and the model  		of service use and costs developed by Brookings and Lewin-VHI for projections  		of target populations and costs for persons aged 65 and over.</p>
<p>In general, we have limited data on working age persons with  		disabilities in regard to key DHHS policy concerns. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Use and costs of PAS and related supports</i>. Recent expert  			 meetings confirmed our need for data on uses and costs of PAS and related  			 supports (such as assistive technology or adaptations) and for certain basic  			 health benefits such as maintenance rehabilitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Impacts of increased reliance on managed care on persons with  			 disabilities</i>. Managed care is a centerpiece of most reform initiatives  			 being implemented by many States (e.g., for their Medicaid programs) and by  			 private insurers. While managed care holds promise of providing, under one  			 auspice, an array of needed services by persons with disabilities, persons with  			 disabilities and their advocates express a number of fears and concerns about  			 potential disadvantages of managed care. These center on access to and receipt  			 of appropriate services.</p>
<p>There are few data to address key questions such as functional and  			 demographic characteristics of persons with disabilities in managed care and  			 the impact of managed care on access to needed services, affordability and  			 costs, and on individual outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Incentives or barriers to employment of persons with  			 disabilities</i>. Incentives and barriers to work for persons with disabilities  			 include access to health insurance and to long-term supports. ASPE/DALTCP has  			 in progress research to determine what data are available on the use of PAS and  			 of assistive technology by workers with disabilities to answer questions such  			 as:</p>
<ul><li>What number and proportion of workers use PAS, assistive  				technology, and adaptations and to what extent are these used in the work  				place? </li>
<li>
<p>To what extent do employers provide for personal assistance in  				  the work place or pay for assistive technology and other adaptations?</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i>How persons with disabilities or parents of children with  			 disabilities would be affected by proposed changes in the AFDC program</i>. As  			 mentioned above, ASPE/DALTCP is sponsoring exploratory telephone interviews  			 with officials in five States which have undertaken welfare reform initiatives.  			 In addition, ASPE is sponsoring an evaluation of State welfare reform  			 initiatives. It is anticipated that data collection will include questions  			 concerning AFDC recipients who have disabilities or who have children with  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Existing Data Sources</h3>
<p>Numerous Federal surveys collect disability data on the working age  		population (aged 18-64), but except for the 1994/95 Disability Survey, none  		focus primarily on disability. That was not always the case. SSA conducted the  		Surveys of Disability and Work every few years beginning in the early 1960s in  		order to measure the extent of disability in the working age population and to  		examine the experience of disabled workers on SSDI and their families. The last  		Survey of Disability and Work was conducted in 1978 and there are no plans to  		repeat the survey.</p>
<p>Nowadays, data sources include either special surveys on disability  		(like the 1994/95 Disability Survey) or the addition of disability questions on  		non-disability surveys. Besides the 1994/95 Disability Survey, the major  		sources of information on the entire working age population with disabilities  		include:</p>

<p></p><menu><li>1990 Decennial Census, </li>
<li>1984, 1990-96 Surveys of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),  		  </li>
<li>1957-95 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), </li>
<li>1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES), and </li>
<li>Annual Current Population Surveys (CPS). </li>
<p></p></menu><p>In addition, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) covers SSDI  		beneficiaries eligible for Medicare--a small but policy-relevant segment of the  		working age population with disabilities.</p>
<h3>C. Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>The sheer size of the working age population with disabilities is  		immense. Although disability rates are much lower among the working age  		population (13.7 percent) than among the elderly (54.8 percent), more people  		with disabilities are in their working years (21.1 million) than in their  		elderly years (17.1 million).</p>
<p>The working age population is not only large, but heterogeneous, and is  		in fact made up of many smaller groups, most of whom are too small to pick up  		in surveys. These small often policy relevant groups can be based on condition  		(i.e., mental retardation, mental illness, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord  		injury), type of impairment (i.e., mental, physical), program participation  		(i.e., SSDI, SSI, VA), onset (congenital, childhood, early or late adulthood),  		age, gender, and race. Only the 1994/95 Disability Survey with its huge samples  		can hope to gather data on many of these small groups.</p>
<p>There are crucial but unresolved definitional and measurement issues  		among the working age population. No equivalent severity measures and survey  		questions have been developed for physical versus mental impairments. The  		standard functioning questions based on ADLs and IADLs often break down. Since  		mental illness and mental retardation are major disabling conditions in this  		age group, this is a critical gap.</p>
<p>The relationship between functional disability and work is also not well  		understood. Some people with the same level and type of disability work while  		others do not. Besides disability, a host of other factors are important in the  		decision to begin or return to work. These can include occupation (i.e.,  		sedentary, manual labor), educational attainment, and age (those in their 60s  		may wish to stop work and retire early).</p>
<p>A small but important segment of the working age population with  		disabilities are institutionalized (i.e., nursing homes, mental hospitals,  		prisons) or are homeless. Since few national surveys include this population  		and since the few surveys which focus on the institutionalized (i.e., the  		National Nursing Home Survey) have very small samples of the nonelderly, we  		know little about this group.</p>
<p>Most Federal disability programs focus on the nonelderly and many of  		these pertain to people in their working years. These programs have  		administrative records which, if linked to national population-based surveys,  		could strengthen and expand our knowledge. However, administrative data is  		often not linked for reasons of confidentiality or simply because no such  		considerations were made.</p>
<h2>V. DATA ON PERSONS UNDER AGE 18</h2>
<h3>A. Key ASPE/DALTCP Policy Concerns</h3>
<p>A major policy focus for this age group concerns issues relating to  		benefits for children under the Federal SSI program. In 1994, almost three  		times as many children received SSI benefits (approximately 900,000 children)  		as did in 1989. This dramatic growth in the SSI program and the changing  		characteristics of the children who participate--most notably a presumed  		increase in children with mental impairments--has caused scrutiny of the  		program by the Administration and the Congress.</p>
<p>By Congressional mandate, the National Commission on Childhood  		Disability is reviewing the SSI program and the needs of children with  		disabilities. ASPE/DALTCP has been involved in developing a research agenda for  		the Commission. In addition, ASPE and DALTCP staff are leading the task force  		on disability programs for children as part of the Administration's Disability  		Policy Review.</p>
<p>The Commission has authority to examine:</p>
<ul><li> causes of program growth; </li>
<li> eligibility criteria and determination;</li>
<li> relative merits of voucher rather than cash benefits; </li>
<li> effects of SSI benefits on children and their families; and</li>
<li> merits of alternative approaches to helping children achieve future  		  independence and employment, including closer involvement of private  		  organizations in providing services. </li>
</ul><p>In addition the Commission's charge includes consideration of Federal  		health assistance programs for children and the interactions of SSI with other  		public medical, special education, and case management programs.</p>
<p>Our plans to date for generating information for the National Childhood  		Disability Commission include analysis of early data from the Disability  		Survey; a synthesis of SIPP, Census, and NHIS data, and studies of use of  		Medicaid-funded services by SSI recipients.</p>
<p>In addition to its work with the Commission and the Disability Policy  		Review, ASPE/DALTCP and other ASPE programs are undertaking a program of  		research on children with disabilities. Projects include analyzing use of  		Medicaid services by children with disabilities, examining managed care  		programs for children with disabilities, and describing the extent to which  		school systems meet requirements for provision of related services under the  		individuals with Disabilities Education Act by using Medicaid benefits.</p>
<p>More broadly, the "reinvention" of the Federal Government and the shift  		toward consolidating categorical programs, establishing block grants and  		capping expenditures for major programs (e.g., Medicaid) could have significant  		impacts on children with disabilities.</p>
<p>We recently awarded seven research grants for projects which make use of  		available data sets. These include State and local data bases. Topics include  		assessment of policy implications of alternative functional definitions,  		patterns of service use and costs within several States, interactions of the  		AFDC and SSI programs with regard to children with disabilities.</p>
<h3>B. Existing Data Sources</h3>
<p>Little information exists on children with disabilities. The major  		sources of information are:</p>

<p></p><menu><li>1994/95 Disability Survey, </li>
<li>1984-96 Surveys of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), </li>
<li>1957-95 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), </li>
<li>1987-88 Survey of Families and Households, and </li>
<li>1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES). </li>
<p></p></menu><p>Program records from SSI and the special education programs also contain  		disability data.</p>
<h3>C. Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>It is difficult to measure disability in children-much more so than for  		adults. Furthermore, the younger the child, the harder it is to understand,  		articulate, and measure disability. In fact, disability is a very different  		concept for infants, toddlers, preschool children, school-age children, and  		adolescents. Whereas play is the usual activity for children aged 3-5 and  		attending school for those aged 5-17, the usual activity of infants and  		toddlers (growing, developing?) is unclear and hard to measure. The lack of  		standard measures meant that new questions needed to be created for the 1994/95  		Disability Survey.</p>
<p>Although children constitute about a quarter of the population, national  		surveys often include few children with disabilities in their samples. This is  		because the prevalence of children with disabilities is small (about 6 or 7  		percent of all children) and because major surveys like the SIPP and the CPS  		are really focused almost exclusively on adults (people aged 15+ or 16+).</p>
<p>For example, SIPP has collected data on children's disability since its  		inception, but none on children's SSI participation, because SSI receipt is in  		the core set of questions designed solely for adults. (This will be remedied  		starting with the 1996 SIPP.)</p>
<p>While longitudinal data are universally scarce for people with  		disabilities, their lack is especially crucial for children, who change much  		more rapidly than adults in regards to disability and everything else. Finally,  		children live in families. While data on a child's disability is crucial, we  		also need to know about his or her family and their characteristics in order to  		gain an accurate understanding of the issues.</p>
<h2>VI. DATA ON OLDER ADULTS</h2>
<h3>A. Key Policy Concerns</h3>
<p>While data on older adults with disabilities is more extensive than for  		other populations, there are significant gaps.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Modeling Service Use and Costs</i>. Increases in the aging  			 population, especially in numbers of persons over age 80 or 85 who are at  			 greatest risk for needing health and long-term care services, dominates much  			 debate over policies on older adults. A major emphasis of ASPE/DALTCP's recent  			 work with regard to older adults has been modeling long-term care service use  			 and costs by persons age 65 and older using primarily data from the NLTCS.</p>
<p>Use of the model greatly facilitated development and acceptance of  			 the long-term care proposal for various health reform bills last year. We plan  			 to extend this model to estimating acute care costs in order to project  			 consequences for policy changes such as, for example, adding co-payments to  			 Medicare home health benefits or increasing Medicare Part B premiums.</p>
<p>We would also expect to examine the impact of integrated acute and  			 long-term care strategies on public and private expenditures. In addition, we  			 propose to extend our capability to understand impacts within States of  			 changing use and costs of acute and long-term services, using Census data, the  			 NLTCS and the Disability Survey.</p>
<p>A key question is the extent to which increased life expectancy is  			 accompanied by a longer period of disability and chronic illness. There is some  			 evidence from earlier rounds of the NLTCS that the prevalence of disability  			 among the elderly is decreasing. Data from the 1994 NLTCS may provide further  			 assessment of these trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Changes in Medicare Home Health Care Benefits</i>. Medicare home  			 health and skilled nursing facility expenditures have quadrupled in the past  			 five years, from $2 billion to over $8 billion. We are undertaking research in  			 collaboration With the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and  			 HCFA to understand the nature of these increases and the extent to which  			 Medicare home health benefits are changing from a post-acute care step down  			 benefit into a source of long-term custodial care for the elderly.</p>
<p>We also hope to link the Medicaid Statistical Information Systems  			 data set with the MCBS to examine the mix of skilled and custodial home care  			 benefits by persons dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Subacute Care</i>. Subacute care--i.e., comprehensive,  			 specialized services provided in settings other than hospitals--has emerged as  			 a policy concern for both the Medicare and Medicaid programs and to those  			 involved in health reform. We are attempting to describe use of subacute care  			 in both fee-for-service and managed care settings and its effects on acute  			 (i.e., hospital) and other traditional post acute services. Expected and  			 achieved outcomes are also at issue. At this point data for such analyses are  			 limited, so that we are undertaking case studies of four market areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Long-Term Care Insurance</i>. A key proposal of long-term care  			 reform--incentives for private long-term care insurance--continues to be of  			 interest to Congress and may be pursued separately from other health reform  			 proposals. As noted above, data are lacking on the availability, coverage and  			 use of such insurance. We are particularly interested in assessing the impact  			 of State regulation on the affordability and quality of, as well as consumer  			 satisfaction with various long-term care insurance products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Housing with Services</i>. As the long-term care system evolves,  			 more emphasis is being placed on combining housing and PAS for the frail  			 elderly in community settings. We are interested in examining a variety of  			 housing with services options, including board and care homes, assisted living  			 facilities, continuing care retirement communities and others.</p>
<p>There is a need for current and comprehensive data on such places in  			 order to determine their appropriate role in the long-term care  			 system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>International Comparisons</i>. ASPE has undertaken a project to  			 strengthen collection, analyses and dissemination of comparable data about  			 long-term care in Japan and the United States. This work involves collaboration  			 with HRSA and the Leadership Center for Longevity and Society at Mount Sinai  			 Medical Center. ASPE provides support for analyses of informal caregiving in  			 several industrialized societies.</p>
<p>Other international efforts are underway as well, including working  			 with WHO on the revision of the ICIDH, with special attention to how it affects  			 disability policy.</p>
<p>ASPE also participates actively in the International Collaborative  			 Effort (ICE) on Aging, sponsored by NCHS. For example, in one project on the  			 outcomes of nursing home care in five countries, the ICE on Aging researchers  			 have highlighted the need for improved measurement and data collection  			 comparability among nations (Van Nostrand et al., 1993).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Existing Data Sources</h3>
<p>The major sources of data on the frail elderly include the NLTCS (1 982,  		1984 and 1989), the Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Asset and Health Dynamics  		of the Elderly Survey and the MCBS. The elderly are included in most general  		purpose surveys like NHIS and SIPP, but sample sizes for the frail  		elderly--especially those at advanced ages--are typically small.</p>
<h3>C. Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>For purposes of determining disability status among the elderly, surveys  		tend to focus on the ability of respondents to carry out ADLs and IADLs.  		However, operational measures of these activities vary widely across surveys.  		There are discrepancies regarding the sources of assistance; some measures  		focus on active personal assistance, others include standby or supervisory  		assistance and still others cover assistive devices. The lack of consistent  		measures has contributed to a wide range of estimates of size of the frail  		elderly population.</p>
<p>Measures of cognitive disability have not kept pace with the measurement  		of physical disability. This is a major concern, in light of the policy focus  		on persons with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>Existing sampling frames are inadequate for accurately and efficiently  		identifying places where frail elderly persons reside. The growth of housing  		with services options means that elderly persons with disabilities can live in  		places other than their own home or a nursing home. These alternative living  		arrangements include board and care homes, assisted living facilities,  		continuing care retirement communities and other related group living  		arrangements.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau classifies places as households or group quarters, the  		latter being subdivided into institutional and non-institutional group  		quarters. Unfortunately, this classification means that assisted living  		facilities and similar arrangements can show up in any or all of these  		categories. This makes screening and sampling extremely expensive and  		inefficient.</p>
<p>Other problems include small sample sizes for persons aged 85 or over,  		inadequate coverage of minority elderly, insufficient geographic detail,  		obstacles to administrative record linkages, and paucity of longitudinal data  		for measuring transitions in old age. Most critically, we lack an appropriate  		conceptual framework with corresponding measures to study disability across the  		lifespan.</p>
<h2>VII. DATA ON SPECIAL POPULATIONS</h2>
<h3>A. Key ASPE/DALTCP Policy and Research Concerns</h3>
<p>In general, it is important to note that proposed cutbacks in the SSI  		program, State and private health reform initiatives, and potential changes in  		Medicare and Medicaid are all policy issues which affect special populations of  		persons with disabilities. In addition, racial, ethnic, and gender differences  		in service needs and use are increasingly important variables in designing  		programs, given the increasing heterogeneity of the U.S. population and  		increased incidence of disability among minority populations.</p>
<p>An issue regarding special populations which is of particular concern to  		ASPE/DALTCP is how well persons with serious mental illness or mental  		retardation are served by a "generic" system of home and community-based  		services. For example, ASPE/DALTCP is proposing to convene a meeting to address  		the long-term care needs of persons with developmental disabilities involving  		mental retardation and whether they are best served by separation from or  		integration with other long-term care programs.</p>
<p>One interesting concept involves identifying tracer "conditions",  		whereby persons with particular disabilities--especially the more rare  		populations--could be tracked in terms' of service use, expenditures and  		payment sources.</p>
<p>Eligibility determination for a system serving multiple populations is a  		particular issue. For example, persons with serious mental illness are  		concerned not only about selfcare functions but also with functioning in social  		and recreational settings as well as at work. This population is also concerned  		that bureaucratic gatekeeping based on ADL impairments would not offer  		eligibility to needed services for them.</p>
<p>Further, persons with mental illness often have periods of relative good  		health and functioning but argue that continued access to long-term supports  		during these times would be cost-effective in that health would be sustained  		over longer periods with supervision and other supports. The MR/DD population  		tends to need supervision or cuing to perform ADLs, as well as help with IADLs.  		Hence eligibility based on need for hands on help with self care activities is  		inappropriate.</p>
<p>A focus of the President's Disability Policy Review is the transition of  		young adults from school to work. Various policies and programs have an impact  		on readiness to work of a young adult with disabilities including not only  		special education interventions and the availability of suitable employment but  		also access to health insurance and needed personal assistance and assistive  		devices.</p>
<p>Other special populations, e.g., persons with mental illness or  		developmental disabilities, are also concerned with linkages between long-term  		supports and social, recreational, and work settings.</p>
<h3>B. Existing Data Sources</h3>
<p>In light of a variety of policy and program concerns, data needs on  		special populations can be grouped into four categories: (a) prevalence data  		for the population as a whole and major subgroups; (b) data on socioeconomic  		status, health status, functioning and related demographic characteristics; (c)  		data on service use, service needs, service costs; and, (d) data on  		developments over time for special populations as they move from childhood to  		adulthood to old age.</p>
<p>Special populations with certain disabilities (e.g., MR/DD) are rare in  		the population as a whole, though they are significant from a policy  		perspective. Existing surveys often fail to include measures for identifying  		them. There are three nationally representative surveys with some information  		about special populations: SIPP, NHIS and NMES.</p>
<p>For some special populations, e.g., persons with developmental  		disabilities, there also exist State surveys and narrowly focused studies,  		covering participation in selected programs or particular living arrangements  		(such as large residential facilities). All are able to shed some light on  		special populations.</p>
<h3>C. Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>The principal limitations across the three national surveys include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Inadequate flexibility in the data to distinguish between mild and  			 moderate disability from severe disability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on Federal program participation rather than comprehensive  			 coverage of individuals' service needs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insufficient coverage of nonmedical family and community-based  			 services, such as day care, supported employment, crisis intervention, assisted  			 living and case management. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small or non-representative sample sizes. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, NHIS and SIPP are limited to the non-institutional  		population, with SIPP beginning with respondents age 15 and over. NMES included  		persons in facilities, but tended to exclude those in small community-based  		residential settings.</p>
<p>More narrow surveys and studies provide a rich source of information  		about special populations. However, without a clear idea of the  		representativeness of the persons included in these studies, it is not possible  		to put the findings in context.</p>
<p>The Disability Survey, which is being administered as a supplement to  		the NHIS over a two year period, will go a long way toward remedying many of  		these concerns (though, as noted, it is household-based and excludes  		institutions).</p>
<h2>VIII. A DISABILITY DATA STRATEGY</h2>
<h3>A. Key Questions</h3>
<p>In developing a disability data strategy that meets ASPE's specific  		policy research agenda and at the same time serves the interests of the  		research community more broadly, a number of questions suggest themselves.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Content</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>What are the relative priorities on collecting data at the level  				  of: </p>
<ul><li>persons?</li>
<li>families and households?</li>
<li>providers?</li>
<li>environment?</li>
<li>
<p>specific programs?</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Coverage</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Since many major national surveys cover only the civilian  				  noninstitutionalized population, how can coverage be extended to persons in  				  institutions, persons in the armed forces and persons living abroad as part of  				  an overall disability data strategy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should a higher priority be given in the future to separate  				  disability surveys or inclusion of standard disability measures in existing  				  surveys?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would be needed to assure that standard disability measures  				  are included in existing or planned surveys?</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Sampling</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>How can existing sampling frames, which are built around housing  				  units and group quarters (institutional and non-institutional), be changed to  				  identify more easily persons with disabilities who live in alternative housing  				  arrangements (assisted living facilities, board and care homes, independent  				  living facilities, etc.)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the key policy-relevant subgroups of persons with  				  disabilities, for which sufficient sample sizes are needed for accurate  				  estimation along critical dimensions? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What strategies are needed to assure representativeness of key  				  disability-related subgroups in sample surveys? </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Periodicity</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>What can be done to collect data on persons with disabilities on  				  a more regular and predictable basis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given budgetary realities, should the emphasis be on one time or  				  occasional surveys that collect a lot of data or more regular and frequent  				  surveys that collect fewer data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In light of budgetary realties, what relative priority should be  				  given to: (a) longitudinal surveys, (b) panel surveys, and (c) cross-sectional  				  surveys?</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Access</b></i></p>
<p>What can be done to assure the timely production of useful and  			 widely available public use tapes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Administrative Records</b></i></p>
<p>What can be done to improve access to administrative records and  			 link them to national survey data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Subnational and International Estimation</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>To what extent should Federal resources be expended to generate  				  estimates at the State and sub-State level on the prevalence, incidence and  				  types of disability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What role should the Federal Government, DHHS and ASPE play in  				  promoting State and subState data collection on disability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What role should the Federal Government, DHHS and ASPE play in  				  fostering expansion and comparability in international data collection and  				  coding (i.e., ICIDH) on disability? </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Modeling</b></i></p>
<p>How can microsimulation models on financing and personal assistance  			 services for persons with disabilities be developed and what would be the  			 critical features of such models?</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>B. Potential Next Steps</h3>
<p>The following is a list of potential next steps for ASPE that could help  		articulate and support a policy relevant disability-related data strategy.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Exploration of accessing data from demonstrations and waiver  			 programs (e.g., 1115 waivers) for analysis, with emphasis on the methodological  			 and cost implications of this approach for related data collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of technical assistance to States in their  			 disability-related data collection efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for expanded analyses of existing disability-related data by  			 researches and policy analysts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouragement of linkages of administrative records to survey data.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of the use of disability measures; in general, purpose  			 surveys to help monitor the impact of new policies and programs (e.g., block  			 grants) on persons with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting of a disability data conference, resulting in proceedings,  			 special issue of a journal and/or a book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishment of a Federal interagency coordinating body on  			 disability statistics (analogous to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging  			 Related Statistics).</p>

<h2>August 1995</h2>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		sponsored a meeting of experts on the topic of Disability Data for Disability  		Policy. The meeting focused on data relevant to health and long-term support.  		It was hosted by ASPE's Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy  		(DALTCP) at the Holiday Inn Capital in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1995.</p>
<p>This day-long meeting was the last of three expert meetings on  		disability topics, in which DALTCP sought advice for its newly-expanded  		research agenda on disability. National experts in disability data sets  		relating to children, working age adults, the elderly, and special populations  		joined with representatives of Federal agencies to examine the availability of,  		access to and potential analyses of disability data.</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the meeting were to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Assess disability-related national data sets pertaining to health  			 and long-term supports, particularly as related to the policy issues discussed  			 in the background paper <b><i>Disability Data for Disability Policy:  			 Availability, Access and Analysis</i></b>, prepared by DALTCP staff and  			 distributed to the participants prior to the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify useful State, area, private and international data bases,  			 including data from large federally-assisted demonstrations of managed care,  			 integrated health services, long-term care and welfare reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify next steps in analyzing available disability data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propose priorities for DALTCP's research agenda regarding disability  			 data.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>II. SUMMARY OF PARTICIPANTS' COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<h3>A. Environment</h3>
<p>In the current environment, several participants stated that new Federal  		funding for large national surveys relating to disability was unlikely. At the  		same time there is an ongoing need for data in the light of societal changes  		and policy issues affecting persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Department of Health and Human Services  		(DHHS), changes in the health care system are of critical importance. Data are  		needed to monitor the impact on persons with disabilities of efforts to control  		access and reduce costs under managed care systems. Similarly many welfare  		reforms initiated by States will have an impact on persons with  		disabilities.</p>
<p>The availability of personal assistance services and the role of  		consumer choice in service delivery is an important issue for DHHS. Other areas  		of concern to persons with disability are factors affecting labor force  		participation (e.g., vulnerability in recessions) and access to affordable  		housing.</p>
<p>With reduced Federal funding, it will be necessary to search for and  		make better use of subnational and private sector data sets to explore these  		issues.</p>
<h3>B. Themes</h3>
<p>Among the themes highlighted by participants were the following:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b><i>Longitudinal Data</i></b></p>
<p>Participants stressed the need for longitudinal data on disability.  			 National surveys like the National Health and Retirement Survey (NHRS) and its  			 companion Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old Survey (AHEAD), the  			 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics  			 were mentioned as sources of longitudinal data. <a href="research-agenda-disability-data.html#sectionD">Section  			 D</a> below discusses State-level data sources, which may include longitudinal  			 data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Disability Measures</i></b></p>
<p>There is a need for a wide range of disability measures on surveys,  			 so that researchers can select particular measures appropriate for their  			 investigations. Researchers need to report on the precise measures they are  			 using in their analyses.</p>
<p>At the same time, the creation of a minimum data set on disability  			 should be explored; such a data set could be included in all population-based  			 surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</i></b></p>
<p>The selection and development of survey domains--e.g., income and  			 assets, health, work, functioning--should be done on an interdisciplinary  			 basis. This was done effectively in the case of the NHRS and AHEAD surveys.  			 (NHRS focuses on a baseline cohort aged 51-61 in 1992. AHEAD includes persons  			 aged 70 or over in 1993.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Control Groups</i></b></p>
<p>Where feasible, control groups should be included among survey  			 respondents to compare findings on persons with disabilities to persons without  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>C. Coverage</h3>
<p>Participants made a number of recommendations on obtaining updated  		disability data. Among them were the following.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Include at least broad questions on disability on all major  			 population-based surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand the number of disability questions on the Current Population  			 Survey. Include among them one or more questions on working conditions and ask  			 the questions monthly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand AHEAD's survey modules to capture more aspects of disability  			 and test experimental approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend NHRS to younger age groups; among other things this could  			 permit capture of data before and after the onset of disability for some  			 individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Supplemental Security Income status to questions on children in  			 the Consumer Expenditure Survey, the Survey of Income and Program Participation  			 and all other major economic surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate hypotheses and measures from epidemiological studies  			 into the development of national surveys; for example, it is possible that  			 clinically-derived measures of cognitive impairment could be adapted to  			 large-scale surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oversample children in national surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider more focused surveys rather than oversampling on large  			 surveys; one possibility is a survey of families who have children with  			 developmental disabilities to evaluate the impact of cash payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track users of services (e.g., mental health services) across  			 different service systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make greater use of questions from national surveys, e.g., National  			 Medical Expenditure Survey for health expenditure information, in State  			 surveys. With appropriate weights, national surveys could thereby be used for  			 State-level estimation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the planned redesign of the National Health Interview Survey,  			 retain the conditions list and incorporate questions on work capacity plus  			 cognitive, social and physical functioning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionD" id="sectionD">D. Data Sources</a></h3>
<p>Some federally-sponsored surveys have disability data that could be more  		fully utilized. The revised version of the <a href="research-agenda-disability-data.html#backpaper">background  		paper</a> now provides information on such surveys as: the Behavioral Risk  		Factor Surveillance System sponsored by the Center for Disease Control (CDC),  		the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, and the Department of Veterans  		Affairs' National Survey of Veterans. The National Institute on Mental Health  		is currently sponsoring the development of a new national survey with  		disability-related measures titled Use, Needs, Outcomes and Costs in Child and  		Adolescent Populations.</p>
<p>In addition to national surveys, it will be necessary in the future to  		make greater use of subnational data sources, such as:</p>
<ul><li> State surveys and information systems,</li>
<li> natural experiments,</li>
<li> school systems,</li>
<li> Workmen's Compensation files, and</li>
<li> cata from demonstrations and waiver programs with a disability  		  focus.</li>
</ul><p>Insofar as possible, national surveys should be replicated at the State  		level or at least key data elements from these surveys incorporated into State  		surveys. State and local government monitoring systems are another potential  		source of useful data on persons with disabilities. The benefits to State and  		local governments in increasing access to their data need to be  		highlighted.</p>
<p>CDC sponsors Disabilities Prevention categorical grants. Thirty States  		participate and have research and surveillance systems for traumatic brain  		injury, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol  		syndrome, Down syndrome, mental retardation, and sickle cell anemia.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the meeting, one participant sent a letter proposing a way  		to generate longitudinal data from States. The idea is to identify at least  		several States (preferably large ones) that have maintained strong data sets on  		persons with disabilities. Such data sets could be pooled across a specified  		number of years. The model for this is the DHHS' Administration for Children  		and Families MultiState Data Archive on foster care.</p>
<p>One largely untapped area is proprietary data bases. It was suggested in  		the meeting that private firms might be more willing to make their data  		available if they got some tangible return. Also, the incentive to share data  		might be enhanced if it were possible to pool data from several sources (e.g.,  		a group of employers) to preserve anonymity.</p>
<h3>E. Analyses</h3>
<p>The potential for analyses of data on disability issues is great.  		Several specific suggestions emerged from the participants.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Identify the top ten questions of disability policy interest and  			 invite researchers to address them. For example, the National Institute on  			 Aging supports nine Demography on Aging Centers around the country; they are  			 available as resources for analyzing policy issues on elderly persons with  			 disabilities, as well as conducting basic research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use new techniques of computer mapping to highlight geographic areas  			 of high and low disability rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emphasize basic research on the processes of disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop more theory-driven and hypothesis-driven surveys on  			 disability rather than trying to answer every conceivable question. Often  			 survey development is guided by policy issues which prove to be transitory.  			 Survey data should focus rather on longer term issues and concerns that  			 undergird policy development.</p>
<p>NHRS and AHEAD are examples of surveys that were developed around  			 theories about the decision to retire (e.g., structural models of utility  			 functions) and hypotheses about consumption, saving and intergenerational  			 transfer patterns among the elderly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use disability data to monitor the differential impacts of cutbacks  			 in public programs, to evaluate program effectiveness and to improve program  			 operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While additional data on disability are needed, more could be done  			 to analyze existing data. In fact, in an era of cutbacks more will have to be  			 done to analyze existing data.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>III. ASPE FOLLOWUP</h2>
<p>Some comments were offered on the <a href="research-agenda-disability-data.html#backpaper">background  		paper</a> <b><i>Disability Data for Disability Policy: Availability, Access and  		Analysis</i></b>, prepared by DALTCP staff. While generally well-received, the  		paper was faulted for failing to highlight problems with self-reported data on  		functional status. There was some question about the advisability of  		oversampling based on functional status, since the measures are inherently  		"soft" and since functional status itself is very changeable. Also, it was  		noted that too little attention was paid to the need for data on pre-disability  		and post-disability status and to longitudinal data overall.</p>
<p>Participants throughout the day identified actions that ASPE might take  		to foster disability data development and analyses. One post-meeting  		correspondent supported the creation of a single agency to manage Federal  		statistical programs and respond to policy research priorities. Advisory focus  		groups of key constituencies (e.g., the disability community, State and local  		officials) could be tapped to identify emerging policy initiatives and service  		delivery models as input into survey design.</p>
<p>Other actions discussed at the meeting included the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Bring together State officials, private sector representatives and  			 members of the disability community to discuss data design and data access  			 issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide technical support to State data initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct smaller meetings devoted to the data needs of specific  			 groups of persons with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote faster access to Federal data sets through such mechanisms  			 as early results workshops. A current candidate for release of public use tapes  			 as soon as possible is the Disability Survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate linkages between survey data and administrative records;  			 e.g., Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Also, try to broaden the kinds of  			 information collected for administrative purposes; e.g., by routinely including  			 health and functional status in administrative records.</p>
</li>
