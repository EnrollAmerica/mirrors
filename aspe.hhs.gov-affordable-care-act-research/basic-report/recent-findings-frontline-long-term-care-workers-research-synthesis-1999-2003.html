</dl><h2><a name="sectionI" id="sectionI">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the synthesis paper is to review, summarize, and discuss  		the significance of available research findings on the frontline long-term care  		(LTC) workforce since 1999, in both home and community-based and nursing home  		settings. This paper builds on the review article by Stone (2001) that reviewed  		the seminal practice and policy research related to recruitment and retention  		of frontline workers in LTC. Writing in 2001, Stone noted the lack of empirical  		research and, in particular, of evaluations to determine the effectiveness of  		programs and polices intended to recruit and retain LTC direct care  		workers.</p>
<p>This paper provides an updated review of the status of empirical  		findings, focusing on what has been learned between 1999 and 2003. The primary  		goal is to learn what initiatives have worked to reduce LTC direct care  		workforce recruitment and retention problems. A secondary goal is to provide  		empirically-based insights on the factors that contribute to recruitment and  		retention problems. This paper is intended to help policymakers, providers,  		worker and consumer groups, and researchers create a framework for future  		evidence-based policy, practice, and applied research initiatives to address  		LTC direct care workforce shortages.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>The paraprofessional LTC workforce--over 2.4 million nursing aides,  		orderlies, and attendants, home health aides, and personal and home care aides  		(USBLS, 2004a)--forms the core of the formal LTC system.<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Direct care workers serve as the eyes and ears  		of the formal LTC system and provide most of the care in this system. Even with  		relatively high unemployment rates, LTC providers and state agencies  		responsible for LTC services are reporting unprecedented vacancies and turnover  		rates among direct care workers, ranging from 45 percent to over 100 percent  		annually for nursing homes. Most states consider direct care worker recruitment  		and retention major issues (NCDFS, 1999; PHI and NCDHHS, 2004). </p>
<p>Significant societal factors are converging that will likely result in a  		21st Century LTC direct care workforce crisis, or "care gap," in the US. These  		dynamics include an unprecedented increase in the elderly population and those  		with chronic medical conditions, a decrease in the traditional pool of women  		available to provide formal care, fewer adult children available to provide  		care, and a potential increase in the need for paid care for elderly parents of  		dual-income and single-parent households. Policymakers and providers need to  		know what workforce initiatives have been shown to work to address the direct  		care workforce shortage.</p>
<p>Previously reported research (discussed in Stone, 2001 and Stone and  		Wiener, 2001) highlights a variety of factors associated with LTC direct care  		workforce recruitment and retention problems. These factors include but are not  		limited to: inadequate training; poor public image of the LTC direct care  		workforce; low pay; insufficient benefits; inadequate job orientation and lack  		of mentoring; little or no opportunities for continuing education and  		development within the position; poor supervision; emotionally and physically  		hard work; workplace stress and burnout; personal life stressors, such as  		problems with housing, child care, and transportation; lack of respect from  		residents' families; and, short staffing. In the past several years, states,  		providers, and worker groups have developed, implemented and, in some cases,  		evaluated a variety of initiatives to address these challenges. This paper  		gives an overview of the most recent evidence base on both problems and  		possible solutions, to inform future investment choices and initiatives.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>We review both published reports and articles, unpublished conference  		presentations and working papers reporting results of research and evaluations  		on recruiting, retaining, and sustaining a quality frontline workforce in  		nursing homes, home care, and assisted living facilities. The review updates  		research findings reported in a seminal piece by Stone (2001) to better  		understand the problems facing the frontline LTC workforce and to identify  		effective solutions to chronic shortages, high turnover, and training needs.  		Studies on the relationship between LTC staffing levels and quality of care  		were not included, as they are beyond the scope of this paper; however, studies  		that examine links between staffing levels and worker satisfaction or turnover  		rates are included in this review. </p>
<p>Research and evaluation reports and articles completed or initiated  		between 1999 and 2003 were identified using Internet searches, personal  		communication with researchers, and database searches (e.g., PubMed). Search  		terms used when conducting web site and database searches included: LTC  		workforce, recruiting, labor force, nurse aides, job tenure, employment  		practices, work environment, aging services personnel, paraprofessional  		personnel, and intervention strategies. While published articles in  		peer-reviewed journals generally were preferred, unpublished reports and  		interim progress reports were included if based on sound research methods. We  		include studies that use qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Initiatives  		that were at an early stage of development in the Stone (2001) article were  		investigated to determine if the research or evaluation was now complete. We  		also obtained relevant working papers and presentations at professional  		conferences (e.g., American Society on Aging, Gerontological Society of  		America) and made personal communications.</p>
<p>The studies abstracted and analyzed for this report fall into two main  		categories: (1) empirical research (i.e., results of surveys and qualitative  		studies) on direct care workers that describe their working conditions or  		further elucidate the causes of turnover; and (2) evaluations of the  		implementation and impact of public and private initiatives designed to improve  		the recruitment and retention of direct care workers (e.g., wage and/or benefit  		enhancements, new training programs, and revised certification requirements).  		</p>

<h2><a name="sectionIV" id="sectionIV">IV. TRENDS IN CHARACTERISTICS OF DIRECT CARE  		WORKERS AND THE WAGES AND HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS OF THEIR JOBS</a></h2>
<p>Eighty to 90 percent of direct care workers are women. About half of  		direct care workers are non-white, compared to one-quarter of all workers. The  		typical direct care worker is a single mother aged 25-54. Compared to the  		general workforce, direct care workers are more likely to be non-white,  		unmarried, and with children at home (GAO, 2001). Crown, Ahlburg and MacAdam  		(1995) conducted a comprehensive profile of nurse aides and home care workers  		based on nationally representative samples using data from the Current  		Population Survey (CPS) March supplements of the late 1980s. The profile  		compared demographic characteristics and work conditions for three types of  		aides: hospital aides, nursing home aides and home care aides. A new study by  		Yamada (2002) updated the data examined by Crown and colleagues, using the same  		data sources and methodology, in order to assess trends in the direct care  		workforce over the past 10 years from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. </p>
<h3>A. Characteristics of Direct Care Workers</h3>
<p>The study by Yamada found a number of important changes over this  		period. Compared to the late 1980s, home care aides in the late 1990s were  		younger, more educated and more likely to have children. While home care aides  		tended to be older than nursing home aides and hospital aides in both the 1980s  		and the 1990s, the mean age of home care aides declined in the 10-year period.  		While no data were available on citizenship in the late 1980s, home care aides  		were significantly less likely to be native-born US citizens than were nursing  		home and hospital aides in the late 1990s. Educational levels among aides have  		increased over the past 10 years; home care aides still have less education  		than other aides, but almost 30 percent of nursing home aides and home care  		aides have at least some college education. </p>
<p>With regard to working conditions, home care aides were more likely to  		work full-time and full year in the 1990s (46 percent) than in the late 1980s  		(29 percent), but still less likely to work full-time and full-year than  		nursing home aides (55 percent) and hospital aides (63 percent). Forty-two  		percent of part-time home care aides reported a preference for part-time work.  		However, 18 percent of part-time home care aides said they preferred a  		full-time job but could only find part-time jobs. Home care workers are  		somewhat more likely to have earnings from other work (23 percent) than are  		nursing home aides (20 percent). </p>
<h3>B. Wages</h3>
<p>Even with modest improvements in the working conditions for some groups  		of direct care workers over the last decade, these jobs continue to be  		characterized by low wages and limited benefits. According to Yamada's study of  		CPS data, median wages of home care aides increased slightly in the past 10  		years (adjusted to 1998 dollars based on Consumer Price Index), from $5.81 to  		$6.00 hour, while both mean and median family income increased as well.  		However, median wages of nursing home aides and hospital aides declined, from  		$7.29 to $7.00 and $9.81 to $7.99, respectively. Family income for these two  		groups also declined over the 10-year period.<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> Hospital aides still have the highest wages of  		the three groups. In the late 1990s, nursing home aides and home care aides  		were more likely to be in poverty (16 percent and 22 percent, respectively)  		than the average population (12-13 percent). </p>
<p>Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) National  		Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (2002), the median hourly wage for  		direct care workers ranged from $7.81 to $9.59 in 2002. This represents a  		median annual wage of $16,250 to $19,960, if the worker is employed full-time  		year-round. However, as noted earlier, many direct care workers work less than  		40 hours per week or do not work the full year. Direct care workers work about  		30 hours per week on average. Further, the wage figure does not take into  		account the wages of independent home care workers, who are not employed by any  		agency.</p>
<p>Konrad (2003) found that nursing aides who had left the health field  		were better off financially than those who remained in the field. The study  		compared North Carolina workers trained as nursing aides who remained certified  		to work as nursing aides in a health care facility with those who did not  		remain certified. Among those who lost certification to work as a nursing  		assistant since 1990 (called "inactive registrants"), the median 1998 wage was  		$14,425 compared to $11,358 for active registrants. The median wage for  		inactive registrants rose to $17,359 in 2001 compared to $12,877 for active  		registrants. So, while wages increased slightly over the last few years for  		certified nurse assistants (CNAs) in North Carolina, median wages remained  		lower for active registrants than inactive registrants.</p>
<h3>C. Health Insurance Coverage</h3>
<p>Two different analyses of the health insurance status of aides over the  		10-year period (late 1980s to late 1990s) show somewhat different results.  		Yamada found little change over the 10-year period in employer-provided health  		insurance coverage rates for nursing home aides and hospital aides (about 42  		percent and 62 percent, respectively). However, an increasing proportion of  		home care aides received employer-provided health coverage--14 percent in late  		1980s versus 26 percent in the late 1990s. Yamada also found a substantial  		increase in the percentage of aides with Medicaid coverage, nearly tripling in  		all three groups of aides--to 11 percent of nursing home aides, 16 percent of  		home care aides, and 5 percent of hospital aides. While this suggests that the  		overall rate of insurance coverage increased, another study of CPS data found  		that among all three groups of aides, the proportion of those without any  		health insurance coverage grew from 18.6 percent in 1988 to 23.8 percent in  		1998 (Case et al., 2002). Workers in the private sector accounted for all of  		the growth in the number of uninsured over that period. The divergence in  		findings by the two studies is not clear, but may be due to differences in the  		types of workers examined.<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Significant increases in the amount employees contribute to health  		insurance premiums in all sizes and types of work establishments in the past  		several years could have contributed to reduced rates of employer-provided  		coverage among the low-wage workforce. Between 1996 and 1999, the average  		annual dollar amount paid by employees for health insurance coverage rose from  		$342 to $420 (Branscome and Crimmel, 2002). As a percentage of the total  		premium, the increase was less than one percentage point (from 17.2 percent to  		18.1 percent). Nevertheless, co-insurance premiums for LTC employees can be as  		much as 50 percent of the total premium (Michigan Assisted Living Association,  		2001). For low-wage workers, this makes health coverage unaffordable. For  		example, a survey of nearly 200 direct care workers in Massachusetts found that  		one in four were uninsured in 2002, with uninsured workers reporting average  		income a third less than those who were insured (Hams et al., 2002). With even  		larger increases in the co-insurance rates charged to employees in the past few  		years, employer-provided insurance coverage may show further deterioration  		among low-wage workers (Robinson, 2002).<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="sectionV" id="sectionV">V. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SUPPLY AND TURNOVER OF  		DIRECT CARE WORKERS</a></h2>
<p>Direct care worker occupations are predicted to be among the top fastest  		growing occupations, and those with the largest growth, among health  		occupations between 2002 and 2012 (Hecker, 2004; USBLS, 2004b). Estimates  		indicate that there will be 888,000 <em>additional</em> direct care worker  		jobs, an increase of about 34 percent (Hecker, 2004; USBLS, 2004b). Including  		both these new jobs and replacement jobs for retiring workers and those who  		leave the occupation, BLS projects that over 1.2 million new direct care  		workers will be needed over the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century  		(Hecker, 2004; USBLS, 2004b). The demand for direct care workers in home- and  		community-based settings is projected to grow even higher than for  		institutionalized settings. Including job openings due to growth and net  		replacements, BLS projects a 56 percent increase in demand for home care and  		personal care aides and a 61 percent increase in demand for home health aides  		between 2002 and 2012 (Hecker, 2004; USBLS, 2004b).</p>
<p>According to a report by the Center for Health Workforce Studies (2002),  		precise numbers of workers are elusive for a variety of reasons. Many direct  		care worker jobs have few or no educational or training requirements, face  		inconsistent licensing laws from state to state, and lack clearly defined  		tasks, which makes it hard to track those who move in and out of these jobs.  		There are also independent home care workers hired directly by care recipients;  		they are not recorded as employed as direct care workers in government data  		systems (CHWS, 2002). One national study estimates that 29 percent of the  		direct care workers providing assistance to Medicare beneficiaries in the home  		are self-employed (Leon and Franco, 1998). Some data on direct care workers are  		available at the national level from the BLS and Centers for Medicare and  		Medicaid Services's (CMS) Online Survey Certification and Reporting system  		(OSCAR), but each has limitations that hamper its utility (CHWS, 2002). </p>
<p>Surveys and registries maintained at the state level yield some  		information and insights about trends in the supply of direct care workers over  		the past few years. For example, in California, the pool of active CNAs has  		declined by 15 percent from 120,000 in 1998 to 101,000 in 2000. The number of  		newly CNAs (25,388) did not keep pace with the number of CNAs who did not renew  		their certification (39,178) during this time period (Franks, et. al, 2002). In  		North Carolina, by contrast, between July 2000 to June 2002, the number of  		newly certified nursing assistants outpaced the number of CNAs becoming  		inactive; new CNAs grew from 85,148 in 2000 to 95,092 in 2002 (Konrad, 2003).  		</p>
<h3>A. Factors Associated with Turnover</h3>
<p>Recent studies on the turnover problem among direct care workers are  		providing some new insights. While most studies have gathered data directly  		from interviews with employees and employers, a recent study looked at the  		issue from a broader perspective. Brannon and colleagues (2002) examined  		factors that help to distinguish nursing facilities with very high and very low  		nursing assistant turnover rates from a middle referent group, exploring the  		possibility that high and low turnover are discrete phenomena with different  		precursors. With the exception of registered nurse turnover rate, low turnover  		and high turnover were not associated with the same factors. These findings  		suggest that future studies of facility turnover should avoid modeling turnover  		as a linear function of a single set of predictors. However, since there is no  		consensus on what constitutes optimal turnover rates, care must be taken in  		setting a low turnover rate cutoff based solely on statistical patterns (Swan,  		2002). </p>
<p>Brannon examined turnover from secondary data. More common in the  		literature are studies based on interviews with CNAs or home health aides. Such  		studies are better able to explore the real-life experiences of direct care  		workers. However, such studies are more likely to encounter problems  		maintaining sufficient sample size throughout the study period. That was the  		case in a series of studies by Noelker and Ejaz (2001), who studied newly  		trained nursing assistants about to be employed for the first time in a nursing  		facility. Most of the recruited students were lost in follow-up interviews;  		some never pursued nursing home employment and many did not intend to work as a  		nursing assistant when they took the training. Some claimed they entered  		training solely to meet requirements of the changing welfare system, while  		others did not keep scheduled appointments. </p>
<p>Despite these problems, Noelker and Ejaz were able to compare interview  		data from 1999-2000 with earlier studies conducted in the 1991-1993 and  		1993-1994 period. They found that newly trained nursing assistants in the most  		recent period were more likely to be younger, unmarried, and minorities than  		those in the early 1990s. The group of nursing assistants in the late 1990s  		also expressed more worries about finances and family while at work. There were  		also noticeable increases in the proportion of nursing assistants reporting  		that they received inadequate initial training and that their supervisors did  		not acknowledge the importance of their observations about residents. Fewer  		reported a desire to continue working as a nursing assistant three years from  		the time of their interview. About one-third of nursing assistants in all three  		samples scored as being clinically depressed. Low pay ranked as the top source  		of job dissatisfaction in all three sample groups.</p>
<p>The relationship between supervisory staff and CNAs is an important  		contributor to worker satisfaction and turnover. Jervis (2002) explored direct  		care worker-supervisory relationships within the context of a "chain of  		command," based on ethnographic research. Findings confirmed the hierarchical  		organizational structure as nursing supervisors often used language such as,  		"delegate down" and "down at the unit level" in their conversations.  		Supervisory staff frequently attributed the cause of recruitment and retention  		problems to nursing assistants' personal problems, dysfunctional family  		structure, being irresponsible and lack of respect for the job. Rarely did  		supervisory staff mention organizational structure, or mistreatment or poor  		management by top-level staff, as a reason for turnover. Both the top- and  		mid-level staff complained about the amount of their time spent on paperwork,  		which causes them to be less connected to residents and direct care workers.  		Conversely, nursing assistants perceive their own work to be hard physical  		labor compared with their superiors, contributing to tension between nursing  		assistants and nurses. </p>
<p>A study by the California Association of Homes and Services for the  		Aging (CAHSA) and the Institute for the Future of Aging Services (IFAS) also  		finds this gap in perception between workers and supervisors. The team used  		surveys and focus groups with direct care workers and administrators,  		respectively, in California LTC facilities (Harahan et al., 2003). The study  		team found consistent complaints from direct care staff that they feel they are  		not valued or respected by their supervisors, coupled with the perception of  		charge nurses that they are not managers and have no need for management  		skills. </p>
<p>Bowers et al. (2003) conducted a study to determine why certified  		nursing assistants leave, using "grounded dimensional analysis" or in-depth  		interviews rather than structured interviews or survey instruments. This method  		allows nursing assistants to express their opinions on why they leave their job  		and how different factors influence their decision. This study confirmed many  		of the reasons previously shown as reasons for turnover, such as  		dissatisfaction with staffing and absenteeism policies, training and  		orientation practices, and low compensation. However, Bowers' analysis revealed  		that it was the perception that these policies and practices made CNAs feel  		unappreciated and undervalued, which in turn led to their departure from the  		job. </p>
<p>A multivariate analysis of data from a 1996 survey of nursing assistants  		employed in Louisiana nursing homes confirmed that professional growth,  		involvement in work-related decisions, supervision, and communication between  		management and employees were significantly related to both turnover and  		overall job satisfaction (Parsons et al., 2003). Previous research with direct  		care workers as well as qualitative interviews with and observation of direct  		care workers in nursing home settings (Pennington and Magilvy, 2003) reflect  		these same findings.</p>
<h3>B. Job Characteristics and Factors Associated with Job  		Retention</h3>
<p>Hunter (2000) explored factors related to defining what determined a  		"good job" from the perspective of nursing assistants in nursing homes. Based  		on survey data from 152 facilities in Massachusetts, the study showed that  		aides' job preference was associated with facilities that had more private pay  		residents, skilled care, and religious or ethnic affiliation of the facility.  		These facilities tended to offer such benefits as employer-subsidized tuition,  		employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, and higher wages and  		opportunities for wage growth. They also tended to have administrators with  		specialty training, while unions had a positive and significant effect on job  		quality, when niche markets were controlled. The study, however, did not look  		at the relationship between "good job" traits and retention.</p>
<p>On the home health side, Luz (2001) analyzed qualitative data gathered  		from interviews with independently employed home care workers who work without  		the oversight of an agency. Luz examined what led the workers to take, keep,  		and leave a job. Her findings suggest that these workers choose the profession  		as a vocation, choose clients with whom their relationships make a difference,  		like the ability to choose full-time or part-time work, and prefer independent  		work environments. Other issues that factor into independent workers' decision  		whether or not to take a job are family obligations, wages, whether other  		income and health insurance are already provided for them, entrepreneurial  		aspirations, personal health, and personal standards for good care services. A  		qualitative study of direct care workers in New Hampshire that included home  		health aides corroborates the perceived importance of work schedule  		flexibility, as well as having more time to spend on each client compared to  		working in a nursing home setting (Kopiec, 2000)</p>
<p>Based on ethnographic research involving 159 interviews and more than  		100 hours of direct observation, Eaton (2001) concludes that five key  		managerial practices characterize environments with lower turnover and better  		retention of nursing staff. These practices are: (1) high quality leadership  		and management; (2) a practice of valuing and respecting nursing staff,  		especially direct caregivers; (3) positive human resource practices, both  		economic and non-economic; (4) a set of work organization and care practices  		that help to retain staff and build relationships; and (5) a sufficient  		staffing ratio to allow for the provision of high quality care. Eaton concludes  		that, "even in a complex system, one person could make a vast  		difference--particularly in a key leadership role in the facility, but also as  		charge nurse on a unit, or an HR or staff development person, as long as the  		individual had direct contact with the care giving decisions and staff  		members." While Eaton cautions that these practices need further large-scale  		randomized evaluation, she notes that they can be attained by most managers, or  		at least those who have discipline and compassion, are open to learning and  		innovation, willing to delegate responsibility and to hold managers and staff  		accountable, and spend significant time on the floor or unit. </p>
<p>Based on case studies conducted as part of the CAHSA and IFAS study of  		California LTC facilities mentioned earlier (Harahan et al., 2003), the  		attributes of a successful workplace environment appear to include: (1) clearly  		articulated expectations from management that direct care workers, ancillary  		staff and nurse supervisors are to be decision-makers and problem-solvers; (2)  		a timely feedback system as issues and problems are identified; (3) open door  		management policies that are based on trust, are without repercussions, and  		which include follow-up that addresses issues that have been raised; (4)  		blurred lines between CNAs and nurses, two-way accountability, and mutual  		respect and acknowledgement; (5) management styles which rely on mentoring and  		role modeling to transfer needed skills; (6) career advancement opportunities  		and the facility's support to pursue them; and, (7) a Director of Nursing with  		strong leadership skills who is visible, accessible and intimately involved  		with resident care. While the pay-off of such strategies with respect to  		reducing staff vacancies and turnover and improving quality has not been  		systematically evaluated, the sites that employed these strategies, reported  		fewer problems with either recruitment or retention compared to the majority of  		respondents.</p>
<p>Victoria Parker and colleagues at Boston University School of Public  		Health are currently conducting a study that includes examining what job  		characteristics influence job satisfaction among certified nursing assistants  		in nursing facilities. Preliminary results, based on employees surveyed in 20  		nursing homes in eastern Massachusetts, suggest that task identity, autonomy,  		and feedback from the job itself well predict job satisfaction for these  		workers (personal communication).</p>
<h2><a name="sectionVI" id="sectionVI">VI. EVALUATIONS OF INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE  		DIRECT CARE WORKER CRISIS</a></h2>
<p>In the past several years, providers and states have implemented a  		variety of initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of the direct care  		workforce. In addition, a number of initiatives are currently being implemented  		that have an evaluation component such as the Better Jobs Better Care state  		demonstrations and the CMS Direct Service Worker state demonstrations. This  		section briefly describes LTC direct care workforce programs that have been  		evaluated in the past few years, emphasizing their effects, if any, on direct  		care worker turnover and/or retention.<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> Several of these programs focus on one type of  		activity, such as peer mentoring, staff-family communication, career  		advancement, alternative management approaches, and wage enhancements for CNAs.  		Other programs are multi-faceted initiatives or aim to achieve broader  		organizational culture change. Finally, we look at the workforce component of a  		home- and community-based consumer-directed initiative, Cash and Counseling, as  		a mechanism for providing an additional labor pool of direct care workers.</p>
<h3>A. Peer Mentoring</h3>
<p>Hegeman and colleagues (2003, 2004) at the Foundation for Long Term Care  		conducted a CNA retention intervention and evaluation project entitled "Growing  		Strong Roots." The "Growing Strong Roots" peer mentoring program uses  		experienced CNAs to acquaint new CNAs with the customs, resources, and care  		values of the nursing home. The program is intended to supplement, not replace,  		the usual training of new CNAs. </p>
<p>The program includes four key components: (1) a six-hour orientation to  		the program for project coordinators, including a comprehensive manual on how  		to operate the program and evaluate it and newsletters for mentors that  		reinforce key concepts; (2) a six-hour training and manual for mentors to help  		them develop and/or enhance the leadership, communication, mentoring, and  		conflict resolution skills to be successful mentors; (3) a guide to orienting  		mentors' supervisors to the program, to gain facility support for the program;  		and (4) booster training sessions and manuals for mentors to reinforce the  		program. Trained mentors are matched with new CNAs. The mentoring relationship  		is usually active for eight weeks (more if needed), and mentors attend one or  		more booster sessions during this time and receive the newsletters. Each  		facility provides mentors a salary increase or other tangible benefits for the  		extra work involved.</p>
<p>Using a pre-post comparison group design with six nursing homes in New  		York state, the evaluation found a statistically significant 18-point increase  		in average retention rate among those who were mentored while no significant  		difference was found among the comparison group. Data analysis has been limited  		by poor facility support in obtaining pre- and post-test data. </p>
<h3>B. Enhanced Staff-Family Communication</h3>
<p>"Partners in Caregiving" is an intervention designed to increase  		cooperation and effective communication between family members and nursing home  		staff. Cornell researchers developed and evaluated the program, which includes  		two parallel six-hour workshops, one for nursing staff and the other for family  		members (Pillemer et al., 2003). Trainings focus on communication and conflict  		resolution skills. Participants in the randomized, controlled study included  		932 relatives and 655 staff members from 20 nursing homes. Positive outcomes  		were found for both family and staff in the treatment group. In addition to  		improved attitudes toward each other, families of residents with dementia  		reported less conflict with staff and staff reported a lower likelihood of  		quitting. The control group, on the other hand, showed an increase in  		likelihood to quit over the same two-month period. Job burnout remained stable  		among the treatment group staff but increased in the control group over the  		study period. Though the focus of the intervention is not on direct care  		workforce retention, the findings seem promising for both improving  		worker-family relations and possibly for enhancing workers' job commitment.  		Examining the effect of this intervention on turnover data, rather than just  		workers' perceived intent to quit, would be a valuable addition to the  		evaluation of this program.</p>
<h3>C. Career Ladders</h3>
<p>Based on the desire of some CNAs for upward mobility within their chosen  		field, career ladders have been promoted by some states and providers. Career  		ladders are intended to reward those who stay longer with more training  		opportunities and increased wages or other incentives. The Extended Care Career  		Ladders Initiative (ECCLI) was introduced in the fall of 2000 in Massachusetts  		as part of a broader Nursing Home Quality Initiative. It provided funds for  		several consortia of workforce training partners and LTC organizations to  		develop opportunities for direct care workers to increase their skills in order  		to reduce high turnover rates and vacancies among LTC paraprofessionals and  		improve the quality of care provided to consumers.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the implementation of ECCLI projects (Wilson et al.,  		2002) found preliminary evidence to suggest these activities had an impact.  		Through a case study approach, this evaluation documents activity and effects  		in six facilities that were selected to reflect a range of strategies,  		conditions, and partnership arrangements. Investigators interviewed frontline  		workers, supervisors, workforce partnership organizations, project  		coordinators, and other staff at participating nursing homes and home health  		agencies. They also observed project coordination meetings and technical  		assistance sessions and examined spreadsheet data from facilities on consortium  		activities, trends in each workplace, and recruitment costs. Their preliminary  		findings indicate some important implementation lessons for statewide workforce  		improvement initiatives: </p>
<ul><li>Training, wage increases, and establishing career ladders are the  		  most frequently used interventions among consortia members. </li>
<li>Multi-year, multi-faceted initiatives are essential in organizational  		  change initiatives.</li>
<li>Working with a workforce "network" rather than just individual  		  providers is more effective.</li>
<li>Organizing and sustaining culture change and training programs  		  require serious investment at the facility level.</li>
<li>Wage increases need to be of a meaningful size to workers  		  (commensurate with their sense of their increase in skills and/or  		  responsibilities) to have a positive effect.</li>
<li>The support of nurse supervisors is critical to the success of ECCLI  		  initiatives.</li>
<li>Working relationships developed through the implementation phase have  		  improved through increased teamwork and communication and the relationships  		  that have formed between departments, as well as between aides and their  		  supervisors. </li>
</ul><p>Another study on the effects of a career ladder program, by Remsburg and  		colleagues (2001), examined a program involving a three-step career ladder in  		which nursing responsibilities are delegated to unlicensed nursing assistants.  		As in most states, where regulations restrict the nursing tasks that can be  		delegated to nursing assistants, this program required a waiver. The pre-post  		study design examined changes in nursing assistant retention rates, the time  		available to licensed nurses to perform higher-level clinical tasks, and  		clinical outcomes, such as wound infection rates. The incidence of adverse  		outcomes decreased or remained at zero for eight of nine clinical  		functions/skills after program implementation. No significant changes in  		retention rates for the career ladder staff occurred over the one-year period  		of the study. These results, however, reflect only one year of program  		implementation; this time period may not have been long enough to produce  		changes in retention, given the focus on initial implementation issues during  		the first year. </p>
<h3>D. Alternative Management Practice</h3>
<p>Building on studies that find dissatisfaction with the management  		practices typically used in nursing homes, an approach known as "self-managed  		work teams" (SMWTs) has been promoted as a way to give employees a greater say  		in how their work is organized (Yeatts and Seward, 2000). A pilot test of SMWTs  		was designed to empower CNAs, improve their job satisfaction, and improve  		resident care. The teams consist of CNAs who work together daily to serve the  		same group of residents, identify clinical (e.g., skin care, weight loss) or  		work (e.g., absenteeism, tardiness) areas needing improvement and share  		decision making about how to accomplish their work. The structure includes a  		rotating team coordinator, 30-minute weekly meetings, support from facility  		leadership, and periodic meetings between team representatives and facility  		leadership. </p>
<p>In their two-month implementation pilot at two nursing facilities,  		Yeatts et al. (2004) found that the teams improved: (1) interpersonal relations  		(e.g., discussion, understanding, apologizing, praising) among the CNAs, (2)  		communication between CNAs and nursing home leadership (e.g., better  		explanation to CNAs of reasons for certain practices), and (3) understanding of  		nursing home policies among CNAs. Lessons learned for successful implementation  		include surveying management to be sure they want nurse teams, nursing staff  		buy-in and support, orienting and training the managers, nurses, and nurse  		aides, and facilitating the teams through weekly meetings between team  		representatives and nursing facility leadership, leadership support for the  		teams, and keeping charge nurses informed of team developments. The research  		team is now conducting an impact evaluation with five experimental nursing  		homes in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and five comparison nursing  		homes. The evaluation will examine whether SMWTs result in reduced turnover and  		absenteeism and improved performance among CNAs. Results will be available in  		2005, after follow-up survey data are collected 12 months after team  		implementation.</p>
<h3>E. Wage Enhancements</h3>
<p>To stem the tide of nursing assistants and other frontline workers  		leaving the LTC sector, surveys conducted by Cushman and colleagues (2001)  		suggest that more competitive wages are needed. Just over half the states (26)  		funded a wage or benefit pass-through or other increase to benefit direct-care  		workers between 2000 and 2003 (PHI and NCDHHS, 2004). But how much of an  		increase is needed? Some studies suggest that relatively modest increases in  		compensation should help to draw low-wage workers from other sectors. Holzer  		(2001), for example, cites estimates indicating that an increase in average  		wages paid to LTC workers of up to $8 to $9 per hour would make these jobs  		competitive for between six and 19 million low-wage workers. However, this is  		based on modeling projections and may not hold true in practice, or the results  		may differ depending on local labor market conditions.</p>
<p>Some recent empirical studies are beginning to shed light on this  		question. An analysis by Howes (2002) concluded that a near doubling in wages  		(not adjusted for inflation) for home care workers in San Francisco County over  		a 52-month period from November 1997 to February 2002, led to a 54 percent  		increase in the number of In Home Supportive Services (IHSS) workers, and a 17  		percent drop in the proportion of the workforce in the job for less than one  		year. The wage increases followed passage of a Living Wage Ordinance at the  		county level and the establishment of a Public Authority to serve as employer  		of record for IHSS workers, which permitted union bargaining for higher wages.  		These results should be interpreted with caution as other external factors  		could have contributed to these workforce outcomes. For example, at the time of  		the first significant wage increase over the 52-month period, the CalWorks  		program was implemented; this required adults receiving welfare (TANF) benefits  		to enroll in welfare-to-work programs. Additionally, during this time, an  		innovative low-cost health plan called Healthy Workers was offered to any  		caregiver who worked a minimum number of hours and had been in the home care  		workforce for a specified time.</p>
<p>Some research with CNAs suggests that wage increases may need to be  		targeted, i.e. to those who stay longer or as rewards for providing good care  		(Bowers, 2003). In Wyoming, a mandated wage increase for certain types of  		direct care workers required differential minimum wages for new staff and those  		with 12 months of experience. A study of the impact of increasing direct care  		workers' wages on turnover was conducted by the Wyoming Department of Health  		(2002) for the Joint Appropriations Committee. About $22 million were allocated  		by the legislature in 2002 specifically to improve the salaries and benefits of  		non-professional direct care personnel in adult developmental disabilities  		community-based programs, and minimum wages for new and longer-term workers  		were specified. As a result, total compensation (wages and benefits) for these  		full-time direct care staff increased from an average $9.08 per hour to $13.74  		per hour, 51 percent over the first three months of implementation. According  		to the study, turnover dropped by nearly one-third in the three month period,  		from 52 percent to 37 percent. However, this may be too short a time period to  		judge whether such an effect was due to the wage increases or to other factors,  		and the study did not compare the results to any control group. A Kansas study  		found that one year after implementation of a wage pass-through program,  		annualized turnover rates for all positions (not just direct care workers)  		decreased only slightly from 111 percent to 101 percent, probably due to  		less-than-adequate funds to support the projected wage increases--only $4.3  		million were allocated for all positions.<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Data on the impact of wage pass-through programs on direct care worker  		recruitment and retention are limited and inconsistent. Findings across the few  		evaluations completed to date--and the lack of an appropriate comparison group  		in these studies--do not support the efficacy of wage pass-through programs or  		of a particular type of wage pass-through approach (PHI, 2003). </p>
<h3>F. Multi-faceted Initiatives</h3>
<p>The initiatives below include some combination of education in clinical  		and/or interpersonal communication skills, supervisory training, support  		groups, mentoring, and monetary incentives for direct care workers. Among these  		four interventions, WIN A STEP UP seems most promising because of its clear  		positive effect on reducing direct care worker turnover using a string  		evaluation design. However, results from the other program evaluations do  		provide valuable lessons that can be used to inform the development,  		implementation, and evaluation of future workforce initiatives. Results from  		the Iowa Caregivers Association program show a positive effect on retention,  		but it is unclear whether all treatment facilities received the same set of  		interventions in the same way. The Kansas Long-Term Care Workforce Project  		study shows some positive results as well as highlights the challenges of  		implementing any workforce initiative when short staffing is common on a unit.  		The WETA program evaluation appears to reduce turnover; however, the much  		higher starting turnover rate among the comparison facilities compared to the  		treatment facilities may be confounding the intervention effects. </p>
<p><strong><em>WIN A STEP UP</em></strong>. The acronym WIN A STEP UP  		stands for Workforce Improvement for Nursing Assistants: Supporting, Training,  		Education, and Payment for Upgrading Performance. This continuing education and  		payment incentive workforce improvement program is designed to reduce turnover  		of nursing assistants. WIN A STEP UP is a partnership between the North  		Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Institute on Aging of  		the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The program operates solely in  		nursing homes. It is funded through civil monetary penalty (CMP) fines  		collected from nursing homes. </p>
<p>The WIN A STEP UP program includes 10 modules and accompanying detailed  		participant and instructor manuals that focus on clinical skills (e.g.,  		pressure ulcers, infection control) and interpersonal skills and communication  		(e.g., working in a team, empathetic skills). Participating facilities must  		agree to commit staff time to implement the program and give either a retention  		bonus ($75) or a wage increase (of at least 25 cents per hour) to participating  		nursing assistants starting three months after they complete the modules. In  		addition, the WIN A STEP UP program gives $70 to nursing assistants for each  		module session they attend and $75 to nursing assistants who complete seven or  		more of the modules and stay at the facility for at least three months after  		completing the modules. Annual turnover rates were significantly lower (15  		percent) for nursing assistants in the program compared to those in the matched  		comparison groups (32 percent) (Konrad and Morgan, 2003). The program was  		active in 37 North Carolina nursing homes as of April 2004, with plans to  		involve 55 nursing homes (and 25 comparison homes) by July 2005. </p>
<p><strong><em>Iowa Caregivers Association CNA Recruitment and Retention  		Project</em></strong>. In the belief that reducing shortages and turnover rates  		among direct care workers requires many changes in the way workers are treated  		and care is organized, some programs are intentionally taking a broader  		approach to the problem. For example, the Iowa Caregivers Association (ICA)  		managed the two-year CNA Recruitment and Retention Project. The project's goal  		was to reduce CNA turnover by assessing the needs of direct care workers in  		nursing facilities and providing programs and services responsive to their  		needs. Interventions implemented in facilities included: (1) CNA training in  		work skills (e.g. conflict resolution, team/building/communication) and  		clinical skills (e.g., communicating with dying residents, caring for  		Alzheimer's patients); (2) a CNA mentoring program, and (3) CNA support group  		activities. Community-based interventions included a public awareness campaign,  		CNA recognition programs, and CNA support groups facilitated by local community  		colleges. </p>
<p>The nursing facilities receiving interventions experienced significantly  		longer retention than those facilities which did not receive the interventions  		(18.96 months compared to 10.01 months). Two of the three treatment facilities  		showed progressively lower turnover during the course of the intervention  		period, while the third had increased turnover in the same period. Turnover  		data were not available for the comparison facilities (Findley and Richardson,  		2000). </p>
<p><strong><em>Kansas Long-Term Care Workforce Project</em></strong>. The  		Long-Term Care Workforce Project examined the impact of a three-part  		intervention--interpersonal skills and empathy training, biweekly support  		groups and online supervisory training--on frontline nursing home employees'  		interpersonal relationships and their supervisors' capabilities. The project  		was conducted through a collaboration with IFAS, Kansas Association of Homes  		and Services for the Aging (KAHSA), and Wichita State University. The  		evaluation used a comparison group design (randomized at the work group level  		within homes) among seven mid-sized facilities of around 100 beds each, about  		evenly distributed between rural and urban locations. The nursing homes in the  		study were among the better nursing homes in the state, relative to quality of  		care records and reputation (KAHSA and IFAS, 2003). </p>
<p>As a result of the training, nurse supervisors felt more confident about  		their ability to communicate with, encourage, and effectively mentor members of  		their work team. However, the aides failed to detect any change in their own  		behavior or in their supervisor's behavior, beyond providing more feedback on  		their progress at work. This inconsistency may be because supervisors held fast  		to a belief that all work group members should be treated exactly the same,  		even after intervention training advocated taking into account each  		individual's uniqueness. As a positive outcome, work group members reported  		better interpersonal relationships with their residents after the training.  		Workplace stress ranked constantly high by aides and supervisors both before  		and after the intervention. The stress associated with chronic short staffing  		played a major role in the inability of the participants to apply and  		internalize the lessons learned from the professional trainer. Overall, the  		intervention caused some changes in attitudes and behavior among frontline and  		supervisory staff consistent with its teachings. The intervention also  		demonstrated an ongoing willingness to try to continue to implement behavior  		change, even in a difficult short-staffed work environment. However, the lack  		of a stronger response to the intervention is primarily attributable to the  		stress and tension associated with under-staffing (KAHSA and IFAS, 2003).</p>
<p><strong><em>Worker Education, Training, and Assistance (WETA)  		Program</em></strong>. WETA was a three-year demonstration project conducted by  		Sager and colleagues (2003) in Wisconsin designed to improve job satisfaction  		and worker retention in participating assisted living facilities. The program  		was designed to provide education and training, financial benefits, access to  		emergency assistance with child care, recognition, and advancement  		opportunities. A pre-post comparison group design found no significant  		treatment effects for the intervention on employee satisfaction. In fact,  		employees in both treatment and comparison facilities showed decreased job  		satisfaction over the one-year data collection period. However, treatment  		facilities showed a marginally significant trend toward greater decline in  		turnover compared to comparison facilities. Comparison facilities' average  		turnover rate changed from 135 percent at baseline to 126 percent one year  		post-WETA, while treatment facilities' average turnover changed from 84 percent  		at baseline to 60 percent one year post-WETA (Sager et al., 2003). Because of  		the significant baseline differences between the treatment and comparison group  		facilities, interpretation of these results is difficult. </p>
<p>The WETA program team draws the cautious yet optimistic conclusion,  		however, that these differential changes provide some evidence that WETA may  		have influenced turnover rates among employees in treatment facilities. The  		withdrawal of 42 facilities from the demonstration because of financial  		difficulties resulted in the evaluation having only one year of results rather  		than two. The State of Wisconsin is presently developing a demonstration  		program as a result of the lessons learned from WETA.</p>
<h3>G. Culture Change</h3>
<p>Another type of multi-faceted intervention falls under the rubric of  		"culture change" which involves several mutually reinforcing initiatives, such  		as training in both clinical and "soft" (i.e. communication, problem-solving)  		skills; changes in management practices; and career ladders. Four culture  		change initiatives--the Eden Alternative, LEAP, the Lyngblomsten House  		demonstration, and Wellspring--have been evaluated in the past few years, with  		the LEAP and Wellspring practices showing promising evidence of positive  		effects on direct care workforce retention.</p>
<p><strong><em>LEAP</em></strong>. Project LEAP, which stands for Learn,  		Empower, Achieve, and Produce, is a workforce development program that aims to  		educate, empower, and retain nursing managers and staff in nursing homes. Its  		goal is to develop high quality, dedicated LTC leaders and staff that will  		result in better resident quality of life and well-being. Mather Lifeways and  		the Mather Institute on Aging, in association with Life Services Network (the  		Illinois affiliate of the American Association of Homes and Services for the  		Aging), developed and started the LEAP program in 1999. LEAP includes training  		for nurses and for CNAs. A six-week 18-hour workshop series for nurse managers  		and charge nurses addresses nurses' four key roles (leader, team builder, care  		role model, and gerontological clinical expert). A seven-week 17.5-hour  		workshop series for CNAs focuses on career development (e.g., training on  		person-centered care, communication skills, cultural sensitivity, building care  		teams, mentoring new CNAs, and working with families). LEAP also includes a  		two-level CNA career ladder that allows CNAs to advance within the CNA role and  		gain greater responsibility, mentoring, and small pay raises. LEAP aims to  		encourage a sense of pride among gerontological nurses and build a bridge  		between nurses and CNAs (Hollinger-Smith et al., 2002; Hollinger-Smith et al.,  		2003). </p>
<p>Program developers, Ortigara and Hollinger-Smith, believe that the  		success of LEAP is contingent on the commitment of top management to promote  		LEAP and sustain the program throughout the facility. For that reason, the  		first step in the LEAP process is an assessment of the organization and its  		management to determine its management style, readiness for learning, and  		capacity to implement and sustain LEAP.</p>
<p>Two LEAP test facilities experienced a significant reduction in nurse  		and CNA turnover rates after the program began. One facility went from a nurse  		turnover rate of 36 percent and a CNA turnover rate of 43 percent before LEAP  		to turnover rates of 16 percent and 4 percent, respectively, one year after  		implementation. The other facility went from a 75 percent nurse staff turnover  		rate and a 113 percent CNA turnover rate to 34 percent and 44 percent turnover,  		respectively, over one year after implementation. CNAs in the LEAP test  		facilities show statistically significant improvements in work empowerment, job  		satisfaction, and sense of organizational climate (Hollinger-Smith et al.,  		2003; Hollinger-Smith and Ortigara, 2004).</p>
<p>As of March 2004, 15 organizations in 14 states were signed up to  		complete the train-the-trainer workshops and implement LEAP. LEAP organizers  		are exploring ways to expand the CNA career ladder to a third level, in which a  		CNA-Level three would become a facility-wide resource on issues such as skin  		care or dementia care. </p>
<p><strong><em>Wellspring</em></strong>. A team of researchers from the  		IFAS, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Texas A&amp;M University  		evaluated the Wellspring culture change program, which represents a model for  		nursing home quality improvement and a process for organizational change (Stone  		et al., 2002). Wellspring started as an Alliance of 11 facilities in Wisconsin  		that developed a mutual strategy to improve clinical outcomes, conduct staff  		training and empower staff. The core elements of the Wellspring model include:  		top management commitment to the quality improvement approach; a shared program  		of staff training, clinical consultation, and education from a geriatric nurse  		practitioner; sharing of comparative data on resident outcomes; and, use of  		multidisciplinary care resource teams empowered to develop and implement  		interventions to improve quality of care for residents. </p>
<p>The evaluation team used a multi-faceted methodology including site  		visits, interviews and focus groups with residents, families and staff,  		participant observation, and analyses of secondary data from diverse sources  		using a comparison group evaluation design. Rates of nursing staff turnover,  		including direct care workers, were lower or increased more slowly in  		Wellspring nursing homes compared to control facilities in Wisconsin.  		Wellspring facilities also showed improved performance on the federal nursing  		home survey. No additional increases in net resources were required and  		Wellspring facilities had lower costs than the comparison group. Staff members  		were more vigilant in assessing problems and took a more proactive approach to  		resident care, although clear evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes  		using MDS quality indicators could not be documented. Observational evidence  		and interview results indicated a better quality of life for residents and an  		improved quality of interaction between residents and staff.</p>
<p>The evaluation produced several key lessons for the successful  		implementation and sustainability of the Wellspring model and similar culture  		change initiatives: </p>
<ul><li>The philosophy of the culture change initiative must be aligned with  		  the administrative, operational, and management structures.</li>
<li> Staff nurses must be committed to work with and mentor nursing  		  assistants.</li>
<li> Having an organizing superstructure such as the Alliance helps  		  facilities stay the course and is a key mechanism for improving quality within  		  and across facilities. </li>
<li> The full commitment of top administrative staff is required--use of  		  training modules alone is not sufficient to change a nursing home's  		  culture.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>The Eden Alternative</em></strong>. Proponents of the Eden  		Alternative are committed to creating better social and physical environments  		for nursing home residents. The Eden Alternative is an approach to creating an  		elder-centered community where life revolves around close and continuing  		contact with plants, animals and children. A one-year comparison group study  		implemented in two nursing homes run by the same organization found no  		beneficial effects for residents in terms of cognition, functional status,  		survival, infection rate, or cost of care (Coleman et al., 2002). Further, the  		Eden site had more staff terminations and new hires than did the control site  		during the study period. </p>
<p><strong><em>Lyngblomsten Service House</em></strong>. A fourth culture  		change initiative replicates a Swedish model of supportive living for nursing  		home residents, to bridge the gap between a medical model of skilled nursing  		facility and a social model of assisted living (Grant, 2002). Based in  		Minnesota, Lyngblomsten Service House residents live in a less institutional,  		more "home-like" setting than residents in a typical skilled nursing facility.  		They live in private studio apartments with full baths, kitchenettes, and a  		call system wired to pagers carried by "care assistants." Care assistants are  		universal workers, who carry out nursing, housekeeping, food service, and other  		activities. Care assistants work in self-directed teams. Residents are able to  		decide the timing of day-to-day activities (e.g., when to awaken and when and  		what to eat). </p>
<p>The two-year randomized (resident and family caregiver, but not staff)  		control group evaluation found positive impacts on quality of life among  		service house residents and family caregivers (Grant, 2002). However, it found  		no significant differences in staff job satisfaction or job stress. Nursing  		staff had some difficulty adjusting to the new model, due both to unclear  		direction about whom they should report to (the Director of Nursing or the  		Service House Coordinator) and to negative reactions to undertaking  		housekeeping and meal preparation duties. There was higher than anticipated  		turnover among care assistants in the program's first year, but after that the  		workforce stabilized. The implementation experience highlights some key  		lessons: (1) carefully screening care assistant applicants during recruitment  		helps to ensure that job tasks are consistent with expectations; (2) care  		assistants need clear information on whom to report to; and (3) sufficient  		training helps staff adjust to new roles.</p>
<h3>H. Family and Friends as an Alternative Labor  		Supply</h3>
<p><strong><em>Cash &amp; Counseling</em></strong>. Cash &amp; Counseling  		is a national program sponsored by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF),  		the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the  		U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Administration on  		Aging (AoA) also in HHS. The Cash &amp; Counseling approach provides consumers  		with a flexible monthly allowance, counseling, and fiscal assistance, which  		allow them to direct and manage their own personal assistance services and  		address their own specific needs. Cash &amp; Counseling intends to increase  		consumer satisfaction, quality, and efficiency in the provision of personal  		assistance services. A three-state Cash &amp; Counseling Demonstration was  		implemented to compare the Cash &amp; Counseling consumer-directed model with  		the traditional agency-directed approach to delivering personal assistance  		services. </p>
<p>Almost all of the demonstration recipients used the allowance to hire  		workers, in most cases hiring relatives or acquaintances (Phillips et al.,  		2003). Hiring family and friends accesses a source of assistance usually  		unavailable to traditional agencies, since these caregivers are motivated  		primarily by their relationship with the consumer rather than by employment as  		an aide. Treatment group members from the Arkansas demonstration were much more  		likely than control group members to receive paid care (Dale et al., 2002). In  		fact, consumers in the treatment groups in all demonstration states had  		difficulty hiring a worker if they did not have a relative or friend to hire  		(Phillips et al., 2002). These findings speak to the potential value of friends  		and family as an alternative labor pool for home- and community-based services,  		and to the need for programs like Cash and Counseling to facilitate linking  		quality workers with care recipients who do not have access to friends or  		family who can provide care. The RWJF, ASPE, and AoA have funded an expansion  		of the Cash &amp; Counseling program through grants and comprehensive technical  		assistance to additional states that are interested in replicating, and in some  		states expanding on, this Cash &amp; Counseling model. </p>
<h2><a name="sectionVII" id="sectionVII">VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>This synthesis of the recent literature on problems and solutions to the  		LTC direct care workforce dilemma suggests possible candidates for broader  		replication and remaining gaps where further applied research is needed.  		Further, the synthesis raises the continuing need to see evaluation as an  		important component to building the evidence base for what works in the effort  		to develop a qualified, stable LTC workforce. In this section, we highlight  		what interventions the evidence shows works, limitations in study designs that  		impede the development of an evidence base, and on-going or future publicly-  		and privately-funded efforts that can help contribute to a strong evidence  		base.</p>
<h3>A. What Works?</h3>
<p>Stone (2001) noted the dearth of an evidence base in the literature up  		to the late 1990s. There have been more applied research and evaluation studies  		conducted in the past several years, and a number of evaluation efforts are  		currently in the field or planned for the near future. The designs used to  		evaluate the interventions described earlier vary in their ability to measure  		the effect of the intervention on outcomes of interest (retention and/or  		turnover). In determining what works among the interventions reviewed, we  		looked for a pre-post design and use of a comparison group. This  		quasi-experimental design gives one greater confidence (e.g., compared to no  		comparison group) that positive effects, if any, are more likely due to the  		intervention rather than to other competing factors that may have influenced  		the outcomes of interest. Three interventions reviewed seem appropriate for  		further replication because relatively robust evaluations (pre-post comparison  		group design) with clearly defined interventions have shown them to have  		positive effects on direct care workforce retention and/or turnover: (1)  		"Growing Strong Roots" peer mentoring for new CNAs; (2) WIN A STEP UP education  		and payment incentive workforce improvement program; and, (3) the Wellspring  		model of quality improvement and culture change. </p>
<p>Two additional interventions appear promising but would benefit from  		further evaluation--LEAP and Iowa Caregivers Association CNA Recruitment and  		Retention Project. The LEAP nurse supervisor and direct care worker training  		plus career ladder model has shown decreased CNA turnover and increased job  		satisfaction and work empowerment in numerous test facilities. However, the  		evaluation design does not use comparison groups and different test facilities  		measure turnover in different ways. LEAP evaluators note that finding truly  		comparable nursing homes is impossible because even within organizations that  		have several homes, there are many differences (due to different management,  		turnover rates, staffing ratios, etc.). With funding from the Health Resources  		and Services Administration, the LEAP team will follow LEAP-participating  		organizations over five years and look at organizational characteristics as  		well as resident indicators to see how these factors relate to worker  		perceptions and turnover (personal communication with Linda Hollinger-Smith).  		</p>
<p>The Iowa Caregivers Association CNA Recruitment and Retention Project  		consisted of a variety of interventions including CNA training, mentoring, and  		support groups as well as a community-level public awareness campaign and CNA  		recognition programs. The results from the pre-post comparison group design  		show a positive significant effect on retention. However, it is unclear whether  		all treatment facilities received the same set of interventions and, therefore,  		whether all components are necessary to have the positive outcomes experienced.  		Further work--to determine whether particular components of the multi-faceted  		initiative contributed most to increased retention, or whether treatment  		facilities receiving different components had different outcomes--would be  		helpful in determining whether this initiative (or particular components) is  		appropriate for replication.</p>
<p>Other promising models--such as self-managed work teams, WETA, and the  		Kansas Long-Term Care Workforce Project--are currently being evaluated, need  		more refinement based on current results, need better-designed evaluations, or  		have not measured actual turnover or retention among their outcomes. For other  		interventions, such as wage and benefits enhancements, more work is needed to  		determine: (1) how best to target them for optimal workforce outcomes (e.g.,  		amount of wage increase, whether to link them to tenure or performance) and (2)  		the feasibility of this strategy in light of state budget cuts and Medicaid  		cuts.</p>
<p>All intervention studies, even those whose outcomes are inconclusive,  		contribute important lessons on what supports effective implementation. Though  		the substance of interventions varied, they often pointed to the same set of  		common implementation requirements. For example, management at all levels must  		have a sustained commitment to the initiative. In particular, nursing staff who  		serve as direct care worker supervisors must be committed to working with  		direct care staff. Staff also need to get clear, consistent messages and  		expectations about the intervention (i.e., what is being changed and why). </p>
<h3>B. Challenges to Developing a Strong Evidence Base--What  		Needs to Be Done?</h3>
<p>The evaluation findings reported raise some important issues about the  		challenges of conducting evaluations in the real world--namely, measuring  		longer-term effects, determining the replicability of effective models, the  		need to measure actual behavioral outcomes, like turnover, and using strong  		evaluation designs. Well-done evaluation takes time because it takes time for  		real change to occur with real people in real settings. Evaluating outcomes  		before there is sufficient time to expect any difference to occur, or not  		following up to see if change is sustainable, does not benefit policy or  		practice to the maximum extent possible. </p>
<p>Not only is it important to evaluate carefully an initial intervention  		(Beck, 2001), but to invest in replication efforts of interventions that have  		been shown to work in a particular setting or facility. The devil truly is in  		the details when it comes to creating workforce change in LTC. The initial  		Wellspring model showed consistently positive outcomes; subsequent efforts to  		replicate the model among a different set of nursing homes in Wisconsin did not  		show similar positive outcomes. Rather than write off this lack of success as a  		loss, resources are needed to understand <em>why</em> the differences occur and  		what assistance and tools newcomers to Wellspring, or any evidence-based model,  		need to adapt and implement an effective model in their own context. As Stone  		(2001) found in the earlier review of evidence, intervention studies still  		focus on a specific setting. Work is needed to determine whether interventions  		found effective in one setting (e.g., LEAP in nursing home settings) are  		transferable to other settings (e.g., assisted living, other residential care  		settings, home and community-based settings). </p>
<p>In order to know what works to recruit and retain LTC direct care  		workers, evaluations need to establish whether interventions resulted in  		significantly decreased turnover and increased retention. These assessments  		require that evaluators have access to data that measure turnover and retention  		in the same way across all facilities. Currently, facilities measure these  		outcomes differently. Further, in some cases, as with the Partners in  		Caregiving intervention, evaluators do not measure turnover and retention  		(possibly because of the lack of available outcomes data) and instead look only  		at intent to quit. </p>
<p>The studies described varied in the type and quality of evaluation  		designs used. The classic randomized, controlled clinical trial epitomizes the  		ideal evaluation design, where randomizing study subjects allows the evaluator  		to determine whether the intervention caused a change in the outcome. In most  		evaluations conducted in real-life settings--such as with workforce  		interventions--randomized, controlled designs are often impossible. However,  		pre-post studies that use a valid comparison group composed of study subjects  		(workers) with similar characteristics in similar facilities to the  		intervention facilities are generally stronger than studies using no comparison  		group. Finding an appropriate comparison group and having them provide study  		data can be challenging. However, having a comparison enables evaluators to  		rule out some common alternative explanations for intervention findings, thus  		lending greater credence to the results.</p>
<p>Facilitating the use of evidence-based workforce practices requires more  		than just better-designed evaluation studies. The results of evaluation studies  		have not always been heeded. Sometimes, models that have been empirically shown  		to have positive intended outcomes do not receive wide dissemination or  		adoption (e.g., Wellspring), while other innovative approaches (e.g., wage pass  		throughs) with little or no evidence base are replicated more broadly.  		Resources and attention must also be paid to the effective dissemination of the  		results of studies to providers, policymakers, third-party payers, and  		regulators. Providers need training and technical assistance on implementing  		evidence-based practices (Feldman and Kane, 2003). </p>
<h3>C. On-going and Future Efforts to Build a Strong  		Evidence Base</h3>
<p>At a time when most states have been experiencing continuing challenges  		with LTC direct care workforce recruitment and retention, the Provider Practice  		database<sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> may be a  		welcome tool for providers and others looking for answers. IFAS and the  		Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute developed the database--a web-based tool  		containing 40 promising LTC direct care workforce recruitment and retention  		practices across settings. Although the intent was to include only those  		practices with an evidence base, most of the practices in the database have not  		been evaluated. Ideally, resources should be spent to evaluate these practices  		and contribute to the evidence base. </p>
<p>States and providers are implementing an array of initiatives, including  		those being funded by private foundations and the Federal Government. All of  		these efforts need to be tracked, the range of efforts evaluated, and  		successful efforts disseminated with careful attention to what is needed to  		support effective replication. RWJF and the Atlantic Philanthropies recently  		funded a $15 million grant program--Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC)--to support  		state-based policy and practice demonstrations in Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon,  		Pennsylvania, and Vermont. The state demonstrations are being evaluated by  		researchers at Pennsylvania State University. </p>
<p>BJBC is also funding eight applied research projects designed to advance  		knowledge about which programs and policies work best to recruit and retain  		high quality direct care workers in the LTC field. Several applied research  		grantees will examine organizational innovations and job training models that  		improve workforce recruitment, retention, and quality. Others will assess the  		potential of new labor pools, such as older workers and family members and  		friends, to meet future LTC demands. One study will measure the impact of wage  		and job benefit enhancements on workforce recruitment and retention. The BJBC  		program will also provide an opportunity for shared learning across states,  		providers, and worker organizations and allow wide dissemination of information  		across LTC settings. </p>
<p>As part of the national New Freedom initiative, HHS awarded nearly $6  		million in September 2003 to five state demonstration projects aimed at helping  		recruit, train and retain direct service workers. Three of these demonstrations  		plan to test offering health insurance benefits to workers to determine if that  		helps keep workers on the job. This Demonstration to Improve the Direct Service  		Community Workforce will grant $1.4 million each to the New Mexico Department  		of Health, the Maine Governor's Office of Health Policy and Finance, and to  		Pathways for the Future, a service provider in North Carolina. Grants of  		$680,500 each will go to the University of Delaware and Volunteers of America  		in Louisiana for developing educational materials, training of service workers,  		mentorship programs and other activities. Each of these grants is expected to  		conduct an evaluation of their efforts.</p>
<p>A number of culture change efforts and accompanying evaluation efforts  		are currently underway. Two examples include Rosalie Kane's evaluation of the  		Greenhouse in Tupelo, Mississippi, and Leslie Grant's evaluation of the Beverly  		Corporation's Resident Centered Care Program.</p>
<p>One of the myriad of challenges faced by those trying to develop  		evidence-based workforce strategies is the lack of consistent measures, such as  		turnover. As an example, both the CAHSA-IFAS project team and the LEAP  		evaluation team found that different LTC facilities use different ways to  		measure such outcomes as turnover. This challenge suggests the need for a  		resource of high-quality measures that can be used within and across evaluation  		studies. </p>
<p>As part of its National Initiative to Improve the Recruitment and  		Retention of the Paraprofessional Workforce in LTC project, ASPE funded IFAS to  		develop <em>Measuring Long-Term Care Work: A Guide to Selected Instruments to  		Examine Direct Care Worker Experiences and Outcomes.</em><sup><font><a href="recent-findings-frontline-long-term-care-workers-research-synthesis-1999-2003.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> The Office of Policy in the  		Department of Labor also contributed to its development. The Guide is intended  		to help providers, in collaboration with applied researchers, assess worker  		experiences and track how well their interventions are doing to improve the  		work environment and keep workers. The Guide includes measures on a variety of  		topics including retention, turnover, vacancies, worker empowerment, job  		design, and workload.</p>
<p>ASPE is also funding a national survey of nursing assistants in LTC to  		examine wages and workers' perceptions of their working conditions, workplace  		experiences, job responsibilities, and supervisor relationships. The survey  		will be fielded in the summer of 2004 in conjunction with the National Center  		for Health Statistics' National Nursing Home Survey. Results are currently  		planned to be available in December 2004 (PHI and NCDHHS, 2004). ASPE is also  		sponsoring a symposium in May 2004, of invited stakeholders from LTC and  		workforce development fields to discuss current available evidence about  		effective strategies for recruiting and retaining direct care workers.</p>
<p>The past several years have shown that the downturn in the economy has  		not solved the LTC direct care workforce problem. The challenge is only likely  		to become greater in the decades to come as societal forces merge to require  		more direct care workers across the country than are currently projected to be  		available. Effective workforce policy and practice must be founded on solid  		evidence. This paper reflects selected evidence-based practices that can be  		useful as we continue to explore how best to recruit and retain a qualified and  		committed LTC workforce.</p>

<h2><a name="notes" id="notes">NOTES</a></h2>
<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">In</a> this report we use the terms paraprofessional  			 workers, direct care workers, and frontline workers interchangeably to refer to  			 nurse aides or assistants, personal care aides or assistants, home health  			 aides, home care aides and others who provide paid hands-on assistance with  			 bathing, eating, dressing and other activities of daily living for persons with  			 disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">As</a> these are national averages, wages vary by  			 state. For example, in California, wages in the late 1990s for nursing aides,  			 orderlies and attendants were higher than the national averages: $8.40 median  			 hourly wage, $8.78 mean hourly wage, and $18,260 mean annual wage, assuming  			 year-round, full-time hours. California home health aides have much higher  			 wages than the national averages; in 1999, the median hourly wage for these  			 workers was $8.54, mean hourly wage $9.73, and mean annual wage $20,230 (Franks  			 et al., 2002, based on data from the California Employment Development  			 Department). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">Case</a> and colleagues used Census Bureau  			 Occupational Classification codes 445, 446 and 447 for aides, while Yamada used  			 446 and 447 only. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">According</a> to a survey by Watson Wyatt &amp;  			 Company for the Washington Business Group on Health, released in March 2003,  			 about 80 percent of employers plan to increase employee co-pays and/or premium  			 contributions in 2003 in response to double digit growth in employee health  			 care costs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Not</a> all studies measured both retention and  			 turnover. As a result, we use the term "retention and/or turnover." For each  			 study we reviewed, we report on results for whichever of these two outcomes the  			 study measured. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">The</a> Kansas data were reported in, "State Wage  			 Pass-Through Legislation: An Analysis", <em>Workforce Strategies</em>, No. 1,  			 by Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, April 2003. The source of the data is  			 unclear. </p>
