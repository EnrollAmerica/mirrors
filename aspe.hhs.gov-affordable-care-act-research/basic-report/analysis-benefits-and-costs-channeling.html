<p>By its nature, a benefit-cost analysis draws on the work and experience  		of many individuals. In this instance, we are particularly indebted to Peter  		Kemper and George Carcagno, who designed and directed MPR's six-year effort to  		evaluate the National Long Term Care demonstration. We have also benefited  		extensively from the work of our colleagues who, along with Peter and George,  		estimated and analyzed the impacts and process of channeling: Bob Applebaum,  		Ray Baxter, Randy Brown, Jon Christianson, Walter Corson, Tom Grannemann,  		Barbara Phillips, Jennifer Schore, Joanna Will, and Judith Wooldridge.</p>
<p>At the federal level, many individuals, particularly Mary Harahan and  		Bob Clark, provided continuing encouragement and support. They, along with the  		demonstration advisory board, helped us substantially by sharing their comments  		and perspectives on our reports and the long term care field in general.</p>
<p>Our efforts were greatly facilitated by the programming and data base  		management skills of Dan Buckley, John Crawford, Mark Davies, and Margaret  		Harrigan. Felicity Skidmore and Thomas Good provided editorial support.  		Marjorie Mitchell handled the myriad chores associated with producing this  		report and its earlier drafts.</p>
<p>Of course, our evaluation would have been impossible without the  		tireless work of the staff in the ten demonstration states and projects who  		operated the channeling programs, and the participation of the sample members  		who provided the experience and information necessary to evaluate the  		demonstration., Our report is dedicated to these persons and the hope of future  		success in improving not only the delivery of long term care services but,  		ultimately, the quality of life for elderly persons.</p>

<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>The National Long Term Care Demonstration, initiated by the U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services in 1980, tested whether a managed  		approach to providing community-based long term care could help control costs  		while maintaining or improving the well-being of its clients and their informal  		caregivers. These effects were expected to derive from more appropriate  		decisions on institutionalization and the more rational use of services in the  		community. This report analyzes the benefits and costs of this program,  		focusing particularly on the net impact of channeling on public and private  		expenditures for living, medical, and long term care services.</p>
<p>Channeling was designed to work through 10 local projects, each of which  		used a uniform client-centered case management approach. Two models were  		tested:</p>
<ul><li><b>The basic case management model</b>, which augmented the case  		  management intervention with a small amount of direct service purchasing power  		  to fill service gaps</li>
<li><b>The financial control model</b>, which, through the pooling of  		  categorical program funds, permitted channeling case managers to order the  		  amount, duration, and scope of services that they deemed necessary</li>
</ul><p>It was hoped that both models would enable impaired elderly persons to  		remain in the community rather than enter a nursing home. In the process, the  		models were expected to help contain long term care costs while enhancing the  		quality of the lives of clients. The program included an extensive outreach and  		screening process to identify persons at risk of institutionalization. A  		comprehensive assessment of each client's needs was conducted, and an  		appropriate care plan was developed. This plan was then implemented and  		monitored over time to ensure that the necessary services were delivered.</p>
<p>The demonstration included an evaluation component designed to estimate  		the impacts of adding channeling case management services to the existing  		service system. Thus, this benefit-cost analysis, which is one component of  		that evaluation, examines the additional costs and benefits generated by  		channeling. These costs and benefits are in addition to those created by the  		long term care systems in place at the 10 demonstration sites.</p>
<p>The general conclusion of this benefit-cost analysis is that channeling,  		as it was fielded in the demonstration, led to an increase in total costs for  		clients, including costs for medical and long term care services and costs for  		shelter, food, and other daily living expenses. The absolute and relative size  		of this increase differed substantially by each model. The basic case  		management model appeared to increase these costs by about $1,300 per client  		during the 18-month observation period, which represents an increase of  		approximately 7 percent over the $18,500 per-client costs that we estimate  		clients would have incurred in the absence of channeling.</p>
<p>The financial control model, with its greater expenditures for community  		services, increased costs by much more: approximately $3,400 per client during  		the observation period. We estimate that during this period clients would have  		incurred average costs of almost $23,000 per client in the absence of  		channeling. Thus, the increase generated by this model of channeling represents  		an increase of roughly 15 percent.</p>
<p>In both models, the government pays for a great deal of the living,  		medical, and long term care services used by clients, particularly when Social  		Security, SSI, and food stamp benefits are included. In the absence of  		channeling, the government would have paid between 65 percent (under the basic  		model) and 75 percent (under the financial control model) of the living,  		medical, and long term care costs of clients, excluding payments from social  		insurance programs. When these social insurance payments are added in with the  		other costs, the total government costs for the 18 months following enrollment  		approximately equal the total expenditures for the clients.</p>
<p>Because the per-client estimates are inadequate in several respects for  		planning an on-going program, we have converted these estimates into estimates  		of the net cost to the government budget per case month (i.e., the net cost  		implied by providing channeling services to a client for a month). This  		conversion encompasses all of the impacts of channeling. Thus, the estimates  		include effects on all government agencies (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid,  		channeling, Social Security, and other public agencies). The estimates reflect  		the direct operating cost of channeling, as well as indirect costs and savings  		for services (e.g., formal community care and nursing homes) and social  		insurance (Social Security benefit payments). Our calculations indicate that it  		would cost the government approximately $2,500 (under the basic model) and  		almost $3,100 (under the financial control model) per case month to operate a  		permanent channeling program. These costs must be compared with those that the  		government would have incurred in the absence of channeling: $2,300 per case  		month in the basic model sites, and $2,600 in the financial control model  		sites. Thus, channeling would increase government costs for clients by 10  		percent under the basic model and by 20 percent under the financial control  		model. These increases in government costs are greater than those for society  		as a whole because the government costs exclude savings to clients and their  		families.</p>
<p>In both models, these increased net costs appeared to produce benefits  		in the form of reductions in the number of unmet client needs and increases in  		the reported levels of life satisfaction by clients. There were relatively  		clear indications that the number of unmet needs fell in both models, and that  		the proportion of clients with severe (i.e., more than three) unmet needs fell  		significantly. The proportion of clients who reported being satisfied with  		their service arrangements increased. In addition, channeling seemed to  		increase clients' reported satisfaction with life, an increase that was  		observed at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization.</p>
<p>Primary informal caregivers also seemed to derive benefits from  		channeling: they reported more satisfaction both with their lives and with the  		care arrangements for clients. The evidence suggests that primary caregivers  		did not reduce their efforts due to channeling under either model. The only  		observed reduction in effort was a slight reduction for visiting caregivers  		(who were generally less closely associated with clients) under the financial  		control model.</p>
<p>The differences among the sites in which the two channeling models were  		fielded create some uncertainty about the extent to which observed differences  		between the models can be generalized to a broader context. In general,  		however, the results indicate that the basic model was more cost-effective. It  		produced approximately the same increase in measures of life quality as did the  		financial control model, but its net cost was about one-third that of the  		financial control model. However, the differences in the availability of  		services in the sites cloud this issue, since it is unclear whether the  		financial control model might have generated greater increases in life quality  		had it been fielded in the less service-rich environment of the basic model  		sites. Nevertheless, our available evidence indicates that the basic case  		management model is the more cost-effective of the two.</p>
<p>When the evidence from the channeling demonstration is combined with the  		findings from previous community care evaluations, two general conclusions  		emerge about the benefits and costs of channeling-type programs. The first is  		that these efforts will tend to raise overall costs. Community care programs  		have largely been unsuccessful in delivering services only to those clients who  		would enter a nursing home in the absence of community services. This has  		limited their ability to generate nursing home cost savings. At the same time,  		they have increased the general level of services provided to community  		residents, thereby increasing overall costs.</p>
<p>The second conclusion is that these extra services to community  		residents have apparently increased the quality of the lives of the elderly  		clients. Further, channeling was found to increase the quality of the lives of  		primary caregivers and their satisfaction with service arrangements. In  		addition, the formal services provided by channeling did not appear to cause  		primary caregivers to reduce their efforts.</p>
<p>These two conclusions must be considered together in order to make the  		final assessment of channeling or other efforts to expand case management or  		community care. The net costs of this intervention are now well documented,  		both in this report and in previous studies. Benefits in the form of increases  		in life quality have been more difficult to document, but they do appear to  		exist. The issue for consideration is whether the largely intangible benefits  		are worth the net costs of producing them.</p>
<h2><a name="benefit" id="benefit">I. BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS AND THE NATIONAL LONG TERM  		CARE DEMONSTRATION</a></h2>
<p>The desire to control the burgeoning costs of long term care, combined  		with a belief that persons would generally prefer to remain in the community,  		has provided a powerful motivation for expanding community-based long term  		care. There is a growing sense that the current system, with its emphasis on  		institutional care, can be made more humane and less expensive by increasing  		the availability of community-based alternatives. Of course, it is recognized  		that community-based services can be expensive and that the number of services  		and funding sources can bewilder elderly persons seeking assistance. Therefore,  		case management services have been proposed as a means to facilitate access to  		services while providing a means to control costs.</p>
<p>The National Long Term Care Demonstration was an effort to test these  		ideas. It hoped to generate cost savings and increase the quality of the lives  		of clients and their caregivers. This was to be accomplished by establishing a  		case management system that would rationalize the delivery of long term care  		services. This intervention, termed "channeling," attempted to substitute  		formal and informal services in the community for institutional care, whenever  		community care was appropriate. Furthermore, it attempted to enroll and serve  		those impaired elderly persons who were at risk of entering a nursing home.  		This combination of community service orientation and careful targeting was  		expected to produce the desired cost savings and life-quality impacts.</p>
<p>Benefit-cost analysis provides a method for assessing the degree to  		which the channeling intervention succeeded in meeting its goals. Such an  		assessment, while admittedly imperfect, provides a basis for assessing whether  		the impacts of channeling are sufficiently large to justify the program costs.  		It establishes a comprehensive framework for organizing the available data and  		assessing the orders of magnitude of the impacts and the relative certainties  		and uncertainties inherent in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The analysis incorporates both cost-efficiency and humanitarian goals.  		The cost saving goals are examined by summing up the estimates of channeling's  		impacts on costs for medical and long term care services as well as impacts on  		shelter, food, and other living expenses. This summation produces an estimated  		net cost, reflecting the net impact of channeling on expenditures by and for  		clients. The success in achieving humanitarian goals is assessed by comparing  		the net cost estimate with estimates of the impacts on client and caregiver  		well-being. These well-being impacts are not valued in dollars, so they cannot  		be aggregated or compared as easily as cost impacts. Nevertheless, the overall  		success of channeling can be judged qualitatively by assessing whether these  		intangible effects represent benefits that are sufficiently large to justify  		the net costs of producing them.</p>
<p>This introductory chapter presents an overview of the channeling  		intervention and the impacts expected. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>  		reviews the overall evaluation design and the role of the benefit-cost analysis  		within that design. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a> also provides an  		overview of the benefit-cost results and the basic methods underlying their  		estimation. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a> examines the benefit and cost  		components individually to assess their magnitudes and the level of precision  		with which they are estimated. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a> examines factors  		that determine the net costs that would be generated after the 18-month period  		covered by our data.

A series of appendices contain details regarding the specific  		methods and impact estimates used in developing the benefit-cost analysis.</p>
<p>In describing the channeling intervention, this introductory chapter  		examines the channeling models, their expected impacts, their implementation,  		and the characteristics of the individuals enrolled. As mentioned, the  		demonstration hoped to achieve its desired effects by providing case management  		and formal community services to frail elderly persons at risk of  		institutionalization. Our evidence indicates that it succeeded in delivering  		channeling services and in enrolling a severely impaired population. However,  		the persons enrolled in the demonstration appear to have had a risk of  		institutionalization that was lower than expected given their advanced age and  		extensive impairments.</p>
<h3>A. THE CHANNELING INTERVENTION</h3>
<p>Channeling could expect to increase the quality of clients' lives by  		delivering more community services; but it could hope to achieve overall cost  		savings only if clients used the extra community services to substitute for  		more expensive institutional services. Thus, channeling tried to direct  		services to persons who would enter an institution otherwise and attempted to  		avoid extending benefits to individuals who might merely substitute publicly  		funded community services for care provided informally by family and  		friends.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, the following core components were included in  		the channeling intervention:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Outreach</b> to identify and attract potential clients at high  			 risk of entering a long term care institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Standardized eligibility screening</b> to determine whether an  			 applicant met each of the following pre-established criteria:</p>
<ul><li><b>Age</b>: must be 65 years of age or older</li>
<li><b>Functional Disability</b>: must have two moderate disabilities  				in performing activities of daily living (ADL), or three severe impairments in  				ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), or two  				severe IADL impairments and one severe ADL disability where cognitive or  				behavioral difficulties affecting individual ability to perform activities of  				daily living can count as one of the severe IADL impairments<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup></li>
<li><b>Unmet Needs</b>: must have an unmet need (expected to last for  				at least six months) for two or more services or a fragile informal support  				system not expected to be able to continue to meet the needs of the  				client<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Comprehensive in-person assessment</b> to identify individual  			 client problems, resources, and service needs in preparation for developing a  			 care plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Initial care planning</b> to specify the types and amount of care  			 required to meet the identified needs of clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Service arrangement</b> to implement the care plan through the  			 provision of both formal and informal in-home and community services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ongoing monitoring</b> to ensure that services are appropriately  			 delivered and continue to meet client needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Periodic reassessment</b> to adjust care plans to changing client  			 needs</p>
</li>
</ol><p>These seven core functions were combined with additional features of the  		demonstration to create two different channeling approaches--the basic case  		management model and the financial control model.</p>
<p>The <b>basic case management model</b> relied primarily on the seven  		components above to achieve its results. It tested the premise that the major  		difficulties in the long term care system were problems associated with  		information and coordination that could be remedied by intensive,  		client-centered case management. An additional feature of this model was a  		small amount of funding (typically $250,000 for each project over the  		demonstration period) that was made available to the case managers to purchase  		services or otherwise meet specific client needs.</p>
<p>The <b>financial control model</b> was more ambitious in its scope,  		adding several features to the seven basic channeling components. It  		established a funds pool to pay for a wide range of community-based services.  		These services included skilled nursing, therapy and home health assistance,  		personal care, homemaking, meal preparation, transportation, and other  		community-based services. The funds pool combined funds from Medicare,  		Medicaid, and certain state programs, and enabled case managers to provide  		needed services without concern for the eligibility requirements of specific  		programs. Because of the use of Medicare funds, all participants in the  		financial control model were required to be eligible for Medicare. This funds  		pool enabled case managers to authorize the amount, duration, and scope of  		community services purchased using funds-pool dollars, thus giving them access  		to, and accountability for, the full range of community services. To control  		costs in this model, two spending limits were imposed. First, a spending cap  		was placed on average funds-pool expenditures per client; the cost of  		individual care plans could vary, but the average client expenditure could not  		exceed 60 percent of the average annual rate for intermediate care facilities  		(ICFs) and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the area. Second, expenditures  		for an individual client could not exceed 85 percent of the average rate of ICF  		and SNF care without special approval. The financial control model also had a  		requirement that clients share in the cost of services if their income exceeded  		200 percent of the state's SSI eligibility level plus the food stamp bonus  		amount.</p>
<p>The channeling demonstration was fielded by 10 participating states and  		local agencies. Five channeling projects tested each model. The basic case  		management model was implemented in:</p>
<ul><li>Baltimore, Maryland</li>
<li>Houston, Texas</li>
<li>Middlesex County, New Jersey</li>
<li>Eastern Kentucky</li>
<li>Southern Maine (York and Cumberland counties)</li>
</ul><p>The financial control model was implemented in:</p>
<ul><li>Miami, Florida</li>
<li>Greater Lynn, Massachusetts</li>
<li>Rensselaer County, New York</li>
<li>Cuyahoga County (including Cleveland), Ohio</li>
<li>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</li>
</ul><p>The projects opened their doors to clients between February and June of  		1982, and were operational through October 1984. The local projects were phased  		out of the federal program in-March of 1985, although most continued to operate  		under other auspices.</p>
<h3>B. THE EXPECTED EFFECTS OF CHANNELING</h3>
<p>The channeling models outlined in the previous section were expected to  		affect four areas: community-based service use (including both formal and  		informal services), nursing home use, hospital use, and the quality of life of  		channeling clients and the family and friends who cared for them (informal  		caregivers). It was expected that savings from the reduced use of nursing homes  		and hospitals would offset any extra costs from the increased use of formal  		community-based services. Furthermore, case managers hoped to moderate  		increases in community-based service costs by working with informal caregivers  		to help them continue to provide care to clients.</p>
<p>Channeling was designed to have five central mechanisms that would  		produce these effects. Both models embody all five mechanisms to varying  		degrees, but the first three mechanisms are case management mechanisms common  		to both models, whereas the last two are financial mechanisms embodied  		primarily in the financial control model. These five mechanisms were expected  		to lead clients to substitute community services for institutional services, an  		effect that would, it was hoped, lead to the desired cost savings and  		improvements in life quality.</p>
<p>The three case management mechanisms were problem identification,  		information/advocacy, and support. The core functions of initial needs  		assessment, ongoing monitoring, and periodic reassessment enabled case managers  		to identify serious health problems and mismatches between clients' needs,  		services, and service providers. Case managers could act to correct any such  		problems by providing information about services and funding sources, and by  		helping clients and their families apply for assistance. The case managers also  		acted as advocates for clients and worked to ensure that providers were  		responsive to client needs. The case managers also provided emotional support  		and encouragement to clients and informal caregivers. The case managers'  		periodic checking on clients and their availability in times of need were  		intended to reassure clients that their needs would be met and to reinforce  		informal caregivers' capacity to provide care.</p>
<p>The two financial mechanisms were service price reduction and financial  		control. For covered services authorized by a case manager, channeling reduced  		to zero the price paid by clients in financial control sites.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> In basic case management sites,  		the gap-filling funds could be used to reduce the prices of community services.  		These effective price reductions not only lowered the overall price of  		community care, but also reduced the price of nonmedical community services  		(such as homemaking, personal care, and transportation) relative to the prices  		of medical community services (such as nursing or home health aide care), which  		are often paid by Medicare or Medicaid. The financial control mechanism  		constrained this price reduction mechanism by placing a cap on expenditures  		(either directly, as in the financial control model, or indirectly, as in the  		basic case management model that had only limited gap-filling funds). The  		constraining effect of these caps was enhanced in channeling because it  		operated by making the case manager the person accountable for service  		authorization and cost control.</p>
<p>All five of these mechanisms were expected to increase the use of  		community services. For those persons at risk of institutionalization whose  		service needs could be appropriately met in the community, channeling would  		induce and enable them to substitute community care for institutional care. In  		addition, for those persons who were not at risk of institutionalization but  		who had unmet needs, channeling would increase the use of community  		services.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup> The stronger  		price reduction mechanism of the financial control model was expected to  		generate larger increases in community-based service use.</p>
<p>The channeling mechanisms were expected to reduce the use of nursing  		homes as they increased the use of community services. They also sought to  		reduce hospital use by reducing the number of persons remaining in hospitals  		solely because of inadequate care at home or a shortage of nursing home  		beds.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup> As a consequence  		of changes in nursing home use and the identification of medical problems,  		channeling might also be expected to increase the rise of other medical  		services.</p>
<p>Improvements in life quality were expected to result from the increases  		in community residence which would enable persons to remain in their own homes  		and avoid the often debilitating effects of involuntary relocation to a nursing  		home. Furthermore, the improved monitoring and support were expected to reduce  		the anxiety that clients and caregivers had about the stability of their  		service arrangements. Also, the strain on informal caregivers was expected to  		be reduced through the provision of respite care. This caregiver support, along  		with the increased availability of community services, was expected to  		encourage caregivers to maintain or increase their informal caregiving. These  		efforts were considered essential for achieving overall cost savings because  		they reduced the tendency to substitute formal services for informal care.</p>
<h3>C. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CHANNELING INTERVENTION</h3>
<p>Channeling was expected to achieve its goals by providing case  		management services to impaired elderly persons at risk of  		institutionalization. In assessing the implementation of this intervention, we  		consider the delivery of services and the characteristics of enrollees  		separately.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Delivery of Case Management Services</b></i></p>
<p>The channeling intervention appears to have been implemented as intended  		under the demonstration. Data collected in a series of on-site interviews with  		channeling project staff and providers indicate that all seven core functions  		were delivered to clients. There were, however, some difficulties in the early  		stages of implementation.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> In particular, the monitoring and reassessment  		components of channeling were not fully implemented during the early months of  		the demonstration because emphasis was placed on building the caseload, and the  		gap-filling service component for the basic case management model was subject  		to some delays due to lags in authorizing the basic case management projects to  		expend funds.</p>
<p>The result of the demonstration was a clear increase in the amount of  		case management provided to clients, despite the fact that the demonstration  		projects were fielded in communities that already had some case management  		services available.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup>  		Furthermore, as discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>, treatment group members received more  		formal community-based services than did controls. Thus, the demonstration  		achieved its goal of increasing access to and use of community services.</p>
<p><b><i>2. Clients Enrolled in the Demonstration</i></b></p>
<p>Baseline data indicated that the demonstration successfully identified  		an extremely frail group experiencing severe physical limitations. Consistent  		with the eligibility criteria, sample members reported major limitations in  		functioning--with over 22 percent unable to undertake any of the five common  		activities of daily living (eating, getting out of bed or a chair, toileting,  		dressing, or bathing), 52 percent incontinent, and 81 percent restricted in  		their mobility. There was also overwhelming dependence in meal preparation (87  		percent), transportation (87 percent), shopping (95 percent), and housekeeping  		(97 percent). These impairments were associated with a high number of unmet  		needs for services; sample members reported an average of 3.4 such needs at the  		time they applied.</p>
<p>Linked to problems of functioning were physical health problems. Sample  		members reported the presence of medical conditions, such as heart trouble (48  		percent), stroke (30 percent), cancer (11 percent), arthritis (71 percent),  		diabetes (20 percent), nerve problems (24 percent), high blood pressure (42  		percent), and paralysis (14 percent). In the two months before entering  		channeling, over 47 percent of the sample had been admitted to a hospital and 6  		percent to a nursing home. Overall, the sample spent an average of over 10 days  		in a hospital and almost 2 days in a nursing home over that two-month  		period.</p>
<p>The channeling sample was poor. At the baseline interview, 57 percent  		reported incomes below $500 per month (which included spouse income where  		applicable), with income for the sample averaging only $542 per month. As  		further indicators of poverty, 56 percent reported no assets, and 25 percent  		reported Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>Coupled with these functional and financial limitations were isolation  		and stress. Over one-third of the sample lived alone, and 27 percent reported  		they were often lonely. During the year before baseline, a majority of sample  		members (86 percent) had experienced a major stressful life event, such as the  		death of a spouse or close friend or relative, or the onset of a major illness.  		Finally, a high proportion of the sample (44 percent) reported being  		dissatisfied with their lives.</p>
<p>These statistics indicate that channeling clearly identified an impaired  		population with serious health problems and low income. However, this  		population did not appear to have a high risk of institutionalization. As is  		discussed later (and in Wooldridge and Schore, 1986), fewer than 25 percent of  		the control group had a nursing home stay during our observation period. In  		addition, the evidence suggests that clients would have received many formal  		community services as well as some case management even in the absence of  		channeling. Thus, the demonstration seemed to attract a needy and very frail  		population that, in general, tended to live and receive services in the  		community. This tendency limited the extent to which channeling could create  		savings by substituting community for institutional care.</p>
<p>This situation characterizes most of the community-based long term care  		demonstrations. Weissert (1985) noted that available evidence indicates that  		most of the persons using community care use it as an add-on to rather than as  		a substitute for institutional care. He concluded that the vast majority of  		community care recipients in previous demonstrations were not at risk of  		institutionalization and would have remained in the community even without  		community care services. He reviewed eight demonstrations and found that fewer  		than 25 percent of control group members entered a nursing home (for these  		demonstrations, the fraction of control group members entering a nursing home  		during the relevant observation periods ranged from 2.1 percent to 23 percent).  		Thus, this constraint on the ability of community care to generate systemwide  		cost savings appears to be common.</p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">II. OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION AND BENEFIT-COST  		ESTIMATES</a></h2>
<p>Our analysis indicates that both models of channeling, as they were  		fielded in the demonstration, increased average long term care expenditures per  		client. In the basic case management model sites, the increase was  		approximately 7 percent over the estimated average expenditure level expected  		in the absence of channeling, which would have been approximately $18,500 per  		client over the 18-month observation period. In the financial control model  		sites, the increase was larger, due to the greater expenditures for formal  		community services at these sites. The increase was almost 15 percent over the  		estimated average expenditure level expected in the absence of channeling,  		which would have been approximately $23,000 per client. In both models, the  		services purchased with these additional expenditures generated small  		reductions in the average number of unmet client needs and small increases in  		the level of life satisfaction reported by clients and informal caregivers.</p>
<p>The above paragraph provides a simple statement of the benefit-cost  		findings. However, it does not reflect the large number of underlying estimates  		and assumptions used to derive those findings, nor does it provide a sense of  		the imprecision inherent in analyses of social programs such as channeling. In  		the remainder of this benefit-cost report, we provide a background for our  		conclusions by discussing these underlying assumptions, the impact estimates  		used in the analysis, and a framework for judging the level of confidence that  		can be placed in the findings. In doing so, we provide a more complete basis  		for assessing the extent to which the channeling intervention achieved its  		objectives--to reduce overall costs and to increase the quality of the lives of  		both clients and their informal caregivers.</p>
<p>This chapter begins the process by providing the framework and  		background necessary to interpret the various impacts and costs included in the  		benefit-cost analysis. In <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#section2.A">Section A</a> we delineate our  		basic strategy for estimating the impacts of channeling. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#section2.B">Section B</a> then describes the accounting framework that  		lies at the heart of our analysis. In describing this framework, we present an  		overview of the benefit-cost estimates so as to provide an appropriate context  		for interpreting the impact estimates. The individual impact estimates and the  		uncertainty surrounding them are then examined separately in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="section2.A" id="section2.A">A. EVALUATION DESIGN</a></h3>
<p>The evaluation sought to examine the extent to which channeling, as it  		was fielded in the demonstration, affected the expenditures, resource use, and  		well-being of clients. As the first step in our evaluation design, we assigned  		eligible applicants randomly to either a treatment or a control group. We  		followed both groups for 18 months through a series of in-person interviews,  		augmented by several sets of records data. The activities, expenditures, and  		attitudes of treatment and control group members were then compared to derive  		estimates of the impacts of channeling.</p>
<p>Three aspects of this evaluation design are particularly important to  		the benefit-cost analysis. First, the evaluation was designed to draw a  		specific comparison: the difference between what actually happened to persons  		who were offered channeling services and what would have happened to those  		persons in the absence of channeling. Second, the design established a method  		for drawing this comparison accurately. Finally, the design called for a  		sufficiently large sample size to provide relatively precise measures of the  		impacts of the program. We discuss these three aspects separately in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#section2.A.1">subsection 1</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#section2.A.2">subsection  		2</a>, and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#section2.A.3">subsection 3</a>.</p>
<p><i><b><a name="section2.A.1" id="section2.A.1">1. The Demonstration and the Comparisons  		Underlying the Evaluation</a></b></i></p>
<p>The evaluation was designed to assess as accurately as possible the  		channeling intervention as it was implemented in the demonstration. Thus, it  		was designed to draw some very specific comparisons between what actually  		happened and what would have happened in the absence of channeling.  		Furthermore, these comparisons were specific about the individuals and  		alternatives being compared. The persons included in the evaluation were those  		individuals who lived in one of the ten demonstration sites, volunteered to  		participate in the program, and were judged by the projects to be appropriate.  		The alternatives being compared reflect the operation of the demonstration  		projects and the service environments of the demonstration sites.</p>
<p>The specific nature of these comparisons has important implications for  		interpreting the evaluation findings. Two particularly important implications  		arise from the way channeling was fielded. First, not all persons who were  		offered channeling services actually received those services: some found  		alternative services, others died or moved out of the area, and others were  		determined to be ineligible at the in-person baseline assessment. Second,  		because channeling-type agencies already existed in some sites, as did agencies  		that provided some services similar to the core channeling services, some  		clients would have received case management services even in the absence of  		channeling.</p>
<p>Thus, the experimental design underlying the evaluation can be used only  		to estimate whether channeling generated impacts relative to the existing long  		term care system that was previously used by those who applied to and were  		determined to be eligible for channeling. It does not enable us to assess  		whether channeling generated impacts relative to a no-case-management or a  		no-formal-community-service-use scenario. Nor does it address the impacts on  		the long term care system as a whole or what the potential impacts would be on  		different groups (i.e., groups that include those who did not apply to or were  		ineligible for this particular demonstration). Finally, because it addresses  		the impacts associated only with the 10 judgmentally selected projects, the  		results cannot be extended directly to other sites or assumed to equal the  		results that might be produced by different organizations.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the results of the evaluation provide an  		accurate assessment of a large, multi-site community-based care program. These  		results--when combined with those from the channeling process analysis  		(Carcagno et al., 1986), the studies on channeling case management (Schneider  		et al., 1985), and the preceding long term care demonstrations (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a>)--provide a sound basis for assessing the  		effectiveness of channeling as a vehicle for reducing long term care  		expenditures and improving the well-being of elderly persons.</p>
<p><i><b><a name="section2.A.2" id="section2.A.2">2. The Experimental Design, Data Collection  		Effort, and Analytical Methods</a></b></i></p>
<p>The technique for drawing an accurate comparison between what actually  		happened in the demonstration and what would have happened in the absence of  		channeling is based on the random assignment of eligible applicants to either a  		treatment or a control group. Treatment group members were given the  		opportunity to receive channeling services; control group members were  		precluded from enrolling in channeling but were free to obtain any other  		services (including case management) that were available in their community.  		Random assignment should ensure that treatment and control group members are  		identical in terms of measured characteristics (such as basic demographic  		characteristics, prior service use, current ADL impairments, and income) and  		unmeasured characteristics (such as attitudes toward community care and the  		propensity to become ill). The two groups should also be identical in terms of  		influences that change over time, including those due to general trends (such  		as improvements in training techniques and technologies in the health care  		industry) and those due to program changes (such as changes in reimbursement  		policies under Medicare and Medicaid). This underlying similarity along all  		measured and unmeasured dimensions--except the opportunity to receive  		channeling services--enables us to use the experience of the control group to  		measure what would have happened to the treatment group in the absence of the  		demonstration. Thus, the differences between the treatment and control groups  		measure the impact of channeling.</p>
<p>The experimental design was implemented as follows. To enter the  		project, individuals who were referred to or who applied to channeling were  		screened to determine whether they were eligible and interested in  		participating. If so, they were assigned randomly to either a treatment or a  		control group. After random assignment (on average, about a week later), both  		treatment and control groups received a baseline assessment. Channeling program  		staff administered this assessment to the treatment group, for which it served  		the dual function of an initial needs assessment for case management and the  		source of baseline information for the research effort; research staff  		administered the same assessment instrument to the control group.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we use the term "client" throughout this report  		to refer to all individuals who were determined eligible and were offered the  		opportunity to receive channeling services. Most, but not all, of such persons  		actually received some channeling services (see Carcagno et al., 1986, Tables  		V.3 and VIII.8). This focus is consistent with the impact analyses, which  		compared all treatment group members, regardless of their participation, with  		all control group members.</p>
<p>Both groups were followed up with interviews administered by research  		staff at 6 and 12 months after random assignment. The half of the sample who  		enrolled earlier were interviewed again at 18 months after random assignment.  		These interviews collected measures of formal and informal service use and  		well-being. In addition, records data--which were collected from the channeling  		projects, Medicare and Medicaid records, provider billing records, and official  		death records--were used to obtain complete service use and cost data, as well  		as information on mortality. The interviews also identified the primary  		informal caregivers for a subsample of both treatment and control groups; these  		caregivers received a baseline interview and two followup interviews at 6 and  		12 months.</p>
<p>We used multiple regression techniques to analyze the data on treatment  		and control group members.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup> Essentially, this analytical technique  		compares the mean outcomes for both groups, controlling for the effects of  		individual characteristics and other a priori factors that can be expected to  		affect the outcomes. Furthermore, regression analysis enables us to correct (at  		least partially) for any biases that could be due to the different rates of  		attrition that were exhibited by the treatment and control groups.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The impact analyses used the regression analysis to test whether  		channeling had an effect on service use, costs, and the quality of life. In  		doing so, the analyses relied on standard rules of statistical inference to  		assess whether the estimated differences were likely to indicate real  		impacts--that is, whether a relatively high probability existed that the  		estimated treatment-control differences were the effects of the channeling  		intervention, rather than due to chance. In the impact analysis, an estimate  		was considered significant if it was found to be statistically different from  		zero at a 95 percent level of confidence.</p>
<p>In the benefit-cost analysis, we are concerned primarily with the  		relative magnitudes of the various impacts and their relative sizes compared  		with the costs of producing them. Thus, we are interested in the best estimates  		of the true effects, not just the extent to which an estimated effect is likely  		to differ from zero. The estimates derived from the regression analysis  		described above provide such estimates, and we use these estimates regardless  		of whether they are statistically significant.</p>
<p>While our comparison of the impacts includes estimated differences even  		when they are not statistically significant, we are still very much concerned  		with statistical precision. For the benefit-cost analysis, it is essential to  		know the range of likely values (i.e., the statistical confidence interval) for  		an estimate rather than simply whether this range includes zero as a possible  		value. For example, Wooldridge and Schore (1986) estimated that treatment group  		members in the basic case management model of channeling spent an average of  		$165 less on nursing home use than Aid control group members during the first  		six months following their enrollment. This estimate is statistically  		significant, and, consequently, the probability is less than 5 percent that the  		true effect is zero and the estimated effect is due to chance. Nevertheless,  		considerable uncertainty still surrounds this estimate. The 95 percent  		confidence interval, which is centered at $165, ranges from $15 to $315. While  		the midpoint of this range is the most likely value and is the single best  		estimate of the impact, a reasonable probability still exists that the true  		impact differs by as much as $150, an amount that could have implications for a  		comparative analysis of benefits and costs. This concern over the precision of  		the impact estimates is important regardless of statistical  		significance.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b><a name="section2.A.3" id="section2.A.3">3. Sample Size for the  		Evaluation</a></b></i></p>
<p>Another determinant of precision is the size of the sample used to make  		the estimates. In general, larger sample sizes yield more precise estimates.  		The large sample available for the evaluation, over 5,600 individuals, enables  		us to draw relatively precise impact estimates. The exact size of the available  		sample and the resulting precision varied according to the outcome under  		examination, because of missing data for some individuals and because of the  		differential coverage of the various data sources. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.1">Table  		II.1</a> presents the maximum total sample available (including treatment and  		control group members) for estimating the impacts of channeling on the major  		outcomes examined in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The available sample size is largest for the impacts estimated from  		records data--that is, impacts on hospital use, other medical service use, and  		mortality. These records data were comprehensive and generally not subject to  		attrition problems. The impacts estimated on the basis of interview data  		represented smaller samples. In particular, the interview sample available at  		18 months is generally only half the size of the sample available in earlier  		periods, because only those sample members who enrolled in the first half of  		the demonstration were scheduled to be interviewed 18 months after enrollment.  		Thus, estimates for the period from 13 to 18 months after randomization are  		less precise than those for earlier periods.</p>
<p>The sample size figures presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.1">Table II.1</a>  		generally reflect the samples that were used to estimate costs, but there are  		several exceptions. In particular, some cost estimates relied on data collected  		in searches of provider records for a randomly selected 20 percent subsample.  		For most analyses, this smaller sample size did not create problems because  		interview or other records data were used in conjunction with the provider  		records data to obtain accurate estimates. Problems arose when such  		corroborating data were unavailable. In addition, a few cases exhibited high  		expenditure levels, due to large private expenditures for formal community  		services; such cases may be disproportionately represented in the small  		provider records sample, creating potentially misleading estimates. We will  		discuss these cases in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>, in which we present  		the individual impact estimates.</p>

<p>In most cases, a benefit-cost analysis can focus on the extent to which  		a program increases the goods and services available to society (i.e., social  		resources)--an approach similar to the approach underlying the estimation of  		gross national product (GNP). This approach assumes that benefits and costs  		that reflect measured changes in the value of social resources capture all the  		important impacts of the program under study. For channeling, this assumption  		is inadequate because the desired impacts on the quality of life are not  		captured by measures of the net change in resource use.</p>
<p>We address this problem by using an approach that divides the analysis  		into two parts. The first focuses on the <b>net resource cost</b> of  		channeling--that is, the measured change in social resources due to the  		intervention. The second part examines the <b>impacts on the quality of the  		lives</b> of clients and their caregivers. The final conclusions combine these  		two parts and rest on judgments about whether the impacts on life quality,  		which are not valued in dollars, are sufficiently large to justify the net cost  		of producing them.</p>
<p>Of course, assessments of whether channeling produces benefits that  		exceed its costs will depend on the perspective adopted. Clients can be  		expected to find channeling desirable as long as any increases in their  		well-being are worth more than any additional costs they incur as a result of  		channeling. Medicaid, which pays for much of the nursing home care that clients  		might use, would view the program as a success if it reduced total Medicaid  		expenditures. Similarly, Medicare and other government programs would find  		channeling appealing if it reduced their costs. A government-wide perspective  		would examine whether gains to one agency were offset by costs to another; it  		would judge success on the basis of the overall net cost to the government.  		Finally, a broader social perspective would seek to balance the interests of  		all groups by assessing whether the gains to whomever they accrued outweighed  		any costs to other groups in society.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>To keep the various benefit-cost comparisons straight, we use an  		accounting framework that incorporates all the major impacts of channeling  		(measured and unmeasured) and the various perspectives. This framework imposes  		a logical rigor on the analysis and serves as the basis for interpreting the  		findings. The framework seeks to include all the important impacts, even if  		they are not measured in the analysis. In this way, those items that are  		excluded can easily be identified, and judgments can be made about whether the  		overall conclusions would be altered if those items had been included.</p>
<p>This framework is laid out in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>, which also present, for each channeling  		model, the estimated control group means for the 18 months following random  		assignment.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note12">12</a></font></sup> These  		means reflect the expenditures associated with all control group members,  		including those who died prior to the end of the 18-month observation period.  		They indicate the expected value of the expenditures that the average client  		would have made during this period in the absence of channeling.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note13">13</a></font></sup> To correct for the effects of inflation, we  		have expressed all values in 1984 dollars (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix  		D</a> for our rationale and the relevant procedures). </p>

</tr></table><p>The accounting framework includes seven perspectives. The first  		four--Medicare, Medicaid, channeling, and other public programs--are combined  		in the fifth perspective to produce a total government perspective.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note14">14</a></font></sup> The sixth perspective  		encompasses clients and their families. Here, again, we include all persons who  		were offered channeling services, regardless of whether they actually received  		those services (that is, the "client" group includes all treatment group  		members and their families). The seventh perspective aggregates all the other  		perspectives to yield a social perspective. We have defined these perspectives  		in a manner whereby the sum of the benefits and costs to various government and  		client perspectives will represent the net benefit or cost to society as a  		whole. Impacts that result in a benefit or cost to one group and an offsetting  		benefit or cost to another group will cancel each other out in this summation  		process, and will thus be excluded from the social perspective.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In this framework, the channeling perspective is separated from the  		Medicare, Medicaid, and other public perspective in order to highlight the  		costs of providing channeling services. However, it should be mentioned that  		the financial control model projects received 94 percent of their funds from  		Medicare and Medicaid, and the basic projects received 15 percent of their  		funds from other public sources (see Thornton, Will, and Davies, 1986, Table  		III.5). Thus, shifts in the distribution of government costs must be  		interpreted carefully.</p>
<p>From the social perspective, our estimates indicate that, <b>in the  		absence of channeling</b>, clients would have used substantial resources over  		the 18-month period following enrollment. In the basic case management sites,  		we estimate that clients would have incurred costs worth over $18,000 per  		person for medical and long term care services and for food and shelter while  		in the community.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note16">16</a></font></sup> In  		the financial control sites, these expenditures would have been slightly  		higher, almost $23,000 per person, during the 18 months after randomization.  		Most of these higher resources would have been paid for by the government; in  		particular, Medicare would have paid approximately 50 percent of the total.</p>
<p>The costs included in these totals are the major costs that were  		expected to be affected by channeling.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note17">17</a></font></sup> They include expenditures for all major  		medical and long term care goods and services, as well as community housing,  		food, and clothing. The first category that is listed contains the cost of  		channeling case management, which, of course, would have been zero in the  		absence of channeling. The second category includes the costs of formal  		community services (nursing, home health aides, delivered meals, etc.). The  		estimates indicate that clients would have received substantial community  		services even in the absence of channeling. We estimate that clients in the  		basic sites would have received formal community services worth over $3,000 per  		person during the observation period, while clients in the financial control  		sites would have received about $3,500 worth of these services.</p>
<p>Those persons who lived in the community would also have incurred costs  		for room and board, including costs for food and clothing and costs for housing  		and utilities. These costs would also have been substantial in the absence of  		channeling; we estimate that expenditures for these items would have been worth  		over $4,100 during our 18-month observation period.</p>
<p>Some clients would also have received case management services in the  		absence of channeling. Many of these persons would have received these services  		along with other formal services provided by nurses, home health aides,  		hospital discharge planners, and other formal service providers. The case  		management costs for such providers are included in the relevant cost component  		(e.g., formal community services or hospital services). In other cases,  		individuals would have received case management services as a separate service.  		We have accounted for these costs of separate case management services in the  		fourth category of the framework. While some individuals may have received  		substantial assistance from this source, we estimate that the average cost per  		client would have constituted only a relatively small fraction of total costs  		in the absence of channeling. We estimate that these services were worth about  		$190 per client in the basic sites, and about $240 per client in the financial  		control sites.</p>
<p>The areas in which channeling was expected to generate savings were  		nursing home and hospital costs, the fifth and six categories. We estimate that  		expenditures for hospital use would have been very large in the absence of  		channeling: in the basic case management sites, average expenditures would have  		been over $6,600 per client during the 18-month observation period; in the  		financial control sites, they would have been even larger, over $9,300 per  		client during the period. For nursing homes, expenditures in the absence of  		channeling were not nearly so great, averaging about $2,400 per client in both  		groups of sites.</p>
<p>Channeling was also expected to affect the use of other covered medical  		services, Social Security and Veterans benefits, and transfers from the  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and food stamp programs. Medical services  		covered by Medicare or Medicaid include doctors, drugs, supplies, and other  		medical services. These services were used substantially. We estimate that, in  		the absence of channeling, clients would have used approximately $2,000 per  		person worth of these services in the basic model sites and almost $2,900 per  		person in the financial control sites.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note18">18</a></font></sup> Benefits from Social Security were also  		substantial. We estimate that, in the absence of channeling, clients in both  		groups of sites would have received roughly $6,000 worth of these benefits  		(including benefits from Veterans Administration programs) during the  		observation period. Participation in the SSI and food stamp programs would be  		much lower. In the absence of channeling, benefits from these programs would  		have averaged less than $600 per person over the 18-month observation period.  		Combined, Social Security and transfers accounted for the bulk of the clients'  		income.</p>
<p>Unlike the other cost components included in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table  		II.2</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>, the treatment of Social  		Security and transfer payments depends on the analytical perspective adopted.  		These payments represent costs to the government and income to clients. To  		indicate this difference, we have included them as costs from the other  		government and total government perspectives and as benefits (negative costs)  		from the client perspective. Thus, this transfer of income does not appear in  		the social perspective, since it is a redistribution of income rather than a  		use of social resources.</p>
<p>The framework also includes two outcome areas that are unobserved. The  		first is unmeasured resource costs, primarily drug and medical expenditures not  		covered by Medicare or Medicaid and the costs incurred by volunteers who  		assisted sample members. We omitted these costs because satisfactory data or  		methods for estimating their value were not available. Their exclusion implies  		that our total cost estimates in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a> understate the actual costs incurred by the  		control group over the 18-month observation period. However, as we discuss in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>, channeling probably had little effect on  		those costs, and, consequently, their omission is unlikely to affect the  		conclusions of the benefit-cost analysis, which examines the <b>changes</b> in  		the costs and benefits due to channeling.</p>
<p>The second unobserved outcome area in the accounting framework is the  		benefits and costs that occur after the observation period. Channeling was a  		long-term program whose purpose was to provide ongoing services to impaired  		elderly persons. Thus, costs and benefits can be expected to continue after the  		program. We can estimate these future outcomes only by extrapolating from  		trends observed in the 18 months of data that are available, a process that  		involves numerous assumptions and a relatively high level of uncertainty. We  		have not made a point estimate of these costs. Rather, in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a>, we examine the impacts of the program that will  		determine these future costs and indicate their possible magnitude.</p>
<p>The accounting framework also includes the quality of the lives of  		clients and their informal caregivers. For clients, several measures of the  		quality of life are available: their satisfaction with services and  		environmental conditions, social/psychological well-being, and level of  		functioning. For informal caregivers, we have examined the limitations on their  		personal lives and employment imposed by their caregiving responsibilities, as  		well as their satisfaction with life and with service arrangements, and the  		strains they experience due to caregiving. These intangible outcomes are  		discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>.</p>
<p>Channeling was expected to alter all the outcomes listed in the  		framework. It was expected to enhance the well-being of clients and caregivers  		while also increasing the average net expenditures for the first three  		components: channeling case management, formal community services, and  		community room and board. It was expected to reap its major cost savings by  		reducing the use of nursing homes, although it was also expected to lead to a  		net reduction in the time spent in hospitals, particularly for individuals who  		were in the hospital waiting for the arrangement of appropriate community  		services. Finally, some small savings were expected from reductions in the use  		of alternative case management.</p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table  		II.5</a> present the estimated impacts of the basic case management and  		financial control models of channeling on each outcome area. Both models  		generated an estimated net increase in the well-being of clients and their  		informal caregivers. The net cost of producing these well-being outcomes was  		just over $1,300 per client under the basic model-an increase of approximately  		7 percent in total expenditures. The net cost under the financial control model  		was higher, almost $3,400 per client (a 15 percent increase in total costs),  		due primarily to the greater increase in formal community services delivered in  		those sites.</p>
<p>Again, it is important to remember that we have used the term "client"  		to refer to all persons who were offered channeling services, and that some of  		these persons did not actually receive channeling services (Carcagno et al.,  		1986, Table VII.8). For example, 11 percent of the persons who were enrolled in  		the treatment groups at the basic case management sites and 7 percent of those  		in the financial control sites did not complete their baseline assessment  		(primarily because of refusals to participate and deaths). Consequently, the  		costs per <b>participant</b> would have been higher than our estimated costs  		per <b>client</b> who was offered channeling services. Our per-client estimates  		indicate the expected net change in costs that are due to offering channeling  		services to the persons who were enrolled in the demonstration.</p>
<p>We discuss these benefit-cost estimates and their various components in  		the remaining three chapters. Throughout our discussion, the estimates  		presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table  		II.5</a> provide a frame of reference for interpreting the relative magnitudes  		and uncertainties of the specific impact estimates. In particular, the  		estimated costs of the channeling case management (approximately $1,200 per  		client over the 18-month observation period) are, used as a base from which the  		estimated cost savings that this case management approach tried to generate can  		be judged. Moreover, the net cost estimates (approximately $1,300 per client in  		the basic model and $3,400 in the financial control model) can be used to judge  		the degree to which changes in specific impact estimates might alter the  		overall conclusions of the benefit-cost analysis. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter  		III</a> uses this framework to assess the individual impact estimates.  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a> considers the potential magnitude of the net  		costs that might arise beyond the 18-month observation period and how they  		might influence conclusions based only on the 18 months of observation.  		Finally, we bring all the elements together in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter  		V</a>, to provide an interpretation of the benefit-cost estimates.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="observe" id="observe">III. OBSERVED OUTCOMES</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter we consider the expectations regarding channeling's  		impact on the 11 outcomes presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a>,  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a>, as well as the data used to make the  		estimates and the relative magnitudes of the estimates. We also discuss the  		values placed on the outcomes and the relative certainty we feel can be placed  		in those values.</p>
<p>In reviewing these outcome areas, we emphasize the total discounted  		values of costs for the 18 months after randomization. These discounted values  		are obtained by converting the streams of observed costs into their equivalent  		value at the time of enrollment.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note19">19</a></font></sup> Focusing on these totals rather than on the  		various sets of impacts over time makes it easier to judge the relative  		magnitudes of the different impacts. We will discuss those trends that did  		appear in the data when they have important implications for the benefit-cost  		analysis. The technical reports cited in the text contain complete discussions  		of the trends observed in the data, and we have reproduced the undiscounted  		estimates for each six-month period (along with the associated t-statistics for  		the impact estimates) in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendE">Appendix E</a>.</p>
<p>We have postponed until <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a> our  		discussion of the distribution of costs across the various perspectives  		(Medicare, Medicaid, channeling, other public, clients, and society as a  		whole). That discussion will draw on our assessments in this chapter of the  		impacts in all eleven outcome areas. Changes in the distribution of costs  		across these perspectives are important for judging the effectiveness of the  		intervention and for assessing the incentives that various groups and  		government agencies might have to participate in channeling. In particular, we  		are interested in assessing the extent to which channeling affected the  		distribution of costs between the government and the clients.</p>
<p>Our examination of the eleven outcome areas begins with a brief analysis  		of the statistical uncertainty in the benefit-cost analysis. This uncertainty  		is inherent in the estimation of program impacts. It is determined by the  		properties of the population under study and the methods used to estimate the  		impacts. Uncertainty also stems from the procedures used to value the diverse  		outcomes and to aggregate the resulting values. It reflects both the difficulty  		in assigning dollar values to the outcomes of social programs and the inherent  		limitation of the data sets used. We discuss this valuation uncertainty along  		with the various net cost components.</p>
<h3>A. STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY IN BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS</h3>
<p>In general, the precision of impact estimates is determined by the  		interaction of three factors: estimation techniques, sample size, and  		population variance. Given an estimating procedure, the estimates are more  		accurate the larger the sample of persons used in the analysis is and the less  		variation the population has in the behavior and characteristics of interest.  		The properties and statistical power of the estimating procedures themselves  		also contribute to the accuracy of the impact estimates.</p>
<p>As Brown (1986) discusses, the plan adopted in the evaluation produced  		unbiased estimates of modelwide impacts. The sample was large; data are  		available for up to 6,300 individuals depending on the specific outcome  		analyzed. It also was relatively homogeneous (when compared with the general  		population) with respect to health status and other factors determining service  		use and institutionalization. Furthermore, a variety of methodological studies  		that examined potential problems due to attrition, the use of proxy respondents  		for some sample members, and regression specification suggest that the impact  		estimates are valid and robust.</p>
<p>There is still uncertainty in all the estimates. As noted in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>, the 95 percent confidence intervals  		surrounding some impact estimates were wide enough that they include values  		that are proportionally very different from the impact estimate. The  		benefit-cost analysis deals with this uncertainty by assessing the extent to  		which its overall conclusions would be altered by using alternative estimates  		in the confidence interval around the specific impact estimate. In most cases,  		we found that, even when these alternative estimates were proportionally much  		larger than the impact estimates, the impact estimates were relatively small so  		that the absolute value of the implied change was not great. Furthermore, as  		seen in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>, the costs involved were substantial  		(channeling case management alone cost approximately $1,200 per client), and  		small changes in the absolute value of estimated savings or costs will not  		affect the overall benefit-cost conclusions.</p>
<h3>B. CHANNELING CASE MANAGEMENT COSTS</h3>
<p>Channeling case management, the first outcome area listed in the  		accounting framework, includes the seven core functions described in Chapter I.  		For purposes of analyzing costs we have grouped these functions into those  		one-time-only functions associated with enrolling clients (outreach, screening,  		initial needs assessment, and initial care plan development) and the ongoing  		functions of service arrangement, ongoing monitoring, and assessment.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note20">20</a></font></sup> These functions are described  		in Carcagno et al. (1986), and their costs were estimated by Thornton, Will,  		and Davies (1986).</p>
<p>In estimating the costs of these functions we have included the direct  		case management costs along with the projects' administrative costs (which  		included costs for clerical services and ongoing relations with service  		providers as well as those for managing the projects). In the financial control  		projects, administrative costs also included most of the costs of operating the  		financial control data system that enabled projects to monitor costs and ensure  		that the expenditure caps were not exceeded. These project administration costs  		varied across models and projects. The basic projects spent from 37 to 47  		percent of their salary expenditures on administration; the financial control  		model projects spent 49 to 62 percent on these functions.</p>
<p>For the benefit-cost analysis we used estimates of the channeling case  		management costs for the demonstration's steady-state phase, the period of  		relatively stable operations that occurred after the demonstration projects had  		attained their full sample size.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note21">21</a></font></sup> This phase was chosen because it was the  		period during which demonstration activities most closely resembled those of an  		ongoing program. The steady-state phase emphasized delivering services to a  		constant caseload rather than building caseloads, which was the focus of  		earlier phases. As a result, outreach and enrollment activities were much more  		modest during the steady-state phase. Projects were able to replace clients who  		had died or left channeling by recruiting from waiting lists. They no longer  		needed the extensive outreach efforts that characterized early operations when  		it was important to increase project size and to recruit and screen persons who  		were assigned to the control group. Furthermore, project-level research  		activities were minimal during this phase, accounting for less than 1 percent  		of total project-level case management costs.</p>
<p>During the steady-state phase, the basic case management model projects  		spent an average of $330 per client enrolled on the initial  		functions.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note22">22</a></font></sup> Once a  		person had signed his or her care plan (or had begun to receive services if  		that was earlier), these projects spent an average of $92 per casemonth to  		provide ongoing services. The financial control projects spent an average of  		$346 per client enrolled, with ongoing costs averaging $86 per ongoing  		casemonth. Costs per client for the earlier phases were substantially higher,  		reflecting the smaller size of the projects, the extra costs associated with  		program startup, and the higher research costs due to efforts to find and  		screen persons assigned to the control group.</p>
<p>We estimated the average channeling case management cost per client over  		the observation period by multiplying the ongoing cost estimates by the average  		number of ongoing casemonths per client during that period, and then adding in  		the average initial cost per client. We also added in the costs of central  		administration. As part of the demonstration, the states and federal government  		both monitored the projects. Since an ongoing program would probably not  		involve the extensive monitoring done in the demonstration, the costs incurred  		by the states and federal government probably exceed those that would be  		observed for an ongoing program. For this reason we did not use observed  		central administration costs, but rather used an estimate of 5 percent of  		project-level costs. This somewhat arbitrary assumption was used because it  		reflects a level of resources consistent with the central monitoring efforts  		observed for similar programs.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The resulting values, which are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table  		II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a>, indicate that channeling  		spent approximately $1,200 per client for case management services during the  		18 months following randomization. There is little variation across models,  		since the average costs are quite similar, and there was little difference in  		the average length of participation.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>These estimates of average costs per client are quite accurate for the  		demonstration projects as fielded. The cost estimates are based on data from  		project accounting systems and are generally consistent with the process  		observations.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note25">25</a></font></sup>  		Furthermore, the cost estimates are consistent with those observed for other  		community care demonstrations.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note26">26</a></font></sup> Of course, since all these estimates are  		based on the actual costs of the demonstration projects, they may still  		misrepresent the costs of an ongoing program. The observed costs may be too  		high because the demonstration imposed special costs on the projects and  		because the projects had not yet resolved all of the start-up problems even by  		the steady-state phase. Also, the demonstration projects may have had higher  		administrative costs per client because of their relatively small scale.  		Alternatively, observed costs may also understate the costs of an ongoing  		program to the extent the projects benefited from the special attention and  		enthusiasm given the demonstration.</p>
<p>While the precise effects of these various factors are unknown, their  		implications for the benefit-cost analysis appear modest, particularly when  		viewed in the context of estimated <b>net</b> costs. For the basic model,  		aggregate net costs for the observation period were a little over $1,300, of  		which channeling case management costs for that period were less than $1,200.  		Thus, even relatively large changes in the average cost of channeling case  		management would not alter our basic conclusion that channeling increased  		aggregate costs. This situation also holds for the financial control model,  		where channeling case management costs were about the same as for the basic  		model, and the aggregate net cost was about $3,400. We return to this issue in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a>, when we consider the overall conclusions  		and the potential for reducing net costs in future channeling-type  		programs.</p>
<h3>C. FORMAL COMMUNITY SERVICES</h3>
<p>The primary means by which channeling case management sought to  		rationalize the delivery of long term care services was through its impact on  		community services. Most of the central channeling mechanisms described in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#benefit">Chapter I</a>--problem identification, information/advocacy,  		support, and service price reduction--worked to increase the use of community  		services, although the fifth channeling mechanism, financial control, worked to  		limit any increase in expenditures for formal community services. This  		increased use of community services was an essential part of the channeling  		intervention and was intended to substitute for the use of institutional  		services, particularly nursing homes, and enable clients to remain in the  		community.</p>
<p>These efforts were expected to increase the use of both formal and  		informal community services. Formal services are those provided by persons who  		are either employed privately or working through an agency or organization as  		part of their paid or volunteer work. Informal community services are those  		provided by spouses, children, friends, and neighbors on an unpaid basis. This  		section examines formal community services; informal services are examined in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#sectionIII.K">Section K</a>.</p>
<p>The formal community services provided to clients included a broad range  		of long term care and medical assistance services. Many were in-home services  		such as nursing, therapy, home health aide services, homemaking, personal care,  		housekeeping, and companion and chore services. They also included services  		delivered outside the home: delivered or congregate meals, transportation,  		adult day care, and adult foster care. Finally, these services included such  		special and emergency assistance as emergency transportation, supplies and  		equipment, medical social services, respite care, and emergency lodging.</p>
<p>Corson et al. (1986) estimated that expenditures for these types of  		formal community services would have been substantial even in the absence of  		channeling. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> indicated that control group  		members in the basic case management sites used formal community services worth  		over $2,800 per client during the 18 months covered by our data. In the  		financial control sites, control group members used $3,500 worth of services  		per client (<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>). In-home services provided by  		visiting caregivers--housework, laundry or shopping, personal care, and meal  		preparation--were the most commonly used formal services.</p>
<p>Channeling increased the use of these community services. Data collected  		in the interviews showed that channeling led to an increased use of formal  		community services under both models and that the increases in use were much  		larger under the financial control model (Corson et al., 1986, Chapter  		III).</p>
<p>Data on expenditures followed the same general pattern as those on use  		but were influenced to a greater extent than were the use estimates by the  		existence of a few high-use individuals in the research sample. Interview data  		indicated a sprinkling of high-use persons in both treatment and control  		groups, for both models, and for all time periods. However, in the control  		group in the first six-month period in the basic sites there was a  		disproportionately high number of high-use cases, which was magnified in the 20  		percent provider records subsample.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are at least some high-use individuals in the  		populations. Liu, Manton, and Liu (1985) found that such persons constitute a  		potentially important (though small) subgroup of the noninstitutionalized,  		impaired elderly population. If channeling could reduce the expenditures of  		this high-use group, it might be able to achieve at least some of the cost  		savings necessary to pay for the additional services provided to other  		clients.</p>
<p>The inclusion or exclusion of the high-use persons with respect to the  		provider records data makes a substantial difference to the observed  		distribution of expenditures, since their expenditures were enormous compared  		with those of the vast majority of sample members. The provider records data  		indicate, for example, that the few high-use individuals used as much as  		$20,000 per client worth of formal community services in the six months  		following randomization. If they are excluded, the average formal community  		service expenditure per client would be less than 15 percent of that figure. In  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendC">Appendix C</a> we consider four alternative estimates of the  		net impact of channeling on formal community service expenditures. These  		estimates differ with respect to the data set used and whether we include the  		high-use individuals in our sample. These four estimated impacts over the  		18-month observation period for the basic model range from an <b>increase</b>  		of $555 per client to a <b>reduction</b> of $784 per client.</p>
<p>Corson et al. (1986) made the judgment that the distribution of high-use  		individuals observed for the provider records sample (used to estimate provider  		and other public expenditures) in the first six months was unlikely, rendering  		inappropriate the conclusion that channeling was the operative mechanism  		leading to their absence in the treatment group. To be consistent, the high-use  		cases were excluded throughout the analysis of community services. They paid  		most of their services privately. With this exclusion, the basic model of  		channeling led to an increase of $175 per client over the 18-month period. This  		estimate reflects the average experience of the vast majority of sample  		members.</p>
<p>In assessing the implications of this decision, it is essential to keep  		in mind that the uncertainty affects only the basic model during the first six  		months and pertains only to private expenditures for formal community  		services.</p>
<p>The presence of these few high-use individuals in the control group for  		the basic model creates an important uncertainty for the benefit-cost  		analysis.</p>
<p>The financial control model results are not subject to this uncertainty.  		This model clearly increased the use of and expenditures for formal community  		services. Corson et al. (1986) estimated that average expenditures for these  		services rose by approximately $2,500 per client during our observation period.  		This is a 70 percent increase in expenditures for formal community  		services.</p>
<h3>D. COMMUNITY ROOM AND BOARD</h3>
<p>Channeling was expected to increase expenditures for community room and  		board by enabling clients to remain in the community. As can be seen in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>,  		the costs of room and board for clients in the community can be large: Corson  		et al. (1986) estimated that, in the absence of channeling, over $4,000 per  		person would have been spent during the observation period for housing, food,  		clothing, utilities, and the other costs of living in the community.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Housing accounts for over half of these costs. The housing cost  		estimates include the costs for private residences, public housing, and the  		homes of friends, relatives, and others with whom the clients live rent-free.  		They also include the costs of residences such as supportive housing and  		personal care homes (and the services provided by these facilities). In all  		cases, Corson et al. attempted to estimate actual resource costs, not just  		expenditures. Thus, the estimates do not necessarily represent out-of-pocket  		expenditures for housing, but rather the amount of housing resources used by  		clients. These estimates were derived by multiplying estimates of use for each  		housing type (based on interview data) by the estimated cost of each type of  		housing (based on interviews, provider records, and published unit-cost  		information).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The bulk of the other costs of living in the community are for food, but  		they also include estimated expenditures for clothing, transportation, and a  		small amount of personal consumption. These costs are estimated from the lower  		budget estimates developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982) for an  		elderly couple living in an urban area.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note29">29</a></font></sup> For those persons who lived in supportive  		housing or personal care homes, we did not include an additional estimate of  		the costs of food.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The impact estimates presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a>  		and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a> indicate that channeling had almost no  		effect on expenditures for community room and board. This is not surprising  		since channeling did not have any noticeable effect on mortality or community  		residence, the two primary mechanisms that would have led to an increase in  		costs for community room and board. Thus, we conclude that these costs play  		almost no role in the assessment of the benefits and costs of channeling,  		despite their importance in total living, medical, and long term care costs for  		controls.</p>
<h3>E. ALTERNATIVE CASE MANAGEMENT</h3>
<p>Channeling was fielded in communities that already provided a range of  		long term care services, including case management. This is clear from the  		estimates of formal community service use by control group members. It is also  		evident in the data on the use of separate case management (Brown and Phillips,  		1986). These data show that as many as 62 percent of the control group members  		in the basic sites and 74 percent of control group members in the financial  		control sites received some sort of case management service; much of it,  		however, related to the delivery of direct services and was much less  		comprehensive than channeling's.</p>
<p>Channeling substituted (at least partially) for these alternative  		sources of case management. Therefore, reductions in the use of such services  		are treated as benefits (offsets to costs) in the benefit-cost analysis. As  		noted in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>, we are evaluating the net cost of  		offering channeling services in addition to those already available in the  		community.</p>
<p>The estimates of formal community services undoubtedly include some  		costs for case management. Much of the case management in the existing system  		is provided, and paid for, in conjunction with the delivery of direct services.  		Home health aides, nurses, and staff from other formal service providers offer  		a range of assessment and care planning services. In addition, hospital  		discharge planners provide case management assistance. The costs of such  		services are included in the costs of formal community and hospital care. Thus,  		our estimates of expenditures for formal community care and hospital  		expenditures capture (at least conceptually) all the costs of alternative case  		management except for those of agencies which provide case management as a  		separate service. Data used in the other parts of the analysis have excluded  		case management costs when they were identified separately from the other  		service costs. We analyze all such separate case management costs in this  		section.</p>
<p>The control group members did not use a substantial amount of separately  		identifiable case management services. We estimate that in the basic case  		management sites, expenditures for such services were worth about $200 per  		client over the 18-month observation period. Expenditures on such services in  		the financial control sites were somewhat more, approximately $240 per client.  		These relatively low values primarily reflect the low rate of use of separate  		case management services. When such services were received, we estimate that  		they could have been substantial (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>).</p>
<p>These estimates are relatively uncertain. As described in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>, our data on case management provided as a  		separate service indicate only whether a person received these services. Thus,  		we do not have data on the actual amount of case management services received.  		As a result, we had to estimate expenditures for these services by multiplying  		an estimate of the fraction of controls receiving case management as a separate  		service by an estimate of the average cost per recipient of such  		services.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note31">31</a></font></sup> The  		estimates of use were obtained from provider records data; the cost estimates  		were based on several assumptions about the intensity and duration of the case  		management services.</p>
<p>There is some uncertainty in our estimates of use because they are based  		on the relatively small provider records sample. This data set contained only  		about 20 percent of the observations included in the sample of individuals who  		completed followup interviews, but it did accurately identify case management  		provided as a separate service. Interview data were available for a much larger  		sample, but they indicate only whether a sample member received services from  		at least one of a list of comprehensive case management agencies. Thus, the  		advantages of the larger sample are offset to some extent by the greater  		imprecision in the data. In any event, both the provider records and interview  		data indicate the same general level of use (<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>  		presents, for both data sets, estimates of the fraction of control group  		members receiving alternative case management services). Therefore, we feel  		that the uncertainty over the incidence of alternative case management is less  		important than that due to our lack of data on the intensity and duration of  		those services.</p>
<p>To assess the implications of our lack of data on service intensity and  		duration, we used several alternative methods for estimating the costs of this  		case management. At one extreme, we assumed that all separate case management  		was just as intensive and continuous as the basic model of  		channeling.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note32">32</a></font></sup> Given the  		comprehensive and intensive nature of channeling, this assumption is likely to  		yield an upper bound on the costs of alternative case management (provided as a  		separate service). At the other extreme, we assumed that the alternative case  		management was just a single care planning visit, with a cost of $150 per  		person served. These two unit-cost estimates imply a range of estimated savings  		due to foregone alternative case management (as a separate service) of $53 to  		$284 per client in the basic model and $68 to $355 per client in the financial  		control model. In either of these cases, the change from our impact estimate is  		not large enough to alter our basic conclusion about the benefits and costs of  		channeling.</p>
<h3>F. NURSING HOME USE</h3>
<p>One of the key hypotheses underlying the demonstration was that  		channeling would reduce nursing home use and expenditures and, to a lesser  		degree, hospital use and expenditures by the appropriate substitution of  		community-based services. As Wooldridge and Schore (1986) point out, the  		primary impact was expected to be a reduction in the proportion of clients  		entering a nursing home as a permanent place of residence through the provision  		of community care services that would either eliminate the need for or delay  		nursing home entry. In addition, channeling was expected to reduce short-term  		convalescent stays in nursing homes (and hospitals) by arranging for community  		care that was less costly. Some increased nursing home use was expected to  		occur for individuals who would be more appropriately cared for in a nursing  		home than in a hospital or in the community. Overall, however, channeling was  		expected to reduce nursing home use and, hence, expenditures.</p>
<p>The nursing home analysis was restricted to settings in which medical  		care was provided--namely, intermediate care facilities (ICFs) and skilled  		nursing facilities (SNFs).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note33">33</a></font></sup> The data collection strategy for nursing  		home data was predicated on the assumption that Medicaid and private sources  		would be the primary payors (Medicare covers only skilled nursing stays).</p>
<p>Expenditures were estimated for each six-month period after  		randomization. In the first two periods Medicaid and Medicare records were used  		to estimate the expenditures for persons covered by Medicaid throughout the  		period. For other persons, expenditures were estimated using data collected  		from their nursing homes (through the provider records extract data collection  		effort) and from Medicare records.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note34">34</a></font></sup> In the third six-month period, only Medicaid  		and Medicare data were available; provider records data were not collected. As  		a result, there were only the limited cost data for Medicare (which cover only  		specific types of nursing home stays) available to estimate costs for persons  		not covered by Medicaid.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that we included all nursing home costs for the third  		six-month period week, we had to use an alternative, two-step estimation  		strategy (described fully in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendE">Appendix E</a>). This  		alternative began by calculating, for the second six-month period, the ratio of  		nursing home expenditures (estimated from all data sources) to nursing home  		days reported in the interviews. This average expenditure per reported home day  		was then multiplied by the average number of nursing home reported in the  		interviews for the third six-month period. This alternative should produce a  		reasonably accurate estimate of nursing home expenditures per client in the  		third period, but is subject to greater uncertainty than the estimates for  		earlier periods that were based entirely on records data.</p>
<p>As Wooldridge and Schore (1986) report, although the demonstration  		intended to enroll a sample at high risk of institutionalization, the control  		group's institutionalization rate was only slightly higher than that of the  		general population of this age profile and frailty. Nevertheless, treatment  		group members did have lower average nursing home use and expenditures than  		control group members, although few of the estimated impacts were statistically  		significant. As was indicated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>, over the 18-month observation period the  		control group's average total nursing home expenditures were worth roughly  		$2,400 in both models. Wooldridge and Schore estimated that channeling led to  		average per-person savings over that 18-month period worth roughly $280 in the  		basic case management model and $120 in the financial control model (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table  		II.5</a>)--savings that accounted only for about 10 to 23 percent of the costs  		of providing the channeling case management services. This result is counter to  		the expectation that reductions in nursing home expenditures would be the  		principal savings generated by channeling.</p>
<p>A number of sensitivity tests were performed in order to examine the  		robustness of these estimates. They included an examination of monthly impact  		estimates, alternative regression models, and different functional forms of the  		outcome variable. These tests yielded estimated impacts on expenditures that  		were similar to those presented here.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note35">35</a></font></sup> Thus, we are confident about the nursing  		home findings we have, presented.</p>
<h3>G. HOSPITAL SERVICE USE</h3>
<p>Channeling was also expected to reduce hospital use and, consequently,  		hospital expenditures. In addition to arranging for community-based  		convalescent care (or nursing home care) in lieu of similar care provided in  		hospitals, channeling was expected to reduce hospital use by improving both  		access to health-related services and monitoring of clients' health in order to  		identify health problems before they became more serious. Alternatively, this  		monitoring of clients' health could lead to increased hospital use, if serious  		health problems were more readily identified. In addition, a decrease in  		nursing home use, as hypothesized above, might lead to an increase in the use  		of hospitals for the treatment of ailments that would otherwise be handled  		routinely by nursing homes. On balance, however, channeling was expected to  		reduce hospital use.</p>
<p>Channeling enrolled a sample with levels of hospital use and  		expenditures that were remarkably higher than those of the general aging  		population, and indeed were consistent with samples of persons in their last  		year of life (Wooldridge and Schore, 1986). Over the 18 months following  		randomization, the average total hospital expenditures from all sources for  		control group members were worth approximately $6,600 in the basic model and  		$9,300 in the financial control model (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a>  		and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Under both the basic and financial control models, Wooldridge and Schore  		concluded that there was a very small (and not statistically significant)  		increase in average hospital expenditures for clients. This increase was  		estimated to be worth approximately $200 per client (a 3 percent increase)  		under the basic case management model and $30 per client (less than a 1 percent  		increase) under the financial control model. Given the overall level of  		expenditures observed for clients, changes of this magnitude are relatively  		unimportant.</p>
<h3>H. OTHER COVERED MEDICAL SERVICES</h3>
<p>Other covered medical services include the following services when  		covered by Medicare and Medicaid: services provided by physicians and other  		independent practitioners; outpatient, clinic, and HMO services; and  		laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy, and other miscellaneous services not received  		while in a hospital or nursing home. The hypotheses surrounding the impact of  		channeling on the consumption of these medical services are strongly tied to  		those presented above for hospital use. If channeling was instrumental in  		reducing hospital use, then we would expect an increase in the use of  		outpatient and other ambulatory services. In addition, if channeling case  		managers identified health problems early and encouraged preventative physician  		visits, we would expect an increase in physician use. On the other hand, the  		amount of physician attention while in the hospital would decline if hospital  		admissions and days were reduced; thus, a reduction in physician use could  		result as an indirect effect of reduced hospital use. On balance, however, the  		expectation was that if channeling increased the percent of people in the  		community, the use of and expenditures for other medical services would also  		increase.</p>
<p>Control group means presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a> indicate that, in the absence of  		channeling, treatment group members in the basic and financial control models  		would have used, on average, approximately $2,000 and $2.900, respectively,  		worth of other medical services over the 18-month period following  		randomization.</p>
<p>Note that these dollar amounts understate the total costs for other  		medical services. Because Medicare and Medicaid claims records were the sole  		sources of data for this analysis, only services that were covered by these  		programs were included in the analysis. Thus, our expenditure estimates  		underrepresent personal and family expenditures for uncovered services and for  		services for which the physician did not accept assignment of benefits, billing  		the patient for the excess beyond the Medicare payment.</p>
<p>The exact magnitude of our underestimate is unknown. We did capture some  		private costs, since we included deductibles and copayments payable by clients  		who were not Medicaid covered. However, data from the National Health Care  		Expenditures Study suggest that total payments from sources other than Medicare  		and Medicaid may account for the majority of the physician and other medical  		service expenditures when such services are provided in an ambulatory setting.  		Berk and Schur (1985) found that in 1977 Medicare and Medicaid paid for only 32  		percent of the expenditures for ambulatory nonphysician services incurred by  		persons age 65 and older who had such expenditures. Similarly, Wilensky and  		Bernstein (1983) found that the corresponding fraction for physician services  		was 42 percent. However, these rates probably overstate the amount of error for  		our sample, since a large part of physician expenditures for the channeling  		sample were probably for inpatient care where assignment rates are higher than  		for office visits (Burney and Schieber, 1985). Thus, we have probably captured  		between 40 and 60 percent of the total costs for all (covered and uncovered)  		other medical services.</p>
<p>This potential error means that our estimates of total control group  		expenditures (<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>) are too low. The estimates of net cost,  		however, are probably not seriously affected, since Wooldridge and Schore  		concluded that treatment group members did not consume significantly more of  		these services over the 18-month period after randomization than they would  		have in the absence of channeling. They found virtually no effect under the  		financial control model. Under the basic model, they found an increase in  		average total expenditures per client over the 18-month period worth  		approximately $140 (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a>). Thus, even if we  		captured only half of the total other medical service costs, the total increase  		in costs for such medical services would probably constitute a small portion of  		the total increase in living, medical, and long term care costs.</p>
<h3>I. SOCIAL SECURITY AND TRANSFER PAYMENTS</h3>
<p>Social Security (specifically, the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability  		Insurance Program, OASDI) was the major source of income for the channeling  		clients. At baseline, these benefits accounted for 85 percent of total income.  		Over the 18 months following randomization, these benefits were worth over  		$5,700 per client. While channeling was not expected to affect these benefits,  		it is useful to examine them in the context of judging clients' ability to pay  		for the needed medical, living, and long term care services. The same argument  		holds for Veterans pensions, although they account for a much smaller fraction  		of income.</p>
<p>In contrast, channeling was expected to increase transfer payments from  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and food stamps, which together were worth  		approximately $575 per client during our observation period. First, these  		transfer payments are generally contingent on the recipient's living in the  		community. Thus, they could be increased if channeling reduced nursing home use  		and increased community residence. Second, channeling case managers could  		inform clients about and assist them in applying for these transfer programs.  		Finally, transfer payments would also increase if clients lived longer, thereby  		increasing the time during which they could receive transfers.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note37">37</a></font></sup> A channeling-induced increase  		in public transfers would be paid for by the government, and would represent an  		increase in income available to clients and their families.</p>
<p>The evaluation found virtually no impacts on mortality and community  		residence. As we might expect, then, there was virtually no observed  		differences between average transfer payments received by treatment group  		members and those received by the control group.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note38">38</a></font></sup> The specific point estimates (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a>)  		were increases of approximately 1 percent over the amount of transfers received  		by control group members. Thus, the impact of channeling on transfer payments  		does not play a major role in our assessment of the costs and benefits of  		channeling.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note39">39</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>J. CLIENT LIFE-QUALITY</h3>
<p>One of the major premises of the demonstration was that the expansion of  		community-based long term care alternatives would result in a better life for  		the channeling clients. Although there have been numerous studies of  		well-being, it remains a difficult concept to measure. After surveying the  		literature, the evaluation adopted a broad measurement approach that examined  		several indicators of life quality. The approach assumes that impacts on life  		quality are captured indirectly through their effects on these' indicators.  		This approach is organized around four dimensions: (1) longevity; (2) service  		and environmental conditions facing clients in the community; (3) social and  		psychological well-being; and (4) functioning.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In general, estimates of the various life quality indicators suggest  		that channeling did improve service and environmental conditions (reducing  		unmet needs and improving satisfaction with service and housing conditions) and  		global life satisfaction, a measure included in the social/psychological  		well-being dimension. Significant impacts were generally small to moderate in  		magnitude but, on average, represented proportionally large improvements in  		quality of life when compared with that reported by control group members. In  		the financial control model, there was also an unexpected and contrary effect:  		treatment group members reported being more disabled on the ADL tasks.  		Channeling impacts across all these dimensions of client life quality are  		described below; the control group means and estimated impacts for many of  		these measures are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendE">Appendix E</a>.</p>
<p>In assessing the performance of the two channeling models it is  		important to note that there were no substantial differences by model in  		longevity, unmet needs, general social/psychological well-being, satisfaction  		with service arrangements, or confidence about receiving needed services. As a  		result, it seems that the higher net costs of the financial control model did  		not produce a measured difference in client well-being.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Longevity</b></i></p>
<p>Mortality is a central element in quality of life. It also affects all  		the other elements in the benefit-cost analysis through its indirect effects on  		service use. In the evaluation, mortality was measured using death rates and  		survival days.</p>
<p>Wooldridge and Schore (1986) found that channeling had little effect on  		mortality. This is not surprising given that channeling did not affect nursing  		home use or the use of health-related services, the principal mechanisms by  		which channeling might affect mortality. This conclusion is the same regardless  		of whether mortality is measured using death rates or survival days. Given the  		size of the sample and the variety of procedures used in this analysis, we feel  		quite confident of this conclusion.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Unmet Needs, Satisfaction with Care, and Physical Environment  		</b></i></p>
<p>The measures of unmet needs used in this analysis were based on whether  		the respondent reported needing help with any of eight major tasks of daily  		living with which a channeling-eligible individual could be expected to need  		assistance on a regular basis: transfer, dressing, toileting, bathing, meal  		preparation, housekeeping, transportation, and medical treatments. Under both  		models the treatment group reported significantly fewer unmet needs than did  		the control group.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note41">41</a></font></sup>  		For example, at 12 months after randomization, total scores on the 8-item  		measure under both models were approximately 20 percent lower for the treatment  		group (a difference of about one-third of one unmet need). This reduction in  		unmet needs relative to the control group also existed at 18 months, although  		it was no longer statistically significant.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Followup respondents were also asked about their satisfaction with  		service arrangements for four services (housework, meals, laundry, and  		shopping).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note43">43</a></font></sup> On  		average, treatment group members were significantly more satisfied, despite the  		fact that control group members reported a high level of satisfaction with  		service arrangements (only between 7 and 13 percent of the control group  		reported being dissatisfied).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note44">44</a></font></sup> These treatment/control differences were  		relatively small in size, although in certain categories (such as those  		reporting to be dissatisfied) impacts represented large proportional  		differences (30-50 percent reductions) in those dissatisfied with service  		arrangements.</p>
<p>A checklist of six key environmental problems observed by the  		interviewer in the respondent's house was used as the measure of physical  		hazards in the client's community residence.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note45">45</a></font></sup> Under the basic model, treatment group  		members were found to have significantly fewer hazards than control group  		members at 12 months. This small difference (0.11 hazards) represents a 41  		percent reduction in the number of observed hazards compared with basic model  		control group members. No significant differences were observed between  		treatment and control group members in the financial control model sites.</p>
<p><i><b>3. Social/Psychological Well-Being</b></i></p>
<p>The investigation of social/psychological well-being indicated that  		channeling had small effects on client satisfaction--greater confidence in  		receiving needed services, more satisfaction with service arrangements for  		housecleaning, meals, laundry, and shopping, and more satisfaction with their  		life generally.</p>
<p>There were generally no impacts on other reported measures of  		social/psychological well-being: reported happiness, attitudes toward  		loneliness, social contacts, self-perceived health, concern about health, and  		contentment. There were, however, two exceptions to this general result under  		the basic model. Both were indications of improved social/psychological  		well-being at 12 months; at that time, treatment group members reported more  		positive attitudes toward aging and less loneliness than did control group  		members (differences that were statistically significant).</p>
<p><i><b>4. Functioning</b></i></p>
<p>There were essentially no impacts on functioning for the basic model  		(with the exception of an impact on bathing at 12 months). In the financial  		control model, there were no impacts on IADL or restricted days. There was,  		however, a statistically significant impact on the ADL measure under the  		financial control model: on average, treatment group members reported being  		more disabled than control group members at 6 and 12 months. There are two  		possible explanations for this result, both related to service use but with  		very different substantive implications. The first is the possibility that  		increased formal service use induced to some degree the kind of atrophy effect  		on functioning which has been reported to occur as a result of  		institutionalization. The second is that the result is an artifact of the way  		we asked the question about ADL functioning of sample members ("do you?" rather  		than "can you?"), which led to more "no" answers by those sample members who  		received more formal services, without any real differences in functional  		ability. We cannot distinguish between these two possibilities based on our  		impact data.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.K" id="sectionIII.K">K. INFORMAL CARE</a></h3>
<p>Channeling expected to affect the behavior and well-being of informal  		caregivers--those persons who provided care to clients on an informal, unpaid  		basis. The case managers were expected to help these caregivers maintain their  		efforts by arranging for needed services, including respite care for the  		caregivers. These services were expected to add to those already provided by  		informal caregivers and to reinforce the informal support network. Thus, there  		might be some substitution of formal for informal services, but it was hoped  		that this would enable informal caregivers to continue providing care for a  		longer time.</p>
<p>Christianson (1986) found a great deal of informal care provided to  		sample members. During the 18-month observation period, approximately 85  		percent of control group members living in the community received informal  		care, with the average caregiving network having about two members. Most of  		these control group members received help with housework, laundry, or shopping  		(76 to 81 percent) and with meal preparation (65 to 71 percent). Informal help  		with therapy and medical treatments was reported the least frequently (less  		than 5 percent). Sample members received about three visits a week, on average,  		from visiting caregivers, who spent about six to nine hours a week in providing  		care.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note46">46</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In analyzing the efforts of these caregivers, we distinguished between  		the individuals identified by the sample members as being the primary informal  		caregiver (typically spouses and daughters) and all other informal caregivers  		(typically neighbors and friends). Data about all services provided informally  		were collected directly from the sample members (or proxy respondents). In  		addition, detailed data about the caregiving services and financial assistance  		provided by the primary caregiver were obtained in interviews with those  		caregivers. Thus, we have a broad overall picture of the informal services  		received by sample members and a narrower, but more detailed, picture of the  		primary persons providing this care.</p>
<p>It is important to note that providing care, on an informal basis, can  		generate both benefits and costs to the caregiver. The costs are quite clear.  		Over the 18-month observation period, Christianson (1986) found that, on days  		that they helped, primary caregivers devoted two to three hours a day to  		caregiving activities and an additional two hours to socializing with the  		sample member.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note47">47</a></font></sup> About  		30 to 40 percent of the primary caregivers to non-spouse control group members  		also provided financial assistance, averaging about $190 a month per caregiver  		providing the assistance (not including in-kind assistance, such as gifts of  		food or clothing, which were probably substantial). In addition, slightly more  		than half of the primary caregivers to control group members living in the  		community reported limitations in their social lives due to caregiving (very  		few reported any limitations with respect to employment), and roughly  		one-quarter reported that they experienced severe emotional stress.  		Approximately one-third of these primary caregivers also reported  		dissatisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p>The benefits from caregiving are less tangible. They pertain to  		satisfaction from caring for a loved one or close friend and a desire to  		fulfill a social obligation to provide such care.</p>
<p>The benefit-cost analysis focuses on the net change in these benefits  		and costs as indicated by the change in the reported well-being of primary  		caregivers. We also considered the changes in time spent and the extent to  		which formal services were substituted for informal ones. However, we have not  		assigned a dollar value to this substitution due to a lack of data on secondary  		caregivers and the difficulty in valuing such volunteer time.</p>
<p>In general, the inability to value the substitution is not a serious  		drawback, since there is very little evidence that channeling resulted in any  		substitution of formal services for informal care provided by primary  		caregivers. Specifically, there was no evidence that channeling had any effect  		on the overall provision of care by primary caregivers.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note48">48</a></font></sup> The results do suggest that channeling led  		to some concentration of care into certain care areas, such as the arrangement  		of services or benefits and help with eating and certain other personal care  		tasks. A possible explanation for this is that the increased provision of  		formal services allowed primary caregivers more time for tasks not readily  		performed by formal providers.</p>
<p>There also was no evidence that channeling under the basic case  		management model led to a substitution of formal services for care provided by  		visiting caregivers (friends and neighbors), although channeling under the  		financial control model did lead to minor reductions in certain services  		provided by friends and neighbors (who, it should be noted, provided a small  		amount of total informal care in any case).</p>
<p>There did appear to be impacts on the reported well-being of the primary  		informal caregivers. As with the life quality of the clients, the evaluation  		measured impacts on caregiver well-being by examining changes in a number of  		variables thought to be good indicators of well-being. These indicators  		included reductions in stress-producing factors such as: personal and  		employment limitations, objectionable behavior by the sample member (for  		example, yelling at the caregiver or refusing to cooperate), sleep  		interruptions due to caregiving, worry about obtaining sufficient care for the  		sample member, satisfaction with service arrangements, and general emotional,  		physical, and financial strain.</p>
<p>Christianson (1986) found that channeling improved the well-being of  		primary caregivers according to some of these indicators (estimates are  		presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendE">Appendix E</a>). Under both models, the percent  		of primary caregivers reporting serious privacy and social limitations  		declined. Both channeling models also increased caregiver satisfaction with  		care arrangements. Finally, it appeared to increase the overall life  		satisfaction expressed by primary caregivers. There was, however, no indication  		that channeling reduced caregiver perceptions of emotional, physical, or  		financial strain or perceptions of the prevalence of serious objectionable  		behavior exhibited by sample members.</p>
<p>In many instances, there were sizable changes in the indicators of  		well-being. For example, under the basic case management model at 6 months,  		there was a 50 percent reduction in the percent of caregivers reporting that  		restrictions on privacy imposed by caregiving were a serious problem (5.7  		percent of the treatment group caregivers compared with 11 percent of the  		control group caregivers reported a serious problem). Similarly, 22 percent of  		control group caregivers in the basic case management sites at 6 models  		reported limits on social life to be a serious problem, compared with 16  		percent of treatment group caregivers (a reduction of 27 percent).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note49">49</a></font></sup> Impacts at 12 months were  		generally in the same direction but were not significant, possibly indicating  		that channeling had a strong early effect on caregiver perceptions which  		diminished over time.</p>
<p>Channeling also increased caregiver satisfaction with both formal and  		informal care arrangements. At both 6 and 12 months under the financial control  		model the percent of treatment group caregivers reporting they were very  		satisfied with care arrangements was significantly larger than that for control  		group caregivers. For example, at 6 months, roughly 37 percent of caregivers to  		control group members reported being very satisfied with care arrangements,  		compared with 51 percent of treatment group caregivers; this difference of 14  		percentage points represents a 38 percent increase in the percent reporting  		themselves very satisfied.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note50">50</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, under the financial control model at 12 months, 76 percent more  		treatment group caregivers than control group caregivers reported being  		completely satisfied with their lives (17.4 percent of caregivers to treatment  		group members reported being completely satisfied, compared with 9.9 percent of  		control group caregivers). Also under this model at 12 months, there was an  		accompanying decrease in caregivers reporting that their lives were not very  		satisfying.</p>
<p>While estimated impacts on some indicators of well-being suggest that  		channeling did improve caregiver well-being under both models, there is some  		uncertainty about the strength of this conclusion to the extent that the  		concept and indicators of well-being are difficult to define and measure. Other  		indicators of well-being included in the analysis (such as emotional strain due  		to giving care), which we might expect to be correlated with those that were  		affected by channeling, did not appear to change as a result of the  		intervention. However, none of the measures indicated that channeling  		significantly reduced caregiver well-being. Thus, although life quality remains  		a concept that is difficult to measure, it seems clear that the channeling  		intervention did improve caregiver well-being.</p>
<h2><a name="net" id="net">IV. NET COSTS AFTER THE OBSERVATION PERIOD</a></h2>
<p>Thus far, we have examined only the outcomes observed during the 18  		months following randomization. As the accounting framework indicates, such a  		time-limited analysis is incomplete since it ignores the outcomes that occur  		after the observation period. In order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the  		net costs of channeling, we now turn to these longer range outcomes. This  		analysis, with its focus on future net costs, indicates the magnitude of the  		net financial commitment that would be made to persons enrolled in an ongoing  		channeling program.</p>
<p>Future costs will be determined by the types of services that clients  		use and the costs of those services. We can expect both the pattern of use and  		cost to change over time. Use will change depending on the mortality rate and  		decisions about using nursing home, hospital, and community services. Such  		changes in the pattern of use will affect average costs, and, in addition,  		channeling may directly affect the costs of some services by negotiating more  		favorable rates with service providers.</p>
<p>The analysis of these factors is made difficult because these future  		trends are unobserved. We can assess their magnitude only by extrapolating the  		trends observed during the first 18 months, a process that is obviously much  		less certain than the analysis of the observed outcomes discussed earlier.</p>
<p>The 18-month observation period provides only a limited basis for  		estimating future expenditures and service use. In some cases, the data set  		contained only three observations over the 18 months. Given all the factors  		that influenced sample members' expenditures and service use over this period,  		three observations are insufficient for projecting long-range patterns of  		use.</p>
<p>As a result, we have confined our analysis to an assessment of the  		potential magnitude of future costs and the implications of changes in key  		parameters. Rather than make specific point estimates of future costs, we have  		estimated them under a variety of alternative assumptions about mortality,  		rates of use for hospital and nursing homes, and the effects of channeling on  		average expenditures. While none of these estimates has any special validity as  		a point estimate of future costs, together they indicate how these various  		factors interact to determine future costs and the general magnitude of those  		costs.</p>
<p>There are four general conclusions from this analysis.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The value of future social costs (i.e., costs excluding Social  			 Security, SSI, and food stamp payments) under both models of channeling is  			 likely to be large. However, the value of <b>net</b> future social costs due to  			 channeling is probably of the same general magnitude as net social costs  			 observed during the first 18 months. Thus, in the basic case management model,  			 <b>total net costs</b> of channeling are likely to be around $2,350 per client  			 (compared with $1,300 for the first 18 months), while in the financial control  			 model they are likely to be around $8,200 per client (compared with $3,400 for  			 the first 18 months).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimates of the distribution of future net costs between the  			 government and clients are more uncertain than those of aggregate social net  			 costs. Nevertheless, if the patterns observed for the first 18 months persist,  			 clients would save some additional expenses (primarily for formal community  			 services), and future net costs to the government would be somewhat greater  			 than the total social costs summarized above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacts on mortality and the use of nursing home, hospital, and  			 community services must be considered simultaneously. These factors interact  			 over time, with savings in one area often implying costs in another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if channeling had a delayed effect that reduced the use of  			 nursing homes, it is extremely unlikely that such an effect would be large  			 enough to offset the net costs incurred during the first 18 months.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Thus, our analysis of future costs suggests that the basic conclusions  		from the 18-month observation period would probably not be changed by the  		inclusion of future outcomes. However, these future costs are likely to be  		quite important for budgeting channeling-like programs.</p>
<p>We begin our analysis by examining the average cost of providing care to  		persons in nursing homes, hospitals, and the community, and the effect of  		channeling on these expenditures during the observation period. These estimates  		provide the basis for the analysis of future costs, and provide a useful  		perspective on the impacts of channeling during the observation period. We then  		turn to the alternative assumptions about future patterns of use and the  		resulting estimates of future average expenditures.</p>
<h3>A. DAILY COSTS FOR NURSING HOMES, HOSPITALS, AND THE  		COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>We estimated average daily costs per client in two parts. The first  		included the direct costs for nursing home, hospital, and community services,  		as these services were defined in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>. The  		second part included the costs of the associated covered physician services and  		other covered medical goods and services. This second part was necessary in  		order to allocate the costs of the other covered services between hospital,  		nursing home, and community service costs.</p>
<p>The average direct cost per client per day of being in a nursing home  		was estimated by Wooldridge and Schore (1986, Chapter IV). They used  		expenditure and use data from Medicare, Medicaid, and provider records data to  		estimate these costs. During months 7 to 12, the last period for which we have  		complete expenditure records data, the sample members in nursing homes incurred  		average costs of approximately $50 per day in the basic case management model  		sites, and $54 per day in the financial control model sites.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, Wooldridge and Schore estimated the average direct cost of a  		day in the hospital. These costs were found to be just over $300 in both  		models.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note52">52</a></font></sup> There was no  		evidence that these costs were affected by channeling.</p>
<p>The costs of a day in the community include several factors: formal  		community services, community room and board, and case management provided by  		channeling or other agencies.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note53">53</a></font></sup> The average costs per client for these  		community services were discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>. In  		order to estimate the average cost per client per day in the community, we  		divided the estimated average community-service costs per client by the average  		number of days clients spent in the community.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note54">54</a></font></sup> These costs clearly were affected by  		channeling. Case management and formal community services, in particular, are  		much greater under channeling. Thus, we made two estimates of the average daily  		costs for community residence: one corresponding to channeling and the other  		pertaining to costs in the absence of channeling. These procedures are  		described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these direct costs of nursing home, hospital, and  		community services, we added the costs for covered physician and other medical  		services. These other costs were estimated by Wooldridge and Schore (Chapter  		VI). We allocated these costs among community, nursing home, and hospital costs  		by assuming that all nonphysician other medical costs (for example, costs for  		podiatrist, pharmacy, and outpatient services) were incurred by persons in the  		community and that the physician costs should be allocated according to the  		distribution of Medicare service expenditures.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note55">55</a></font></sup> These allocations are also described in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting estimated daily rates are shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableIV.1">Table IV.1</a> (Appendix <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.2">Table D.2</a>  		provides a disaggregation of these estimates into their components). The  		estimates reflect the general pattern of impacts already discussed in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>. They  		indicate that, under the basic case management model, channeling appeared to  		increase average daily costs for persons in the community by $3 (11 percent),  		to approximately $27. Under the financial control model, with its higher  		expenditures for formal community services, the average daily cost for  		channeling clients in the community was over $37. This represents an increase  		of more than $11 (approximately 43 percent) over the daily costs in the absence  		of channeling. Most of this difference is due to differences in the  		expenditures for formal community services: average daily expenditures for  		these services in the financial control model were almost twice those in the  		basic case management model. Estimated average expenditures for housing and  		food were about the same under the two models, approximately $12 to $13 per  		day, and they accounted for a substantial fraction of total community  		expenditures: 48 percent under the basic case management model and 39 percent  		under the financial control model.</p>
<p>The cost estimates in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableIV.1">Table IV.1</a> also indicate  		that the average daily cost of serving persons who live in the community is  		substantially below the cost of serving persons who live in nursing homes. This  		is true even with the extra services provided by channeling. Under the basic  		case management model, the average daily cost of serving the persons living in  		the community was just slightly more than half that of serving the persons who  		were in nursing homes. Under the financial control model, the higher costs of  		serving persons in the community made the difference smaller, but costs for  		persons in the community were still only 68 percent of those for persons in  		nursing homes.</p>

</tr></table><p>These differences reflect the different costs of providing services in  		institutional and community settings, as well as the potentially different  		service needs of persons in these two settings.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note56">56</a></font></sup> The estimates presented here indicate the  		overall difference in average expenditures potentially due to both these  		reasons. This implies that efforts to substitute community services for those  		provided by nursing homes are unlikely to achieve savings equal to the full  		difference in these daily rates. We return to this issue in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a>.</p>
<p>In estimating future expenditures, we have assumed that channeling did  		not affect the average daily rates for hospital and nursing homes. This  		reflects the findings of Wooldridge and Schore. It also helps to simplify the  		estimation process and clarify the effects of changes in the key parameters  		determining future expenditures (i.e., differences in future costs can be  		attributed to factors other than small differences in the average expenditures  		for hospital and nursing home days).</p>
<h3>B. ESTIMATES OF AVERAGE FUTURE EXPENDITURES</h3>
<p>The method for estimating future costs begins by estimating the expected  		number of days that sample members will spend, on average, in nursing homes,  		hospitals, and the community. Future costs are then estimated by multiplying  		the number of days estimates by their appropriate daily cost estimate and then  		summing the results. In this way, shifts in the use of these broad service  		types can be taken into account, although the method fails to capture some  		changes in the mix of services that clients use while in a hospital, nursing  		home, or the community.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note57">57</a></font></sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a> documents  		these procedures in more detail.</p>
<p>In all these calculations, we have used a ten-year time horizon. This  		period was chosen because it reflects the general life expectancy of sample  		members and is also a common planning horizon. Under our assumptions about  		mortality, which are described below, virtually all of the sample members would  		be expected to have died by the end of this period (11.5 years after  		randomization). We feel that this time horizon will yield estimates that  		indicate the general magnitude of future costs and the interactions of the  		underlying factors, although we recognize that the choice of a time horizon is  		somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>The calculations also discount all dollar values back to the time of  		enrollment in channeling using a 5 percent real annual discount rate. In  		addition, all dollar values in these calculations are expressed in 1984  		dollars. These procedures assure that the value of future costs can be directly  		compared with the estimates of costs for the observation period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note58">58</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In general, the available data are insufficient for us to make precise  		estimates of future trends in the use of community, nursing home, and hospital  		services (an uncertain process even with a wealth of data). As a result, we  		have made several sets of assumptions that reflect the general experience of  		the demonstration. By considering these alternatives we can assess the impact  		of changing specific assumptions about the average expenditures for the  		different types of services or about mortality, nursing home, and  		hospitalization rates. As mentioned at the outset, these estimates are  		illustrative, and should be interpreted as reasonable ranges rather than as  		valid point estimates of actual future costs.</p>
<p>In all, we consider five sets of alternative assumptions. The first set  		of assumptions examines the general magnitude of the future costs that would be  		incurred in the absence of channeling. This set of assumptions is used as a  		benchmark for assessing the implications of alternative assumptions about  		channeling's future impacts. We estimated the future pattern of use by first  		estimating the expected average number of survival days for each six-month  		period after the end of the observation period. We then estimated how these  		survival days would be allocated between nursing homes, hospitals, and the  		community.</p>
<p>The starting point for these extrapolations was the distribution of the  		sample members across statuses (nursing home, hospital, community, or dead)  		that was observed at the end of the observation period. We used the  		distribution of the entire sample, rather than separate estimates for treatment  		and control group members, to reflect the conclusions of Wooldridge and Schore  		(1986), who found no evidence that channeling had an effect on mortality or  		place of residence. The extrapolation assumptions are described in more detail  		in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a> and are summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.3">Table D.3</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.4">Table D.4</a>.</p>
<p>We also had to make assumptions about the rates at which the  		probabilities of clients being in nursing homes, in hospitals, or dead would  		change over time.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note59">59</a></font></sup> In  		making these assumptions, we drew on the trends observed during the first 18  		months and on published data about general trends in use. Our intent was to  		develop a plausible set of assumptions that would serve to approximate the  		future trends that would occur in the research sample.</p>
<p>In all cases, we started with the rate of change observed for the last  		six months of the observation period (months 13 to 18). We then made several  		assumptions about how those rates would change. The death rate was assumed to  		increase over time at the same rate of increase observed for death rates in the  		U.S population between 85 and 95 years old. This rate is approximately 0.7  		percentage points every six months (American Council of Life Insurance,  		1983).</p>
<p>The rate at which survivors used nursing homes was assumed to continue  		the trend toward increasing nursing home use observed during the first 18  		months following randomization but a slower rate of increase. However, it  		appeared unlikely that the rapid growth in this rate over the observation  		period would continue (the number of nursing home days per 100 survival days  		increased over 175 percent in both models during that period). Thus, we assumed  		that the rate of increase would begin to decline over the extrapolation  		period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note60">60</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Finally, the rate of hospital use appeared to decline among survivors  		during the first 18 months.

Under the  		first set of assumptions, we calculated the average expenditures per client  		over the 10 years following the observation period in the absence of  		channeling. In the absence of channeling, these expenditures would have been  		over $26,000 (over the 10-year extrapolation period) per client enrolled in the  		basic case management sites. In the financial control sites, they would have  		been approximately $34,000. The difference in these estimates reflects the  		differences in the pattern of service use in the two sets of sites. The average  		daily expenditures for persons in the community and in nursing homes were  		higher for persons living in the financial control sites. Partially  		counteracting this expenditure difference was a tendency for clients in the  		basic case management sites to be more likely to be in a nursing home.</p>

</tr></table><p>Channeling can be expected to affect this situation in a number of ways.  		It will raise the costs of serving persons in the community and may alter the  		pattern of the use of community and institutional services (although the  		available evidence shows changes only in the pattern of community services). To  		see how future costs would be affected by channeling's impact on average  		expenditures for community services, we recalculated the 10-year costs under a  		second set of assumptions. This set maintained all of the initial assumptions,  		and in addition assumed that channeling increased average expenditures per day  		for persons in the community, as indicated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableIV.1">Table  		IV.1</a>.</p>
<p>Under this set of assumptions, channeling would increase the costs  		(relative to the costs in the absence of channeling) over our 10-year  		extrapolation period only by 4 percent (about $1,000 per client over the  		ten-year extrapolation period) under the basic case management model. Costs  		would be increased by more under the financial control model: approximately 14  		percent (about $4,800 per client).</p>
<p>In many ways this second set of assumptions is our best indication of  		the magnitude of the future social costs of channeling as it was fielded in the  		demonstration. It incorporates channeling's impact on average expenditures for  		community services, but assumes no effect on mortality or on the use of nursing  		homes or hospitals. In this case, future costs would be substantial, but future  		<b>net</b> costs (over the 10-year extrapolation period) under the basic case  		management model could be expected to be just 77 percent of those observed over  		the first 18 months. Thus, total net costs over the remaining lifetime of  		clients would be on the order of $2,350 per client (which is 77 percent more  		than the $1,328 per client observed for the first 18 months). Future net costs  		under the financial control model would be larger than those observed in the  		first 18 months. The $4,800 per client in estimated extra future costs would  		raise the total net cost of this model over the remaining lifetimes of clients  		to approximately $8,200 per client.</p>
<p>If channeling had a delayed effect that limited the rate at which future  		nursing home use increased, it could create additional savings. While we have  		no evidence that channeling would produce such an effect, we used a third set  		of assumptions to assess the implications of such an occurrence. This  		calculation indicates how changes in future nursing home use change future  		costs. Our specific assumption was that channeling had the effect of decreasing  		the <b>rate of change</b> in nursing home use by 25 percent (we maintained all  		the other assumptions of the first and second sets).</p>
<p>Under this third set of assumptions, channeling reduces future nursing  		home costs but increases future community costs relative to their expected  		values in the absence of channeling. Under both models, the estimated nursing  		home savings under this third scenario are relatively small when compared with  		the increased community costs. As a result, future net costs are not very  		different under this alternative than they were under the second alternative,  		which assumed that channeling did not affect nursing home use--suggesting that  		very large (and implausible) delayed effects on nursing home use would be  		required just to offset the future net increase in community costs.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note61">61</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Channeling might also reduce future hospital use by enabling persons to  		move more quickly into the community. We assessed the implications of such a  		delayed impact by using a fourth set of assumptions. Specifically, we assumed  		that channeling would enable clients to decrease their use of hospitals over  		time by one percentage point (by approximately 20 percent). We maintained all  		the other assumptions of the first two sets.</p>
<p>If channeling decreased future hospital use, as indicated in the fourth  		alternative, it could generate substantial savings. These savings would be  		nearly $2,000 per client under either model. Under the basic model, these  		savings would more than offset the costs of future increases in community  		services due to channeling, leaving a total net cost of only $450 per client  		for the combined observation and extrapolation periods. Under the financial  		control model, the hospital savings would be insufficient to offset even the  		future increases in community costs. Of course, we have no evidence of such a  		delayed effect on hospitals under either model. This analysis simply indicates  		that even modest reductions in the use of these high-cost services could  		produce substantial savings.</p>
<p>Finally, we can examine the implications of a delayed channeling impact  		on longevity. Changes in longevity will lead to an increased use of all  		services, and so will increase the net cost due to channeling. At the same  		time, we would expect greater longevity to produce additional benefits in life  		quality. The potential future costs of such a delayed effect can be assessed  		with the fifth alternative, which assumed that channeling decreased (by 25  		percent) the extent to which the death rate would increase in the future (all  		other assumptions of the first and second alternatives were maintained).</p>
<p>So far, our examination of future net costs has focused on social  		costs--that is, aggregate resource costs regardless of who pays for them. We  		are also interested in net costs to the government, particularly to the extent  		that channeling leads to any substitution of public for private expenditures.  		Such information is crucial for efforts to budget any channeling-like  		programs.</p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table  		II.3</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table  		II.5</a> indicated the estimated distribution of living, medical, and long term  		care costs between the government and clients. They showed that, for the  		18-month observation period, the government paid for the majority of these  		services for clients: approximately two-thirds of these costs for controls in  		the basic sites and approximately 72 percent of them in the financial control  		sites. In addition, most of the extra costs associated with channeling were  		paid for by the government. Thus, the general pattern of future government  		costs, including both total and net costs, is likely to follow closely the  		patterns estimated for social costs. Futhermore, if the general cost  		distribution persists, future government total and net costs will probably be  		somewhat larger than the corresponding future social costs.</p>
<p>This conclusion reflects two general observations. First, in addition to  		all of the costs considered so far, the government must pay the costs of Social  		Security, SSI, and food stamp benefits. Channeling did not appear to affect  		these payments, so they will not enter into future net costs. However, they  		represent a large component of future total costs. We estimate that the average  		cost per survival day of Social Security benefits would be approximately $14,  		while the average cost per day in the community for SSI and food stamps would  		be roughly $2. Under the first set of extrapolation assumptions described  		earlier, this implies total future costs to the government for these programs  		of over $8,000 per client under either channeling model.</p>
<p>The second observation is that channeling appeared to reduce client  		costs slightly during the observation period while increasing government costs.  		The client savings were in the costs for nursing homes and formal community  		services and appeared in both models. This pattern, if it persisted, would tend  		to increase government costs above social costs. We will return to this issue  		in the next chapter.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="interpret" id="interpret">V. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a>  		we have presented the background necessary for interpreting the overall  		benefit-cost results first presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>. In  		particular, by examining the underlying impact estimates and valuation  		procedures, we have highlighted the uncertainty inherent in any single estimate  		of net costs. Moreover, in assessing the impact of channeling on the quality of  		the lives of clients and their informal caregivers, we have underscored the  		difficulty of capturing such impacts in the benefit-cost analysis.  		Nevertheless, this background has not altered the essential conclusion  		presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>--that channeling appeared to  		increase net costs as it led to small increases in the quality of the lives of  		both clients and their informal caregivers.</p>
<p>In this concluding chapter, we begin by reviewing the overall net cost  		findings, focusing explicitly on the distribution of costs and benefits between  		the public and private sectors. We then discuss some of the implications of  		these estimates; specifically, we analyze the break-even point for  		channeling--that is, the magnitude of the impacts that would be necessary to  		create net savings--and the approximate level of government funding required to  		operate channeling on an ongoing basis. We conclude this chapter by comparing  		our results with those from other community care demonstrations.</p>
<h3>A. THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF CHANNELING</h3>
<p>The channeling demonstration led to an increase in the living, medical,  		and long term care costs per client. The absolute and relative size of this  		increase differed substantially by the two models. The basic case management  		model appeared to increase these costs by about $1,300 per client during the  		18-month observation period, which represents an increase of approximately 7  		percent over the roughly $18,500 in costs we estimate that clients would have  		incurred in the absence of channeling.</p>
<p>The financial control model, by devoting greater expenditures to  		community services, increased costs by much more: by approximately $3,400 per  		client during the observation period. We estimate that, during this period,  		clients would have incurred average costs of almost $23,000 in the absence of  		channeling. Thus, the financial control model of channeling increased costs by  		roughly 15 percent.</p>
<p>Channeling will continue to generate additional net costs beyond this  		observation period. While we cannot, of course, estimate the precise magnitude  		of such costs, it appears that including them would not alter the basic  		benefit-cost findings from the observation period. Under the basic model,  		future social net costs could add another $1,000 per client to the observed net  		costs, under plausible assumptions about future longevity and service use.  		Under the financial control model, the higher costs for serving persons in the  		community could lead to greater future net costs of almost $5,000 per client  		under the same extrapolation assumptions.</p>
<p>Under both models, the government pays for virtually all of the living,  		medical, and long term care services used by clients. In the absence of  		channeling, Medicare and Medicaid would have paid approximately 94 percent of  		the hospital costs of clients, 85 percent of their other covered medical  		service costs (primarily physician and outpatient services), and 55 percent of  		their nursing home costs (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>). In addition, Medicare and Medicaid would  		have paid for approximately 60 percent of clients' formal community service  		costs in the basic model sites and for approximately 82 percent of these costs  		in the more service-rich financial control model sites. Moreover, the  		government provided most of the income for clients through payments from Social  		Security, Supplemental Security Income, and the food stamp program. Thus, these  		government expenditures for direct services and income maintenance in the  		absence of channeling roughly equal the total expenditures that clients would  		have incurred for living, medical, and long term care services: $18,500 per  		client in the basic model sites and $23,000 per client in the financial control  		sites.</p>
<p>In addition to these expenditures, the demonstration indicated that both  		channeling models would raise government expenditures further by increasing the  		use of services--primarily channeling case management and additional formal  		community services. Under the basic model, government costs would rise by 10  		percent (approximately $1,750 per client) over the 18-month observation period.  		Under the financial control model, government costs would rise by 16 percent  		($3,800 per client) over this period.</p>
<p>In the demonstration, the channeling projects incurred most of these  		additional government costs. They paid for all of the channeling case  		management, as well as for additional formal community services. Moreover,  		under the financial control model, the projects paid for many community  		services that would have been paid by Medicare or Medicaid in the absence of  		the demonstration. Thus, the pattern of demonstration funding generated savings  		to Medicaid and other public agencies under both channeling models and  		substantial savings to Medicare under the financial control model (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table  		II.5</a>).</p>
<p>These savings to specific government programs should be considered an  		artifact of our accounting system. The savings reflect a redistribution of  		government costs due to the pooling of Medicare, Medicaid, and some other  		government funds under channeling. The specific redistribution of costs  		observed in the demonstration is only one possible way to finance channeling.  		Other financing arrangements (for example, funding channeling as part of  		Medicare) would produce different distributions of government costs. The  		essential conclusion is that channeling increased the total costs to the  		government for clients; these costs could be distributed across existing or new  		government agencies in almost any way the government desired.</p>
<p>Under both models, it appears that the increased costs of case  		management and formal community services generated benefits for clients. For  		instance, the indications are that both models significantly reduced the  		proportion of clients who had severe (that is, more than three) unmet needs,  		and increased the proportion of clients who reported that they were more  		confident about receiving the necessary services and more satisfied with their  		service arrangements for house cleaning, meal preparation, and laundry and  		shopping. Moreover, channeling seemed to increase clients' reported  		satisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p>Some indicators of the quality of clients' lives were not enhanced by  		channeling. For instance, longevity and average income were unaffected. In  		addition, measured declines occurred in the average functioning level of  		clients under the financial control model (functioning was unaffected under the  		basic model). In part, these results show simply that channeling will not  		affect all aspects of clients' lives. (The means by which it could bring about  		changes in such outcomes as longevity or income are tenuous at best.) The  		results also highlight the difficulty of measuring intangible outcomes: we used  		several indicators of the underlying outcomes (i.e., life quality, functioning,  		and satisfaction with services), and these indicators respond differentially to  		changes in those underlying outcomes. Moreover, with respect to functioning, it  		is unclear whether an actual decline occurred or whether it was only the manner  		in which the questions on functioning were asked in the interviews that  		generated the observed decline.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note63">63</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Despite these uncertainties, it appears that, when all these indicators  		are considered together, channeling enhanced the quality of clients' lives.  		However, it is difficult to assess the precise magnitude of this enhancement,  		since the psychometric properties of our indicators are not well understood,  		and not all of them were apparently affected. It is this uncertainty about the  		magnitude of these generally intangible benefits that makes it difficult to  		draw overall benefit-cost conclusions.</p>
<p>Primary informal caregivers also seemed to derive benefits from  		channeling: they reported more satisfaction both with their lives and with the  		care arrangements for clients. The evidence suggests that primary caregivers  		did not reduce their efforts due to channeling under either model. The only  		reduction in effort observed was a slight reduction for visiting caregivers  		(who were generally less closely associated with clients) under the financial  		control model.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note64">64</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these apparent benefits in terms of enhancing the quality  		of the lives of both clients and their informal caregivers, we estimated that  		clients experienced some savings under the channeling models. These savings are  		small, approximately $400, and are somewhat uncertain. They stem from savings  		in private expenditures for formal community services and nursing homes.</p>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding these private expenditures is due to the  		presence of a few individuals (all of whom were control group members in the  		basic model) who had very high private expenditures for formal community  		services. This evidence suggested the possibility that channeling produced  		potentially large private savings. However, because of the rarity of these  		individuals, we cannot be sure whether they are represented in the correct  		proportion in our sample. Furthermore, we cannot be certain whether channeling  		was the operative mechanism that led to the observed treatment/control  		differences in private expenditures for formal community services. In this  		case, we have chosen to exclude this handful of high-use individuals and to  		report the results that are applicable to the vast majority of clients in the  		basic model: a small savings in private expenditures for formal community  		services, and a slight overall increase in total public expenditures for these  		services.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note65">65</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Overall, we place a high degree of confidence in the general picture  		that emerges from our net-cost and life-quality estimates. The evaluation  		findings are based on the experience of a large sample of individuals and on an  		extensive data base. Furthermore, we generally found consistent results when we  		estimated the outcomes with different data sources. For example, the estimated  		patterns of use based on interview data are generally similar to the estimated  		patterns of expenditures based on records data. Finally, the key  		outcomes--nursing home expenditures and the costs of channeling case  		management--are based on comprehensive records data. The quality of the data  		and the consistency of the results, as well as the extensive methodological  		investigations conducted as part of the evaluation, generate a high level of  		confidence in the overall findings.</p>
<p>Of course, residual uncertainty remains. Even with the samples used in  		this evaluation, there is a chance that some estimated treatment/control  		differences are due to chance rather than to the operative mechanisms of  		channeling. The statistical confidence intervals surrounding our estimates  		include a relatively wide range of values. Thus, while the orders of magnitudes  		suggested by the expenditure estimates are reliable, some caution should be  		exercised when using the specific dollar estimates.</p>
<p>In summary, the general weight of the findings is that channeling, as it  		was fielded in the demonstration, led to higher overall expenditures, due to  		the expansion of channeling case management and formal community services.  		These extra expenditures were incurred in addition to the substantial  		expenditures that would have been incurred even in the absence of channeling.  		Thus, based on our estimates, the net increase in social expenditures for  		channeling clients was about 7 percent under the basic case management model  		and 15 percent under the financial control model. These increased expenditures  		enhanced the quality of the lives of both clients and their primary caregivers.  		Whether these increases in life quality are large enough to justify the extra  		costs is a policy judgment that must be answered in a broader context.</p>
<p>This overall conclusion holds for both of the channeling models that  		were fielded in the demonstration, although the two models did differ in terms  		of the magnitude of their net costs. These differences are generally due to the  		greater expenditures devoted to formal community services under the financial  		control model. However, the differences also reflect the more service-rich  		environment of the financial control model sites. These site differences were  		noted by Carcagno et al. (1986), and are evident in the higher control-group  		expenditures for formal community services under the financial control model  		sites.</p>
<p>Further, the differences among the sites in which the two channeling  		models were fielded create some uncertainty about the extent to which observed  		model differences can be generalized to a broader content. The results  		generally indicate that the basic model was more cost-effective. It produced  		approximately the same increase in measures of life quality as did the  		financial control model, but its net cost was about one-third that of the  		financial control model. However, the differences in the availability of  		services in the sites clouds this issue, since it is unclear whether the  		financial control model would have generated these greater increases in life  		quality had it been fielded in the less service-rich environment of the basic  		model sites. Nevertheless, our available evidence indicates that the basic case  		management model is the more cost-effective of the two.</p>
<h3>B. IMPACTS NECESSARY TO GENERATE NET SAVINGS</h3>
<p>Another way to consider the benefit-cost estimates is to examine the  		size of the impacts necessary to generate a net savings, given the observed  		magnitude of the costs of channeling case management. These necessary impacts  		are influenced by two factors over and above the costs of services. First, most  		of the cost savings were expected to stem from reductions in the use of nursing  		homes. Second, it is difficult to predict who will enter a nursing home.  		Consequently, expanded community services are inevitably provided to some  		persons who would have remained in the community even in the absence of such  		services. The expectation of channeling was that the savings generated from  		reductions in nursing home expenditures would outweigh the costs of providing  		additional services to community residents.</p>
<p>To estimate the potential savings from the reduction in nursing home  		days, we used estimates of the average cost per day both in the community and  		in nursing homes. These cost estimates were presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter  		IV</a>, and reflect the patterns of use observed for treatment and control  		group members over the period from 13 to 18 months after randomization. Under  		the basic model, these estimates indicate that channeling case management  		increased the average cost per day in the community by 11 percent, to  		approximately $27 per day. At the same time, the average cost of a nursing home  		day in these sites was $51. The difference in these average costs suggests that  		it would be possible to save an average of almost $25 for every day a person  		remained in the community rather than placed in a nursing home, although it  		would cost an extra $3 per day in the community to provide additional services  		to community residents who would not have entered a nursing home. Thus, if the  		proportion of clients who are at risk of institutionalization remains high, it  		appears that the basic model could generate savings.</p>
<p>Of course, this possibility assumes that those individuals for whom  		channeling prevented or delayed institutionalization would have the same  		average service needs as persons in the community. Specifically, this simple  		comparison assumes that the average cost per day in the community would be  		unaffected by changes in the composition of the community residents. This is a  		strong assumption. It may be true for small changes in which the number of  		nursing home residents served in the community is small relative to the number  		of community residents who receive services. However, in a more narrowly  		focused and smaller program, the switch from nursing home to community care  		could increase the average cost of community care. In that case, the savings  		would be less than those implied by the observed difference in the daily costs  		of community and nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Despite the limitations of this type of comparison, it can provide a  		lower bound for the impacts necessary to generate a net savings. Wooldridge and  		Shore (1986) found that, in the absence of channeling, clients in the basic  		sites would have spent an average of 49 days in a nursing home, 23 days in a  		hospital, and 349 days in the community during the 18-month observation  		period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note67">67</a></font></sup> These figures  		imply that channeling would have to reduce nursing home days by about 75  		percent (37 days) in order to break even.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note68">68</a></font></sup> Such a reduction would generate savings in  		nursing home expenditures of over $900 per client over the 18 months and would  		increase the costs of providing services to these and other persons in the  		community by approximately the same amount. In fact, the observed reduction was  		only 5 days, less than 20 percent of the required amount.</p>
<p>The higher costs of the financial control model imply that even larger  		reductions in nursing home use would be required in order to break even. The  		case management and formal community services provided by the financial control  		projects increased the average cost per day in the community by over $11, to  		approximately $38 per day. Nursing home expenditures in these sites averaged  		$55 per day. The difference between these numbers implies potential savings of  		approximately $18 for every nursing home day avoided (again, this implication  		assumes that average prices do not change as a result of serving more persons  		in the community).</p>
<p>For these financial control model sites, Wooldridge and Schore (1986)  		found that, in the absence of channeling, clients would have spent an average  		of 46 days in nursing homes, 32 days in hospitals, and 362 days in the  		community during the 18-month observation period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note69">69</a></font></sup> Even if channeling had been able to  		eliminate all nursing home use for these clients, this model would not have  		generated sufficient savings from reductions in nursing home use to pay for the  		costs of the increased community service. If all clients in these projects had  		remained in the community (and no other savings accrued over and above those  		incorporated in the estimated cost per day in the community), the savings from  		reductions in nursing home use would have been approximately $800 per client  		over the 18 months, compared with an increase in community costs of  		approximately $4,100 per client.</p>
<p>These estimates illustrate the challenge that faces channeling-type  		programs. In order to generate net savings, these programs must enroll persons  		who would be very likely to enter a nursing home if they could not obtain  		appropriate community care. Channeling and all other community care  		demonstrations have made extensive efforts to enroll such persons, but these  		efforts have generally been unsuccessful. Thus, it seems unlikely that these  		types of programs can target services in a manner whereby they generate net  		savings when operated at a large scale. Of course, it remains possible to find  		individual cases for whom savings could be generated.</p>
<h3>C. ESTIMATED ANNUAL NET COST TO THE GOVERNMENT OF AN  		ONGOING PROGRAM</h3>
<p>While it is unlikely that a channeling-type program will generate  		savings for the government, such a program will still be desired if its  		intangible benefits (i.e., increases in the quality of the lives of clients and  		their caregivers) are judged to be important enough to justify its net costs.  		If a permanent program is deemed desirable, estimates of the annual level of  		funding necessary to operate it would be essential for appropriation,  		budgetary, and expenditure planning purposes.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have only indirectly addressed such estimates of the annual  		cost of serving an active channeling caseload. Rather, we have focused on net  		costs per client. For several reasons, these per-client estimates, which  		indicate the net financial implication of the decision to offer channeling  		services to an eligible person, are inadequate for developing an annual budget.  		First, our estimates generally aggregate expenditures that occurred over the  		entire 18-month observation period, and they include the entire research sample  		(including persons who died or entered a nursing home), rather than only active  		program participants. Consequently, our estimates of the net costs per client  		for the observation period will be lower than the actual costs of serving an  		active caseload for the same length of time.</p>
<p>A second inadequacy is due to the fact that the costs of an ongoing  		channeling program will differ from those observed under the demonstration,  		even if the ongoing program is designed to be exactly the same as the  		demonstration programs. In particular, the dynamics of enrollments and  		terminations will change the mix of new and ongoing clients over time. Since  		the costs of serving these two types of clients differ, this change in caseload  		mix will affect the average cost of operating the ongoing program. Further, a  		permanent program might differ from the demonstration in terms of the specific  		program model, the average project and case-manager caseload sizes, the types  		of covered services, cost-sharing arrangements, and service environments. While  		it is uncertain how such structural changes would affect the benefits generated  		by channeling, it is certain that they, too, would affect the costs of  		operating the program.</p>
<p>In this section, we consider the net cost to the government of operating  		a permanent channeling program. These costs include the direct operating  		expenditures of the channeling projects plus the net costs or savings generated  		by channeling for other government programs. Thus, the estimates encompass the  		Medicare, Medicaid, channeling, and other public program perspectives.  		Furthermore, the estimates include expenditures for medical and long term care  		services, as well as those for Social Security, Supplemental Security Income,  		and other social insurance programs (total social insurance payments account  		for approximately 30 percent of total government costs for clients).</p>
<p>In examining these costs, we provide several alternative estimates of  		the cost to the government budget per case month--that is, the net cost to the  		government of providing channeling services to a client for a month. Each of  		these estimates illustrates the implications of specific assumptions. No single  		estimate can be regarded as best. The most appropriate estimate for budgeting a  		future program will depend on a host of decisions about who would be served and  		what services would be provided. However, the estimates provided herein  		indicate the likely magnitude of the change in the aggregate government budget  		that is necessary to implement channeling, as well as how decisions about  		operating the program will affect those net costs.</p>
<p>Our discussion is based strictly on the results of the basic and  		financial control models that were fielded in the demonstration. As we noted,  		the costs of future programs will differ from the costs of these demonstration  		program models for many reasons. Here, we can only note these potential  		differences, and we caution budgeters to take into account how future  		programmatic or environmental changes might alter the present benefit and cost  		findings of channeling.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Estimation Process: Implications of Client Mix</b></i></p>
<p>As the first step in determining the costs of implementing the basic and  		financial control models, we estimated the mix of new and ongoing clients that  		would be observed in an ongoing program. We then used these proportions to  		calculate the appropriately weighted average of the estimated cost per case  		months for these two types of clients. As indicated below and in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>, the key assumptions in this process are the  		long-term survival rates of clients and the costs of serving ongoing  		clients.</p>
<p>The data from the demonstration suggest that clients who receive case  		management services can be divided into two groups in terms of their net costs.  		The first group constitutes new clients. These clients receive the  		one-time-only initial case management services of screening, assessment, and  		initial care planning. They also tend to have high medical expenditures, which  		(as we found in the demonstration) are often due to acute health problems that  		prompted them to seek channeling services. The other group constitutes ongoing  		clients. They receive only ongoing case management services, and the acute  		health problems they had experienced at enrollment have often been  		resolved.</p>
<p>The net costs of these two groups differ. If we define (somewhat  		arbitrarily) new clients as those who have received case management services  		for less than six months, their total government cost per survival month would  		be $1,600 under the basic model and $2,200 under the financial control model.  		For on-going clients--that is, those who survive and continue to receive  		services beyond six months after randomization--we estimate that the total  		government cost would be only $1,400 under the basic model and $1,900 under the  		financial control model. These figures for ongoing clients represent reductions  		of, respectively, 12 and 15 percent from the figures for new clients.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note70">70</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As we suggested earlier, this reduction is due partially to differences  		in the costs of channeling case management (initial costs are incurred only for  		new clients) and partially to declining medical expenses (for instance, medical  		expenditures per survival month for controls declined after the first six  		months following randomization).</p>
<p>To make budget calculations easier, we converted these estimates of the  		costs per survival month (units that are difficult to measure outside of a  		demonstration) into costs per active case month. To do so, we multiplied the  		costs per survival month by the ratio of survival months to case months (case  		months are less than survival months because of survivors who were terminated  		from channeling). These calculations are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableV.1">Table V.1</a> presents the  		resulting estimates. They show that it costs the government just over $2,500  		for every month in which a new client participates in the basic model of  		channeling. Under the financial control model, the government's cost is almost  		$2,500 per case month. For ongoing clients, the costs are slightly under $2,500  		per case month under the basic model, and $3,000 per case month under the  		financial control model.</p>
<p>The average cost per case month for a permanent program will be  		determined by the costs of serving these two types of clients and the mix of  		these clients. The demonstration cost estimates for the two types provide a  		reasonable basis for making budgetary calculations (although they should be  		modified to reflect any anticipated changes in the models or the environment).  		The mix of new and ongoing clients that was observed in the demonstration is  		inappropriate; in the long run, a channeling program will consist of  		proportionately more ongoing clients.</p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>The change in client mix is due to the long-term nature of channeling.  		Many clients will continue to receive services long after their enrollment.  		Thus, as clients continue to be enrolled, the program's stock of ongoing  		clients will continue to rise. That is, each year, the program must serve the  		surviving ongoing clients from previous years, as well as those former new  		clients who have become on-going clients because they continued to participate  		in channeling. Ultimately, attrition among the long-term clients due to death,  		institutionalization, and individual decisions to decline further services  		should balance the inflow of new clients, and the projects should reach a  		stable caseload size and mix.</p>
<p>We estimated the mix of new and ongoing clients in a permanent program  		based on the estimated length of time that clients remained enrolled in  		channeling. Because we observed our sample only for 18 months at most (and thus  		cannot be certain what the average length of participation would be in the long  		run), we have used the extrapolations presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter  		IV</a> (and derived in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>) to draw estimates  		which indicate that, in the long run, 20 percent of the caseload will  		constitute new clients (persons who have been in the program for six months or  		less), and the remaining 80 percent will constitute ongoing clients.</p>
<p>Using these fractions, we estimate that the average cost per case month  		in a ongoing program would be approximately $2,500 under the basic model and  		$3,100 under the financial control model. Annual-budget costs would be derived  		by multiplying these cost-per-case-month estimates by 12 to yield costs per  		case year and then multiplying that product by the expected caseload size.  		Thus, a program based on the basic case management model that expected to have  		an annual active caseload of 1,000 persons would cost the government  		approximately $30 million per year, including both direct operating costs and  		the net cost of channeling to other government programs. In the absence of such  		a channeling program, the government would have spent approximately $27.6  		million on the persons included in this caseload (based on the experience of  		demonstration controls). Thus, adding the channeling basic model would raise  		government costs by 8.7 percent (recall that the average costs to the  		government per client who is offered basic-model channeling services rose by  		approximately 9.5 percent). Under the financial control model, annual  		government costs would rise by almost 20 percent.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Implications of Different Caseload Definitions</b></i></p>
<p>To budget an ongoing program, one uses the average cost per case month  		(weighted for the appropriate mix of new and ongoing clients) multiplied by the  		expected average size of the ongoing program. This exercise depends crucially  		on the definition of clients that is used. It is essential that the same  		definition be used to estimate caseload size as is used to calculate annual  		costs per case month.</p>
<p>In particular, it should be noted that our estimates reflect the  		caseload definitions used in the demonstration. Thus, only persons actively  		receiving case management services were included in the caseload. All  		individuals who entered a nursing home, declined services, moved out of the  		catchment area, died, or were otherwise judged inappropriate for services were  		terminated from the program.</p>
<p>If a program used a different estimate of caseload, then it would be  		necessary to use different estimates of cost per case month for assessing its  		impact on the government budget. For example, a program might use a broader  		definition that kept some persons who entered a nursing home or declined  		services on the caseload. Such a definition would be consistent with desires to  		serve those persons if they subsequently decided to return to the community or  		ask for services. Our estimates of cost per case month would be inappropriate  		for a program using this definition of caseload; their use would overstate net  		government costs since the broader definition of caseload includes persons who  		receive essentially no program services. In such cases, it would be necessary  		to recompute the cost per case month estimates to reflect this change in the  		definition of caseload. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Implications of Alternative Estimates of the Costs of  		Channeling Case Management</b></i></p>
<p>The third critical element in estimating the annual net cost of  		operating channeling as an ongoing program is to assess the consequent changes  		in the average costs of case management. To do so, one must extrapolate beyond  		the demonstration data, thus adding considerable uncertainty to the estimates.  		Nevertheless, we can assess the sensitivity of the net cost per case month  		estimates to changes in the costs of delivering channeling case management.</p>
<p>Thornton, Will, and Davies (1986) estimated that during the steady-state  		phase of the demonstration approximately 40 percent of the initial costs and  		over 50 percent of the ongoing case management costs (excluding direct service  		costs) were attributable to project administration, clerical, and provider  		relations activities. A larger-scale program may provide more opportunities for  		improving the efficiency of these administrative and support efforts. If we  		assume, for example, that these costs could be reduced by 25 percent (a  		percentage change that is smaller than the change reported by Thornton, Will,  		and Davies between the buildup and steady-state phases of the demonstration),  		then the costs of case management would decline by at least 10 percent: initial  		costs would fall by less than $35 per client enrolled (from approximately  		$340), while ongoing case management costs would fall by $9 per case month  		(from $90).</p>
<p>Such reductions in the average costs of channeling case management would  		reduce net costs per case month by less than 1 percent (since case management  		costs are less than 10 percent of total government costs). However, this change  		would reduce the net amount that channeling <b>adds</b> to the system by 5  		percent ($216 to $205 per case month) under the basic model and by 2 percent  		($507 to $496 per case month) under the financial control model.</p>
<p><i><b>4. Estimates of Net Cost Per Case Month</b></i></p>
<p>The three factors discussed herein--caseload mix, caseload definitions,  		and case management costs--are only a few of the dimensions along which the net  		costs of an ongoing program might differ from those of the demonstration. Yet  		they indicate the general range that one might observe for an ongoing  		program.</p>
<p>Examining costs per case month does not change the central conclusion  		that living, medical, and long term care costs would be higher under  		channeling. We estimate that net government expenditures per case month,  		including costs for Social Security and transfers, would rise by approximately  		10 percent ($216 per case month) under the basic model and by approximately 20  		($507 per case month) percent under the financial control model. These numbers  		reflect the average costs observed during the steady-state phase of the  		demonstration, assume that 20 percent of the future caseload will consist of  		new clients, and are based on the demonstration definition of clients.</p>
<p>These net annual cost estimates indicate larger net cost increases than  		did the social cost per client estimates presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#overview">Chapter II</a>, since the savings that accrued to clients are  		excluded for the government perspective presented here. Those costs that do  		accrue to the government will be spread across several government agencies. The  		specific distribution will depend on how channeling services are financed.</p>
<h3>D. COMPARISON WITH OTHER COMMUNITY CARE  		DEMONSTRATIONS</h3>
<p>Comparisons between the benefit-cost findings for channeling and those  		for other community care demonstrations are difficult because of differences in  		analytical methodologies, data sources, and the populations served. Differences  		in the types of cost data collected are particularly limiting. Given the many  		providers and sources of reimbursement and funding, the cost data, by their  		nature, are distributed throughout the system. Thus, cost analyses must adopt  		broad data collection strategies, such as those used in the channeling  		evaluation, or must limit the focus of their analysis.</p>
<p>Most other community-based care demonstration efforts have chosen to  		limit their analytical focus. They have obtained cost data from the  		demonstration projects (for demonstration-funded costs) or from Medicare or  		Medicaid claims files. These sources typically lack information on private and  		other public costs. Such missing data can be particularly problematic with  		respect to assessing the impacts of formal community services and separate case  		management services. The varying coverage of the cost data used to evaluate the  		other demonstrations makes it difficult to make comparisons with them.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the overall findings for channeling can be compared in  		general terms with those for the other community care demonstrations that have  		been implemented and evaluated over the past 15 years:</p>

</tr></table><p>An additional comparison can be made across several of the  		demonstrations in terms of the costs of the case management services (that is,  		project costs excluding those for formal community services and other direct  		services). Berkeley Planning Associates (1984) estimated these costs on a  		consistent basis for five earlier demonstrations. Thornton, Will, and Davies  		(1986) compared the case management costs incurred by the basic and financial  		control model projects in the demonstration with these earlier cost estimates.  		The results indicated that channeling costs were about in the middle of the  		range of the case management costs for the five earlier demonstrations.</p>
<p>The evidence from these previous evaluations, combined with the findings  		from channeling, yields two general conclusions about the benefits and costs of  		channeling-type programs. The first is that these efforts will tend to raise  		overall costs. Community-care programs have largely been unsuccessful in  		delivering services only to those clients who would enter a nursing home in the  		absence of community services. This has limited their ability to generate  		system savings. At the same time, they have increased the general level of  		services provided to community residents, thereby increasing overall costs.</p>
<p>The second conclusion is that these extra services to community  		residents have apparently increased the quality of the lives of the elderly  		clients and their informal caregivers. In the demonstration, we found that  		channeling reduced the average number of unmet needs, and increased clients'  		satisfaction with services, their confidence that they would receive the  		necessary services, and their global life satisfaction. Channeling was also  		found to increase the quality of the lives of primary caregivers and their  		satisfaction with service arrangements. Furthermore, the formal services  		provided by channeling did not appear to cause primary caregivers to reduce  		their efforts.</p>
<p>These two conclusions must be considered together in order to make the  		final assessment of channeling. The net costs of this intervention are now well  		documented, both in this report and in previous studies. Benefits in the form  		of increases in life quality have been more difficult to document, but they do  		appear to exist. The issue for consideration is whether the largely intangible  		benefits are worth the net costs of producing them.</p>

<h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A. ALTERNATIVE CASE MANAGEMENT</a></h2>
<p>Case management services vary substantially. They are provided by a  		range of organizations, including ones similar to the channeling projects as  		well as home health agencies, hospital discharge planners, and other care  		providers. The services also may vary in their comprehensiveness, duration, and  		intensity.</p>
<p>The challenge facing the benefit-cost analysis is to capture the costs  		of all the various case management services. We have approached this task by  		dividing all case management provided to sample members into three categories.  		The first category contains all the costs of providing channeling case  		management to treatment group members. These costs were estimated by Thornton,  		Will, and Davies (1986), who used demonstration accounting records. The second  		category includes all case management that was provided as part of other formal  		services--for example, case management provided by hospital discharge planners  		or home health aides. These costs are captured along with the other service  		costs incurred by these agencies and are included in the estimates of formal  		community service costs and hospital costs.</p>
<p>The third category includes case management that was provided as a  		separate service. These services were generally provided by case management  		agencies operated by the states or private non-profit organizations. These  		costs were estimated as part of the benefit-cost analysis using the data  		collected for the analysis of the receipt of case management (Brown and  		Phillips, 1986).</p>
<p>This appendix presents our procedures for estimating this third  		component of case management costs. These costs for case management provided as  		a separate service were estimated in two steps. The first step was to determine  		how many persons received such services in each six-month period. The second  		step was to estimate how much case management service those persons received  		and its cost. This second step involved several assumptions about the intensity  		and duration of these case management services. These steps are described in  		the following two sections; the resulting estimates were presented and  		discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>. When interpreting these  		estimates, it is important to remember that they include only a portion of the  		total cost for case management provided to sample members.</p>
<h3>A. ESTIMATING RECEIPT OF CASE MANAGEMENT AS A SEPARATE  		SERVICE</h3>
<p>We had two basic measures of the fraction of controls receiving case  		management as a separate service: data from provider records and interview data  		collected in the followup surveys. Both data sources have strengths and  		weaknesses, but they both indicate the same general level of use.</p>
<p>The provider records data accurately identified case management provided  		as a separate service, and, therefore, minimize the problem of double-counting  		the costs of such case management (that is, they avoid the problem of including  		here the costs of case management already captured by the analysis of formal  		community services). In contrast, the interview data indicate whether a sample  		member received case management from at least one of a list of agencies  		providing relatively comprehensive case management. In some cases, these  		agencies could have provided services other than case management, or persons  		could have received case management as a separate service from another agency  		omitted from the list. Thus, in this regard, the provider records data appear  		to be more accurate for benefit-cost purposes.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note72">72</a></font></sup></p>
<p>However, the interview data contain many more observations. Interview  		data about case management were available over for 1,400 control group members.  		Provider records data were available only for 297 control group members for the  		first six-month period and only for 140 control group members for the second  		six-month period, and they were not collected for the last six-month period.  		This smaller size for the provider records data increases the uncertainty  		inherent in estimates using those data. Thus, in this regard, the interview  		data appear to be more accurate.</p>
<p>We chose to use the provider records data in the benefit-cost  		calculations. We then tested the sensitivity of the benefit-cost findings to  		our use of these data by making an alternative estimate using the interview  		data. Because both data sets indicate similar levels of the receipt of  		alternative case management, there is not much difference in the two sets of  		estimates. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableA.1">Table A.1</a> presents both sets of  		estimates.</p>
<p>The estimates presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableA.1">Table A.1</a> are derived  		from the findings of Carcagno et al. (1986). The derivation included two steps.  		The first was required because both the provider records and interview  		estimates correspond to the survivor sample (only persons living to the end of  		a six-month period received an interview, which was also the basis for  		collecting provider records). All estimates used in the benefit-cost analysis  		reflect the entire research sample, in that they include persons who died  		during our observation period. Thus, we needed to adjust the estimates for  		survivors to reflect the death rates. This was done for each six-month period  		by multiplying the estimates for survivors by the associated percent of the  		sample which survived to the end of that period (estimates of the survival rate  		were obtained from Wooldridge and Schore, 1986).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note73">73</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The second step in the derivation was to estimate the percent of the  		sample receiving separate case management in the period 13 to 18 months after  		randomization (the third, and last, six-month period observed). Provider  		records and interview data on comprehensive case management data were not  		available for this period. In the absence of other data, we assumed that the  		receipt of alternative case management among survivors remained the same as it  		was in the previous six-month period, 7 to 12 months after randomization.</p>

</tr></table><h3>B. ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF CASE MANAGEMENT  		RECEIVED</h3>
<p>It proved to be difficult to estimate the amount and cost of the  		separate case management received by controls who reported that they had  		received such services. Most case management agencies that were interviewed for  		the provider records data collection effort did not maintain records about the  		amount of services provided or the cost per client of providing these services.  		In many cases this reflected the fact that such services were provided at no  		charge because the agency or program was supported by general grants rather  		than by fees for service. Thus, we were unable to obtain an accurate estimate  		of the average cost per person of these case management services.</p>
<p>Faced with this problem, we attempted to make a rough estimate of costs  		per person that was consistent with our general observations about the case  		management services provided to controls in the demonstration sites. Because  		such estimates involve uncertainty we tested the sensitivity of the  		benefit-cost findings to changes in the estimate of average cost by  		recalculating net costs using alternative estimates of average cost.</p>
<p>All together, we made four estimates of the costs of case management  		provided as a separate service. These estimates differ in the assumptions they  		make about the fraction of controls receiving case management as a separate  		service and about the cost of that service. As noted above, there were two  		alternative estimates about the fraction of controls receiving these  		services--one based on provider records data, and the other based on interview  		data. We also used three cost estimates based loosely on the costs observed for  		channeling. These three cost estimates include: (1) a "high" estimate which  		assumes that other case management was as comprehensive and intensive as  		channeling, (2) a "middle" cost estimate, which we have used as our primary  		estimate in calculating the net cost of channeling (that is, 75 percent of the  		cost observed for channeling), and (3) a "low" estimate which assumes that the  		other case management service costs equaled the average initial costs incurred  		by channeling projects with the channeling outreach and screening costs  		excluded.</p>
<p>The channeling projects incurred $646 in costs per treatment group  		member over the first six months after random assignment. This cost includes  		$330 in initial costs and 3.4 months of ongoing services at $92 per month.  		Because some treatment group members dropped out prior to receiving services  		(see Carcagno et al., 1986, Table VIII.8) this cost estimate understates the  		cost for those treatment-group members who actually received services. To  		correct this underestimate, we divided the cost per treatment group member by  		the fraction of treatment group members who received some channeling services.  		This fraction varied across sites, but was approximately 91 percent overall.  		The resulting estimate was $710 per person who received at least some case  		management during the first six months.</p>
<p>This estimate was used as our high cost estimate. The middle estimate  		was simply 75 percent of this figure, $533 per six months. This fraction is  		arbitrary, but reflects the general conclusion of Carcagno et al., that, while  		many of the agencies that provided case management as a separate service  		provided comprehensive case management, it was, in general, less comprehensive  		and intensive than those provided by channeling.</p>
<p>The low cost estimate was $230. This estimate equals the average initial  		costs of the channeling projects, with the costs for outreach and screening  		excluded.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note74">74</a></font></sup> While  		separate case management services may have provided followup as well as  		assessment and care planning services, we have assumed that their total cost  		per client equals these initial channeling costs.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes it is useful to consider the costs of an agency  		that maintained an average caseload of 100 clients per case manager. This  		client to case manager ratio is high for many agencies, but we did observe some  		programs with this staffing pattern. In this case, a case manager would be able  		to spend about 10 hours per client every six months.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note75">75</a></font></sup> Our provider records data suggest that case  		management costs about $30 per hour, implying a six-month cost of $300 every  		six months. This figure is between our low and middle estimates.</p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableA.2">Table A.2</a> presents our primary estimate (which  		is based on provider records data and assumes a cost of $533 per six months)  		and the three alternative estimates. These estimates all indicate the same  		general level of use. The choice of provider records or interview data appears  		to make little difference: for the 18-month period, the two sets of estimates  		are within 5 percent of each other. The high cost estimate which assumes that  		alternative case management was as expensive as channeling is likely to be an  		upper bound, since channeling appeared to be more costly than most other case  		management agencies. None of these estimates indicates a level of use that  		would alter our overall benefit-cost conclusions. In particular, they do not  		suggest that savings from the reduced use of separate case management by  		clients would offset more than a fraction of the costs of channeling case  		management and the costs of the additional formal community services arranged  		through channeling.</p>

<p>This appendix examines client receipt of payments from the Social  		Security Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program as well  		as payments from Veterans Administration cash-benefit programs, Supplemental  		Security-Income (SSI), and food stamps.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note76">76</a></font></sup> This Appendix begins with an overview of the  		mechanisms by which channeling might affect payments from these programs and  		the data sources used in the analysis. The second section presents the  		estimated effects.</p>
<h3>A. OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>Social Security, Veterans benefits, and transfer payments accounted for  		a substantial fraction of client income. As a result, they played an important  		role in clients' financial ability to live in the community and in their  		general well-being. Channeling could have affected these payments by (1)  		assisting clients to apply for income-conditioned transfers (such as SSI and  		food stamps), (2) helping clients to live in the community and thereby make  		them eligible for SSI and food stamp benefits that are paid only to persons in  		the community,<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note77">77</a></font></sup> or (3)  		reducing client mortality, which would increase the time during which clients  		could receive all types of cash benefits. Such changes in payments would affect  		both the clients (and their families) and government expenditures.</p>
<p>At baseline, these payments accounted for almost 90 percent of the  		approximately $560 in average monthly income reported by sample members. The  		bulk of these benefits (accounting for 85 percent of average income) were OASDI  		payments. Almost all sample members reported receiving OASDI baseline, and they  		reported an average payment of $470 per month. There was less participation in  		SSI--only 17 percent of the sample members reported receiving it at  		baseline--and SSI payments were generally lower ($221 per month for a person  		receiving SSI). Food stamps were received by 17 percent of the sample (these  		benefits were worth an average of $46 per month for persons receiving them),  		and Veterans benefits were received by only 5 percent of the sample (the  		average value was $242 per month for recipients).</p>
<p>Information about these payments came from self-reported data collected  		in the baseline and three followup interviews. These interview data correspond  		to the total amount received by a sample member plus his or her spouse (when  		applicable) and pertain to the month prior to the interview. In order to obtain  		estimates of the total cash benefits received during the 18-month observation  		period, we had to interpolate between the observations. This process generally  		averaged the payment amounts reported by an individual at two consecutive  		interviews and multiplied the result by six to estimate the amount received for  		the six-month period defined by those two interviews.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some of the data need to interpolate were missing. Some  		sample members failed to report the dollar amount of their benefits even though  		they reported receiving payments from specific programs. Other sample members  		died during the observation period, and so no information was obtained about  		their transfer payment receipt between their last interview and their  		death.</p>
<p>When data were missing, we attempted to use the available information to  		impute the appropriate dollar amount. For sample members who reported a dollar  		amount at one interview but reported only that they received the benefit at a  		contiguous interview, we multiplied the reported amount by six to obtain a  		value for the period defined by the two interviews. For sample members who  		reported in two consecutive interviews that they received transfer payments  		(but gave no amounts), we imputed using average payments for that program. (The  		estimation sources for the imputations for each transfer program are listed in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableB.1">Table B.1</a>.) For sample members who reported receiving  		transfers at one interview but died prior to completing their subsequent  		interview, we assumed that they continued to receive the reported benefits up  		to the time of their death.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note78">78</a></font></sup> If they were married, we assumed that  		benefits to surviving spouses were paid for the remainder of the period defined  		by the interviews preceding and following death. After that period, all  		payments for that sample member were assumed to be zero.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note79">79</a></font></sup></p>
<p>We estimated the effect of channeling on these payments using, with only  		a minor exception, the standard regression model and control variables used  		throughout the evaluation (see Brown, 1986, for details). The exception was to  		include an extra control variable representing OASDI receipt by the sample  		member and spouse at baseline. This extra variable was needed to control for a  		baseline difference in OASDI receipts between treatment and control group  		members.</p>

<p>The evaluation found that none of the three hypothesized mechanisms that  		could have affected the payments actually operated so as to change the average  		level of payments to clients. The process analysis (Carcagno et al., 1986)  		found that, while there were instances where case managers aid help needy  		persons apply for income-conditioned transfers, there was no evidence of a  		systematic effort to enroll clients in such transfer programs. Similarly, the  		impact analysis indicates that channeling had only trivial effects on mortality  		and community residence (Wooldridge and Schore, 1986). As a result, it is not  		surprising that we find virtually no difference between average payments made  		to treatment and control group members.</p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableB.2">Table B.2</a> presents the specific estimates of the  		impacts on payments. The figures indicate the effect on average payments for  		persons in the followup plus deceased sample.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note80">80</a></font></sup> They indicate that there is virtually no  		difference between the average payments received by treatment group members and  		those received by the control group. None of the estimated treatment/control  		differences is statistically significant. Furthermore, the point estimates for  		the two groups are remarkably close. In all cases, we estimate that the  		treatment/control difference in average payments is less than 8 dollars per  		month. Thus, it appears that there was essentially no impact on average cash  		benefit payments.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note81">81</a></font></sup></p>

<p>The analysis of channeling impacts on formal community-based service  		expenditures employed data from Medicare, Medicaid, the channeling financial  		control system, channeling project cost records, the client tracking system,  		and provider records extracts. The Medicare, Medicaid, and channeling data  		accurately indicate expenditures from these three sources.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note82">82</a></font></sup> However, expenditures by other  		public organizations (e.g., the Veterans Administration, social service block  		grants, or Title III funds) and by clients (and their friends and private  		insurance) are not captured as accurately. These expenditures are estimated  		using provider records data that are more limited in their coverage and  		accuracy.</p>
<p>This appendix outlines the limitations of these provider records data  		and describes the methods used in generating the benchmark estimates presented  		in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>,  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a>, and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a>.  		In addition, three sensitivity tests based on alternative estimation strategies  		are described.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we were limited in our ability to estimate  		channeling impacts on other public and private expenditures. Provider records  		were the only available sources of data on expenditures by private payors and  		public programs other than Medicare, Medicaid, and channeling. Moreover, the  		sample of persons with such data was small for a number of reasons. First,  		provider records extracts were prompted only for a 20 percent subsample.  		Second, a relatively small fraction of these sample members received services  		paid for privately or by other public funds. Finally, not all providers  		supplied the information. In addition, for the 7- through 12-month period,  		provider records extracts were prompted only for those individuals in the 20  		percent subsample who were randomized in the earlier months of the program; for  		the period from 13 to 18 months, there were no provider records  		prompts.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note83">83</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Impact estimates for the first two time periods (months 0-6 and 712)  		were estimated via ordinary least-squares. The resulting coefficients were  		inflated for the underreporting of public and private expenditures (due to the  		underreporting of service use by both sample members and providers).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note84">84</a></font></sup> In addition, since no provider  		records data were collected for the 13- through 18-month period, Corson et al.  		(1986) estimated public and private expenditures for formal community services  		provided during this last period as a function of the 7- to 12-month  		expenditure estimates. This extrapolation adjusted for changes in the average  		time spent in the community because of deaths or changes in  		institutionalization rates, and assumed that average expenditures and  		percentage impacts were the same in these two time periods as they were for  		those in the community.</p>
<p>In addition to the general limitations of the provider records data  		outlined above, the distribution of expenditures was highly skewed, due to a  		small number of high-use individuals in the basic case management model  		sites.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note85">85</a></font></sup> Provider  		records for two control group members in basic case management model sites  		indicated that they each received over $20,000 worth of formal community  		services in the first 6 months after randomization (they reported receiving  		round-the-clock care from multiple visiting caregivers). Eighty percent of  		these expenditures were from private sources, while 20 percent were paid by  		public funds other than Medicare and Medicaid. Indeed, the private expenditures  		of these two persons plus one other high-use control-group member accounted for  		approximately 70 percent of the private expenditures for all control-group  		members in the basic case management model. Because the provider records sample  		was quite small (only 130 basic model controls had valid data on private  		expenditures in months 1 to 6), these outliers had a very strong effect on  		estimates of average private expenditures for the control group and the mean  		differences between the treatment group and the control group.</p>
<p>Alternative estimates of impacts on formal community-based services were  		computed by Corson et al. (1986). One set included the full provider records  		sample, and one set eliminated those individuals with private expenditures over  		$10,000--namely, the two cases described above and a few others.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note86">86</a></font></sup> Corson et al., concluded that the estimates  		made by eliminating the very high service users from the sample were more  		reasonable than were those for individuals in the sample, because the  		treatment/control distribution of high users was concentrated only in the  		control group in one time period. The situation was accentuated in using the  		provider records data, since the few high users in the treatment group (as  		documented in the interview data) were, by chance, not selected for the 20%  		provider records sample. In this report, we have followed Corson et al., in  		using as our benchmark set of estimates the estimated average expenditures,  		<b>excluding</b> the high-use cases. In addition to the formal community  		service expenditure estimates based on records data, Corson et al., also  		present two additional sets of estimates based on interview data. Like the  		estimates presented above, one set includes high-use cases, while the other set  		excludes them. Both estimates were calculated by multiplying use data from the  		interviews by unit prices for services and, then, mean weeks in the community.  		This procedure assumes that expenditures in the snapshot week at the end of  		each period are representative of average expenditures per week in the  		community over the entire six-month period. Because of the number of  		assumptions involved both in generating an estimate of total expenditures  		according to this method and in breaking that total down by payment source,  		Corson et al. (1986) concluded that the benchmark estimates discussed above are  		probably more accurate. All four sets of estimates of total formal community  		service expenditures are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableC.1">Table C.1</a>.</p>
<p>As indicated above, the benchmark estimates of the total net cost of  		channeling presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a> used the formal community service estimates  		based on records data, excluding the high-use cases. To investigate the  		sensitivity of these benchmark estimates, we reestimated the net cost of  		channeling using the three alternative sets of estimates. <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableC.2">Table C.2</a> summarizes the results of these sensitivity  		tests.</p>
<p>For the basic case management model, the four estimates of total net  		cost over the 18-month observation period range from $369 to $1,708, indicating  		that the benchmark estimates appear to be sensitive in that model to the data  		set used and to whether or not we include the high-use cases.  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableC.3">Table C.3</a> presents the lowest estimate, representing a  		net cost of $369 per client over 18 months, broken down by cost component and  		funding source. (The benchmark estimates are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.4">Table II.4</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.5">Table II.5</a>.) As  		Corson et al., point out, it is possible that the large reduction in formal  		community service private expenditures (which drives the lower net cost  		estimate) is a true effect of channeling--that is, that channeling found more  		cost-effective alternatives to round-the-clock care for the few clients who  		would have been high users in the absence of the program. However, as noted  		above, we feel that the high service users are overrepresented in the control  		group in the first six-month observation period, so that estimates made by  		eliminating them from the sample (such as the benchmark estimates) are more  		likely to represent the true impact of channeling.</p>
<p>For the financial control model, the situation is more clear-cut. This  		model clearly increased the use and expenditures for formal community services,  		leading to a total net cost of channeling within a range of $3,124 to $3,396  		per client over the 18-month observation period. Total net cost, as well as the  		distribution across payment sources, did not appear to vary substantially among  		alternative estimates of formal community service expenditures.</p>

<p>Channeling services are provided over time. As a result, there is a  		continuous stream of costs to provide the channeling case management and a  		similar stream of effects as that case management helps shape the services used  		by clients. To analyze this pattern of services, we had to account explicitly  		for the time period over which services were provided and the effects produced.  		This required that we address the issues of inflation, discounting, and  		extrapolation beyond the 18-month observation period. These issues are relevant  		for interpreting the evidence from the demonstration and estimating the  		magnitude of the net change in government expenditures required to fund  		channeling on an ongoing basis. </p>
<h3>A. INFLATION</h3>
<p>Channeling was fielded from early 1982 through 1984.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note87">87</a></font></sup> While inflation during this  		period was lower than in earlier years, it was still high enough to affect  		comparisons of dollars from different years. Using a broad-based inflation  		index, such as the implicit price deflator for the gross national product  		(GNP), the general price level rose by just over 10 percent during the period  		covered by the evaluation (first quarter of 1982 through the second quarter of  		1984).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note88">88</a></font></sup> General price  		increases in the goods and services purchased by state and local governments  		and in medical services rose even faster. The prices of state and local  		government purchases rose by approximately 13 percent during the period of the  		evaluation, and medical service prices (measured by the change in the consumer  		price index for medical services) rose by 22 percent. </p>
<p>This type of change in the price level will distort treatment/control  		comparisons if channeling affects the time pattern of use. In particular, there  		would be a problem if channeling delayed nursing home admissions, but did not  		reduce overall use during the observation period. In this case, inflation would  		increase the nominal cost of nursing homes for treatment group members relative  		to that for control group members, an effect that would reduce the overall  		treatment/control difference in nominal expenditures for nursing homes.</p>
<p>Because of the possibility of such effects, the benefit-cost analysis  		(as well as most other components of the evaluation) attempted to control for  		the effects of inflation. In most cases, we collected dollar-denominated data  		on the outcomes of interest (for example, reported expenditures for nursing  		homes or hospitals). These nominal values were expressed in 1984 dollars by  		multiplying them by the ratio of the GNP implicit price deflator for the month  		of the observation to the deflator for the first quarter of 1984.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note89">89</a></font></sup> The first quarter of 1984 was  		chosen as the base period because it corresponded to the middle of the  		demonstration steady-state period: the time from the fourth quarter of 1983  		through the second quarter of 1984 when the demonstration operations most  		closely resembled an ongoing program (see Carcagno et al., 1986, for a  		discussion of the demonstration phases). Because the data on channeling case  		management costs used in the benefit-cost analysis correspond to this  		steady-state period, the use of that period as a base period enabled us to use  		the cost estimates without adjustment. In those cases where outcome data were  		not already expressed in dollars (for example, use of owner-occupied homes), we  		valued the outcomes using shadow prices expressed in 1984 dollars.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note90">90</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. DISCOUNTING</h3>
<p>When summing benefits and costs that occur in different years, there is  		a problem that a benefit or cost (measured as a given amount of dollars)  		achieved this year is worth more than one achieved, say, ten years from now,  		even after inflation has been taken into account. Consider a result that  		reduced nursing home costs. The savings, if they occurred this year, could be  		reinvested and earn a rate of return over the next ten years. Thus, over a  		ten-year period, the value of this savings would equal the costs saved this  		year plus the return on investment over the next ten years. This value will  		clearly exceed the value of the same savings if they occurred ten years from  		now.</p>
<p>To reflect this, all benefits and costs must be calculated in equivalent  		values by discounting those that occur in the future by a factor that reflects  		the return that could have been earned in the interim. The resulting discounted  		values are termed "present values."<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note91">91</a></font></sup> For convenience, values are discounted to  		the point of randomization into the program.</p>
<p>The appropriate discount rate to use when evaluating social programs is  		always somewhat controversial. While the choice of a discount rate is very  		important for the evaluation and is well established theoretically, there has  		never been a completely satisfactory way to estimate discount rates.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note92">92</a></font></sup> Imperfections in the markets  		for capital, the existence of risk, uncertainty and inflation, and the fact  		that many tax-incidence questions are still unresolved have made it impossible  		to determine a single discount rate that is appropriate for evaluating social  		programs. As a result, the choice of a discount rate is typically done  		arbitrarily. Most studies of social programs have used rates between 3 and 10  		percent a year. We use a middle value, 5 percent, and then test the sensitivity  		of the findings to this assumption by recomputing the values using 3 and 10  		percent discount rates.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note93">93</a></font></sup> Under neither of these alternative discount  		rates does the estimated net cost for channeling change by more than 4 percent  		(for example, under the basic model, increasing the discount rate from 5 to 10  		percent lowers the present value of net costs from $1,338 per client to $1,272  		per client).</p>
<h3>C. EXTRAPOLATION</h3>
<p>The assessment of benefits and costs is limited by the demonstration  		observation period. In general, we have data on sample members only for the 18  		months following randomization. Thus, we do not observe the long-term effects  		of channeling. However, we can assess the potential magnitude of those long-run  		effects and get a better understanding of the factors that will determine them  		by extrapolating trends observed during the 18-month observation period.</p>
<p>The process of extrapolating outcomes into the future is an uncertain  		one at best. In the case of the channeling evaluation, the process is  		particularly constrained because the 18-month observation period provides only  		a limited basis for assessing trends. Because of this uncertainty we are  		limited to a rough assessment of potential future net costs. We make a number  		of assumptions that reflect plausible future scenarios for key outcomes, and  		then calculate future costs under those assumptions. This exercise provides a  		means for assessing the potential magnitude of future net costs and an  		illustration of how key factors interact to generate those future net costs.  		Throughout this discussion, it should be remembered that only the rough order  		of the magnitude of costs and the general pattern of effects are important;  		specific values have little meaning in themselves.</p>
<p>The procedure used to examine future costs had two components. The first  		was to estimate the average cost per day of serving persons in the community,  		nursing homes, and hospitals. The second was to extrapolate into the future the  		trends observed for months 1 to 18. These price and future-use estimates were  		then combined to derive an estimate of total future costs. In this section, we  		first discuss the estimation of average costs per day. We then turn to the  		extrapolation procedures. The resulting estimates of future costs are presented  		and discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a>. In the following calculations,  		we made separate estimates for treatment and control group members, except  		where explicitly noted.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Estimating Average Daily Costs</b></i></p>
<p>In estimating the average daily costs of serving persons in nursing  		homes, hospitals, and the community, we used data from the last six-month  		observation period for which complete data were available. In most cases, this  		was the last six months of the observation period, months 13 to 18. For nursing  		homes, we used the period from months 7 to 12, since this was the last period  		for which there were complete Medicaid-, Medicare, and provider records data on  		nursing home costs.</p>
<p>The use of the last period often required that we use a smaller sample  		than that available for earlier periods. However, despite this limitation, we  		felt that the last period was preferable, since it was closest to the periods  		to which we were extrapolating. Furthermore, there was a greater chance that  		any specific, acute problems clients had when they enrolled in channeling had  		been resolved by this last period, and so the last period would more accurately  		reflect the long-run costs of serving clients in the future.</p>
<p>The first step in estimating the average cost per day for services  		provided to persons in the community, nursing homes, and hospitals was to  		allocate the other covered medical services to these three statuses. The  		estimates of these other covered medical services are presented in Wooldridge  		and Schore (1986). We allocated these expenditures to the community, nursing  		home, and hospital statuses on the basis of general information about their  		composition.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note94">94</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The allocations are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.1">Table  		D.1</a>.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note95">95</a></font></sup> We began by  		assuming that all nonphysician services (which include, for example,  		podiatrist, pharmacy, and outpatient services) were provided to persons in the  		community. This assumption is plausible since nonphysician services provided to  		persons in hospitals and nursing homes are generally billed as part of the  		overall costs of those facilities. Physician services were allocated according  		to the distribution of Medicare service expenditures observed in our sample.  		This allocation places 66 percent of the physician expenditures that were  		included in the other covered medical estimates with the hospital costs. It  		places 30 percent of these expenditures with community costs, and the remaining  		4 percent were allocated to nursing home costs. This assignment process is  		somewhat arbitrary, but should provide a reasonable approximation of the actual  		allocation. Moreover, other medical costs generally account for a small share  		of the total costs (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.2">Table D.2</a>), and so errors in  		the allocation will have a relatively small effect on the analysis.</p>

</tr></table><p>The second step of the process for estimating average daily expenditures  		was to combine the allocations of other covered medical services with the  		estimates of community, nursing home, and hospital costs. Estimates of the  		average costs per day of serving persons in hospitals and nursing homes were  		obtained from Wooldridge and Schore (1986). <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.2">Table D.2</a>  		presents these daily costs, along with the allocated other covered medical  		service costs.</p>
<p>The average cost per day of serving persons in the community (exclusive  		of the other physician and medical services) was estimated by summing all the  		components of average community costs per person and then dividing by the  		average number of days in the community. The average cost included the costs of  		formal community services, housing, food and other living expenses, and case  		management services (including channeling for persons in the treatment group).

</tr></table><p>In these estimates of the average daily costs of serving persons in the  		community, we have excluded the expenditures for Social Security, SSI, and food  		stamps. These expenditures can be important costs to the government, as seen in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.2">Table II.2</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableII.3">Table II.3</a>.  		However, they are not social costs. That is, they do not represent the use of  		resources, but instead are a transfer of resources between groups in society.  		Furthermore, while these expenditures are substantial, channeling did not  		appear to have an effect on them. Thus, they are of limited interest in the  		analysis.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Extrapolating Observed Trends</b></i></p>
<p>The extrapolation of the trends observed during the 18 months following  		randomization-was problematic. As mentioned in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a>,  		we chose to make a series of calculations that indicated the general order of  		the magnitude of future trends in service use rather than make specific point  		estimates of future use. In making these calculations, we have attempted to  		follow the basic pattern of effects observed in the data and to incorporate  		general data on service use.</p>
<p>The general extrapolation procedure began by estimating the expected  		number of survival days per client in each six-month period for the ten years  		following the observation period. These survival days were then allocated to  		the community, nursing homes, and hospitals.</p>
<p>A ten-year time horizon was used because it reflects the general life  		expectancy of the evaluation sample. Most sample members will die during this  		period, although some can be expected to live beyond it.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note96">96</a></font></sup> However, ten years represents a useful  		planning horizon since any effects beyond that time would carry relatively  		little weight in decisions about channeling as a program.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note97">97</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Future survival days were estimated by extrapolating the death rates  		observed in the demonstration. There was no evidence of a channeling effect on  		mortality, so we used the average rates observed for the entire sample. These  		rates are presented in Wooldridge and Schore (1986). In general, the death rate  		for the period from months 7 to 18 was fairly constant. We began our  		extrapolation with the death rates observed for months 13 to 18, which were  		approximately 23 percent a year in the basic model sites and 21 percent a year  		in the financial control sites.</p>
<p>It is expected that mortality rates would increase as the sample ages.  		This pattern is observed in most mortality tables for persons more than 65  		years old (see, for example, American Council of Life Insurance, 1983). Such an  		increase might not immediately appear for the demonstration sample because  		survivors might be healthier as a group than the persons who die early in the  		demonstration. This could result because persons who had acute medical problems  		that led them to enroll in channeling could have had those problems resolved  		and then be relatively healthy. Thus, the death rate might fall for a while  		until the general effects of an aging population began to predominate. This is,  		in fact, what appeared to happen during the first six months of the observation  		period. However, the death rate then seemed to stabilize as indicated  		above.</p>
<p>In the extrapolations, we have assumed that death rates will increase at  		the same rate observed for the general U.S population between 85 and 95 years  		old. The death rate for this group ranges from 13 to 26 percent, with an  		average increase of approximately 1.4 percentage points per year (assuming that  		the trends are linear over this range). This is the rate at which we have  		assumed that the death rate for sample members will increase.</p>
<p>The distribution of survival days between the community, nursing homes,  		and hospitals is examined by Wooldridge and Schore (1986). They find that the  		fraction of survival days spent in nursing homes increased substantially over  		the 18 months following randomization. In the basic model, the number of  		nursing home days per 100 survival days increased by 185 percent between the  		first six months and the period 13 to 18 months after randomization. In the  		financial control model, the increase was 200 percent.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether these rapid rates of increase will continue. For  		our extrapolation exercise, we assumed that the rate of nursing home use among  		survivors would continue to rise, but at a slower rate. Specifically, we  		assumed that the rate would increase with the logarithm of time. This rate of  		increase was estimated by fitting a logarithmic function to the observed data  		on nursing home use per survival day (these data were obtained from Wooldridge  		and Schore, 1986, Tables IV.3A and IV.3B). This functional form implies that  		the rate will increase by 14 percent during the first six months following the  		observation period and by less than that amount in subsequent periods. This  		implies that the nursing home rate for survivors will rise from approximately  		17 percent to 35 percent over the ten-year extrapolation period.</p>
<p>Hospital use per survival day declined over the observation period  		(Wooldridge and Schore, 1986, Table V.1). It ranged from 8 to 12 days per 100  		survival days for the first six months to 4 to 7 days per 100 survival days for  		the period 13 to 18 months.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note98">98</a></font></sup> In large part, this decline appears to be  		due to the resolution of acute medical problems facing clients at the time of  		enrollment. It is unclear whether this decline will continue or if it will  		begin to reverse itself as the population ages. As a result, we assumed that  		there would be no further change: surviving sample members would continue to  		use the same general level of hospital services (5 percent of survival days in  		the basic model and 7 percent in the financial control model sites).</p>
<p>Once we estimated the fraction of survival days spent in nursing homes  		and hospitals, the rest of the survival days were allocated to the  		community.</p>
<p>These assumptions are summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.3">Table D.3</a>  		and <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.4">Table D.4</a>. These tables also summarize the  		alternative assumptions used in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#net">Chapter IV</a> to assess the  		implications of changing individual assumptions about mortality rates and the  		allocation of survival days between statuses. The estimates of total social  		costs are also provided for reference.</p>
<p><i><b>3. Costs per Survival Day</b></i></p>
<p>Another perspective on the net costs during the observation period can  		be obtained by examining the cost per survival month. The numerators for these  		estimates are the same as for the estimates of the average daily costs of  		serving persons in nursing homes, hospitals, or the community. The  		denominators, average survival months per client, were obtained from Wooldridge  		and Schore (1986). <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.5A">Table D.5</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.6A">Table D.6</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.7">Table D.7</a> and  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.8">Table D.8</a> present these estimates.</p>
<h3>D. NET GOVERNMENT COSTS OF AN ONGOING CHANNELING  		PROGRAM</h3>
<p>In this section, we consider the net cost to the government of operating  		a permanent channeling program. In doing so, we take a comprehensive view of  		government costs. We include the costs for providing the case management  		services, as well as the impacts of case management on other government costs.  		Thus, in addition to the costs of channeling case management, we examine the  		costs and savings that accrue to Medicare, Medicaid, channeling projects, and  		other public agencies. Our view encompasses costs for formal community  		services, nursing homes, hospitals, and physician and other medical services.  		Our view also encompasses the effects of channeling on social insurance  		programs--specifically, the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance  		(OASDI) program of Social Security, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  		program, food stamps, and Veterans Benefit programs.</p>
<p>Our view is also comprehensive in the sense that we examine the impacts  		on the costs incurred by all eligible persons who were offered channeling  		services. We include both active case management clients and those eligible  		persons who were terminated from the program or who declined  		services.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note99">99</a></font></sup></p>
<p>This comprehensive view enables us to include in our analysis all of the  		direct and indirect impacts that channeling had on the government budget. For  		expositional and planning purposes, we have expressed these impacts on a  		per-case-month basis, despite the inclusion of costs and impacts that accrue  		outside the channeling project budgets. These cost-per-case-month estimates can  		easily be used to estimate the <b>net</b> annual cost to the government of  		operating channeling. All that is required is to multiply the cost per case  		month by 12 to derive costs per case year and then to multiply that product by  		the expected average caseload size of the permanent program.</p>

The average number of reported unmet needs was significantly lower among  			 clients, and the number of persons with more than 3 unmet needs was between 12  			 and 47 percent lower among clients. Satisfaction with service arrangements was  			 generally higher among clients, by as much as 35 percent.

</tr></table><p>In examining the estimates of government costs per case month, we  		consider five issues:</p>
<ol><li>The decision to divide clients into two types--new clients and  		  ongoing clients</li>
<li>The estimation of the costs for these two types of clients</li>
<li>The estimation of the mix of new and ongoing clients in a permanent  		  program</li>
<li>The effect of changing the definition of caseload</li>
<li>The effect of reducing case management costs</li>
</ol><p>We have not considered how costs and benefits would be influenced by  		other potential differences between the demonstration programs and a permanent  		program. These include differences in terms of the case management approach,  		the amount of cost-sharing required, the types of services covered, the  		eligibility criteria, the average caseload size, and the general service  		environment in which the channeling programs would operate. Future budgeting  		and planning efforts would need to consider the effects of these potential  		differences in addition to the specific issues addressed herein.</p>
<p><i><b>1. New and Ongoing Clients</b></i></p>
<p>One of the primary differences between the demonstration projects and a  		permanent program will pertain to the mix of clients. A permanent program will  		have proportionally more long-term clients-that is, clients who have completed  		initial assessments and care planning activities and continue to receive  		ongoing channeling services. The channeling projects operated only for a little  		more than two years under the demonstration. In the long run, they would  		continue to serve not only those clients who continued to want services but  		also new clients. Under plausible circumstances, this process would lead to a  		increasingly larger caseload size that includes proportionally more long-term  		clients. Ultimately, attrition among the long-term clients due to deaths,  		institutionalization, and individual decisions to decline further services  		would balance the inflow of new clients, and the projects would reach a stable  		caseload size and mix.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note100">100</a></font></sup></p>
<p>This process must be considered when the costs of a permanent channeling  		program are estimated. We must examine the extent of any cost differences that  		exist in serving clients of different tenures and must take those cost  		differences into account. In theory, we could have divided all clients into any  		number of groups. We chose a relatively simple approach based on the  		cost-per-survival-day estimates presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.7">Table D.7</a>.  		Those estimates indicated that costs per survival day were substantially higher  		during the first six months after randomization than they were during any other  		time in the observation period. These lower costs reflect lower medical costs  		(probably due to the resolution of some of the acute medical problems that were  		present at the time of enrollment) and the fact that the initial case  		management costs are incurred only as clients are enrolled.</p>
<p>On the basis of this observation, we divided clients into two groups:  		new clients and ongoing clients. The new clients were those who had been  		enrolled for less than six months. The ongoing clients were those who had  		survived and continued to participate for longer than six months. This two-part  		categorization is clearly a rough approximation. It is based on the  		availability of data and the desire to keep the estimation process  		straightforward. Furthermore, this procedure should provide reasonably accurate  		estimates for initial planning purposes. If more detailed estimates were  		needed, a more detailed categorization of clients could be made by using  		approaches similar to those used to extrapolate results beyond the 18-month  		observation period.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Costs for New and Ongoing Clients</b></i></p>
<p>We used the costs per survival month that were observed for the first  		six months following randomization as an estimate of the net cost impact due to  		new clients. For ongoing clients, we used the costs per survival day that were  		observed for the period from 13 to 18 months after randomization.</p>
<p>The decision for new clients is clear; the decision for ongoing clients  		is less so. Costs for ongoing clients will reflect the costs for all groups of  		clients who have been enrolled for longer than six months. From 7 to 12 months  		after randomization, costs per survival day were generally lower than those for  		the period from 13 to 18 months after randomization. In subsequent periods, the  		costs per survival day may rise further as more sample members enter nursing  		homes. The decision to use the costs for the period from 13 to 18 months after  		randomization thus represents a somewhat arbitrary compromise in the absence of  		data on costs in the long run. Again, it would be possible to make further  		categorizations of costs by using the extrapolation procedures, if such a  		effort were necessary for planning.</p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.9">Table D.9</a> presents the estimated net cost per  		survival month for the two periods: months 1 to 6 and months 13 to 18. Separate  		estimates are provided for treatment and control groups and for each of the  		channeling models. These estimates, which include transfer payments as well as  		service costs, indicate the same patterns observed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.7">Table  		D.7</a>.</p>
<p>These costs per <b>survival month</b> estimates were converted into  		costs per <b>case month</b> by multiplying them by the ratio of survival months  		to case months.

</tr></table><p><i><b><a name="sectionD.D.3" id="sectionD.D.3">3. Estimating the Mix of Clients in a  		Permanent Program</a></b></i></p>
<p>As noted, the mix of new and ongoing clients will continue to change  		over time until the projects reach a stable caseload. We can estimate both when  		this will occur and the final mix of clients by using the assumptions and  		procedures that are used to extrapolate the impacts. Those assumptions  		(presented in the previous section) implied that virtually all clients would  		die within ten years after our observation period (that is, 11.5 years after  		randomization). Thus, if projects continue to enroll a constant number of new  		clients each year, their caseloads will continue to rise for 11.5 years, at  		which point they will stabilize. The rate of growth over this 11.5-year period  		will decline as the death and determination rates grow in response to the  		increasing proportion of ongoing clients.</p>
<p>To estimate this process, we used the results of the extrapolation  		process. Those calculations produced an estimate of the number of persons who  		were alive and in the community for each 6-month period in the 11.5 years  		following randomization. We used those estimates to represent the statuses of a  		series of client cohorts enrolled at 6-month intervals over an 11.5-year  		period. When considered in this fashion, this series of estimates indicates the  		number of persons from each enrollment cohort who are still alive and in the  		community. We then summed the numbers for all cohorts except the one enrolled  		for less than six months.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note101">101</a></font></sup> That sum provided our estimate of the  		number of ongoing clients in a permanent program. When it was combined with the  		estimate for the cohort that had been enrolled for fewer than six months (the  		new clients), we could then estimate the proportions of new and ongoing clients  		for a permanent program.</p>
<p>This calculation indicated that approximately 80 percent of the clients  		in a permanent program would be ongoing clients, and that the remaining 20  		percent would be new clients. These proportions were virtually identical for  		both of the channeling models. We used these proportions as the weights to  		estimate the costs per case month for a permanent channeling program.  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.9">Table D.9</a> presents these weighted average estimates,  		which are discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>4. The Effects of Changing the Definition of Caseload</b></i></p>
<p>As we noted in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a>, it is essential that  		one use consistent definitions of caseloads and case months when making these  		calculations. We have followed the definition used by the channeling projects:  		clients were terminated as active clients if they declined services, entered a  		nursing home, moved out of the catchment area, or died. Other programs may use  		different definitions. For example, a person entering a nursing home might  		still be considered a client by a program that maintained contact with such  		clients in order to provide support at a subsequent date if the client desired  		to return to the community.</p>
<p>The specifics of the definition are not critical, as long as the same  		definition is used throughout the calculations. Broader definitions will tend  		to increase the measured size of the caseload. This will correspondingly tend  		to reduce the associated average government costs per case month, since the  		costs and savings for all current and former clients are already included in  		the cost estimate, and since the larger caseload estimate lowers the estimate  		of the costs per case month.</p>
<p>This is illustrated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.9">Table D.9</a>. The estimates  		of net costs per survival month would be consistent with a caseload definition  		that included all surviving persons who had been offered channeling  		services.</p>
<p><i><b>5. The Effect of Reducing Case Management Costs</b></i></p>
<p>It is likely that a permanent channeling program would exhibit different  		costs for providing channeling case management services. Such a program might  		be able to obtain additional efficiencies in program administration and  		provider relations activities.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note102">102</a></font></sup> It might also have additional  		administrative functions (for example, more extensive cost-sharing would  		require additional monitoring and recordkeeping efforts). It is interesting to  		note how sensitive our estimates of net costs per case month would be to the  		level of operating costs.</p>
<p>To assess this sensitivity, we reestimated costs per case month under  		the assumption that channeling case management costs could be cut by an  		additional 10 percent (if all of this reduction were obtained by cutting the  		costs of channeling administration and provider relations, those costs would  		have to be cut by 25 percent). <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.10">Table D.10</a> presents  		these alternative estimates. They show that total government costs per case  		month would change by less than 1 percent in response to a 10 percent cut in  		channeling case management costs. However, the additional costs due to  		channeling--that is, the treatment/control differences--are more sensitive to  		changes in case management costs. A 10 percent reduction in those costs would  		reduce this difference by 5 percent under the basic model and by 2 percent  		under the financial control model.</p>

We have indicated in the right-hand column  		the reports from which these estimates were obtained. In general, the estimates  		were obtained from the other evaluation technical reports, with two exceptions:  		(1) channeling service months and (2) nursing home expenditures during months  		13 through 18. Descriptions of the methods used to estimate these two  		components are included below.</p>
<h3>A. AVERAGE ONGOING SERVICE MONTHS PER CLIENT</h3>
<p>As stated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>, the benchmark estimates  		of ongoing channeling case management costs were derived by multiplying the  		cost channeling per service month by the average number of ongoing service  		months per client.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#note103">103</a></font></sup>  		Thornton, Will, and Davies (1986) estimated the average cost per client month  		of ongoing case management. Ongoing service months are all the months in which  		a client was enrolled after services had begun or after the initial care plan  		had been signed, whichever came first. The average number of service months per  		client in each model was estimated by dividing the total number of ongoing  		service months provided by the projects (including zero months for treatment  		group members who never received ongoing case management services) by the total  		number of clients enrolled. These data were obtained from the demonstration  		client tracking system.</p>
<h3>B. NURSING HOME EXPENDITURES, MONTHS 13 TO 18</h3>
<p>Nursing home expenditures during the first two 6-month periods were  		obtained from Wooldridge and Schore (1986). For these two periods, Medicaid and  		Medicare records were used to estimate expenditures for persons covered by  		Medicaid, and extracts from provider records provided information on nursing  		home expenditures for those individuals who were not covered. For the third  		6-month period, however, only Medicaid and Medicare data were available;  		provider records were not collected. Thus, expenditure data for this time  		period, months 13 to 18, were incomplete.</p>
<p>We estimated nursing home expenditures for this period using data on the  		average number of nursing home days and estimates of the average expenditure  		per nursing home day for treatment and control group members. The procedure  		began with the ratio of average nursing home expenditures per person to average  		nursing home days per person. This ratio was calculated for the period from  		month 7 to month 12 based on records data from Medicare and Medicaid and data  		extracted from provider records for those who were not covered by Medicaid. We  		then estimated the average number of nursing home days for the period from  		month 13 to month 18 based on interview data, which were supplemented by  		Medicaid and Medicare data for those persons who had incomplete followup data.  		In this way, interview data were used to substitute for missing PRE data. The  		final estimate of nursing home expenditures for months 13 to 18 was then  		computed by multiplying the estimated number of days by the estimated cost per  		day.</p>
<p>This method for estimating nursing home expenditures during months 13  		through 18 relies on several assumptions. First, average nursing home  		expenditures per day during months 13 through 18 were assumed to be the same as  		for months 7 through 12. However, Wooldridge and Schore found an 8 percent  		reduction in daily rates between months 1 through 6 and months 7 through 12.  		This reduction appeared to reflect the increasing proportion of ICF days  		relative to SNF days. Thus, our estimates of impacts and mean control group  		expenditures may overstate the actual average.</p>
<p>Second, in using this method, we assumed that the interview data  		accurately reflected the same quality of information as was provided by  		provider records data during the first 12 months. Although interview  		self-reports of nursing home days may not be as accurate as the PRE data, the  		two data sources seem consistent. Furthermore, the interview-based estimates  		for months 13 to 18 continue the trends observed for earlier periods:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The number of nursing home days increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percent of individuals in a nursing home increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average length of stay increased.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Finally, by computing average expenditures for months 13 through 18  		based on aggregate-level averages rather than on estimates of total  		expenditures for each individual, we assumed that the distributions of nursing  		home expenditures and days across individuals remained the same between months  		7 through 12 and months 13 through 18. The absence of noteworthy outliers  		during the first two periods led us to believe that this assumption was  		reasonable.</p>
<p>Overall, this alternative approach should have produced reasonably  		accurate estimates of nursing home expenditures per client during months 13  		through 18. However, these estimates are subject to greater uncertainty than  		the estimates for earlier periods, which were based entirely on records  		data.</p>

<p><a name="note1" id="note1">The</a> six ADL activities include bathing,  			 dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and eating. The seven IADL  			 activities are housekeeping, shopping, meal preparation, taking medicine,  			 traveling, using the telephone, and managing finances. For the purpose of the  			 IADL eligibility criterion, the first two and the last three IADLs were  			 aggregated into two combined categories. Thus, there are four possible IADL  			 areas under which applicants can qualify, plus the cognitive/behavioral  			 impairment category, which counts as one IADL item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Over</a> 90 percent of the sample members were  			 eligible because they had unmet needs. There were relatively few persons  			 enrolled who had their needs met by a fragile informal support system (see  			 Carcagno et al., 1986, Chapter VII, Section C).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">For</a> clients who were required to cost share  			 (about 5 percent of all financial control model clients) the effective price  			 was reduced, but not to zero. Cost sharing is discussed in Carcagno et al.  			 (1986), Chapter VIII, Section C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">One</a> factor that might have mitigated the  			 tendency of this effect to increase costs is the possibility that case managers  			 would be able to substitute less costly community services for those that would  			 otherwise have been consumed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Channeling</a> also was expected to influence  			 hospital use through the problem identification mechanism. However, the net  			 impact of this influence was uncertain. It was expected that case managers  			 would identify medical problems that would otherwise have gone unchecked, but  			 it was unclear whether this would reduce hospital use by fostering the early  			 resolution of these problems or whether it would increase hospital use by  			 ensuring that needed hospital care was provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">Carcagno</a> et al. (1986) detail the design and  			 implementation of the channeling models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">The</a> service environment and the increased use of  			 case management are examined by Carcagno et al. (1986) and by Brown and  			 Phillips (1986).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">Brown</a> (1986) discusses the methods used to make  			 the impact estimates. In addition, the various impact analysis technical  			 reports discuss any specific problems or procedures used to make these  			 estimates. We refer to these technical reports in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter  			 III</a>, in which we discuss the specific impact estimates used in the  			 benefit-cost analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">The</a> estimates could be biased if differential  			 and nonrandom attrition from the treatment and control groups occurred, or if  			 systematic differences existed in the quality of data across groups. In the  			 Brown et al. (1986) analysis of these issues, they generally found little  			 evidence of biases of this sort, and their analysis corrected for those that  			 were found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">As</a> another example, consider the estimated  			 impact on average nursing home expenditures over the first six months under the  			 financial control model. The impact estimate was a reduction of $8, with a 95  			 percent confidence interval of plus or minus $143. Thus, even though this  			 estimate is not statistically significant, a fairly large range of estimates  			 are still plausible. The single best estimate remains, of course, the point  			 estimate of $8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">A</a> social judgment might want to weigh the  			 benefits and costs to some groups differently from those for other groups.  			 Several approaches have been proposed for doing so, based either on the budget  			 decisions of legislatures or on public opinion pools (see Gramlich, 1981, and  			 Weisbrod, 1978). Our study does not attempt to place different weights on the  			 various constituencies involved in channeling. Nevertheless, we do provide  			 estimates of the benefits and costs to these groups so that weights can be  			 applied if desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">For</a> purposes of converting the streams of  			 expenditures into their equivalent value at the time of random assignment, we  			 have discounted all dollar values using a 5 percent real annual rate of  			 interest (i.e., a rate that is net of inflation). The effect of this  			 discounting is small over the 18-month period. This process is described in  			 detail in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">Again,</a> as noted earlier, we use the term  			 client to include all eligible persons who were offered channeling  			 services, regardless of the extent to which they actually  			 participated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">In</a> defining these five groups, we have included  			 the perspectives of all persons who are not clients (or their families and  			 friends) with the other public programs perspective.

<li>
<p><a name="note23" id="note23">During</a> the steady-state phase, state-level  			 costs were 4 percent of total project-level costs (including direct service  			 expenditures) in the financial control model projects.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note32" id="note32">Specifically,</a> we assumed that the cost would  			 equal the initial cost of channeling ($330 per client in the basic model) plus  			 five months of ongoing case management (at $92 per month in the basic model).

<li>
<p><a name="note54" id="note54">As</a> mentioned earlier, we use the term  			 client to refer to all persons offered channeling services,  			 regardless of the extent to which they actually received such  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note55" id="note55">Approximately</a> two-thirds of the Medicare  			 expenditures were for hospital services, so this procedure allocates that  			 fraction of covered physician services to our estimate of the average daily  			 cost of hospitals. Services provided in the community accounted for another 30  			 percent of Medicare expenditures. Services provided in hospitals accounted for  			 the remaining 4 percent. Of course, as we mentioned in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter III</a>, these estimates exclude uncovered physician  			 and other medical costs, which could equal the value of the costs included in  			 the analysis. However, channeling did not appear to affect these types of  			 costs. Thus, the total cost estimates understate true costs, but the estimates  			 of changes due to channeling are probably accurate, despite this  			 omission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note56" id="note56">For</a> example, persons in nursing homes might be  			 expected to have higher service needs and therefore higher service  			 expenditures. In comparing channeling clients (80 percent of whom were in the  			 community) with a 1977 nursing home population, Carcagno et al. (1986)  			 indicated that, although the two groups appeared to be similar overall on  			 measures of functioning, nursing home residents were older and slightly more  			 disabled in eating, dressing, and bathing tasks; channeling sample members were  			 more disabled in toileting, continence, and mobility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note57" id="note57">This</a> approach was chosen over a simpler  			 procedure that would have multiplied an estimate of the expected average number  			 of survival days per client by the observed average cost per survival day. Such  			 an approach would err to the extent that the mix of services used by survivors  			 changed over time. We observed surviving sample members to have an increasing  			 rate of institutionalization over the first 18 months. Since nursing home  			 expenditures generally exceed those for care in the community, further shifts  			 of this type would tend to increase the average cost per survival day. The  			 proposed procedure that treats nursing home, hospital, and community services  			 separately eliminates this specific problem. For reference purposes we have  			 included estimates of the average costs per survival day in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>.</p>

<p><a name="note61" id="note61">We</a> return to this issue in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#interpret">Chapter V</a>, where we assess the size of the effects on  			 nursing home required for channeling to break even.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note62" id="note62">While</a> the small client savings for formal  			 community services are likely to continue, those for nursing homes may become  			 government savings. This could occur if the observed nursing home savings were  			 concentrated among persons who would have been spending down their assets to  			 pay for nursing home services in the absence of channeling. In this case, some  			 of these persons would have eventually become eligible for Medicaid benefits.  			 At that time, savings due to channeling efforts to keep these persons in the  			 community would accrue to Medicaid. Thus, there could be some future government  			 savings, although they would be small compared with the costs of channeling  			 case management and the extra formal community service arranged by  			 channeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note63" id="note63">As</a> discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter  			 III</a>, functioning was measured as the number of ADL impairments. These  			 impairments were determined by asking respondents whether they received  			 assistance with the five activities of daily living. Because of channeling  			 services, some clients might have reported a limitation (i.e., receiving help),  			 even though they could perform the activity independently. Applebaum (1986)  			 examines this issue in detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note64" id="note64">Evidence</a> indicated that some substitution of  			 formal for informal care occurred under the financial control model. However,  			 this effect seemed to be concentrated among friends and neighbors, and not the  			 primary caregivers, who were more likely to be spouses or daughters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note65" id="note65">This</a> uncertainty also surrounds the financial  			 control model. In that model, we did not observe persons who had extremely high  			 expenditures for formal community services, but, again, we could have a problem  			 in terms of our not representing rare individuals. As in the basic model, our  			 estimates of the impacts on expenditures in the financial control model are  			 consistent with the evidence from the large interview sample: private  			 expenditures for formal community services declined slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note66" id="note66">It</a> is also possible that the nursing home  			 service needs and costs of persons for whom nursing home days are reduced would  			 fall below the average. Thus, the savings from keeping these persons out of  			 nursing homes would be less than indicated here. Alternatively, if channeling  			 affected those persons who had such extreme needs that community service costs  			 could exceed nursing home costs, then preventing or delaying nursing home  			 admission would generate net costs rather than savings.</p>

(1986) eliminated these cases from the samples used to estimate impacts on  			 expenditures incurred by each payment source (including Medicare and Medicaid).  			 This restriction had only a very small impact on the estimates for payment  			 sources other than private (and other public).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note87" id="note87">This</a> is the period of the demonstration. The  			 channeling projects in most sites continued on after this period using other  			 funding.</p>

<p><a name="note88" id="note88">The</a> implicit price deflator for gross national  			 product and the consumer price index are reported on a quarterly basis by the  			 Council of Economic Advisors (1985).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note89" id="note89">Use</a> of a single index has expositional and  			 computational advantages. Also, the use of a broad-based index like the  			 implicit price deflator for GNP more accurately captures changes in the general  			 price level than do more narrowly focused measures like the consumer price  			 index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note90" id="note90">Shadow</a> prices are used to value changes in  			 resource use where we did not collect data on dollar expenditures. In the case  			 of owner-occupied housing, we imputed a dollar value from the reported number  			 of rooms in the dwelling and its geographic location. The values used in this  			 imputation procedure were all expressed in 1984 dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note91" id="note91">Suppose</a> a $1,000 benefit occurs 10 years from  			 now. What present value invested at a 5 percent return per annum would yield  			 $1,000 ten years from now? Call that value PV. PV invested today would earn 5  			 percent a year for 10 years or (1 + 0.05)<sup>10</sup>. So its value 10 years  			 from now is PV(1 + 0.05)<sup>10</sup> = $1,000. The present value is therefore  			 equal to 1000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>10</sup> = $614. This is the present value of a  			 $1,000 benefit occurring 10 years from now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note92" id="note92">Baumol</a> (1968) provides a theoretical foundation  			 for measuring the social discount rate. He suggests that it should measure the  			 rate of return that the resources used for the public investment would have  			 earned otherwise in the private sector. Bradford (1975) suggests the use of the  			 rate at which consumers trade off future for current consumption (the social  			 rate-of-time preference). These approaches lead to the same rate if all markets  			 are competitive. In the presence of markets characterized by monopoly power,  			 inflation, taxes, and uncertainty, however, the approaches lead to quite  			 different results and are difficult to implement empirically in a correct  			 manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note93" id="note93">The</a> 10 percent rate is mandated by the Office  			 of Management and Budget (1972) for evaluating government investments. These  			 rates are all expressed as real annual rates--that is, as annual rates net of  			 the effect of inflation. Real rates are appropriate because inflation was taken  			 into account by the procedures outlined in the previous section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note94" id="note94">As</a> mentioned in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#observe">Chapter  			 III</a>, the estimates of other covered medical services include only  			 expenditures reported in the Medicare and Medicaid records. We do not know the  			 fraction of total expenditures for other medical services that are reported in  			 these sources, but data from the National Health Care Expenditures Survey  			 (Wilensky and Bernstein, 1983, and Berk and Schur, 1985) indicate that our  			 estimates may exclude up to half the total other medical expenditures. These  			 potentially missing costs mean that the estimates presented here should be  			 interpreted with caution. As shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#tableD.2">Table D.2</a>, the  			 other medical service cost allocations account for no more than 18 percent of  			 community costs, 16 percent of hospital costs, and 2 percent of nursing home  			 costs. As a result, the missing components of other medical services (i.e.,  			 uncovered physician and other medical services and supplies) are not likely to  			 have a substantial effect on the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note95" id="note95">The</a> other covered medical services allocated to  			 each status (community, nursing home, and hospital) were divided by the average  			 number of days clients were in each of those statuses in order to estimate the  			 average daily costs. These estimates correspond to the period 13 to 18 months  			 after randomization (that is, the last six months of the observation  			 period).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note96" id="note96">Given</a> the death rate assumptions discussed  			 later, over 98 percent of the sample in both models would be expected to have  			 died by the end of the ten-year extrapolation period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note97" id="note97">This</a> small weight reflects many factors, but  			 three are particularly important. First, the present value of dollars more than  			 ten years after the end of the observation period (11.5 years after enrollment)  			 would be less than 60 percent of the same dollars at enrollment (assuming a 5  			 percent annual discount rate). Thus, effects after this ten-year point would  			 have to be much larger than any of those observed, before their discounted  			 value would be sufficiently large to change the qualitative conclusions of the  			 benefit-cost analysis. Second, given the level of uncertainty inherent in the  			 analysis of social programs, outcomes assumed to occur more than ten years  			 after the observation period must be considered very skeptically. Finally,  			 after ten years, so few clients are likely to be alive that their will be  			 virtually no costs after that period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note98" id="note98">In</a> the basic model, the number of hospital days  			 per 100 survival days fell from 8.3 in the first six months to 4.8 in the last  			 six months. In the financial control model, the fall was from 11.5 to 6.6  			 hospital days per 100 survival days. These rates are presented in Wooldridge  			 and Schore (1986, Table V.1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note99" id="note99">Of</a> course, this view is comprehensive only in  			 terms of government costs. We have excluded the costs and savings to clients  			 and the effects on the quality of the lives of both clients and their informal  			 caregivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note100" id="note100">It</a> is possible that projects would never reach  			 a stable size, particularly if enrollments or terminations occurred in large,  			 irregularly spaced groups. We have no information that this would be the case.  			 Consequently, we have assumed that clients would be enrolled at an even rate  			 over time, and that the projects would reach a stable caseload size and mix. We  			 return to this issue in <a href="../daltcp/reports/1986/cost.htm#sectionD.D.3">subsection 3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note101" id="note101">In</a> our calculations, we have assumed that the  			 fraction of clients in the community who are active in channeling remains the  			 same after the period from 13 to 18 months after randomization. As Carcagno et  			 al. (1986) discuss, some clients who were in the community did decline  			 channeling services and were terminated. We have no data on how many more  			 clients would decline services after our observation period. We feel that this  			 approximation is reasonable. If additional community residents were terminated  			 from the program, we would expect net costs per case month to be lower than  			 those shown here, although this is not certain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note102" id="note102">The</a> extent of such efficiencies is uncertain.  			 Our cost estimates reflect operations during the demonstration steady-state  			 phase, when research costs were at their lowest and the projects had been able  			 to establish themselves in their communities. Thornton, Will, and Davies (1986)  			 found that the costs associated with administration and provider relations for  			 this period were more than 25 percent below those costs earlier in the  			 demonstration. Thus, savings beyond this point are unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note103" id="note103">Average</a> initial costs (those for outreach,  			 screening, initial assessment, etc.) were estimated on a per-client basis.  			 Thus, they are not considered to be a function of the length of  			 participation.</p>
