</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>This project was designed to explore the utilization and expenditures to  		Medicaid of substance exposed children, using data on the experience of  		children born in California in 1986,1987 and 1988. The Medicaid experience of  		these children in their first two years of life was the focus of the analysis.  		The study also included a randomly sampled comparison group of Medicaid  		children in California without identified substance exposure problems. The  		analysis was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, data from the  		Medicaid Tape-to-Tape data set for California were analyzed. Tape-to-Tape is a  		multi-State Medicaid data base developed by the Office of Research and  		Demonstrations at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). In the  		second phase of the analysis, the Medicaid Tape-to-Tape data were merged with  		California Vital Statistics data (birth records). This merger enabled the  		analysis of factors (substance exposure and others) associated with low birth  		weight among Medicaid infants, as well as the subsequent impacts of low birth  		weight, substance exposure, and other factors upon Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>There are numerous problems with identifying substance exposed infants.  		For example, physicians are reported to be reluctant to identity children as  		having substance exposure problems. Pregnant women are also reported to be  		hesitant to seek treatment for their substance abuse problems during pregnancy.  		They fear losing custody of their children or other legal problems if their  		substance abuse is known. Finally, many treatment programs refuse to treat  		pregnant women.</p>
<p>To identity a study cohort of young children with a potential  		drug/alcohol exposure problem, a broad definition of substance exposure was  		used. The inpatient and outpatient claims files of all women who delivered  		under Medicaid from 1986-1988 were searched for the two years prior to delivery  		and six months post delivery to see if there were diagnoses indicating drug or  		alcohol abuse problems. The rationale for going beyond the immediate period of  		pregnancy was that if there was substance abuse in the period preceding  		pregnancy or immediately after delivery, there was a reasonable probability  		that abuse (and thus exposure for the child) occurred during the period of  		pregnancy. The claims files of all Medicaid children born in 1986-1988 in  		California were also searched to identity children with a direct diagnosis code  		indicating drug or alcohol exposure problems.</p>
<p>With this approach, 8,862 children under age 2 with diagnoses related to  		substance exposure were identified in preliminary study data. Of these, 74.3%  		were identified solely through some indication of drug/alcohol abuse in their  		mothers' files. Another 21.4% were identified solely through diagnoses related  		to drug or alcohol exposure problems in their own Medicaid files. A final 4.2%  		had indications of drug/alcohol problems in both their mothers' files and their  		own files. There were 15,814 children in the randomly selected comparison group  		sample.</p>
<p>The study methodology did not identity nearly as many substance exposed  		children in the Medicaid population as other researchers have suggested. The  		final study cohort of 7,802 children represented 1.4% to 1.9% of the children  		born in 1986, 1987 and 1988 who were enrolled in California's Medicaid  		program.<font><a href="#note1">1</a></font> However, without direct  		testing, the study methodology was limited in its ability to identity children  		with substance exposure. Other researchers have found that the identification  		rate of substance exposed infants is increased from 3 to 5 times if direct  		testing is utilized. There were also limitations regarding the diagnosis coding  		in California Medicaid claims data.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the number of substance exposed children enrolled in the  		California Medicaid program increased substantially over the three year study  		period. The number of substance exposed children identified from Medi-Cal data  		was 3,113 for those born in 1988, compared to 2,159 for those children born in  		1986. This represented an increase of 44.2%. The number of substance exposed  		children was growing at a faster rate than the overall enrollment of children  		under age 1 in California's Medicaid program. From 1986 to 1988, the number of  		child enrollees under age 1 on Medicaid grew by only 8.8%.</p>
<p>There were differences between the substance exposed cohort and the  		control group in the distribution of children by Medicaid eligibility group.  		The most striking difference is the higher proportion of substance exposed  		children in foster care. About 24% of children in the study cohort were in  		foster care, compared to 2% in the control group. Other researchers have also  		reported a high proportion of substance exposed children in foster care.</p>
<p>Substance exposed children showed a stronger attachment to the Medicaid  		program in their first two years of life than children in the control group.  		Children in the study cohort averaged about 18 months enrollment over a 24  		month period, compared to 13 months for children in the control group. Over  		half the study cohort children were enrolled for 22-24 months, compared to only  		about 30% of the control group.</p>
<p>An important study question was whether or not substance exposed  		children have greater health care needs and thus higher rates of Medicaid  		utilization than other Medicaid children in the first two years of life.  		Generally, study data showed that substance exposed children were more likely  		to be inpatient hospital users in both the first and second years of life than  		other children on Medicaid. Adjusting study data for length of enrollment only  		did not change this basic pattern.</p>
<p>Substance exposed children also had higher use rates for  		physician/ambulatory care services, and they averaged more visits per user than  		children in the control group. However, this difference was reduced in the  		first year of life and disappeared in the second year of life, using data  		adjusted for length of enrollment.</p>
<p>Generally, study data indicated that substance exposed children were  		considerably more expensive to the Medicaid program than other Medicaid  		children of the same age. The average Medicaid expenditure per substance  		exposed child over the first two years of life was $2,285, compared to $1,551  		for the control group. This represents a difference of about 47%. However, much  		of this expenditure difference is attributable to longer average lengths of  		enrollment for the study cohort. With adjustments for enrollment, the Medicaid  		expenditure per child year of enrollment was $1,664 for the study cohort,  		compared to $1,472 for the control group. This represents a difference of about  		13%, or $192 per person year of enrollment ($384 for two years).</p>
<p>Thus, substance exposed children had greater utilization and  		expenditures under Medicaid than other children. However, much of this  		difference was attributable to longer length of enrollment, not greater health  		care needs. This result is important because some anecdotal information has  		implied that thy long-term health care needs (and expenses) of substance  		exposed children far exceed those of other children. Study data over a two year  		period do not support this conclusion, when a broad definition of substance  		exposure for children is used.</p>
<p>As with most insured groups, a majority of children did not have  		expenditures nearly as great as the average. The median expenditure per  		substance exposed child was $465 over the two year study period, compared to a  		median expenditure of $240 per child for the control group. Related to this  		result, 10% of the children in the study cohort accounted for 73% of the total  		Medicaid expenditures for the substance exposed group. Similarly, 10% of the  		children in the comparison group accounted for 79% of that group's total  		Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of study data was tested, using more conservative  		definitions of substance exposure. One analysis focused on only those children  		with direct diagnoses of substance exposure in their own claims records. With  		this approach, the expenditure difference between substance exposed children  		and other Medicaid children was substantially greater. Children who were  		directly diagnosed with substance exposure problems had expenditures almost  		twice the rate of other Medicaid children in the first two years of life, even  		with adjustments for length of enrollment. Due to their high costs, this group  		of children with direct diagnoses of substance exposure in their records may be  		good candidates for case management under State Medicaid programs.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, study results confirmed both the growing numbers  		and high proportion of substance exposed children in foster care. Further,  		substance exposed children in foster care had higher Medicaid expenditures than  		other substance exposed children. The higher Medicaid costs of the substance  		exposed foster care subgroup, coupled with their costs in foster care payments,  		add a growing burden on a system already under financial pressure.</p>
<p>One unexpected study finding was that many of the substance exposed  		children had mothers with strong attachments to the Medicaid program. Mother  		and child Medicaid files were linked for 87% of the study cohort, indicating  		that these infants had Medicaid-covered deliveries. Generally, the mothers of  		substance exposed children were older than mothers of the control group  		children, and the study cohort mothers showed longer enrollment on Medicaid  		prior to delivery. For example, over one-quarter of the study cohort mothers  		had been on Medicaid for the entire two years preceding delivery, compared to  		only 14% of the comparison group mothers. This result reinforces the need for  		Medicaid treatment services directed to adults with substance abuse  		problems.</p>
<p>To examine the effects of substance exposure on birth outcomes, the  		1986, 1987, and 1988 California Tape-to-Tape data for the study cohort and  		control group were linked to California Vital Statistics data for the same  		years. Approximately 77% of the originally identified children were  		successfully matched with the Vital Statistics Data. There were two main  		reasons for unsuccessful matches. First, not all children who were enrolled in  		California Medicaid sometime during their first two years of life were born in  		California. Second, the Vital Statistics file contained only the mother's last  		name. For common last names, this limited the ability to match Vital Statistics  		and Tape-to-Tape records.</p>
<p>The California Vital Statistics data provided information on a number of  		variables not available in the Tape-to-Tape data, including the race/ethnicity  		and marital status of the mother, pregnancy and delivery histories, and birth  		outcomes. Substantial differences in the race/ethnicity compositions of the  		study cohort and control groups were found. Mothers of children in the study  		cohort were much more likely to be Black than mothers of children in the  		control group; the converse was true for mothers of Hispanic origin. Thirty  		percent of the mothers in the study cohort were Black--twice the percentage for  		the control group. Twenty-six percent of the mothers in the study group were of  		Hispanic origin compared to 41.5% of the mothers in the control group.</p>
<p>Mothers in the study cohort were also more likely to have had previous  		pregnancy terminations, pregnancy complications, and complications with  		delivery. In addition, more than 74% of the mothers in the study cohort had  		previously given birth, compared to about 60% of the control group.</p>
<p>One of the most significant findings pertained to the relationship  		between substance exposure and premature birth and low birth weight. Over 19%  		of the study group infants were premature (or very premature) versus 12.4% of  		the control group infants. Moreover, these figures probably underestimate the  		actual incidence of premature births because gestational age was not available  		for 7.9% of the study cohort and 5.5% of the control group.</p>
<p>The incidence of low birth weight among the study cohort was even more  		striking. Over 18% of the infants in the study cohort had a birth weight of  		less than 2,500 grams; the same was true of only 7.7% of the control group.</p>
<p>In addition to substance exposure, a number of other factors were found  		to be associated with low birth weight. For both the study and control groups,  		mothers of very low birth weight infants (under 1,500 grams) were more likely  		to be Black than to be members of other race/ethnicity groups. Study cohort  		mothers of low birth weight infants (1,500 to 2,499 grams) were also more  		likely to be Black, but this was not true of low birth weight infants in the  		control group.</p>
<p>In the study cohort, mothers of low (or very low) birth weight infants  		were more likely to be age 30 or older. The percentage of control group mothers  		age 30 or older was substantially lower than for the study cohort in each birth  		weight category (e.g., 15.8% of mothers of very low birth weight infants in the  		control group were age 30 or older, compared to 38.7% of mothers in the study  		cohort).</p>
<p>Finally, for both the study cohort and the control group, mothers of low  		or very low birth weight infants were more likely to have experienced previous  		pregnancy terminations, complications with pregnancy, or complications with  		delivery. Mothers of low or very low birth weight infants were also more likely  		to live in urbanized counties, especially in the study cohort.</p>
<p>The descriptive findings demonstrated that substance exposed children  		had higher average Medicaid expenditures and were more likely to have low birth  		weights than other Medicaid children. The link between low birth weight and  		Medicaid expenditure levels has been well-established in the literature.  		Consequently, it seemed plausible that substance exposure might affect Medicaid  		expenditures both directly and indirectly through low birth weight. For several  		reasons, however, the relationship between substance exposure and Medicaid  		costs was complex. First, the demographic characteristics of the study cohort  		and control group were very different. Second, study group membership increased  		the likelihood of having an underweight birth, but low (and very low) birth  		weight was also related to other factors, such as the demographic  		characteristics of the mother. Thus, to the extent that substance exposure  		influenced Medicaid costs, some of this effect might be explained by  		demographic characteristics, low birth weight, and other factors.</p>
<p>To examine the effects of substance exposure on Medicaid expenditures,  		controlling for the effects of other variables, a two-step multivariate  		analysis was conducted. The first step examined the factors associated with the  		probability of under weight births. This analysis confirmed the descriptive  		findings. The probability of low (or very low) birth weight was found to be  		associated with the race/ethnicity of the mother, mother's marital status, age,  		pregnancy and delivery history, length of Medicaid enrollment, and the sex of  		the infant. After controlling for all of these other factors, substance  		exposure was found to have a strong additional positive influence on the  		probability of an under weight birth.</p>
<p>The second stage of the analysis examined the predictors of Medicaid  		expenditures (adjusted for length of enrollment). As expected, under weight  		births were found to be an important predictor of higher Medicaid expenditures.  		In addition, Medicaid expenditures were influenced by the age and  		race/ethnicity of the mother. One or more congenital malformations, cesarean  		delivery, child foster care status, and male children were also associated with  		higher expenditures. A mother's history of previous live births (still living),  		urban county of residence, child medically needy status, and the dummy variable  		for 1988 were all associated with lower Medicaid expenditures. After  		controlling for all of these influences, substance exposure was found to have a  		separate and identifiable effect of increasing Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>The research indicated that the effects of substance exposure on  		Medicaid expenditures were extraordinarily complex. For example, the indirect  		effect of substance exposure on Medicaid expenditures, through the influence on  		low birth weight, was examined in this study. But it is reasonable to expect  		that there are similar interactions of substance exposure with race, foster  		care status, and other variables. More research on these interactions is  		necessary for a fuller understanding of the Medicaid expenditure impacts and  		policy implications of substance exposed children.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In recent years, a new social problem has developed--the growing numbers  		of children born to mothers who are substance abusers (Slutsker, Smith,  		Higginson and Fleming, 1993; Gomby and Shiono, l99l). Preliminary research  		suggests that these children experience higher than expected problems of few  		growth and development during the perinatal period (Phibbs, Bateman and  		Schwartz, 1991; Zuckerman, 1991). There are also anecdotal reports that they  		have medical problems which are long-term, although definitive information is  		still lacking on this pattern. The potential health care costs of substance  		exposed children are a concern to both the Federal government and States  		(Phibbs, 1991). While the abuse of alcohol and other drugs affects women at all  		income levels, a disproportionate share of substance abuse is believed to occur  		among low-income women, leading to higher costs for public programs. For  		example, California officials have estimated that three-quarters of the medical  		care costs for drug exposed infants is paid by the Medicaid and California  		Children's Services Programs (State of California, Office of Legislative  		Analyst, 1989).</p>
<p>This project was designed to explore the utilization and expenditures to  		Medicaid of substance exposed children, using data on the experience of  		children born in 1986, 1987 and 1988 who were enrolled in California's Medicaid  		program (often referred to as Medi-Cal) sometime during their first two years  		of life. The Medicaid experience of these children in their first two years of  		life was the focus of the analysis. The study also included a randomly sampled  		comparison group of Medicaid children in California without identified  		substance exposure problems.</p>
<p>The methodology by which these children could be identified and the  		issues of utilization and expenditures which could be explored were dependent  		on the data that are included in California's Medicaid files. Key issues that  		could be analyzed for the study cohort of substance exposed children  		included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Identification of Substance Exposed Children</b>. How feasible is  			 it to identity children with drug and alcohol exposure problems using Medicaid  			 administrative data? What are the limitations of such an approach? How many  			 children had direct diagnoses in their records which indicate substance  			 exposure problems? How many additional children were identified as potential  			 substance exposure victims by searching their mothers' records before, during  			 and after pregnancy for diagnoses indicating substance abuse? How many children  			 were identified by specific diagnosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Incidence</b>. What was the incidence of drug and alcohol exposed  			 children in California's Medicaid program in 1986, 1987 and 1988? Did the  			 proportion of Medicaid children with such problems increase over time? How do  			 study data on incidence compare with estimates by other researchers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Personal Characteristics and Medicaid Enrollment Patterns</b>.  			 What were the personal characteristics of substance exposed children? To what  			 extent were study children concentrated in California's major urban areas, such  			 as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Long Beach and Oakland?  			 What was the distribution of the study cohort by length of enrollment in  			 Medicaid in the 24 months following birth? What proportion were born into the  			 Medicaid program, i.e. had Medicaid-covered deliveries? What Medicaid  			 eligibility groups did they quality under? How many were in California's foster  			 care program?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Information About Their Mothers</b>. How old were the mothers of  			 study children at the time they gave birth? How long had they been enrolled in  			 Medicaid (looking back 24 months prior to delivery)? How many were covered  			 under Medicaid during the entire pregnancy? What proportion received AFDC cash  			 assistance? How many had multiple deliveries during the 3 year study  			 period?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medicaid Utilization and Expenditures</b>. What were the user  			 rates for inpatient hospital care and physician/ambulatory services during the  			 first and second years of life? What was the distribution of Medicaid  			 expenditures for study children? Was the pattern of expenditures highly skewed?  			 What proportion of expenditures was for inpatient hospital care? Did the  			 pattern of expenditures change over time?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As mentioned earlier, the substance exposed study cohort was compared to  		a control group of Medicaid children without drug/alcohol exposure. Of  		particular interest was the extent to which substance exposed children were  		more expensive to Medicaid than other enrolled children.</p>
<p>In addition to an overall analysis of substance exposed children,  		various subgroups of substance-exposed children were investigated,  		including:</p>
<ul><li> Children directly identified as substance exposed compared to  		  children whose identification for inclusion in the study was based on problems  		  of drug or alcohol exposure in their mothers' Medicaid records;</li>
<li>Foster care children; </li>
<li> Children with continuous enrollment in Medicaid in the two years  		  following birth compared to those with non-continuous enrollment; and,</li>
<li>Children with high Medicaid expenditures.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, the California Medicaid data were linked to the Vital  		Statistics birth records for California. This enabled the analysis of the  		effects of substance exposure on birth outcomes and of birth outcomes on  		Medicaid expenditures. In addition, the Vital Statistics data contained  		information on mothers' pregnancy and delivery histories, marital status, race,  		and prenatal care. These factors have been shown to be important predictors of  		birth weight and Medicaid cost in other studies, so it was important to control  		for them when attempting to isolate the effects of substance exposure on birth  		weight and Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>Key Issues that could be analyzed with the linked data set included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Factors Associated with Low and Very Low Birth Weight</b>. Are  			 the factors associated with the risk of low birth weight the same as those  			 associated with the risk of very low birth weight? Is substance exposure a  			 statistically significant predictor of low birth weight and/or very low birth  			 weight?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Factors Associated with Medicaid Expenditures</b>. What factors  			 are associated with Medicaid expenditures? If substance exposure has an  			 influence on low or very low birth weight, and if birth weight, in turn,  			 influences Medicaid expenditures, does substance exposure have an additional  			 effect on Medicaid expenditures over and above its indirect effect through the  			 risk of low birth weight?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>California was chosen as the State for this study of substance exposed  		children for two reasons. Most important, longitudinal California Medicaid data  		were readily available for research (discussed in greater detail below).  		Second, California had the second largest State Medicaid program nationwide  		(behind New York) both in numbers of recipients and expenditures in 1988. At  		that point, California accounted for approximately 17% of recipients and 11 %  		of expenditures under Medicaid (HCFA, unpublished Form 2082 data). However, it  		was recognized that California was not representative of many State Medicaid  		programs. During the period of the study, California had elected to include  		more of the optional eligibility groups for coverage of children than many  		other States, and California had the highest income thresholds for Medicaid  		eligibility within the contiguous States. As a result, the study findings have  		to be interpreted with caution with regard to their applicability to other  		State Medicaid programs.</p>
<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>The analysis undertaken in this study consisted of two phases. In the  		first phase, data from the Medicaid Tape-to-Tape data set for California were  		analyzed. Tape-to-Tape is a multi-State Medicaid data base developed by the  		Office of Research and Demonstrations at the Health Care Financing  		Administration (HCFA). The Tape-to-Tape data set includes every Medicaid  		enrollee and every claim processed on California's Medicaid Management  		Information System (MMIS) since 1980. These data have been subject to extensive  		editing, code mapping, and reformatting to produce uniform, person-based  		Medicaid records suitable for research. The Tape-to-Tape data used for this  		study cover the period from 1984 through 1989 to allow observation prior to  		delivery for the mothers and after delivery for the children. In the second  		phase of the study, the Tape-to-Tape data were merged with birth records from  		the California Vital Statistics file for 1986, 1987 and 1988.</p>
<h3><a name="sec1.1" id="sec1.1">Study Cohort Selection</a></h3>
<p>To identify a study cohort of children with a potential drug/alcohol  		exposure problem, the following methodology was used. First, all women with a  		delivery diagnosis code or an ancillary care or accommodation code related to  		delivery in the California Medicaid inpatient claims files in 1986-1988 were  		identified. This file included 440,155 women. Their inpatient and outpatient  		claims for the two years prior to delivery and six months post delivery were  		then searched to see if there was any indication of drug or alcohol abuse  		problems. Limiting the time period to only the 9 months of pregnancy would have  		seriously constrained the study. Many women are reported to be reluctant to  		seek treatment for their substance abuse problems during pregnancy. They fear  		losing custody of their children or other legal problems it their substance  		abuse is known. Also, many treatment centers refuse to treat pregnant women  		(Horgan, Rosenbach, Ostby and Butricia, 1991; Dicker and Leighton, 1991). The  		rationale for going beyond the immediate period of pregnancy was that if there  		was substance abuse in the period preceding pregnancy or immediately after  		delivery, there was a reasonable probability that abuse also occurred during  		the period of pregnancy.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a> shows the ICD-9-CM diagnosis and  		service codes used to identity women with substance abuse problems. These codes  		were selected after a review of other research efforts directed to the  		identification of substance abusers and substance exposed children (GAO, 1990;  		Dicker and Leighton, 1991). Since there is some debate about the  		appropriateness of some of the codes (for example, the inclusion of accidental  		drug poisoning codes in E850-EB60), sensitivity analyses omitting several of  		the questionable codes were undertaken as part of the study. Analyses were also  		undertaken that limited the time period during which the substance abuse by  		mothers occurred to only the 9 months of pregnancy. The detailed results of  		these sensitivity analyses are reported later, but it seems appropriate to note  		here that they did not change the direction of the study findings.</p>
<p>As a second step, all children born in 1986-1988 were identified in the  		California Medicaid enrollment files. This file included 425,715 children.  		Using the same codes shown in <a href="#Exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>, the inpatient  		and outpatient files for these children were searched to identity children with  		a diagnosis code indicating drug or alcohol exposure problems.</p>

</tr></table><p>Third, the files were searched to find the children in the California  		Medicaid Tape-to-Tape file who were born to the mothers with substance abuse  		problems, linking mothers and babies by case number, date of birth/delivery  		date and name. A similar approach was used to find the mothers of the children  		identified as having drug or alcohol exposure problems. Thus, mothers were  		matched to their children and children to their mothers. In some instances,  		matches from mother to child were not possible, because the children were never  		enrolled in the Medicaid program (presumably due to a variety of causes such as  		the pregnancy outcome being a miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion, or infant  		death; failure of the mother to enroll the child in Medicaid; or ineligibility  		of the child and mother for Medicaid coverage shortly following birth). There  		is also the possibility that the indication of delivery was a false positive  		(for example, the mother might have been in false labor). Child to mother  		matches were also not achieved in some instances. This was expected since some  		children with drug or alcohol exposure problems are not enrolled into Medicaid  		until they are several months old, and their mothers may never be enrolled in  		the program.</p>
<p>Approximately 2,200 children were excluded from the study cohort. Three  		broad groups were excluded: (1) children with any enrollment under Medi-Cal  		capitated programs or other special county initiatives during the study period;  		(2) any children with "shared" Medi-Cal individual identification numbers (i.e.  		identification numbers which appear to have been used by more than one person);  		and (3) children who appeared to have more than one Medicaid identification  		number. Children were also excluded if their mothers had shared identification  		numbers. The capitated and special initiative children were excluded since  		complete claims data were not available on their Medicaid utilization and  		expenditures. Children and mothers with shared identification numbers as well  		as children with multiple identification numbers were excluded since their  		utilization and expenditure records were contaminated by the presence of  		multiple persons. The number of excluded children was proportionate with the  		extent to which these groups occurred in the overall population of Medicaid  		children in California.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit2">Exhibit 2</a> below depicts the preliminary study  		cohort by source of identification for the study (i.e. child's files, mother's  		files, or both) and Medicaid file status (linked mother/child files, child only  		files and mother only files). Some 8,862 children were identified in  		preliminary study data for inclusion in the study cohort. Of these, 6,588  		(74.3%) were identified solely through some indication of drug/alcohol abuse in  		their mothers' files. Another 1,899 children (21.4%) were identified solely  		through some identification of drug or alcohol exposure problems in their own  		Medicaid files. A final 375 children (4.2%) had indications of drug/alcohol  		problems in their mothers' files and their own files.</p>
<p>Both mother and child Medicaid files were linked for 6.768 children,  		76.4% of the preliminary study cohort. For another 1,034 children (1 1.7% of  		the preliminary study cohort), only the children's files could be identified.  		For the final 1,060 children (12.0% of the preliminary study cohort), only the  		mothers' records were available. Unfortunately, it is not possible with  		Tape-to-Tape data to determine whether all the children in this latter group  		were ever born. All that is known was that there is an indication of delivery  		in the mothers' Medicaid files.</p>

<p>A comparison group of children without drug or alcohol exposure  		diagnoses was drawn from the California Medicaid files. However, the magnitude  		of the population required that a sample be used. The size of the comparison  		group sample was set larger than the study cohort for two reasons. First,  		preliminary analysis showed that there was a higher proportion of "child only"  		records among the comparison group. Thus, a larger sample was needed to insure  		there were a sufficient number of linked mother/baby cases in the comparison  		group. Second, since the data were to be linked with California birth records,  		it was important that the size of the comparison group be set large enough to  		support planned analyses with this data. In particular, one objective was to  		detect small differences in the percentage (1.5 percentage points) of low birth  		weight infants between the study and comparison groups.</p>
<p>In the California Medicaid program, enrollees are assigned both an  		individual identification number and a case number. The case number is used to  		link family members together. The case number is a 7 digit number imbedded in  		the 13 digit individual identification number. Since mothers and children share  		a common case number, this number was used to select the comparison group  		sample from the two rosters of delivering mothers and children born in 1986,  		1987 and 1988. This gave both delivering mothers and children an equal chance  		of being selected for the comparison group. The last two digits of the case  		number in California are randomly distributed across all counties. Two random  		numbers from 1 to 99 were selected. Then all women who delivered in 1986, 1987  		and 1988 with a case number ending with the selected digits were identified, as  		were all children born in 1986, 1987 and 1988 who were enrolled in the Medicaid  		program at some point during their first 24 months of life with case numbers  		ending with the selected numbers. Then mothers and children were matched.  		Omitted from the comparison group were any mother/child pairs which were  		selected for the substance exposed study cohort. The comparison group was also  		subject to the same exclusions used for the study cohort (see page 7). Just  		over 3,000 children were excluded.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit3">Exhibit 3</a> below shows the study cohort and the  		comparison group cohort by Medicaid file status (linked mother/child files,  		child only files and mother only files). Some 18,106 children were identified  		for inclusion in the preliminary comparison group. Mother and child Medicaid  		files were linked for 10,383 children, 67.3% of the preliminary comparison  		group. This compares to 76.4% of the study cohort with linked files. Thirty  		percent of children in the comparison group could not be linked to their  		mothers, compared to only 11.7% of children among the study cohort. About 12%  		of the records in both groups consisted of mother only files. The larger  		proportion of child only files among the comparison group occurred because many  		newborns in California are enrolled in Medicaid soon after birth without their  		mothers being enrolled at all. It appears that the first contact these mothers  		have with the Medicaid program is at delivery, i.e. they have not had any  		prenatal coverage under Medicaid. Only the children are enrolled in Medicaid,  		not their mothers. In some instances, the delivery charges are assigned to the  		children's Medicaid files.</p>

<p>As discussed earlier, the California Vital Statistics files contain  		information on a number of variables not available in the Tape-to-Tape data.  		Thus, as a final step in the methodology, the children in the Tape-to-Tape  		files were linked to the California Vital Statistics data. To accomplish this,  		a series of iterative steps were undertaken, using selected variables available  		in both data sets. The linking variables included the child's last name, first  		name and middle initial, the delivery date, the child's sex, the mother's last  		name, the age of the mother, the hospital name and the county of birth. The  		vast majority of cases were linked with these variables. A few additional cases  		were identified using a soundex version of the child's last and first  		names.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a> presents the results of the file  		merger. Approximately 77% of the children in both the study cohort and the  		comparison group were successfully matched with the Vital Statistics file.  		There were two main reasons for unsuccessful matches. First, not all children  		who were enrolled in California Medicaid sometime during their first two years  		of life were born in California. Second, the Vital Statistics file contained  		only the mother's last name. For common last names, this limited the ability to  		match Tape-to-Tape records to the Vital Statistics files.</p>

<h3><a name="sec1.5" id="sec1.5">Other Methodological Issues</a></h3>
<p>More than one denominator is used throughout the study data to compute  		Medicaid utilization and expenditure rates for the study cohort and comparison  		group. In addition to the usual approach of average utilization and  		expenditures <i>per child</i>, child person years of enrollment are used as a  		denominator, thus allowing the study data to be adjusted for length of  		enrollment. One of the advantages of the Tape-to-Tape data set is that monthly  		enrollment data are available for each child. As a result, the data can be  		adjusted so that a child who is only enrolled in Medicaid for 6 months is only  		counted as half a person year of enrollment. Similarly, rate calculations can  		be made with "user" person years of enrollment. With user person years of  		enrollment, the denominator includes only the users of a particular service.  		For example, the average number of inpatient hospital days per person year of  		enrollment can be calculated only for children who were hospitalized during the  		year.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that all expenditure data were adjusted to  		1988 dollars, using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index  		(CPI).</p>
<h3><a name="sec1.6" id="sec1.6">Study Limitations</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most serious limitation of the study involves the problems  		at identifying children exposed to drugs and alcohol during the prenatal  		period. As other researchers have reported, there is no consensus on the number  		at substance exposed infants born each year, and most believe that the  		incidence of substance exposed newborns is significantly under-reported. In  		fact some evidence exists that the majority of substance exposed newborns are  		undetected by hospitals, in the absence of comprehensive screening and testing.  		There is also concern that hospitals and pediatricians until recently were not  		sensitive to the likelihood of substance exposure (Government Accounting  		Office, 1990).</p>
<p>This study was dependent upon there being a diagnosis of problems  		related to substance abuse either in the mothers' Medicaid claims data, or in  		the children's data. No direct testing was involved. The presumption was that  		if a mother had a problem of substance abuse reported in her record, substance  		exposure for her child occurred. Nevertheless, as noted earlier, sensitivity  		analyses (which are reported later) were undertaken to determine the effect of  		limiting the study cohort to only those children with a direct diagnosis of  		substance exposure, and those whose mothers had a diagnosis of substance abuse  		during the period of pregnancy.</p>
<p>A further constraint was that each California outpatient claim for  		Medicaid includes only one primary diagnosis code. Since a substance exposure  		problem is often reported as a secondary diagnosis, this limitation is believed  		to have significantly constrained the size of the study cohort, particularly  		for alcohol exposed children.</p>
<p>In addition, California's hospital inpatient and outpatient claims on  		the Tape-to-Tape files only include 4 digits in the ICD-9-CM diagnosis coding.  		As a result, identification of certain diagnoses which require 5 digit codes  		(such as fetal alcohol syndrome) was not possible, but they are included under  		a broader 4 digit diagnostic category.</p>
<p>A second limitation with study data involved delivery charges. In  		California, hospital delivery charges are usually assigned to the mother's  		Medicaid file. However, in some instances, the delivery charges may be assigned  		to the child's Medicaid files. This appears to occur when the mother has not  		been enrolled in Medicaid prior to delivery. For them reasons, there was  		concern that delivery charges in the child files would contaminate our  		calculations of the hospital expenditures under Medicaid for the children in  		the study. There was interest, however, in the delivery costs of substance  		exposed children. Thus, an attempt was made to extract the delivery charges  		both from the mothers' Medicaid files and the files of the children. These  		delivery costs are presented as a separate expenditure category in the study  		data, regardless of whether they come from the mothers' files or the children's  		files.</p>
<p>Third, there are some limitations in the data because children do not  		usually have individual Medicaid identification numbers at birth. Until they  		are able to obtain their own individual identification numbers, any charges for  		the care of children will appear on their mothers' Medicaid records. Study data  		showed that children in the study cohort were enrolled in Medicaid on average  		by age 2.3 months, compared to 3.1 months for the comparison group. Thus,  		hospital and outpatient expenditures in the first two months of life are not  		included in study data for many of the study cohort and comparison group. This  		causes the hospital and outpatient user and expenditure rates to be  		understated.</p>
<p>A fourth limitation is that complete expenditure data could not be  		compiled for the Tape-to-Tape data set for services related to the early  		periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment (EPSDT) program in 1986; the EPSDT  		utilization data for that year are complete.<font><a href="#note2">2</a></font> This arose because in 1986 the EPSDT claims files  		only reported the total amount paid, not payments by specific services.  		Although the utilization and expenditure data for EPSDT for later years  		(1987-1989) are complete, EPSDT expenditure data are presented separately for  		each study year due to the limitation in the 1986 data.</p>
<p>A fifth limitation relates to the availability of Medicaid data for  		children born in 1988 (both in the study cohort and the comparison group).  		Medicaid data were only available through December, 1989. Thus, most children  		born in 1988 do not have a full two years of Medicaid data in the study  		results. Fortunately, the use of person years of enrollment as the denominator  		can compensate for these incomplete data in most calculations. However, in some  		instances, data are presented separately for children by year of birth.</p>
<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">DESCRIPTIVE FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3><a name="sec2.1" id="sec2.1">Identification of Substance Exposed  		Children in the Medicaid Population</a></h3>
<p>As reported earlier, 7,802 children born in 1986, 1987 and 1988 with  		evidence of substance exposure problems (either in their own claims files or  		their mothers' files) were identified in California's Medicaid files.  		<a href="#Exhibit6">Exhibit 6</a> shows the proportion of children in the study  		cohort by diagnosis codes related to substance exposure. The most frequently  		occurring diagnosis grouping is labeled "various types of drug dependence;" the  		mothers of 28% of the infants identified in the study cohort had diagnoses in  		this grouping. The specific codes in this group included opioid (heroin),  		barbiturate, cocaine, marijuana or unspecified drug dependence. As a close  		second, 26.5% of infants had the diagnosis of drug withdrawal syndrome in  		newborn. Exactly 16% of study children were identified due to a diagnosis  		related to various types of drug abuse. Other diagnosis groupings accounting  		for more than 10% of study children included noxious influences affecting fetus  		(12.4%), drug dependence in mother complicating pregnancy or childbirth  		(12.2%), and various types of non-accidental drug-related poisonings  		(11.3%).</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit7">Exhibit 7</a> provides additional information about  		the diagnoses identifying the study cohort. The vast majority of substance  		exposed children (70.9%) were identified solely through diagnoses in their  		mothers' files. Another 24.3% of children were identified solely as a result of  		direct diagnoses of substance exposure problems in their own files. A final  		4.8% of the study cohort had substance-related diagnoses both in their own  		files and in their mothers' files. Thus, only 29.1 % of children in the study  		cohort had direct diagnoses related to substance exposure. This low proportion  		of children with direct diagnoses was expected. Other researchers have reported  		the lack of screening for substance exposure problems among infants and the  		reluctance of physicians and hospitals to code children as having substance  		exposure problems, even when they are detected.</p>
<p>Most children (77.8%) only had one specific substance-related diagnosis  		in their (or their mothers') Medicaid files, although the diagnosis could have  		appeared on multiple claims; 22.2% of the study cohort had multiple diagnoses  		related to substance abuse. Also of interest, only about 5.6% of the study  		cohort had any diagnoses related to alcohol abuse. This is believed to be an  		undercount due to an earlier reported limitation of the data base--California  		only provides for one diagnosis code for outpatient claims. Since a problem of  		alcohol abuse would often be reported only as a secondary diagnosis, it is  		believed that the study data significantly undercount the frequency of alcohol  		exposure problems. For example, Washington's Medicaid program estimated that  		one-quarter of substance-abusing pregnant women on Medicaid had problems with  		alcohol abuse (Cawthon, 1991).</p>

For example, diagnoses covering non-accidental drug-related  		poisonings (see <a href="#Exhibit6">Exhibit 6</a> for codes) were included  		because these codes were reportedly used (especially in the early 1980s) to  		identify substance exposure problems even when physicians realized the problem  		might not be due to a poisoning. At that time, there was greater reluctance to  		directly identify children as having substance exposure problems. As is  		reported later, sensitivity analyses were performed which omitted children with  		these diagnoses from the study cohort.</p>

</tr></table><p>There were no major changes over the study period in the overall pattern  		of identification by diagnosis code (data not shown). However, there were  		noticeable increases in two areas. The proportion of children in the study  		cohort with the diagnosis of drug withdrawal syndrome in a newborn increased  		from 23.7% in 1986 to 28.7% in 1988. Similarly, the proportion of children with  		a diagnosis of noxious influences affecting the fetus increased from 10.6% to  		14.3% over the same period. It is not clear whether this reflects an increase  		in the true incidence of these diagnoses, or a change in coding practices.</p>
<p>There was some debate about the exact time period to use in identifying  		delivering mothers who might have a substance abuse problem.  		<a href="#Exhibit8">Exhibit 8</a> below shows when the substance-related  		diagnoses occurred for the mothers of children in the study cohort; however,  		these data have to be used with caution since not all mothers were enrolled in  		Medi-Cal throughout the 24 months preceding birth and the 6 months after birth.  		Diagnoses were reported only in the 6 month period immediately following birth  		(post-pregnancy only) for 41.2% of the mothers identified as having  		substance-related problems. Thus, these mothers did not have any  		substance-related diagnoses in Medi-Cal claims in the two year period prior to  		birth. Another 26.8% of mothers reported a substance-related diagnosis only  		during the estimated period of pregnancy, which for study purposes was defined  		as the 9 months preceding birth. Still another 20.2% of mothers only had  		substance-related diagnoses during the period before pregnancy. Recall that the  		study selection criteria specified that mothers' files were searched for the 2  		year period preceding birth for any substance-related codes. Mothers in the  		pre-pregnancy group only had substance-related diagnosis codes in the period of  		24 months to 10 months preceding birth, i.e. the period prior to pregnancy.  		Diagnoses were reported in more than one time period for 11.9% of mothers.  		Sensitivity analyses were conducted to see whether there was any significant  		difference in study results related to the time period used for identifying  		substance-related diagnoses in the mothers' claims files. These are reported  		later.</p>

</tr></table><p>Nevertheless, the proportion of Medi-Cal children who were identified as  		having substance exposure problems was smaller than expected. Generally, the  		study cohort only represented from 1.4% to 1.9% of overall Medi-Cal enrollment  		for children born in the period from 1986 to 1988. Other estimates of substance  		exposed children vary greatly. Study results are reasonably consistent with  		those of Washington State's Medicaid program. Using a similar methodology for  		identifying children with substance exposure problems, Washington found that  		only 2.7% of its deliveries from July to December, 1988 were to women with  		substance abuse problems (Cawthon, 1991). Recent research using the National  		Hospital Discharge Survey found a similarly low rate of substance affected  		newborns (Dicker and Leighton, 1991).<font><a href="#note3">3</a></font> However, testimony before the House Select Committee  		on Children, Youth and Families suggested that 10% of all Medi-Cal births in  		1987 were substance exposed children (Halfon, 1989).</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, several aspects of the study methodology  		significantly constrain the identification of children included in the study.  		Thus, study results cannot be used to estimate with any certainty the true  		incidence of substance exposure in this population.</p>
<h3><a name="sec2.3" id="sec2.3">Personal Characteristics and Medicaid  		Enrollment Patterns</a></h3>
<p>Very little personal characteristics information is included in Medicaid  		administrative data. As mentioned earlier, reliable information on race/ethnic  		group was not reported in California's MMIS system for the study period. (Data  		on race/ethnicity are reported later, based on the merger with the Vital  		Statistics file). Only the variables of sex and geographic location of  		residence were available with the Tape-to-Tape data. With both of these  		variables, little difference was seen between the study cohort and the control  		group. As shown in <a href="#Exhibit10">Exhibit 10</a>, a slight majority of  		children in both the study cohort and the comparison group were male (51.7% and  		50.9%, respectively).

Just over 24% of  		children in the study cohort were in foster care, compared to 2.1% in the  		control group. Other researchers have reported a high proportion of substance  		exposed children in foster cars. The General Accounting Office reported a  		foster care placement rate of 26% to 58% for drug exposed infants, compared to  		1% to 2% for infants born to mothers with no indication of drug use, in a study  		it conducted at 4 urban hospitals (General Accounting Office, 1990). The  		Inspector General's Office reported foster care estimates of 30% to 50% for  		"crack babies" (Office of the Inspector General, 1990). Half of the foster care  		children in a foster care pediatric practice (in Oakland, California) were  		reported to be drug exposed (Halfon, 1989).</p>
<p>Another eligibility-related difference is the comparatively low  		proportion of medically needy children in the substance exposed group (8.3%  		compared to 37.9% for the control group). Previous research has documented the  		high proportion of newborns in California in the medically needy group. One  		study showed 42% of Medicaid deliveries in California in 1983 were to mothers  		qualifying under the medically needy eligibility provisions. This earlier study  		documented that many of these mothers only became enrolled in the last  		trimester of pregnancy, and almost one-quarter did not obtain coverage until  		the point of delivery (Howell and Ellwood, 1991). This pattern is consistent  		with study results for the comparison group.</p>
<p>Generally, children in the study cohort were enrolled in the Medicaid  		program for a considerably longer period of time over their first 2 years of  		life than children in the control group. Children in the study cohort born in  		1986 and 1987 averaged about 18 months enrollment over a 24 month period,  		compared to 13 months for children in the control group. Children in the study  		cohort had their own Medi-Cal enrollment records slightly sooner after birth  		than children in the comparison group (age 2.3 months on average compared to  		age 3.1 months). Over half of 1986 and 1987 study cohort children were enrolled  		for 22-24 months, compared to only about 30% of the control group. Thus,  		substance exposed children showed a stronger attachment to the Medicaid program  		in their first 2 years of life than children in the control group.</p>

</tr></table><p>Generally, the mothers of substance exposed children were older than  		mothers in the control group, and the study cohort mothers showed a much  		longer-term attachment to the Medicaid program prior to delivery. The average  		age of the mothers of substance exposed children was 25.9 years, compared to  		23.7 years for mothers of the control group children. This result is similar to  		program data from Washington on substance abusing mothers (Cawthon, 1991) and  		data on "crack babies" from the Inspector General's Office (Office of the  		Inspector General, 1990). Almost 24% of the control group mothers were under 20  		years of age, versus about 13% of mothers of the study cohort. The average  		length of Medicaid enrollment during pregnancy was 6 months for study cohort  		mothers, compared to 3.8 months for control group mothers. Only 13.3% of  		mothers of the study cohort had no enrollment during the estimated period of  		pregnancy, compared to 35% of the control group mothers. Finally, over  		one-quarter (26.2%) of study cohort mothers had been enrolled in Medicaid for  		the entire 2 years prior to delivery, compared to 14.2% of the control group  		mothers. Since most of these women qualified under the AFDC provisions of  		Medicaid (data not shown), they had to have other children in addition to the  		infants who were the focus of this study. This result suggests that there may  		be other children with potential substance exposure problems beyond those  		identified for this study.</p>
<p>Also important, over the three year study period from 1986 to 1988, 7.2%  		of the mothers in the study cohort had more than one baby delivered under  		Medicaid coverage, compared to 5.8% of mothers in the control group.</p>

</tr></table><p>An important study question was whether or not substance exposed  		children had greater health care needs and thus higher rates of Medicaid  		utilization than other Medicaid children in the first two years of life.  		Generally, study data showed that substance exposed children were more likely  		to be inpatient hospital users in both the first and second years of life than  		other children on Medicaid. However, the number of discharges per child user  		and the average number of hospital days per child user were actually less for  		substance exposed children. Adjusting study data for length of enrollment only  		did not change this basic pattern.</p>
<p>Substance exposed children also had higher use rates for  		physician/ambulatory care services, and they averaged more visits per user than  		children in the control group. However, this difference was reduced in the  		first year of life and disappeared in the second year of life, using adjusted  		data.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit12">Exhibit 12</a> presents the service utilization  		data from the study. In the first year of life, 14.9% of the study cohort  		children had inpatient hospital admissions, compared to 9.2% of the control  		group. However, the control group averaged more discharges per user--2.5 per  		user compared to 1.6 for the study group. Also, the control group hospital  		users averaged 7.9 days in the hospital, compared to 6.8 days for children in  		the study cohort. In the second year of life, the hospital user rate fell to  		8.4% for the study cohort and 4.9% for the control group. The number of days  		per hospital user also dropped to 4.7 days per user for substance exposed  		children and 5.3 for control group children. Children in the study cohort had  		twice the rate of intensive care use as the control group for both time  		periods. In the first year of life, 3.0% of the substance exposed group  		reported intensive care use, compared to 1.6% of the control group. For the  		second year of life, the intensive care user rate dropped to 1.8% for the study  		group, compared to 0.9% for the control group.</p>

</tr></table><p>When adjustments were made for length of enrollment (using person years  		of enrollment as the denominator), the hospital user rate for substance exposed  		children was about 46% more in the first year of life and 72% more in the  		second year of life than the rate for the comparison group. However, children  		in the substance exposed group continued to have fewer discharges per user and  		fewer days of inpatient hospital services per user. This pattern occurred in  		both years. <a href="#Exhibit13">Exhibit 13</a> shows the distribution of  		diagnosis codes associated with the inpatient hospital stays for both groups.  		Generally, these data show that children in the study cohort were hospitalized  		for similar diagnoses as children in the control group, with one exception.  		Children in the study group were much more likely to be hospitalized for  		injuries and poisonings. Thus, the reasons for hospitalization of children in  		the study cohort were not markedly different from that of the comparison group,  		with the exception of injuries and poisonings.</p>
<p>Study data were compared to data from the National Center for Health  		Statistics on hospital utilization rates for children under age 1 in the  		general population, as shown in <a href="#Exhibit14">Exhibit 14</a>. This  		comparison uses somewhat different measures of hospital use--the hospital  		discharge rate per 1,000 population and the average length of stay per  		discharge. Study data show that both the study and control group children had a  		significantly higher hospital discharge rate than children under age 1 in the  		general population, but a shorter average length of stay per discharge. The  		discharge rate per 1,000 population was 238.9 for the study cohort and 231 for  		the control group, compared to 196.1 to 200.6 for the general population from  		1986 to 1988. The difference may be even greater than these data suggest. As  		reported earlier, many children do not have their own Medicaid identification  		numbers for several weeks after birth. During this period, any service  		utilization (and expenditures) they experience is reported on their mothers'  		Medicaid records. As a result, service utilization in the first year of life  		for both Medicaid groups is probably somewhat underreported.</p>

</tr></table><p>Returning to <a href="#Exhibit12">Exhibit 12</a>, the vast majority of  		children in both groups were users of physician/ambulatory services in both  		years of life. The substance exposed group showed a slightly higher user rate.  		With the adjusted data, 91.3% of the study group had physician/ambulatory  		visits during the first year, with an average of 12.2 visits per user. About  		88.3% of control group children were physician/ambulatory users, with an  		average of 11.2 visits per user. In the second year of life, there was little  		difference in the physician/ambulatory user rate for either group, using the  		adjusted data. Both groups had an overall user rate of about 8889%, with an  		average of about 9 visits per user.</p>
<p>Neither group had a very high rate of EPSDT service use. With the  		adjusted data, 56.0% of the study cohort and 48.1% of the control group were  		EPSDT users in their first year. This rate dropped to 39.4% in the second year  		for the study cohort and 36.2% for the control. For the users of EPSDT  		services, the number of visits per user was virtually the same for both groups  		in both years--about 1.7 visits per user. California's own recornmended  		standard for screening visits in the first year of life is 6 visits and 2  		visits in the second year. Thus, the first year users were substantially under  		the recommended number of visits, while the second year users were closer to  		the standard. Nevertheless, in both years a substantial number of children had  		no EPSDT service use. An earlier study by the American Academy of Pediatrics  		documented that many children in California receive Medicaid well-child care  		outside the EPSDT program (Yudkowsky and Fleming, 1990). As a result the  		proportion of EPSDT users reported in the study data may understate the number  		of children receiving routine preventive care services. Also, the problem of  		missing data for the first few weeks of life (until the child is assigned an  		individual Medicaid identification number) could affect this result. Finally,  		the overall physician/ambulatory utilization rates reported earlier for both  		the study cohort and the comparison group were quite high, suggesting both  		groups had a high degree of contact with outpatient health care providers.</p>
<h3><a name="sec2.6" id="sec2.6">Medicaid Expenditure Patterns</a><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></h3>
<p>The primary study objective was to determine whether or not substance  		exposed children are more costly to the Medicaid program than other Medicaid  		children. Generally, study data Indicate that substance exposed children are  		considerably more costly to the Medicaid program than other Medicaid children  		of the same age. However, much of this cost difference is attributable to  		longer average lengths of enrollment. Without an adjustment for length of  		enrollment, average expenditures per substance exposed child are about 47%  		greater than other Medicaid children in the first two years of life. With  		adjustments for enrollment, this difference is reduced to about 13%.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#Exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>, the average Medicaid  		expenditure per substance exposed child over the first two years of life was  		$2,285, compared to $1,551 for the control group. Thus, substance exposed  		children cost the State Medicaid program $734 more (47.3%) than children in the  		control group. Although study children had higher hospital expenditures than  		the control group, their expenditures for physician/ambulatory services, drugs  		and other services were proportionally even greater. As with most insured  		groups, a majority of children did not have expenditures nearly as great as the  		average. The median expenditure per child was $465 for the study group and $240  		for the control group, a difference of almost 94%. The range of expenditures  		per child was greater for the control group, going from $0 to $503,726,  		compared to so to $312,227 for the study group.</p>
<p>The expenditure difference between substance exposed children and  		control group children decreased from the first to second year of life.  		Expenditures for substance exposed children were 40.1% more than the control  		group from birth through 12 months, and 22.2% more for 13 through 24  		months.</p>

</tr></table><p>Over the study period, the average Medicaid expenditure for EPSDT  		services was $126 per child in the study cohort, compared to $93 per child in  		the comparison group. With adjustments for length of enrollment, the EPSDT  		expenditure was $92 per person year of enrollment for substance exposed  		children and $89 for control group children. Thus, substance exposed children  		had 35.5% greater EPSDT expenditures per child over the study period. This  		difference was reduced to 3.4% with adjustments for length of enrollment.</p>
<p>The one area in which expenditures were less for substance exposed  		children than other Medicaid children was delivery expenditures. For those  		child average expenditure was $3,925 for the study cohort, compared to $4,406  		for children in the control group. The average delivery expenditure per  		substance exposed child was 10.9% less than other Medicaid children. This  		probably occurs because of the high proportion of medically needy deliveries in  		the control group. As discussed earlier, many mothers qualifying under the  		medically needy provisions only become enrolled in Medicaid at the point of  		delivery and thus they may not have received any prenatal care. This could  		contribute to higher delivery costs.</p>
<h3><a name="sec2.7" id="sec2.7">Sensitivity Analyses</a></h3>
<p>As discussed earlier, there was concern that some methodological  		decisions might skew the study results; therefore, sensitivity analyses were  		undertaken to determine the impact of alternative approaches to selecting the  		study cohort and comparison group. The results of these analyses are shown in  		<a href="#Exhibit17">Exhibit 17</a> which shows what the average expenditure  		levels per child would have been with alternative definitions.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, 11.4% of the study cohort were selected solely due  		to an accidents poisoning, adverse drug effect, or other type of drug  		poisoning. If these children were excluded from the study cohort, the average  		expenditure per child would have been $2,139 for the study period, or $1,580  		per child person year of enrollment. As it turned out, study children who were  		selected solely due to a poisoning-related diagnosis had greater Medicaid  		expenditures per child on average. As a result, excluding them from the study  		cohort reduced the difference between substance exposed children and children  		in the control group to 37.9% per child over the study period, or 7.3% per  		person year of enrollment. Nevertheless, substance exposed children would have  		continued to be more expensive to the Medicaid program than children in the  		control group.</p>
<p>The next three analyses alter the time period during which the Medicaid  		records of mothers who delivered in 1986, 1987 and 1988 were reviewed to search  		for substance related diagnoses. First, children were excluded from the study  		cohort if their only substance related diagnosis came from their mothers'  		Medicaid record in the period prior to pregnancy. The second analysis excluded  		those children whose only diagnosis came from their mothers' post-pregnancy  		records. The third analysis combined the first two and only includes children  		whose mothers had substance related diagnoses during pregnancy and children  		identified with diagnoses in their own records. In all three instances, the  		effect was to increase the average expenditure per substance exposed child over  		the study period and by person year of enrollment. This occurred because  		children who were identified due to substance related diagnoses in their  		mothers' Medicaid records generally cost less to the Medicaid program than  		children identified through direct substance related diagnoses in their own  		Medicaid records. If the study cohort excluded children selected only due to  		diagnoses in their mothers' Medicaid files either pre or post pregnancy, the  		average Medicaid expenditure per child in the study cohort would have been  		69.1% greater than that of children in the comparison group aver the study  		period (instead of 47.3%). With adjustments for length of enrollment, this  		difference would have been 28.1% (instead of 13.0%). Thus, if the study cohort  		had only been limited to children who had their own direct substance-related  		diagnoses and children whose mothers had substance-related diagnoses during  		pregnancy, there would have been an even greater discrepancy between the  		expenditures levels for the study cohort and the control group.</p>

</tr></table><p>The final area of sensitivity analysis involved excluding children whose  		Medicaid eligibility group was medically needy from both the study cohort and  		comparison groups. This analysis was undertaken because previous research has  		shown that medically needy children have very different Medicaid expenditure  		patterns than other groups of Medicaid children. In particular, medically needy  		children tend to have shorter average lengths of enrollment and considerably  		greater average Medicaid expenditures per person year of enrollment, primarily  		due to a much higher hospital user rate (Rymer and Adler, 1987). The  		sensitivity results suggest that this same pattern is in the study data for  		medically needy children. If they are excluded from both the study cohort and  		the comparison group, the difference between the average expenditure per child  		in the study cohort and the control group is reduced to 24.2%, instead of  		47.3%. However, with adjustments for length of enrollment, the difference  		increases to 18.1%, instead of 13.0%.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with all the sensitivity analyses the direction of the  		difference between substance exposed children and the control group of children  		with regard to Medicaid expenditures was not changed. That is, substance  		exposed children continued to be more expensive to the Medicaid program,  		regardless of the methodological approach. On the other hand, the magnitude of  		the difference was affected. In some instances, such as reducing the number of  		children in the study cohort identified through their mothers' claims, the  		expenditure differences were increased. In other instances, such as excluding  		children from the study cohort due to poisoning-related diagnoses, the  		expenditure differences were reduced. With all the analyses, the actual dollar  		amounts involved in either direction were not substantial.</p>
<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">SUBGROUP ANALYSES OF SUBSTANCE EXPOSED COHORT</a></h2>
<h3><a name="sec3.1" id="sec3.1">Self-Identified Children Versus  		Mother-Identified Children</a></h3>
<p>It was expected that the majority of children in the study cohort would  		be identified for inclusion in the study through indications in their mothers'  		records of substance abuse problems. Other researchers have reported that  		clinicians may be reluctant to "label" children as having substance exposure  		problems. It is also difficult for clinicians to diagnose children as having  		substance exposure problems without deliberate testing. For example, one study  		found that screens of newborns (using medical histories and urine toxicology)  		increased the identification rate of substance exposed neonates by three to  		five times (Chasnoff, 1989, as reported by the General Accounting Office,  		1990).</p>
<p>As presented earlier, 70.9% of the study cohort were identified through  		diagnoses in their mothers' fides, 24.3% through diagnoses in their own files,  		and 4.8% had diagnoses in both files. <a href="#Exhibit18">Exhibit 18</a>  		presents selected data comparing the subgroups of substance exposed children  		identified through their own files, and those identified through their mothers'  		files. In the discussion which follows, these are referred to as  		self-identified and mother-identified children. <a href="#Exhibit18">Exhibit  		18</a> also includes study data on children identified as substance exposed  		both in their own files and in their mothers' files. Since this third group is  		quite small (n=375), their data are presented for information purposes only and  		not discussed.</p>
<p>Generally, study results showed that self-identified children had  		substantially greater health care utilization and expenditures than substance  		exposed children identified solely through their mothers' files. For the first  		year of life, self-identified children had Medicaid expenditures of $2,576,  		compared to $1,319 for mother-identified children. For the second year of life,  		self-identified children had expenditures of $1,309, compared to $658 for the  		subgroup identified through mothers' records. In both years, the expenditures  		of self-identified children were over 95% greater than the expenditures of the  		mother-identified group. This relationship was not changed very much by the  		person year adjustment. Service utilization data showed self-identified  		children had a much higher hospital user rate in both years. Although the user  		rate for ambulatory/physician services was similar between the two groups,  		self-identified children averaged more visits per user (13.5 versus 8.8 for  		mother-identified children in year one, and 8.8 versus 6.3 in year two).</p>
<p>Also important, 45% of the self-identified children were in the foster  		care eligibility group, compared to only 15.2% of the children in the group  		identified through their mothers' records. Over three-quarters of  		mother-identified children were in the AFDC cash assistance group, while only  		44.1 % of self-identified children were on AFDC cash assistance. The mothers of  		self-identified children also had less of an attachment to the Medicaid  		program. The average length of Medicaid enrollment for the mothers in the 24  		months prior to delivery was 12.7 months for the self-identified group,  		compared to 16.1 months for the mother-identified group.</p>

</tr></table><h3><a name="sec3.2" id="sec3.2">Foster Care Children Versus Non-Foster  		Care Children</a></h3>
<p>Many States have reported significant increases in their foster care  		caseloads in recent years. Many have attributed part of this growth to the  		increasing numbers of substance exposed infants. Indeed, as reported earlier,  		foster care children were found to constitute a significant proportion of the  		substance exposed group. Almost one-quarter of the children in the study cohort  		were in foster care. Given the importance of this group, a separate analysis of  		foster care children in the study cohort was undertaken. <a href="#Exhibit19">Exhibit 19</a> presents data comparing the sub-group of  		foster care children to children not in foster care among substance exposed  		children.</p>
<p>Study data showed that the number of substance exposed children in  		foster care grew at a faster rate than the number of substance exposed children  		in other Medicaid eligibility groups. From 1986 to 1988, the number of  		substance exposed children in foster care increased by 54.2%, compared to a  		growth rate of 41.1 % for other substance exposed children. Other Tape-to-Tape  		data (not shown) indicated that the number of children under age 1 in  		California's foster care program was 3,585 in 1986, 3,494 in 1987 and 4,724 in  		1988 (excluding children in capitated programs). There was no growth in the  		number of children under age 1 in foster care from 1986 to 1987, but in 1988  		enrollment increased by 31.8% relative to 1986. Thus, substance exposed infants  		in foster care were growing at an even faster rate than the overall population  		of infants in foster care. Also, over this three year time period, substance  		exposed infants using the study's limited methodology appear to have  		constituted about 16.5% of California's foster care enrollees under age 1.</p>
<p>Foster care children in the study cohort were more likely to be  		self-identified than other cohort children. Over half of the foster care  		subgroup (55.6%) had diagnoses related to substance exposure in their own  		Medicaid records, compared to only 20.6% of non-foster care children.</p>
<p>Linkages were made to the mothers' delivery records for 68% of the  		foster care subgroup children, compared to 92.8% of the non-foster care  		subgroup. Thus, two-thirds of substance exposed children in foster care were  		born to mothers on Medicaid.</p>
<p>Children in the foster care subgroup differed from other children with  		regard to their residence. Some 72.6% of foster care children were classified  		as living in urban areas, compared to 62.1% for other substance exposed  		children.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that the general population of foster care  		children on Medicaid has substantially greater utilization and expenditures  		than other Medicaid children (Rymer and Adler, 1987). This is hypothesized to  		occur because the situations of neglect and abuse from which they come have  		negative impacts on their health status. Another factor may be that foster  		parents are more likely to seek medical treatment for their charges, simply as  		part of their routine responsibilities as foster parents.</p>

Study  		results confirmed this pattern. In the first year of life, the Medicaid  		expenditures of children in the foster care subgroup exceeded those of other  		children by about 62%. However, this difference dropped to just over 23% in the  		second year of life. This relationship was not changed by adjustments for  		length of enrollment. Utilization of inpatient hospital care and outpatient  		care (as measured by visits per user) were substantially higher for the foster  		care group during the first year, while such differences were only slight in  		the second year.</p>
<h3><a name="sec3.3" id="sec3.3">Children with Continuous Versus  		Non-Continuous Medicaid Enrollment</a></h3>
<p>In the general population of Medicaid children, there are sometimes  		substantial differences in the utilization and expenditure patterns of children  		who are enrolled in the program for only a short time, compared to those with  		continuous, long-term enrollment. Generally, children whose Medicaid enrollment  		is continuous and long-term have higher average Medicaid expenditures. However,  		when their expenditures are adjusted for length of enrollment, their average  		expenditures per person year of enrollment are lower than the expenditures of  		children with shorter lengths of enrollment. This occurs because they are more  		likely to have some months of low utilization or no utilization than children  		who are enrolled in Medicaid for a brief period of time. Sometimes children are  		enrolled in Medicaid for a short period of time simply to be eligible for  		Medicaid coverage of substantial health care costs. In fact, hospitals have  		obvious incentives to make certain otherwise uninsured children are eligible  		for Medicaid coverage during their hospital stays.</p>
<p>Thus, there was interest in comparing the utilization and expenditure  		patterns of children with continuous, long-term Medicaid enrollment among the  		substance exposed population to those with non-continuous, short-term  		enrollment. For study purposes, the continuous group was defined as children  		who had their own Medicaid records by age three months and remained  		continuously enrolled in Medicaid (without interruption) over the study  		observation period, i.e. through age 24 months. The parameters were relaxed for  		those children born in 1988 so that they only had to have continuous enrollment  		through December 1989. <a href="#Exhibit20">Exhibit 20</a> presents the study  		data of relevance.</p>
<p>Study results confirmed the expected pattern. Although the Medicaid  		expenditure per child for the continuously enrolled group was substantially  		higher than that of the non-continuously enrolled group, this difference  		completely disappeared when adjustments were made for length of enrollment. In  		fact, the non-continuously enrolled group were slightly more expensive to the  		Medicaid program using person years of enrollment as the denominator. For the  		first year of life, continuously enrolled children had expenditures of $1,998,  		compared to $1,294 for the non-continuous subgroup, a difference of 54.4%. For  		the second year of life, the expenditure rates were $878 compared to $736, a  		difference of 19.3%. However, with the length of enrollment adjustment,  		continuously enrolled children in the substance exposed group actually cost  		4.0% less to Medicaid than the non-continuously enrolled group for the first  		year of life and 5.8% less for the second year of life.</p>
<p>Other characteristics of the continuously enrolled group included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>They were somewhat less likely to reside in urban areas (61.2% for  			 the continuously enrolled group compared to 68% for the non-continuous  			 group).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their mothers had a stronger attachment to the Medicaid program.  			 Their mothers' average length of Medicaid enrollment was 16.5 months during the  			 24 months prior to delivery, compared to 14.5 months for the. non-continuously  			 enrolled group. Also, 35.2% of their mothers had been enrolled the entire 24  			 months prior to delivery, compared to only 25.3% of the mothers of the  			 non-continuously enrolled group (data not shown).</p>

</tr></table><p>In both the general population and the Medicaid population, relatively  		few people account for the majority of health care utilization and  		expenditures. For example, Tape-to-Tape data in 1984 showed 10% of Medicaid  		child enrollees in California accounted for over 75% of child Medicaid  		expenditures that year (unpublished Tape-to-Tape data).</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that a similar pattern would be found with the study  		cohort. To test this hypothesis, a high cost subgroup was defined as the 10% of  		children in the study cohort with the highest expenditures per child.  		<a href="#Exhibit21">Exhibit 21</a> is a Lorenz Curve showing the distribution  		of the study cohort by level of expenditures over the study period. In this  		graph, the percent of total enrollees in the study cohort is the horizontal  		axis, and the cumulative percent of total expenditures for the study cohort is  		the vertical axis. Over the study period of 1986 through 1988, the 7,802  		children in the study cohort accounted for $17,829,745 in adjusted Medicaid  		expenditures. The 45° line shows the hypothetical distribution under the  		assumption that all enrollees had equal expenditures for the study period. The  		curve, the actual distribution, shows that expenditures were unevenly  		distributed across the population of substance exposed children. For example,  		had expenditures been evenly distributed, 90% of enrollees would have accounted  		for 90% of expenditures. In actuality, 90% of enrollees accounted for only  		27.3% of expenditures, while expenditures for the top 10% of enrollees were  		$12,955,754 or 72.7% of total expenditures over the study period. At the 90th  		percentile, the expenditure per child was $4,200, and the highest expenditure  		among the study cohort reached $312,227.</p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="Exhibit21" id="Exhibit21">EXHIBIT 21</a>.  			 Distributional Analysis of Medicaid Expenditures for Substance Exposed  			 Cohort</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68536/caunder2E21.JPG" /></td>
</tr></table><p>Thus, the cohort of substance exposed children exhibited a similar  		distribution with regard to expenditures to that seen previously with Medicaid  		children. This distribution is also seen in most insured groups. As reported  		earlier, the median expenditure per child in the study cohort was only $465,  		compared to an average expenditure level of $2,285 over the study period. This  		underscores the fact that most children in the substance exposed group did not  		have unusually high expenditures. Instead, a small group of children accounted  		for most of the expenditures.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit22">Exhibit 22</a> presents study data comparing the  		so-called high cost group of 780 children who accounted for 73% of the total  		expenditures to other children in the study cohort. With regard to personal  		characteristics and enrollment patterns, there were three areas of difference  		for the high cost group:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The high cost group had a greater proportion of males--58% compared  			 to 51 % among other substance exposed children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high cost group had a greater proportion of children in foster  			 care (32.3% compared to 23.5%) and SSI cash assistance (2.4% compared to  			 &lt;0.1 %), and a lower proportion on AFDC cash assistance (58.3% compared to  			 67.6%). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children in the high cost group had a longer average length of  			 Medicaid enrollment over the study period--19.0 months compared to 16.2 for  			 other children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Not surprisingly, high cost children had considerably greater  		utilization rates in both years of life, particularly for inpatient hospital  		care. The average expenditure for high cost children was $12,262 in the first  		year of life and $4,853 in the second year. This was about 27 times the  		expenditure rate of other substance exposed children from birth to 12 months,  		and 15 times for 13-24 months. Because there were differences in the average  		length of Medicaid enrollment for the two groups, this difference was reduced  		slightly, when the expenditure rate was calculated using person years of  		enrollment.</p>

</tr></table><p>An analysis at the children in the comparison group showed a similar  		distribution. As expected, the data showed that a minority of children in the  		comparison group accounted for the vast majority of expenditures. Specifically,  		90% of child enrollees in the comparison group accounted for only 20.7% of  		expenditures, while expenditures for the top 10% of enrollees were 79.3% of  		total expenditures. <a href="#Exhibit23">Exhibit 23</a> presents selected study  		data for the high cost children in the comparison group. Generally, the high  		cost children in the comparison group showed similar patterns to the high cost  		children in the substance exposed group. For example, there was a greater  		proportion of males In the high cost group; they had a longer average length of  		enrollment over the study period; and there was a greater proportion of high  		cost children in foster care and SSI cash assistance.</p>
<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">MERGER WITH CALIFORNIA VITAL STATISTICS DATA</a></h2>
<p>The California Vital Statistics Data contain information on a number of  		variables not available in the Tape-to-Tape data, including: birth outcomes,  		receipt of prenatal care, race/ethnicity and marital status of the mother,  		previous pregnancy history, and complications in pregnancy and delivery. Strong  		relationships have been documented in the literature between (1) substance  		exposure and low birth weight, and (2) low birth weight and Medicaid  		expenditures. The Tape-to-Tape data were merged with the California Vital  		Statistics data for 1986, 1987, and 1988 to enable the examination of these  		relationships for the study and control groups.</p>
<p>As described earlier, the merged file included 6,018 children in the  		substance exposed cohort and 12,231 children in the comparison group.  		Approximately 77% of the original Tape-to-Tape children in both the study and  		comparison groups were successfully matched with the California Vital  		Statistics data. A first step was to insure that this new merged file was  		representative of the original study cohort and comparison groups. Next,  		descriptive analyses of the new variables available from the Vital Statistics  		file (race and marital status of the mother, pregnancy history, and birth  		outcomes) were undertaken for the study cohort and comparison groups, and  		further examined by birth weight category. Finally, multivariate analyses of  		low birth weight and Medicaid expenditures were carried out. The objective of  		the multivariate analyses was to examine whether substance exposure had both  		indirect effects on Medicaid expenditures (through the risk of low birth weight  		outcomes) and direct effects on expenditures, after controlling for low birth  		weight and other factors.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit24">Exhibit 24</a> presents some of the tabulations  		shown earlier for the Tape-to-Tape data, using the merged data set. Generally,  		these tabulations indicate the characteristics of the merged file are  		consistent with the original study cohort and comparison group. The  		distributions of the eligibility groups are very similar to those of the  		original Tape-to-Tape file, as are average adjusted Medicaid expenditures per  		child, the average age of the mothers, percentage of mothers living in an urban  		county, and the percentage of male children. Moreover, the study cohort and  		control group sample sizes are similar in proportion to the original  		Tape-to-Tape file.</p>

</tr></table><p>The incidence of low birth weight among the study cohort was even more  		striking than that for premature births. Over 18% of the infants in the study  		cohort had a birth weight of less than 2500 grams; the same was true of only  		7.7% of the control group.</p>
<h3><a name="sec4.2" id="sec4.2">Study Cohort Characteristics by Birth  		Weight</a></h3>
<p>Given the pronounced differences in the distributions of birth weight  		for the study and control groups, it is important to examine the distributions  		of the explanatory variables by birth weight for both groups; these  		distributions are presented in <a href="#Exhibit26">Exhibit 26</a> and  		<a href="#Exhibit27">Exhibit 27</a>. <a href="#Exhibit26">Exhibit 26</a>  		presents the variable distributions for the study cohort. Mothers of regular  		weight infants were more likely to be White (41.3%) or Hispanic (28.1 %) than  		mothers of low birth weight infants. In contrast, mothers of low and very low  		birth infants were more likely to be Black. Nearly 44% of very low birth weight  		mothers and over 46% of low birth weight mothers were Black.</p>
<p>Mothers age 30 or older were also more likely to give birth to low or  		very low birth weight infants. Nearly 39% of the mothers of very low birth  		weight infants and more than 28% of the mothers of low birth weight infants  		were age 30 or over. Only 23.4% of the mothers of regular weight infants were  		this age.</p>
<p>There were no dramatic differences in the unmarried status of mothers in  		the three birth weight categories. About 74% of the mothers of very low birth  		weight and regular birth weight infants were unmarried. Mothers of low birth  		weight infants were only slightly more likely to be unmarried (77.3%).</p>
<p>Mothers of very low and low birth weight infants were more likely to  		live in urban counties than mothers of regular weight infants. Nearly 68% of  		the mothers of very low birth weight infants and 68.9% of the mothers of low  		birth weight infants lived in urban counties. The same was true of only 62.5%  		of regular weight infants.</p>
<p>Compared to mothers of regular weight infants, mothers of very low birth  		weight and low birth weight infants were much more likely to have experienced  		previous terminations of pregnancies and complications of pregnancies and  		deliveries. Mothers of very low and low birth weight infants were also more  		likely to have given birth to a previous child.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, gestational age was strongly associated with birth  		weight. Nearly 23% of very low birth weight infants were very premature  		compared to only 2.3% of low birth weight and 0.5% of regular weight infants.  		An additional 46% of very low birth weight infants were premature. Forty-one  		percent of low birth weight infants were premature, as were 12.5% of regular  		weight Infants. Notably, 15.3% of very low birth weight infants and 47.8% of  		low birth weight infants were full term. In contrast, 79.6% of regular weight  		infants were full term.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#Exhibit27">Exhibit 27</a> also indicates that there were  		substantial differences in the age distributions of the study cohort and  		control groups and how they interacted with birth weight. The percentages of  		control group mothers aged 30 and over were substantially lower than the  		corresponding percentages for the study group in each birth weight category.  		Most striking of all, is the tact that 15.8% of the mothers of very low birth  		weight infants were age 30 or older--less than half the percentage of the  		corresponding mothers in the study group (38.7%). Moreover, among the mothers  		of the control group, there was no strong relationship between being age 30 and  		over, and low birth weight. As just mentioned, 15.8% of the mothers of very low  		birth weight infants were age 30 and over, compared to 19.2% of the mothers of  		low birth weight infants and 16.2% of the mothers of regular weight  		infants.</p>
<p><a href="#Exhibit25">Exhibit 25</a> indicated that the percentage of  		unmarried mothers was lower in the control group than in the study cohort. This  		was true for each birth weight category also. In contrast to the study cohort,  		however, the percentages of unmarried women were higher for underweight than  		for regular weight infants in the control group. Nearly 61% of the mothers of  		very low birth weight infants and 60.1% of low birth weight infants were  		unmarried, versus 52.2% of the mothers of regular weight infants.</p>
<p>Patterns of residence in urban counties by infant birth weight were  		similar for the study cohort and control group, except that differences by  		birth weight were stronger for the former. Approximately 65% of the mothers of  		very low birth weight infants in the control group lived in an urbanized  		county, compared to 62.6% of mothers of low birth weight and 61.7% of regular  		weight infants. The corresponding percentages for the study group were higher  		for underweight infants.</p>
<p>In general, the patterns of having a history of previous pregnancy  		terminations and experiencing complications with pregnancy and delivery were  		similar for the study cohort and control group across birth weight categories.  		The incidence of such problems, however, differed across variables in a  		sometimes unexpected fashion. For example, 32.3% of the mothers of very low  		birth weight infants in the control group had experienced at least one  		complication with pregnancy compared to 21.8% of the same group of mothers in  		the study cohort. Similarly, 39.1% of these mothers in the control group had  		experienced one complication with delivery, compared to 27.4% of the study  		cohort mothers of very low birth weight infants. On the other hand, 31.5% of  		the mothers of very low birth weight infants in the study cohort had a history  		of one very early pregnancy termination (&lt;=20 weeks)<font><a href="#note11">11</a></font> versus 27.8% of the corresponding mothers in the  		control group.</p>
<p>The distributions of numbers of previous children did not demonstrate a  		great deal of variation by birth weight for either the control group or the  		study cohort. The most notable difference for this variable was the greater  		incidence of previous births in the study cohort relative to the control group.  		This finding was noted earlier in reference to <a href="#Exhibit25">Exhibit  		25</a>.</p>
<p>Like the pregnancy history, pregnancy complications, and delivery  		complications variables, the distributions of gestational age by birth weight  		differed in complex ways between the study cohort and control group. The  		incidence of premature and very premature birth within the very low birth  		weight category was higher for the control group than the study cohort. In  		addition, the incidence of full term births was higher for the underweight  		infants in the study group than the control group. As expected, however, the  		percentage of full term pregnancies in the normal weight infant category was  		higher for the control group (85.7%) than the study cohort (79.6%). To  		disentangle these complexities, and others such as the differential racial  		composition of the study and control groups, multivariate analyses of low birth  		weight and Medicaid expenditures are presented in the following section.</p>
<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES</a></h2>
<p>A major goal of the analysis was to examine how birth weight and  		Medicaid expenditures were influenced by substance exposure, controlling for  		other potential influences. Several previous studies have used multivariate  		analysis to examine the determinants of low birth weight among infants born to  		Medicaid women (Devaney, Bilhemier and Schore, 1992; Howell, Herz, Wang and  		Hirsch, 1991). These studies have been helpful in understanding the factors  		influencing low birth weight but suggest that further research is necessary in  		several areas. In particular, what are the effects of substance exposure on the  		incidence of low and very low birth weight infants? Do the determinants of low  		weight births differ from those of very low weight births? What affect does  		substance exposure have on Medicaid expenditures per child during the first two  		years of life after controlling for other factors?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, two types of multivariate analyses were  		undertaken. First, the effects of substance exposure on the risk of low birth  		weight and very low birth weight were examined, controlling for the effects of  		other factors such as the demographic characteristics and pregnancy history of  		the mother. Second, the direct and indirect effects (through the risk of low  		birth weight) of substance exposure on Medicaid expenditures during the child's  		first two years of life were examined--again controlling for the effects of  		other variables. Multinomial logit analysis was used for the birth weight model  		because the outcome variable contained three discrete categories (very low  		birth weight, low birth weight, and normal weight). Multiple regression was  		used for the analyses of Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<h3><a name="sec5.1" id="sec5.1">Multinomial Logit Models of Low and  		Very Low Birth Weight</a></h3>
<p>By merging the California Tape-to-Tape data with the California Vital  		Statistics data, considerable information was available on the substance  		exposure of young children, characteristics of the mother, birth outcomes, and  		complications during pregnancy and delivery. The analysis presented thus far  		has identified differences between study cohort and control group mothers by  		the birth weight of their infants. Multivariate analyses were conducted to  		explore these differences further, as well as to ascertain the relative  		strength of alternative factors in explaining them. In the first stage of the  		analysis, a multinomial logit model of the factors associated with the  		probability of low and very low birth weight (normal birth weight was used as  		the reference category) was estimated. Variables included in the model were  		identified through a review of the literature. Factors previously found to be  		associated with low birth weight included demographic characteristics of the  		mother (race and ethnicity, age, marital status, and educational level), amount  		and timing of prenatal care, complications in pregnancy and delivery, and  		behavioral characteristics of the mother (smoking, weight gain, and substance  		abuse).</p>
<p>The results are shown in <a href="#Exhibit28">Exhibit 28</a>. In  		general, the equations for very low birth weight and low birth weight infants  		were very similar. In all instances, variables that were statistically  		significant in both models had the same signs in both models. The low birth  		weight equation had 14 coefficients that were statistically significant at the  		95 percent confidence level or higher. The very low birth weight equation had 8  		statistically significant coefficients. The somewhat stronger performance of  		the low birth weight equation was probably due to the greater sample size for  		low birth weight infants (n=1,793) relative to very low birth weight infants  		(n=257).</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>Low Birth Weight Model</i></b>. Several characteristics of the  		mother increased the odds of having a low birth weight infant (relative to  		having a normal weight infant): being Black or a member of another nonwhite,  		non-Hispanic group, age 35 or older, experiencing pregnancy complications,  		labor complications, being unmarried, and having a history of previous live  		births that had subsequently died. Mothers' characteristics that reduced the  		odds of having a low birth weight infant were: being Hispanic, age 18 or under,  		and the length of Medicaid enrollment during the pregnancy. Males were also  		less likely to be low birth weight infants. In addition, the dummy variable for  		1987 was negative and statistically significant, indicating that after  		controlling for all of the other variables in the equation, the odds of a  		Medicaid enrollee having a low birth weight infant were lower in 1987 than in  		1986 (the reference year).</p>
<p>The most important finding concerned the dummy variable for substance  		exposure. Members of the study group were more likely to be low birth weight  		infants, even after controlling for all of the other factors included in the  		equation. This finding was statistically significant at the 99.9 percent  		confidence level.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most interesting findings for low birth weight  		equation had to do with the dummy variable indicating the receipt of prenatal  		care in the first trimester. After controlling for the mother's length of  		Medicaid enrollment during her pregnancy, prenatal care was <i>not</i>  		statistically significant. When mother's length of Medicaid enrollment was  		dropped from the equation, prenatal care was still not statistically  		significant at a 95 percent confidence level. It seems clear from these  		findings that length of Medicaid enrollment is a stronger predictor of low  		birth weight than prenatal care, although the two are obviously related.</p>
<p><i><b>Very Low Birth Weight Model</b></i>. As in the low birth weight  		model, mothers' characteristics were powerful predictors of the odds of having  		a very low birth weight infant. Mothers' characteristics that increased the  		odds of having a very low birth weight infant were: being Black, having a  		history of pregnancy or labor complications, previous live births that were now  		dead, and previous pregnancy terminations less than or equal to 20 weeks.<font><a href="#note12">12</a></font> For the reasons mentioned earlier,  		however, the association between very early pregnancy terminations (&lt;= 20  		weeks) and birth weight should be interpreted with caution. The mother's length  		of Medicaid enrollment during her pregnancy red uced the odds of having a very  		low birth weight infant and was statistically significant at the 99.9 percent  		confidence level.</p>
<p>As with the low birth weight equation, being a member of the study  		cohort increased the odds of very low birth weight. Again, this finding was  		statistically significant at the 99.9 percent confidence level.</p>
<h3><a name="sec5.2" id="sec5.2">Multiple Regression Model of Medicaid  		Expenditures</a></h3>
<p>The second step in the multivariate analysis was to estimate a  		regression model of Medicaid expenditures. Several previous studies have  		examined the factors associated with low birth weight and Medicaid expenditures  		(e.g., Devaney, Bilheimer, and Schore, 1992; Howell, Herz, Wang, and Hirsch,  		1991). The simplest approach to examining the effects of low birth weight on  		expenditures is to include a dummy variable for low birth weight in the  		expenditure equation. If, however, the underlying factors that determine low  		birth weight also influence expenditure levels, then the residuals for these  		two equations will be correlated. Failure to take account of this correlation  		will lead to biased coefficient estimates in the expenditure equation. Several  		approaches have been developed to correct for this type of bias.</p>
<p>One well accepted method of correcting for sample selection bias is that  		developed by Heckman (1979). The first step in the Heckman approach is to  		estimate the equation for the probability of low birth weight. From the  		predicted probabilities of this model, a variable is constructed known as the  		inverse Mills ratio. The inclusion of the inverse Mills ratio (also known as  		lambda) in the expenditure equation controls for the bias that would otherwise  		be introduced by ignoring the unobserved determinants of the probability of  		being a low birth weight baby. A t-statistic can be used to test whether the  		selection bias is statistically significant (Heckman, 1979; Maddala, 1990).</p>
<p>The estimated Medicaid expenditure equation is reported in  		<a href="#Exhibit29">Exhibit 29</a>.<font><a href="#note13">13</a></font> The mother's age 18 years) and race/ethnicity  		(Hispanic origin, and other non-White, non-Hispanic origin) were found to be  		associated with higher Medicaid expenditures. Mothers who had a history of  		previous live births still living tended to have lower cost infants.</p>

</tr></table><p>Not surprisingly, infants with one or more congenital malformations had  		higher Medicaid expenditures. Similarly, the risk of low birth weight (as  		indicated by the inverse mills ratio) was also associated with higher  		expenditures. The finding that cesarean deliveries were more expensive was  		unexpected given that delivery charges were not included in the Medicaid  		expenditures. Perhaps the cesarean births reflect underlying health problems  		with the infant prior to delivery that carried over into the first two years of  		life. Male babies also had higher average Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>The finding that medically needy infants were associated with lower  		Medicaid expenditures was also very interesting. This may reflect the fact that  		medically needy infants more often have both parents living in the household  		and have higher incomes than other eligibility groups. Higher economic status  		may, in turn, be a proxy for better nutrition, living conditions, and other  		factors that could favorably influence health status--thereby lowering Medicaid  		utilization and expenses. In contrast, foster care infants tended to have  		significantly higher expenditures than infants receiving AFDC cash  		assistance.</p>
<p>Urban county of residence was also found to be associated with lower  		Medicaid expenditures. This was surprising since Medicaid payments to providers  		in urban areas would generally be expected to be higher than those in non-urban  		areas.</p>
<p>In addition, the dummy variable for 1988 was negative and statistically  		significant, indicating that after controlling for all of the other variables  		in the equation, enrollment adjusted Medicaid expenditures were lower in 1988  		than 1986 (the reference year).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important finding presented in <a href="#Exhibit29">Exhibit 29</a> is that of the effects of substance exposure  		on Medicaid expenditures. After controlling for all of the other factors  		included in the equation, membership in the study cohort was associated with  		higher Medicaid expenditures relative to membership in the control group.  		Moreover, there was an <i>additional</i> indirect effect of substance exposure  		on Medicaid expenditures that entered through the risk of low birth weight.</p>
<p>The findings from the multinomial logit and regression models are  		consistent with those of previous studies. The most closely related study is  		that of Howell, Herz, Wang, and Hirsch (1991) who examined the predictors of  		low birth weight for California Medicaid and non- Medicaid infants, as well as  		the determinants of Medicaid expenditures. As in this study, Howell et al.  		found that the mother's race, age, pregnancy and delivery history, and length  		of Medicaid enrollment during pregnancy were associated with the probability of  		low birth weight. Also as in this study, Howell et al. found that very low  		birth weight, congenital malformations, pregnancy and delivery complications,  		cesarean delivery, urban residence, and medically needy status (of infant) were  		associated with Medicaid expenditures. In addition, Howell et al. found that  		hospital characteristics (ownership and level of care) were strongly associated  		with Medicaid expenditures; the effects of hospital characteristics were not  		examined in the current study. The major difference between the current study  		and that of Howell et al., however, is that their emphasis was on the influence  		of prenatal care on birth outcomes. They did not investigate the effects of  		substance exposure on the probability of low birth weight or Medicaid  		expenditures.</p>
<p>Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore (1992) examined the determinants of birth  		weight in Florida, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. As in  		this study, they found that the sex of the child, mother's age, race, and  		marital status, previous pregnancy history, and urban residence (North Carolina  		only) influenced infant birth weight. They also found that prenatal care,  		prenatal WIC participation, and mother's education level influenced infant  		birth weight. The education level of the mother was not available in the  		California Tape-to-Tape or Vital Statistics data. In contrast to Devaney et  		al., however, the findings from this study indicate that prenatal care was not  		statistically significant after controlling for the length of the mother's  		enrollment in Medicaid during her pregnancy.<font><a href="#note14">14</a></font> Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore (1992), like Howell,  		Herz, Wang and Hirsch (1991), did not examine the effects of substance exposure  		on birth outcomes or Medicaid expenditures.<font><a href="#note15">15</a></font> They were interested mainly in the effects of  		prenatal WIC participation and the use of prenatal care on Medicaid birth  		outcomes.</p>
<h2><a name="conclu" id="conclu">CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>No matter what method of identification was used, study results showed  		that substance exposed children in their first two years of life cost the  		Medicaid program more than other children of the same age. How much more they  		cost was related to the method of identification. The study used a broad  		definition and methodology to identify substance exposed children, including  		the use of substance abuse diagnoses in the mothers' files for two years prior  		to delivery and 6 months post delivery. With this approach, substance exposed  		children had expenditures which were 40% greater than other Medicaid children  		in the first year of life and 22% greater in the second year. However, this  		difference was largely due to a much longer average length of enrollment on  		Medicaid for substance exposed children. Study data showed that children in the  		substance exposed group had a strong attachment to the Medicaid program and  		appeared to be long-term enrollees. When adjustments were made for length of  		enrollment, the Medicaid expenditure difference between substance exposed  		children and other Medicaid children was reduced to about 13% in the first two  		years of life.</p>
<p>Thus, substance exposed children had greater utilization and  		expenditures than other children. However, much of this difference was  		attributable to longer lengths of enrollment, not greater health cam needs.  		This result is important because some anecdotal information has implied that  		the long-term health care needs (and expenses) of substance exposed children  		far exceed those of other children. Study data over a two year period do not  		support this conclusion, when a broad definition of substance exposure for  		children is used.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is important to note that the percentage  		difference in <i>median</i> Medicaid expenditures between the study cohort and  		the control group was quite substantial. The median Medicaid expenditure for  		substance exposed infants was $465--94% higher than the median expenditure for  		the control group ($240). Nevertheless, it does not appear that substance  		exposed children have a substantial impact on aggregate Medicaid expenditures  		because the dollar magnitude of the difference in costs is fairly modest ($225)  		and substance exposed children represent a small percentage of the Medicaid  		infant population. Rather, it is the high cost children in <b>both</b> groups  		that have a major impact on the aggregate Medicaid expenditures and the average  		expenditure per child.</p>
<p>However, with a more conservative definition of substance exposure, i.e.  		only those children with direct diagnoses in their own claims records, the cost  		difference between substance exposed children and other Medicaid children was  		substantial. To use the terminology of Dicker and Leighton, this group could be  		called substance affected children, i.e. there was a direct diagnosis of  		medical problems caused by substance exposure in the children's files. These  		substance affected children (also called self-identified children in the text)  		had Medicaid expenditures approximately 90% greater than other substance  		exposed children, even with length of enrollment adjustments. Due to their high  		costs, this group of children with direct diagnoses of substance exposure in  		their records may be good candidates for case management under State Medicaid  		programs.</p>
<p>The study methodology did not identity nearly as many substance exposed  		children in the Medicaid population as other researchers have suggested. The  		study cohort represented 1.4% to 1.9% of the children born in 1986, 1987 and  		1988 who were enrolled in California's Medicaid program. However, without  		direct testing, the study methodology was limited in its ability to identify  		children with substance exposure. Other researchers have found that the  		identification rate of substance exposed infants is increased from 3 to 5 times  		if direct testing is utilized (Chasnoff, 1989, as reported by the General  		Accounting Office, 1990). There were also limitations regarding the diagnosis  		coding in California Medicaid claims data.</p>
<p>Even with the study limitations regarding the identification of  		substance exposed children, the incidence of substance exposed infants enrolled  		in California's Medicaid program increased by 44% from 1986 to 1988. If this  		growth rate continues and substance exposed children continue to show long-term  		enrollment in the program, the effect on California's Medicaid expenditures for  		children will become significant. In this time of limited resources, any group  		of children with greater service needs are a concern.</p>
<p>Study results confirmed both the growing numbers and high proportion of  		substance exposed children in foster care. Further, substance exposed children  		in foster care had higher Medicaid expenditures than other substance exposed  		children. The higher Medicaid costs of the substance exposed foster care  		subgroup, coupled with their costs in foster care payments, add to a growing  		burden on a system already under financial pressure.</p>
<p>One unexpected study finding was that many of the substance exposed  		children had mothers with strong attachments to the Medicaid program. For  		example, one-quarter of the mothers had been on Medicaid for the entire two  		years preceding delivery. This result reinforces the need for Medicaid  		treatment services for adults with substance abuse problems.</p>
<p>Study results also confirmed that substance exposure increases the risk  		of under weight births. Under weight births were, in turn, found to be  		associated with higher Medicaid costs over the first two years of life. Again,  		these results reinforce the need for Medicaid treatment services directed to  		adults with substance abuse problems.</p>
<p>The multivariate findings from the study confirmed the descriptive  		results. In particular, it was found that, after controlling for the influence  		of other variables, substance exposure increased the probability of under  		weight births and increased Medicaid expenditures. However, the mother's length  		of Medicaid enrollment had a very significant effect of lowering the  		probability of a low birth weight infant. When the mother's length of Medicaid  		enrollment during pregnancy was included in the equation, the variable for  		prenatal care in the first trimester was not statistically significant. These  		findings indicate that efforts to enroll pregnant women in Medicaid can help to  		reduce the likelihood of low birth weight infants, which are a significant  		factor in higher Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the time period analyzed in this study, the Federal  		government has imposed increased mandates to States to broaden Medicaid  		coverage for poor infants and pregnant women. These new initiatives could  		substantially increase the number of infants with substance exposure problems  		who are covered under Medicaid. Whether or not these children will exhibit the  		patterns of higher Medicaid utilization and expenditures seen with the study  		data is not known. It seems likely that a key factor will be the success of  		substance abuse treatment programs (that accept Medicaid payment) directed to  		both pregnant women and all low-income women of child-bearing age.</p>
<p>It would be helpful to investigate the incidence of substance exposed  		children in other State Medicaid programs, using a similar methodology.  		California's Medicaid program over the study period offered more comprehensive  		benefits and used less restrictive eligibility criteria than other States.  		These program differences could influence the number and characteristics of  		substance exposed children who were identified. On the other hand, there were  		limitations to the diagnosis data available in California's Medicaid files. For  		example, California's outpatient files do not include secondary diagnoses. As a  		result, the proportion of substance exposed children found in other States  		could be greater, especially with regard to problems related to alcohol  		abuse.</p>
<p>There are also opportunities for continued research with the California  		Medicaid data. It would be informative to continue tracking the study cohort to  		see if the pattern of long-term enrollment and greater expenditures persists.  		It would also be useful to look at children born in later years to determine  		whether the incidence of substance exposed infants has increased, particularly  		among the new Medicaid eligibility groups which measure family income against  		the poverty standard. Research could also be undertaken to further analyze the  		Medicaid experience of mothers of substance exposed children. For example, how  		long have they been enrolled in Medicaid and how many other children have they  		delivered under Medicaid coverage? What level of treatment have they received  		for their substance abuse problems?</p>
<p>Finally, it would be helpful to study the usefulness of the multivariate  		models for developing refined of the effects of substance exposure on Medicaid  		expenditures. Preliminary analyses indicated estimates that the relationships  		of substance exposure to Medicaid expenditures are extraordinarily complex. For  		example, this study controlled for the indirect effects of substance exposure  		on Medicaid expenditures through the probability of low birth weight infants.  		But it is reasonable to expect that there are similar interactions of substance  		exposure with race, foster care status, and other variables. Exploration of  		these indirect effects of substance exposure on Medicaid expenditures could be  		very useful in fully understanding the expenditure impacts and policy  		implications of substance exposure.</p>

<h2><a name="notes" id="notes">NOTES</a></h2>
<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">For</a> 1,060 children, only the mothers' records  			 were available. These children were excluded from the final study cohort for  			 analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">In</a> California, the EPSDT program is called the  			 Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">This</a> focus of Dicker and Leighton's study was  			 <b>drug affected</b>, not drug exposed, newborns. Drug affected newborns were  			 defined as those who, at the time of birth, were found to have symptoms  			 diagnosed by the attending hospital staff as due to the use of drugs by the  			 mother. The study reported in this paper and many other studies report in the  			 literature focus on <b>substance exposed</b> children, i.e. children exposed to  			 drugs at some time during the mothers's pregnancy, even if there are no  			 reported signs of a birth complication or a drug problem in the newborn. Thus,  			 drug affected children are a subset of substance exposed children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">Children</a> were assigned to the eligibility group  			 in which they were enrolled for the longest amount of time over the study  			 period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Estimates</a> from the National Hospital Discharge  			 Survey, National Center for Health Statistics, on rate of discharges and  			 average length of stay for patients under 1 year of age, excluding newborn  			 infants, discharged from short-stay nonfederal hospitals in the United  			 States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">It</a> should be noted that study data did not  			 permit the calculation of hospital neonatal intensive care expenditures for  			 either the study cohort or the control group. This limitation occurred because  			 Medicaid claims only indicate the hospital charges, not the "Medicaid amount  			 paid," in the accommodation field in which intensive care is reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">Marital</a> status is not directly provided on  			 California birth certificates. Rather it is inferred from an elaborate set of  			 rules based on the surnames of the mother and father provided on the birth  			 certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">The</a> early pregnancy termination variable needs  			 to be interpreted with caution because it includes both abortions and  			 miscarriages. No information was available from California Vital Statistics  			 data to determine the relative sizes of the two types of early pregnancy  			 terminations. In addition, the degree to which early pregnancy terminations are  			 reported consistently is unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">Very</a> premature infants are defined as those with  			 a gestational age of less than 28 weeks; infants with a gestational age of 28  			 to 37 weeks were defined as premature; and those with a gestational age of 38  			 weeks or more were defined as full term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">One</a> might expect that gestational age would be  			 more likely to be noted in the case of a premature birth than a full term  			 birth. <a href="#Exhibit26">Exhibit 26</a> and <a href="#Exhibit27">Exhibit  			 27</a>, however, indicate that gestational age was less frequently available  			 for very low and low birth weight infants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">The</a> California Vital Statistics Data do not  			 separate early pregnancy terminations into abortions and miscarriages. Nor is  			 it known, the extent to which this variable is coded consistently by hospitals.  			 Consequently, the meaning of the association of very early pregnancy  			 terminations with low or very low birth weight is not completely clear. It  			 seems, however, to be indicating a positive association between miscarriage and  			 low or very low birth weight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">The</a> reference group for the two previous  			 pregnancy termination dummy variables was <i>no</i> history of previous  			 pregnancy terminations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">The</a> dependent variable was the natural  			 logarithm of expenditures per child person year of enrollment for the study  			 period. The natural logarithm of these expenditures values was used as the  			 dependent variable in the regression to improve the normality of the model's  			 error distribution (e.g., Fox, 1991; Johnson, Johnson, Buse, 1987).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">In</a> their review of previous studies of the  			 effects of Medicaid on prenatal care and birth outcomes, Howell et al. (1991)  			 point out that results regarding these effects in the literature have been  			 mixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">In</a> addition to the studies just described,  			 which used data on individuals, a number of studies have used aggregate  			 (usually county of SMSA-level) data to examine the effects of prenatal care,  			 smoking, and substance abuse on low birth weight (Joyce, Racine, and Mocan,  			 1992; Frank, Strobino, Salkever, and Jackson, 1991; Jones, 1991; and Rosenzweig  			 and Schultz, 1983). In particular, Joyce et al. (1992) found evidence that  			 substance exposure increased the probability of Black low birth weight  			 infants.</p>
