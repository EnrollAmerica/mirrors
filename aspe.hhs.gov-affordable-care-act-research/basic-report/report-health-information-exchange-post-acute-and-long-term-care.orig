</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Clinicians require accurate and timely data to provide high quality  		patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Nowhere is this more important than  		at times of care transition, when patients are transferred from one health  		setting to another. Transfers among care settings are common. Twenty-three  		percent of hospitalized patients over the age of 65 are discharged to another  		institution, and 12% are discharged from hospital with skilled home care  		services (Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality HCUPnet, 1999). An  		estimated 19% of patients discharged from a hospital to a skilled nursing  		facility (SNF) are re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days (Kramer,  		Eilertsen, Lin &amp; Hutt, 2000). One study tracked post-hospital transitions  		for 30 days in a large, nationally representative sample of Medicare  		beneficiaries. Transitions in this study were defined as transfers to or from  		an acute hospital, emergency department, skilled nursing or rehabilitation  		facility, or home with or without home healthcare. Overall, 46 unique care  		patterns were identified during this relatively brief time period (Coleman,  		Min, Chomiak &amp; Kramer, 2004b). </p>
<p>As national awareness of medical errors and quality deficiencies that  		occur within particular care settings continues to rise (Institute of Medicine,  		2000), expanding evidence points to similar problems that occur during care  		transitions. Significant lapses in information transfer threaten patient  		safety; each time a patient's medical record is re-created, it increases the  		chance for a medical error and subsequent harm to occur. Inadequate information  		transfer can potentially increase healthcare expenditures, largely due to  		recidivism back to high-intensity care settings. Further, re-creation of  		essential information is not only inefficient but also can increase costs due  		to redundant ordering of laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, and procedures  		(Institute of Medicine, 2001; Coleman &amp; Berenson, 2004; van Walraven, Seth  		&amp; Laupacis, 2002b; van Walraven, Seth, Austin &amp; Laupacis, 2002a;  		Coleman &amp; Fox, 2004a).</p>
<p>Quantitative evidence increasingly indicates that patient safety is  		jeopardized during transitional care. Medication errors pose a significant  		threat to patients undergoing transitions (Forster, Murff, Peterson, Gandhi  		&amp; Bates, 2003). Receiving care in multiple settings often means that  		patients obtain medications from different prescribers. Clinicians rarely have  		complete information to adequately monitor the entire regimen, much less  		intervene to reduce discrepancies, duplications, or errors. For example,  		Boockvar and colleagues studied the series of transfers from a long-term care  		(LTC) nursing home to a hospital and then back to the LTC nursing home. On  		average, residents experienced three medication changes that led to an adverse  		drug event 20% of the time (Boockvar et al., 2004). Qualitative studies  		consistently have shown that patients and their caregivers are unprepared for  		their role in the next care setting, do not understand essential steps in the  		management of their condition, and are unable to contact appropriate healthcare  		practitioners for guidance (Weaver, Perloff &amp; Waters, 1998; vom Eigen,  		Walker, Edgman-Levitan, Cleary &amp; Delbanco, 1999; Harrison &amp; Verhoef,  		2002; Coleman et al., 2002; Levine, 1998). Each of these types of problems  		conspire to increase rates of recidivism to high-intensity care settings when  		patients' care needs at lower-cost settings are not met (Beers, Sliwkowski  		&amp; Brooks, 1992; Coleman et al., 2004b; Moore, Wisnevesky, Williams &amp;  		McGinn, 2003; van Walraven et al., 2002a).</p>
<h3>A. Previous Work Completed by the University of Colorado  		in Electronic Health Records</h3>
<p>In October 2002, the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center was  		awarded a contract by the Office for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE) to examine and report on the status of electronic health  		records (EHRs) in post-acute care (PAC) and LTC. As part of the project, ten  		"early adoptors" of EHR systems were interviewed to learn more about what  		applications were being used in their health delivery system (HDS) and whether  		PAC and LTC settings were included in their current roll-out plans. Site visits  		also were conducted at four other leading HDSs that had some degree of  		connectivity to affiliated PAC/LTC settings. All four of the health systems  		visited included an urban referral medical center in a medium-sized city with  		outreach into rural areas and smaller communities and hospitals. These health  		systems owned most of the providers (e.g., hospital, nursing homes, home health  		agencies [HHAs]) and employed most of the physicians in their systems (Kramer  		et al., 2004).</p>
<p>The interviewed and/or visited sites were relatively advanced in terms  		of EHR adoption. In general, electronic exchange of health information between  		acute and/or ambulatory care and PAC/LTC was limited to settings that were  		owned by the HDS (Kramer, Bennett, Fish, Lampinen &amp; Coleman, 2003).  		Electronic connectivity usually consisted of one-way communication (e.g., acute  		care to a SNF) and was circumscribed (e.g., read-only access by one or two  		employees, such as the director of nursing). In some cases, no electronic data  		exchange occurred between settings, although it was not necessarily merely a  		technological barrier that precluded this communication stream, but rather, was  		the result of other factors discussed below. Stakeholders in the PAC/LTC  		settings that received even limited electronic health information from other  		parts of the HDS perceived this type of exchange to be of significant value as  		a result of the implementation of an EHR by the HDS.</p>
<p>When probed about why PAC/LTC settings often were not included in the  		design and execution of the larger HDS's EHR roll-out, informants provided  		several reasons. Prioritization was placed on physician usage, both in the  		acute and ambulatory settings. Those interviewed about EHR system  		implementation firmly believed that if physicians "bought in" to EHR usage,  		other clinicians (e.g., nurses, therapists, social workers) and support and  		administrative staff would follow. The costs associated with EHR system  		adoption was a barrier and members of the delivery systems indicated that the  		PAC/LTC settings did not have the capital to initially purchase and support a  		robust, interoperable EHR system. Respondents from SNFs and HHAs indicated high  		staff turnover as another reason for limited EHR usage; training an  		ever-changing staff on the use of the EHR system was seen as a potential drain  		on their budget. Finally, a compelling business case had not been made for EHR  		adoption in many PAC/LTC settings. Thus, although interoperability between  		acute care and PAC/LTC settings was of potential value, this was not a high  		priority for many PAC/LTC settings. </p>
<h3>B. Goals for this Research Project</h3>
<p>ASPE undertook this current study to better understand: (1) the type of  		health information that needs to be exchanged; (2) the methods by which health  		information is exchanged; and (3) the factors that support or hinder timely  		health information exchange (HIE) including, but not limited to, electronic  		HIE. Building on the work previously described, this project is particularly  		focused on if information is exchanged and if so, the type of information that  		is exchanged and how it is exchanged between <i>unaffiliated</i> healthcare  		settings (i.e., the HDS does not own or operate the PAC/LTC setting). For  		example, how is information exchanged between an acute care setting and an  		unaffiliated SNF or HHA?</p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">II. METHODS</a></h2>
<p>This report is based on the most recent and current developments related  		to HIE in PAC and LTC. It builds upon the previous literature review conducted  		in the project that examined the status of EHRs in PAC and LTC and research on  		clinical information exchange needs at times of transition across the  		healthcare settings. Therefore, the literature reviewed for this project was a  		targeted search and was gathered from multiple and varied sources with the  		intention of obtaining only the most up-to-date material available. </p>
<p>The sources from which information was compiled included the OVID and  		Medline databases (available through the University of Colorado at Denver and  		Health Sciences Center, Denison Memorial Library), Internet searches, specific  		website searches, electronically-published periodicals, government reports,  		other relevant organizational information obtained and forwarded from the Task  		Order Manager (TOM), and stakeholder telephone interviews. </p>
<p>Searches of the OVID and Medline databases were made for peer-reviewed  		and nonpeer-reviewed publications within the last two years, using various key  		word and key word combinations (e.g., EHR, health information technology [HIT],  		Medicare, home health, nursing homes, or LTC). Titles and abstracts were  		reviewed and relevant articles were read, including mining each paper's  		reference list for any additional relevant work. Because the focus of the  		review required timely information combined with the delay often associated  		with publishing peer-reviewed journal articles, the selected searches resulted  		in limited peer-reviewed literature relevant to HIT and PAC/LTC. Significantly  		more literature was reviewed regarding HIT in general, and even more  		specifically, within hospital and ambulatory settings. </p>
<p>Internet searches were conducted using key terminology (e.g.,  		interoperability, Regional Health Information Organizations [RHIO]) or key  		organizations (e.g., American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM], Health  		Level 7 [HL7]) to narrow the requested information track. Also, because of the  		Federal Governments investment in this project, federal websites and  		links (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], Agency for  		Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], and Federal Register) were searched and  		regularly re-searched to keep abreast of current proceedings. Much of the  		historical information in this report was accessed from the government  		websites.</p>
<p>Several industry-related electronically-published periodicals and  		newsletters were subscribed to and/or accessed (e.g., Modern Healthcare's HITS  		[Health IT Strategist], and eHealth Initiative's EHI Smartbrief). The  		information gained from these sources was not always relevant to the project's  		focus, but rather gave an overview of the broader, more encompassing  		information technology and HIE topics. </p>
<p>Project-specific materials obtained by the TOM and forwarded to the  		project team also were used for background and preparation of this report.  		Meeting, seminar, and conversation summaries; conference presentations and  		handouts; and relevant links to organizational websites all were used to  		further the knowledge base for this project. </p>
<p>Approximately 20 stakeholder calls were conducted in February, March,  		and April 2006. The Project Director led each of the 30-60 minute calls, which  		also often included the TOM and/or the Principal Investigator. As an efficiency  		measure, calls frequently were scheduled with a group of people, although  		several were conducted with just one informant. Each individual (or group) was  		provided with a list of potential questions prior to the call; however, the  		conversations often covered other topics not provided beforehand. The open  		nature of these discussions ensured that the issues discussed were the most  		relevant and interesting topics specific to the stakeholder(s).</p>
<p>The types of representatives interviewed were specified in the contract,  		and in many cases, the TOM provided assistance in securing the interview. The  		complete list of stakeholders can be found in <a href="#appendA">Appendix  		A</a>. Stakeholders included representatives from HDSs, standards development  		organizations (SDOs), quality improvement organizations (QIOs), PAC/LTC  		associations, and various federal and state government agencies. </p>
<p>The following sections of this report are a synopsis as taken from the  		above-noted information sources. Topics included describe the growing HIT  		federal policy priority and its historical background, federal and private  		sector efforts to expand and support HIE, and current case models taken from  		stakeholder interviews.</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">III. FINDINGS FROM THE LITERATURE SEARCH AND  		STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS</a></h2>
<p>The information gathered from the referenced collection of literature  		and Internet searches, telephone interviews, and background data were drawn  		upon for Section III and <a href="#transition">Section IV</a>. The findings for  		this report are organized as follows: </p>
<p>Sections III.A, B, C, and D describe several initiatives underway in the  		public and private sectors to promote and support electronic HIE.  		<a href="#transition">Section IV</a> describes the types of health information  		needed as patients transition to and from PAC/LTC and other healthcare  		settings, methods and requirements for HIE at times of transition, and the  		relationship of emerging electronic health exchange activities to the types of  		information that is required or other wise needed at times of transition.</p>
<h3>A. Health Information Technology: A Growing Public and  		Private Policy Priority</h3>
<p>There is increasing recognition in both the public and private sectors  		that significant improvements in healthcare quality, continuity of care, and  		efficiency of care may be realized through implementation of HIT solutions.  		This section describes several of the activities undertaken by the public and  		private sectors to support the development and implementation of interoperable  		HIT. </p>
<p><b><i>1. Executive Order Establishing the Office of the National  		Coordinator</i></b></p>
<p>Federal HIT activities took a major step forward on April 27, 2004 when  		President G.W. Bush signed Executive Order 13335 (Federal Register, 2004b). The  		Executive Order recognizes the need for the development and nationwide  		implementation of an interoperable HIT infrastructure and established the  		position of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in HHS  		to provide leadership for this effort. The Executive Order describes an  		interoperable health information infrastructure as one that:</p>
<ul><li>Ensures that appropriate information to guide medical decisions is  		  available at the time and place of care; </li>
<li>Improves healthcare quality, reduces medical errors, and advances the  		  delivery of appropriate, evidence-based medical care; </li>
<li>Reduces healthcare costs resulting from inefficiency, medical errors,  		  inappropriate care, and incomplete information; </li>
<li>Promotes a more effective marketplace, greater competition, and  		  increased choice through the wider availability of accurate information on  		  healthcare costs, quality, and outcomes; </li>
<li>Improves the coordination of care and information among hospitals,  		  laboratories, physician offices, and other ambulatory care providers through an  		  effective infrastructure for the secure and authorized exchange of healthcare  		  information; and </li>
<li>Ensures that patients' individually identifiable health information  		  is secure and protected. </li>
</ul><p>The Executive Order requires the development of a strategic plan to  		support the development and implementation of the nationwide interoperable HIT  		infrastructure. The plan is required to address several issues: </p>
<ul><li>Advance the development, adoption, and implementation of healthcare  		  information technology standards through public and private collaboration;  		  </li>
<li>Address privacy and security issues related to interoperable HIT; and  		  </li>
<li>Ensure that key issues affecting the adoption of HIT are addressed.  		  </li>
</ul><p>In July 2004, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health  		Information Technology (ONCHIT) in HHS released a report, "The Decade of Health  		Information Technology: Delivering Consumer-Centric and Information-Rich Health  		Care" (Office for the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology,  		2004). The report outlines a framework for realizing the goal that most  		Americans have an interoperable EHR by 2014. The report identifies four  		critical goals with three strategies to achieve each goal:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Goal 1: Inform clinical practice</b> with use of EHRs.  		        Strategy 1. "Incentivize" EHR adoption  		        Strategy 2. Reduce risk of EHR  		  investment       Strategy 3. Promote EHR  		  diffusion in rural and underserved areas</p>
<p><b>Goal 2: Interconnect clinicians</b> so that they can exchange  		  health information.       Strategy 1. Foster  		  regional collaborations       Strategy 2.  		  Develop a national health information network (NHIN)  		        Strategy 3. Coordinate federal health  		  information systems</p>
<p><b>Goal 3: Personalize care with consumer-based health records and  		  better information for consumers</b>.  		        Strategy 1. Encourage use of Personal  		  Health Records (PHRs)       Strategy 2.  		  Enhance informed consumer choice  		        Strategy 3. Promote use of telehealth  		  systems</p>
<p><b>Goal 4: Improve population health through advanced biosurveillance  		  methods and streamlined collection of data for quality measurement and  		  research</b>.       Strategy 1. Unify public  		  health surveillance architectures  		        Strategy 2. Streamline quality and  		  health status monitoring       Strategy 3.  		  Accelerate research and dissemination of evidence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two goals and related strategies affect HIE between clinicians  		and providers. Activities that have been implemented that address these goals  		are described later in this report. </p>
<p><b><i>2. Information Gathering</i></b></p>
<p>After releasing the strategic framework, the ONCHIT released a request  		for information (RFI) on November 15, 2004 calling on all interested parties to  		answer 24 questions exploring the role of the Federal Government in  		facilitating the deployment of a NHIN (Federal Register, 2004a). ONCHIT  		received 512 responses to the RFI, including vendors, medical societies,  		healthcare providers, payors, and healthcare consumers (ONCHIT, 2005). The key  		themes that emerged from the responses indicated that the NHIN should be  		developed as a joint public/private effort, decentralized, and linked by  		standards. Respondents consistently indicated that the NHIN needed to address a  		variety of privacy and security issues. A summary report of the responses  		received from the RFI was released in June 2005 (ONCHIT, 2005).</p>
<p>Simultaneous with the RFI release, the ONCHIT convened the Secretary's  		Health Information Technology Leadership Panel, comprised of CEOs from nine  		major companies. Each CEO came from an industry outside healthcare (e.g.,  		Federal Express, Wal-Mart, Procter and Gamble) that had been transformed by  		information technology. Three key imperatives were identified by the Leadership  		Panel: </p>
<ol><li>Widespread adoption of interoperable HIT should be a top priority for  		  the United States healthcare system. </li>
<li>The Federal Government should use its leverage as the nation's  		  largest healthcare payor and provider to drive adoption of HIT. </li>
<li>Private sector purchasers and healthcare organizations can and should  		  collaborate alongside the Federal Government to drive adoption of HIT.</li>
</ol><p>Additionally, the panel outlined these conclusions:</p>
<ol><li>Potential benefits of HIT far outweigh manageable costs. </li>
<li>HIT needs a clear, broadly motivating vision and practical adoption  		  strategy. </li>
<li>The Federal Government should provide leadership, and industry will  		  engage and follow. </li>
<li>Lessons of adoption and success of information technology in other  		  industries should inform and enhance adoption of HIT. </li>
<li>Stakeholder incentives must be aligned to foster HIT adoption. </li>
<li>Among its multiple stakeholders, the consumer -- including individual  		  beneficiaries, patients, family members, and the public-at-large -- is  		  essential in the adoption of HIT and realizing its benefits (The Lewin Group,  		  2005).</li>
</ol><p><b><i>3. Establishing Public-Private Leadership</i></b></p>
<p>a. <i>The American Health Information Community (AHIC)</i>: In September  		2005, the Secretary of HHS formed the AHIC to help advance the goal that most  		Americans have EHRs within ten years. Membership of the AHIC is comprised of  		key public and private sector healthcare leaders. The AHIC is a federal  		advisory committee charged with providing input and recommendations to the  		Secretary of HHS on how to make health records digital and interoperable, while  		ensuring the privacy and security of these records.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, the AHIC has focused on developing "uses cases"  		(i.e., applications of HIT that could produce a specific tangible value within  		a short period of time [e.g., 2-3 years]). The AHIC has identified "uses-cases"  		in the following areas: Biosurveillance; Consumer Empowerment; and Electronic  		Health Records. </p>
<p>The AHIC will be identifying additional uses cases, such as a use case  		for PHRs that would benefit from the deployment of interoperable HIT standards.  		The AHIC has been chartered for two years, with an option to renew for no more  		than five years, to be succeeded by a private sector health information  		community initiative to set additional standards, certify new HIT technology,  		and to provide governance for care transformation.</p>
<p>b. <i>Health Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP)</i>: As  		recognized in the Executive Order, an essential requirement for developing and  		implementing an interoperable nationwide health information infrastructure is  		healthcare information technology standards. While there are many standards for  		HIE, there also are variations and gaps in needed standards that limit  		widespread adoption of interoperable HIT. To support the development, adoption,  		and implementation of interoperable HIT standards, HHS awarded a contract to  		the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), a private sector non-profit  		organization that administers and coordinates the United States' voluntary  		standardization activities, to convene the HITSP. The HITSP convenes  		stakeholders from SDOs and others to develop, prototype, and evaluate a process  		for achieving interoperable HIT standards across healthcare software  		applications, particularly EHRs.</p>
<p>The initial work of the HITSP has focused on identifying the standards  		needed for software applications related to the three use cases prioritized by  		the AHIC (see discussion above). Specifically, the AHIC recommended that HITSP  		identify standards needed for: </p>
<ul><li>secure messaging between patients and clinicians (e.g., secure e-mail  		  between patients and doctors); </li>
<li>reporting laboratory results; and </li>
<li>electronic patient registration information. </li>
</ul><p>c. <i>Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology  		(CCHIT)</i>: In September 2005, HHS awarded a three-year contract to the CCHIT  		to develop certification criteria and processes for HIT products. The CCHIT  		initially focused on criteria needed for physician office EHR products, and are  		now specifying criteria for inpatient hospital EHRs. The third year will focus  		on criteria development for the networks through which these products exchange  		information. The criteria specified by the CCHIT for physician office EHR  		products are divided into three categories: </p>
<ol><li>Functional requirements (i.e., minimum functional requirements for  		  managing and documenting a patient encounter, including problem lists,  		  allergies, medication lists and orders, patient's election of advance  		  directives, laboratory results reporting, generating hard and electronic copies  		  of summary reports, etc.).</li>
<li>Interoperability (i.e., standards needed to exchange health  		  information within and across healthcare settings).</li>
<li>Security and reliability (i.e., standards needed to audit access to  		  the patient's record, standards to ensure that information in an EHR is  		  consistently displayed, etc.).</li>
</ol><p>The criteria for physician office EHR products were developed by CCHIT  		through a series of public meetings at which comments were obtained regarding  		needed EHR certification criteria for ambulatory care EHRs. The CCHIT criteria  		overlap with the EHR System Functional Model and Standards developed by HL7 and  		the ambulatory care profile advanced by HL7 (see <a href="#sectionIII.B.1">Section III.B.1</a> for more information on these  		criteria).</p>
<p>In May 2006, the AHIC unanimously approved the CCHIT: (1) functionality,  		and (2) security and reliability criteria for certification of ambulatory EHRs  		and recommended that the Secretary formally recognize these ambulatory care EHR  		certification criteria. To ensure interoperability, the AHIC also recommended  		that the CCHIT incorporate HITSP standards on an ongoing basis (HHS,  		2006a).</p>
<p>In July 2006, CCHIT announced the certification of EHR products offered  		by 18 companies as meeting the criteria established by CCHIT. Another 11 EHR  		products were certified in October 2006. A listing of the certified products  		(by product name and by company name can be viewed on the CCHIT website (CCHIT,  		2005).</p>
<p>The Secretary of HHS formally recognized the CCHIT ambulatory care EHR  		certification criteria in a July 2006 Federal Register notice (Federal  		Register, 2006). "CCHIT Certified<sup>SM</sup> product certification provides  		an objective set of criteria against which HIT products can be measured to  		enable purchasers to reliably make an investment in those products and to  		assure healthcare consumers that they can trust their healthcare information to  		be stored in those products" (CCHIT, 2006b). Certifying EHR products is one  		step toward minimizing the risk that healthcare providers encounter when making  		HIT investment decisions. </p>
<p>In November 2006, CCHIT issued a press release announcing that HHS  		authorized and funded CCHIT to expand its scope of work (SOW) for the  		certification of EHR products to include two to three medical specialties and  		specialized care settings during this next year. The press release notes that  		CCHIT will establish a "fair and objective process for prioritizing which  		specialties should be addressed first" and will take into account the: (i)  		amount of criteria development work required, (ii) readiness for the  		specialty/care setting to participate in development of EHR certification  		criteria, and (iii) potential positive impact certification could have on EHR  		adoption in the selected specialty/setting. The CCHIT anticipates discussing  		the readiness of additional healthcare settings and specialties for EHR  		certification standards during its January 2007 meeting. </p>
<p><b><i>4. Addressing Privacy and Security Issues</i></b></p>
<p>Timely access to complete and reusable health information is critical  		for improving quality, continuity, and efficiency of care. Ensuring appropriate  		disclosures of and providing adequate security for health information  		consistently have been identified as issues that must be addressed in the  		emerging national health information infrastructure. While the Health Insurance  		Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) established rules concerning  		healthcare privacy and security requirements for protected health information,  		many states and healthcare organizations have adopted policies that go beyond  		HIPAA. As a result, the variability in privacy and security policies poses  		challenges for electronic HIE. </p>
<p>To address these issues a contract was awarded to the Research Triangle  		Institute (RTI) to convene the Health Information Security and Privacy  		Collaboration (HISPC). In May 2006, 22 states and territories entered into  		subcontracts with RTI to address privacy and security policy questions  		affecting interoperable HIE. The subcontractors will examine variations in  		privacy and security practices that affect electronic HIE, and develop best  		practices and propose solutions to address identified challenges. The solutions  		that are identified via these subcontracts will provide a foundation for future  		work to facilitate HIE across states (ONCHIT &amp; HHS, 2006).</p>
<p><b><i>5. Development of a National Health Information  		Network</i></b></p>
<p>In November 2005, HHS awarded contracts to four consortia to develop  		prototypes for a NHIN architecture that will allow for the secure exchange of  		healthcare information across the healthcare continuum. Each of the four  		consortia submitted functional requirements for a NHIN. To address the  		functional requirements needed for a nationwide health information network, the  		NHIN Forum was convened in June 2006, and was sponsored by multiple public and  		private entities (e.g., the ONC, the four consortia developing the NHIN  		prototypes, HITSP, CCHIT, and other key representatives of public and private  		HIT stakeholders). </p>
<p>Discussion at the forum focused on: </p>
<ul><li>the categories of "functional requirements" needed for a NHIN (e.g.,  		  security, data transmission and transformation, information location); and  		  </li>
<li>the components and requirements needed by the NHIN and the  		  applications that will be participating in the exchange of health information.  		  </li>
</ul><p>In July 2006, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics  		(NCVHS) was asked to review and synthesize the results of the June 2006 NHIN  		Forum and by September 30, 2006, define a minimal, but inclusive, set of  		functional requirements needed for the initial definition of an NHIN and its  		possible architectural forms. Although these requirements will not make the  		actual architectural decisions per se, they should clearly designate common  		requirements as well as requirements that are specific to particular prototype  		architectures. </p>
<p><b><i>6. National HIT Infrastructure</i></b></p>
<p>Each of the public and private sector activities described above -- the  		AHIC, HITSP, CCHIT, HISPC, NHIN -- are critical components of the emerging  		National HIT infrastructure. The diagram in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>,  		posted on the Federal Health Architecture (FHA) website  		(<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/fedhealtharch/fedpart.html">http://www.hhs.gov/fedhealtharch/fedpart.html</a>), highlights the opportunities  		the Federal Government and the private sector will have in shaping and  		participating in the development and implementation of this infrastructure. The  		diagram reflects a process through which the Federal Government and private  		sector have input into a process that will result in interoperability between  		these two sectors.</p>
<p><b><i>7. The Federal Health Architecture and Standards </i></b></p>
<p>One stakeholder in the national HIT infrastructure is the FHA. The FHA  		emerged in March 2001, initially as one facet of the government's electronic  		government initiative, the Federal Enterprise Architecture. At that time, the  		FHA was a collaboration across federal agencies charged with creating "a  		consistent federal framework to facilitate communication and collaboration  		among all healthcare entities to improve citizen access to health-related  		information and high quality services" (HHS, 2006d). </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure1" id="figure1">FIGURE 1</a>: Federal  			 and Private Sector Process for Interoperability</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68791/HIErpt-fig1.JPG" /></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>SOURCE</b>: U.S. Department of  			 Health and Human Services, 2006d.</font></td>
</tr></table><p>In 2006, the scope of the FHA was redefined to support the President's  		vision of widespread adoption of interoperable EHRs by most Americans within  		ten years. Thus, the new focus of the FHA was expanded from interoperability  		across federal health agencies to supporting interoperability in both the  		public and private sectors. </p>
<p>One of the key activities of the FHA as originally implemented was the  		Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) Initiative. The CHI Initiative was a  		collaborative effort that resulted in the adoption of several HIT  		interoperability standards (i.e., content and messaging standards) to be  		implemented by federal agencies to enable the exchange of electronic health  		information across the Federal Government. In 2005, HHS published a Federal  		Register notice stating that "[t]he portfolio of 20 adopted standards will be  		used by all federal agencies in implementing new, and to the extent possible  		modifying existing HIT systems, as well as related business processes" (Federal  		Register, 2005a).</p>
<p>The CHI Initiative is being disbanded, and will conclude with the  		production of reports on standards needed for the domain of patient assessments  		and disability content. On October 11, 2006 the NCVHS considered and endorsed  		the CHI recommended content and messaging standards for patient assessment and  		functioning and disability content (HHS NCVHS Subcommittee on Standards and  		Security, 2006; CHI, 2006). Implementation of these standards will support the  		development and use of interoperable HIT applications in PAC/LTC settings that  		are required to complete and submit electronic patient assessments. </p>
<p>It is expected that the HITSP will fill the role of identifying  		standards and implementation guides needed for specific use cases and other  		priority areas. HITSP is required to take into account CHI standards.</p>
<h3>B. Other Standards Development Activities</h3>
<p><b><i><a name="sectionIII.B.1" id="sectionIII.B.1">1. Health Level Seven  		(HL7)</a></i></b></p>
<p>HL7 is one of the most well known ANSI-approved SDOs in healthcare. It  		is a non-profit organization made up of volunteers in the healthcare industry,  		including healthcare providers, software vendors, payors, and government  		representatives who are interested in formulating standards for clinical and  		administrative health data. Currently, the most widely used HL7 standards are  		messaging standards that allow disparate healthcare applications to exchange  		sets of information with each other (Health Level Seven Inc., 2006a).</p>
<p>a. <i>Electronic Health Record System Functional Model</i>: The HL7  		Electronic Health Record System (EHR-S) functional model (FM) is a different  		set of specifications than the traditional messaging standards approved by HL7.  		The EHR-S FM consists of three separate categories of functions that describe  		the myriad of functions possible in an EHR-S: (a) direct care functions,  		such as care management; (b) supportive functions, such as resource  		tracking and research, or report generation; and (c) information  		infrastructure. At the time of the writing of this report, this model is in  		draft standard trial use form and is awaiting final approval by HL7. This model  		represents a change from previous HL7 models by attempting to define functions,  		rather than technical or messaging components. The balloting timeframe for the  		EHR-S FM is anticipated to take place sometime in 2006, with ANSI-accreditation  		to follow.</p>
<p>HL7 workgroups have been formed to define the subset of EHR functional  		requirements needed in particular settings such as physician offices,  		hospitals, and nursing homes (Health Level Seven Inc., 2005). The specification  		of the subset of functions needed in particular settings is considered by HL7  		to be a "profile." HL7 defines a profile as a "specification that uses the  		Functional Model to indicate which functions are required, desired, or  		implemented for certain EHR systems or healthcare delivery settings." </p>
<p>b. <i>Long-Term Care Minimum Function Set Workgroup</i>: The HL7  		workgroup specifying the functional requirements for nursing homes is the  		Long-Term Care Minimum Function Set workgroup. The Long-Term Care Minimum  		Function Set workgroup is charged with creating conformance criteria for a LTC  		profile related to the direct care functions as described in the EHR-S  		functional model. EHR systems do not claim conformance to the HL7 EHR-S FM;  		rather, they conform to one or more profiles (defined by HL7 as a specification  		to indicate which functions are required, desired, or implemented for certain  		EHR systems or healthcare delivery settings). The LTC profile then, is a subset  		of the FM, which will define functions for a LTC EHR system pertinent in  		providing direct care to patients in nursing homes (Health Level Seven Inc.,  		2005). The completion of the LTC profile likely will not be completed until the  		end of 2006 (Stakeholder call with LTC Profile Group, February 3, 2006). </p>
<p>Similar to the process established for ambulatory care EHRs and expected  		for hospital EHRs, CCHIT could consider the HL7 LTC Minimum Function Set for  		EHR functional and interoperability requirements should CCHIT ever establish  		EHR certification criteria for LTC EHRs. </p>
<p><b><i>2. ASTM Continuity of Care Record and HL7's Clinical Document  		Architecture/CCD</i></b></p>
<p>There are two, now related, standards development activities that are  		particularly pertinent to HIE. The Continuity of Care Record (CCR), developed  		by the ASTM, is a standard for compiling summary information for physicians to  		share with one another and is designed to provide a comprehensive clinical  		picture of a patient's current and relevant historical health status (Center  		for Health Information Technology, 2006; Stakeholder call with David Kibbe,  		February 17, 2006). According to the standard specifications, the CCR is "a  		core data set of the most relevant administrative, demographic, and clinical  		information facts about a patient's healthcare, covering one or more healthcare  		encounters" (ASTM International, 2006). The CCR is not a mini-medical record;  		rather it is a snapshot summary (a data set) of a medical record that is  		delivered from setting to setting, and could potentially be displayed in an  		EHR. It is anticipated that providers would be able to auto-populate the CCR  		with data elements from their EHR and then electronically send them. To date,  		ASTM has not specified whether certain clinical domains must be populated and  		whether certain data elements will be required for an acceptable CCR document  		(i.e., at what point does a partial update detract from the goal of information  		transfer). </p>
<p>HL7's Clinical Data Architecture (CDA), Release 2 (r2) was approved in  		June 2005 and is a document architecture standard designed to standardize how  		clinical documents are expressed. In other words, the structure and semantics  		of clinical documents are specified to facilitate HIE (Dolin et al., 2006). The  		CHI Initiative adopted, as an HIT standard, the CDA for text-based reports.  		</p>
<p>On November 2, 2005, HL7 announced that in collaboration with ASTM, they  		are developing an implementation guide to express the CCR data set in an HL7  		Version 3 (V3) CDA, r2 document (Health Level Seven Inc., 2006b). This  		collaborative specification effort is referred to as the Continuity of Care  		Document (CCD) (Alschuler, 2006). The CCD will map CCR content into a CDA r2  		representation, which will enable the exchange of human-readable (text) and/or  		coded transfer documents. The ability to send either coded or text documents  		has the potential to improve quality of care by making clinical information  		readily accessible to the clinician who has the option of reading the  		information while enabling computers to reuse the information for a variety of  		purposes (e.g., performing automated data extraction, facilitating the use of  		computerized decision support, implementing an adverse event alerting system).  		</p>
<p>The authors of the CCR and CCD have attempted to identify and represent  		categories of information important in care planning and care of patients as  		patients transition from setting/healthcare provider to another (e.g.,  		discharge from acute care as well as from other settings). The structured  		representation of this information should help EHR vendors and HDSs better  		process information at times of care transition. HL7 and ASTM released a  		December 6, 2006 Informative Ballot for an HL7 Implementation Guide for the CCD  		to exchange standardized and text-based summary reports about a patient's  		health and functional status, and other pertinent data about a patient  		including advance directives, problems, family and social history, medications,  		immunizations, etc. The CCD Informative Ballot identifies the vocabulary sets  		(as approved the HL7 Vocabulary Committee) needed for some of the various  		clinical domains included in the CCD. The standards included in the CCD ballot  		include those standards recently endorsed by the CHI and NCVHS for patient  		assessments and functional and disability content. The HITSP has indicated that  		it will work "in the coming months to include a harmonized summary record (CCD)  		standard into interoperability specifications" and has indicated that it will  		likely endorse components of the CCD (e.g., demographics, medications and  		allergies) for the AHICs consideration (Office for the National  		Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 2006; Healthcare Information  		Technology Standards Panel, 2006).</p>
<p>Various groups have been examining the utility of various HIT exchange  		standards. One group is Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), which is a  		consortium of vendors. They have been demonstrating the feasibility of  		integrating and transferring data from a wide variety of sources. IHE takes  		existing standards (e.g., CDA and HL7 v2 messages, DICOM, X12) and  		implementation guides (e.g., CCD) and creates profiles for how they can be put  		together with vendor applications to create an interoperable architecture.  		Using an analogy of the post office, the messaging standards are the envelope,  		the CDA is the letter inside the envelope, and the EHR systems are the senders  		and recipients. With this analogy in mind, the Patient Care Coordination group  		within IHE recently examined the CDA Care Record Summary (the precursor to the  		CCD) Implementation Guide and created a profile that demonstrated how different  		entities can send messages back and forth and move CDA around an exchange  		network into and out of EHR systems (Stakeholder interview, Liora Alschuler,  		April 10, 2006).</p>
<p>IHE also has held "Connectathons" for several years, inviting industry,  		providers, and others to find solutions to the barriers between electronic  		systems that limit the ability to transfer information and knowledge needed for  		optimal patient care. Sets of tasks are defined through use cases (such as  		sharing coded patient summary documents between institutions), the integration  		framework and actions needed to guarantee interoperability, and participants  		then are given the opportunity to demonstrate how they would make use of the  		framework, data standards, and other components to send information between  		systems. The example use cases involve within institution connectivity between  		different vendors (e.g., a radiology system to an EHR) as well as data sharing  		between institutions, such as discharge summaries or between specialists and  		primary care providers.</p>
<p>Until recently, little focus has been given to LTC/PAC, although the  		general frameworks and interoperability requirements for inter-institution  		information transfer are relevant to the needs of SNFs and HHAs (IHE, 2006).  		Currently, use cases that provide specific support for the unique communication  		requirements of aging services organizations are being advanced for IHE  		consideration. In particular, in October 2006, the Center for Aging Services  		Technologies (CAST) and the American Health Information Management Association  		(AHIMA) announced the formation of a workgroup to develop the requirements,  		recommendations, guidelines, and standards advocacy towards the adoption of an  		HL7 implementation guide for the CCD with support for functional status and  		wellness content. Their stated goals are to initiate work that will  		result in an HL7 approved implementation guide, progress standards related to  		functional status and wellness content, and complete formal interoperability  		demonstrations of vendor, provider and consumer uses (CAST, 2006). </p>
<p><b><i>3. National Council for Prescription Drug Program LTC  		e-prescribing</i></b></p>
<p>The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, Inc. (NCPDP) is a  		non-profit ANSI-accredited standards organization with approximately 1,350  		members (NCPDP, 2006b). The NCPDP workgroup 14 (WG14) currently is identifying  		fields that are pertinent to LTC and PAC to add to the NCPDP SCRIPT standard.  		The SCRIPT standard was developed to allow for the electronic transmission of  		prescription information between healthcare providers and pharmacies. The  		standard currently addresses the electronic exchange of new prescriptions,  		refills, prescription fill status notifications, and cancellation notifications  		(NCPDP, 2006a). As described in <a href="#sectionC.2">Section C.2</a>, the  		NCPDP SCRIPT standard was adopted as one of the e-prescribing final rules  		required for electronic prescribing under the Medicare Part D drug benefit.</p>
<h3>C. Efforts to Support Electronic Health Information  		Exchange</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the report prepared by the ONCHIT entitled, "The  		Decade of Health Information Technology: Delivering Consumer-Centric and  		Information-Rich Health Care" includes a goal to interconnect clinicians  		through the following strategies: </p>
<ul><li>fostering regional collaborations;</li>
<li>developing a NHIN that develops and uses interoperable HIT standards;  		  and</li>
<li>coordinating the federal health information systems. </li>
</ul><p>Much of the preceding discussion has described public and private  		efforts to develop a NHIN, including federal health information systems, using  		interoperable HIT standards. This section of the report describes some of the  		activities that have been undertaken by the public and private sectors to  		promote and support HIE. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality HIT Planning and  		Implementation Grants for State and Regional Health Information  		Exchange</b></i></p>
<p>The AHRQ has been a leader in supporting the goal of modernizing  		healthcare using information technology. To help in the dissemination of  		constantly changing knowledge regarding HIE, AHRQ created the National Resource  		Center for Health Information Technology and through this initiative, supports  		many wide ranging opportunities for HIE. Included are the AHRQ Transforming  		Healthcare Quality Through IT (THQIT) grants, which were created to help fund  		regional and local community planning, implementation, and demonstration grants  		to illustrate the value of HIT and exchange. At this time, AHRQ has awarded  		over 100 THQIT grants. Six State and Regional Demonstration (SRD) projects  		focused on establishing statewide HIE also have been funded. In October 2005,  		AHRQ awarded 16 grants (11 of which involved small, rural communities) in the  		amount of $22.3 million to implement HIT systems and improve the safety and  		quality of healthcare (AHRQ, 2006). In addition, in 2004, AHRQ made SRD awards  		totaling $34.7 million to Colorado, Indiana, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Utah.  		These five-year SRD grants were awarded for development of statewide  		information technology networks that will facilitate data sharing and transfer  		among healthcare providers (including purchasers, payers, hospitals, and home  		health and nursing home providers). At the time of this writing, no findings  		are yet available on these efforts.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="sectionC.2" id="sectionC.2">2. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of  		2003</a></i></b></p>
<p>The MMA included some provisions that support electronic HIE. These are  		described below.</p>
<p>a. <i>e-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Benefit Program</i>:  		Beginning in January 2006, the MMA establishes an electronic prescribing  		program to support the Prescription Drug Benefit program. The MMA mandates the  		use of HIT standards for certain prescribing functions if a practitioner elects  		to engage in e-prescribing on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. It also  		requires that drug plans participating in the new prescription benefit support  		electronic prescribing. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule  		requiring the use of certain HIT standards for e-prescribing. As noted in the  		Final Rule for the Medicare Program; e-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug  		Program, 42 CHR Part 423, (Federal Register, 2005b), the e-prescribing program  		mandates specific standards for transactions, eligibility, communication  		between prescribers and drug plans, communication between dispensers and Part D  		sponsors, and formulary and benefit coverage. The adopted message format  		standards approved at this time are: </p>
<ul><li>NCPDP SCRIPT, version 5.0 from the NCPDP -- (the newer version 8.1  		  has been requested for use in lieu of version 5.0, using backward  		  compatibility) -- for core functions and transactions between providers and  		  dispensers;</li>
<li>ANSI Accredited Standards Committee ASC X12N 270/271, Health Care  		  Eligibility and Response Standard (004010X092A1) from the ANSI -- for  		  eligibility and benefit inquiries, and responses between providers and Part D  		  sponsors; and </li>
<li>NCPDP Telecommunication Standards, v 5.1 (and equivalent Batch  		  Standard, Version 1.1) from the NCPDP -- for eligibility and benefits (this is  		  the HIPAA standard). </li>
</ul><p>The final rule for e-prescribing exempts LTC settings because of their  		unique three-way prescribing process (facility-physician-pharmacy) and the  		uncertainty about the applicability of required standards for this type of HIE.  		</p>
<p>The final rule provides for the testing of additional standards through  		pilot studies funded by CMS and AHRQ. The standards to be evaluated in the  		pilots include those for information on formulary and benefits, patient  		instructions, prior authorization messages, and clinical drug terminology. The  		pilot studies were awarded in January 2006, with a Report to Congress due in  		April 2007, followed by the final rule for recommended additional standards  		scheduled for April 2008. </p>
<p>E-prescribing pilots were granted to Rand Corporation of California;  		Brigham and Women's Hospital of Boston; SureScripts; and Achieve Healthcare  		Technologies. The pilot study led by Achieve Healthcare Technologies,  		implemented in Eden Prairie, Minnesota is of particular interest to this study.  		This pilot is evaluating the use of e-prescribing standards for nursing homes  		(Benedictine Health Systems, Minnesota). It will test standards that augment an  		existing communication network between facilities, pharmacies, and physicians.  		As comparison sites, two LTC facilities will be included that will use the  		traditional, paper-based prescribing methods. The standards will be analyzed  		from the perspective of functionality, cost benefits, and improvements in  		patient safety and quality of care.</p>
<p>Electronic prescribing also can bring other changes in HIE to the home  		health and nursing home care settings. As mandated in the MMA of 2003,  		exceptions to the Stark Rule (CMS) and the anti-kickback statute (Office of the  		Inspector General) have been authorized. In August 2006, HHS published two  		final rules in the Federal Register providing limited exceptions to the Stark  		law and anti-kickback statutes. These changes now permit the sharing of: (1)  		information technology resources to support EHRs, easing the provision of  		information technology software and/or services to physicians and other  		healthcare entities; and (2) technology and services related to e-prescribing.  		Among the conditions noted is the requirement that software must be  		interoperable, in accordance with CCHIT. The above changes have increased the  		ability to advance HIE among all care providers by enabling smaller entities  		with financial limitations to become connected with hospitals, physicians,  		etc.</p>
<p>While the above regulation changes can facilitate interoperable HIE, the  		new e-prescribing program also has instigated problems that will need to be  		resolved. Many state laws take precedence over new e-prescribing regulations,  		such as New York State, which recently required that all prescriptions be  		written in triplicate, derailing the benefits that e-prescribing offers,  		including streamlining communication between physicians and pharmacies  		(Stakeholder call with Mark Callahan, New York Presbyterian, February 2006).  		Other issues that will need to be addressed within the scope of e-prescribing  		that affect the PAC/LTC environment include costs; different regulations, not  		only within states but for controlled substances; the federal Drug Regimen  		Review; and electronic signature standard requirements (Friedman, 2005).</p>
<p>b. <i>Medicare Health Care Quality (MHCQ) Demonstration Program</i>: The  		MMA of 2003 mandated several demonstration programs to improve and modernize  		the Medicare program. One of these demonstrations is Section 646 of the MMA,  		the MHCQ Demonstration Program. As stated by CMS, the objective of this major  		initiative is to improve quality while increasing efficiency through major,  		regional-level healthcare system redesign. As such, providers and communities  		have the opportunity to reform Medicare payment and redesign care delivery from  		the most basic to the highest level (CMS, 2006a).</p>
<p>Prior to the release of the Request for Proposals (RFP) in Spring 2005,  		CMS requested input and discussion from a variety of stakeholders and  		interested parties with regard to the overarching goals of the demonstration,  		and in September 2005, released RFP CMS-5017-N for submission of proposals with  		two separate solicitation phases (January 30, 2006, and September 29, 2006).  		From the submitted proposals, 8-12 healthcare organizations will be selected to  		participate in the five-year demonstration.</p>
<p>Within the context of the MMA, the goals of the Section 646 MHCQ  		demonstrations are to improve patient safety, enhance quality, increase  		efficiency, and reduce scientific uncertainty and medical variation that  		results in lower quality and higher costs (CMS, 2006b). To meet the above  		goals, CMS defined system redesign to include adoption and use of decision  		support tools, reform of payment methodologies, outcome measurements, and  		enhanced cultural competency in delivery of care. One component of system  		redesign should include adoption of and use of HIT within practice settings and  		clinical data exchange across and among practice settings within a community;  		in essence, a prototype national NHIN. To augment the across settings system  		exchange and encourage participation on a regional level, CMS identified  		specific groups that were eligible to compete in this demonstration award,  		including physician groups, integrated delivery systems, and/or organizations  		representing regional coalitions (which must include a full range of providers,  		including hospitals, clinics, HHAs, and SNFs). At the time of this report,  		these awards have not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>D. Adoption of Health Information Technology: Other  		Select Efforts</h3>
<p>Barriers to the adoption of electronic HIT, including concerns of  		funding, interoperability, security, and investment return are well documented.  		A recent survey published in Healthcare Financial Management Association  		reported that the primary reasons for slow adoption rates of interoperable  		information technology systems by physician practices and hospitals include the  		lack of funding, the lack of standards, engaging physicians to adopt new  		technology, and the lack of interoperability (Healthcare Financial Management  		Association, 2006). With the high start-up and on-going maintenance costs,  		limited standardized HIT products, uncertainty regarding the value of available  		products, and the absence of a strong business case for incurring such an  		expense, convincing these health providers to implement these systems remains a  		concern for these healthcare providers. </p>
<p>These concerns also are shared by HIE networks. From a 2005 survey of  		RHIO participants by Healthcare Informatics in collaboration with AHIMA and the  		Association of Medical Directors of Information Systems (AMDIS), 46% reported  		that funding is the largest challenge facing their organization and 33%  		reported that interoperability and standards development is the main challenge  		(Healthcare Informatics in collaboration with AHIMA and AMDIS, 2005).  		Recipients of AHRQ RHIO grants have been asked to develop business plans that  		will enable these organizations to be viable when their grant funding ceases.  		These grantees have identified potential alternative funding sources such as  		payments from hospitals, public health, laboratories, payors, and purchasers  		(see <a href="#sectionD.1">Section D.1</a> for more information on RHIOs). </p>
<p>While the AHIMA and AMDIS surveys discussed above were undertaken and  		targeted toward specific audiences (e.g., hospitals, physicians, industry  		executives, and other stakeholders), these same groups also are the leaders and  		beneficiaries of advancements in the health exchange technology. In currently  		operating RHIOs, hospitals make up the largest participants (88%), with  		clinics/group practices following at 74%, and LTC and PAC facility membership  		trailing at 20% (Healthcare Informatics in collaboration with AHIMA and AMDIS,  		2005). As such, even though PAC/LTC are included in RHIO formations, the unique  		and specific needs and associated problems of PAC/LTC HIE go beyond the scope  		of these surveys. In fact, corresponding numbers for PAC/LTC settings are not  		available in the literature.</p>
<p>In one of the few studies that looked at EHR adoption in PAC/LTC,  		Kaushal and colleagues convened an expert panel in August 2005. Based on the  		experts opinions, this study: (i) characterized several HIT functions  		that would be needed in an interoperable nationwide health information  		infrastructure, and (ii) estimated current and projected HIT adoption rates for  		several healthcare provider types. The types of HIT functionalities that they  		considered that are relevant to this paper were billing/claims; eligibility  		processing; results reporting; EHRs (e.g., demographics, problem list,  		medication list, allergies, advance directives); and computerized physician  		order entry (Kaushal et al., 2005b; Kaushal et al., 2005a; Poon et al., 2006).  		</p>
<p>Using information gathered from healthcare providers in two market  		areas, the experts attempted to estimate current and future HIT adoption rates  		for physicians, hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, laboratories and pharmacies.  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> below presents these estimates for hospitals,  		physicians, SNFs, and HHAs. </p>

</tr></table><p>While the Kaushal et al. findings are based on expert opinion rather  		than empirical research, other research (discussed below) also has reported  		findings that support differences in HIT adoption rates between hospital and  		physician practices and PAC/LTC settings. Until HIT/EHR adoption in PAC/LTC  		provider settings is increased, the promises of an interoperable nationwide  		health information infrastructure will not be realized. </p>
<p>A common explanation for low adoption rates is that PAC/LTC settings  		have inherently greater resource limitations as compared to inpatient and  		ambulatory settings because of their unique patient population, providers,  		payors, and business case. With many competing financial priorities necessary  		(e.g., staffing, maintenance), nursing homes and HHAs do not generally have the  		operating margins to develop or purchase EHR systems (American Medical  		Directors Association [AMDA], 2005; Gloth III, Coleman, Phillips &amp;  		Zorowitz, 2005). However, as the United States population ages, more focus on  		these care settings will be imperative. An overwhelming majority of SNF care  		(82%) is provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare also is the  		largest single purchaser of home care services in the United States with 41  		million beneficiaries (CMS, 2003; CMS, 2004; Pettey, 2004). Other research has  		indicated that implementation of EHR systems would in theory reduce errors and  		duplicative procedures, and reduce approximately 30% of the annual Medicare  		spending (Fisher et al., 2003).</p>
<p>Many PAC/LTC settings have chosen not to implement an EHR system because  		a strong business case is lacking. Stakeholders mentioned that compared to  		acute and ambulatory settings, they receive a lower volume of patients, they  		have higher rates of staff turnover, and the implementation and ongoing costs  		for EHR maintenance are very expensive as is the corresponding staff training.  		Most importantly, the implementation of an EHR system could disrupt the  		existing workflow that has adapted to the use of paper as the means for  		exchanging data. As one stakeholder stated, "if it isn't broke, don't fix it."  		</p>
<p>However, in spite of these reasons why adopting technology to facilitate  		the exchange of health information is slow and challenging, it is notable that  		in the course of conducting the stakeholder interviews, several health settings  		and other related organizations stood out as having innovative strategies to  		facilitate information exchange. The following findings from the stakeholder  		interviews describe what steps some HDSs and other healthcare organizations are  		making to address the issue of HIE. When applicable, representatives of  		interviewed sites were given the opportunity to review and correct the  		information provided below. </p>
<p><b><i><a name="sectionD.1" id="sectionD.1">1. Regional Health Information  		Organizations</a></i></b></p>
<p>The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)  		defines a RHIO as a group of organizations with a business stake in improving  		the quality, safety, and efficiency of (health) care delivery (Healthcare  		Informatics in collaboration with AHIMA and AMDIS, 2005). Because of the  		multiple issues (e.g., business, legal, legislative, technological, clinical,  		and cultural) involved in creating a cross-organizational interoperable health  		information network, the RHIO approach has become an attractive option at both  		the state and federal levels. Federal programs have emphasized and increased  		the amount of funding for grants and demonstrations for the planning and  		implementation of RHIOs. The ONCHIT indicates that the Federal Government has  		funded over 100 regional projects (<a href="http://www.os.dhhs.gov/healthhit/rhio.html">http://www.os.dhhs.gov/healthhit/rhio.html</a>,  		2005). Over 40 states are in some phase of RHIO planning or implementation or  		have projects that are focused on a RHIO perspective (HIMSS and the Center for  		Health Information &amp; Decision Systems, 2006). Surveys have indicated that  		although grants are normally used for start-up and planning phases, alternative  		funding sources for RHIO start-up and continuation is necessary (Healthcare  		Informatics in collaboration with AHIMA and AMDIS, 2005). As there are no best  		practice methods for RHIO start-up, communities have produced their own design,  		specific to their own needs, with funding and planned funding coming from a  		variety of sources, including hospitals, employers, physician groups,  		non-profit groups, insurers, local government, user fees, financial incentives,  		and public (e.g., AHRQ) and private investors. Stakeholder and business  		organizations have joined together to increase further acceptance on a federal  		and regional level, and the following programs were implemented in the past  		year to facilitate adoption of the regional organization approach:</p>
<ul><li>The HIMSS RHIO Federation was established in late 2005 for the  		  purpose of collaboration and knowledge exchange among existing RHIOs and  		  developing organizations.</li>
<li>The HIT Dashboard, online in 2006, is a joint effort between HIMSS  		  and the Center for Health Information and Decision Systems (CHIDS) at the  		  Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, that has collected,  		  mapped, and updated project information on over 500 state, federal, and private  		  HIT initiatives, including RHIOs (HIMSS and the CHIDS, 2006).</li>
<li>eHealth Initiative released a Connecting Communities Toolkit in 2005  		  to help aid in the development, planning, and implementation stages for  		  regional organizations. The toolkit was implemented as an ever-evolving  		  information portal, with up-to-date information available on policies,  		  governance, financing, technology, and resources. This toolkit was funded thru  		  a Cooperative Agreement of the Health Resources Services Administration Office  		  of the Advancement of Telehealth. </li>
</ul><p><b><i>2. Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs)</i></b></p>
<p>In March 2006, the American Health Quality Foundation (AHQF) released  		Quality Improvement Organizations and Health Information Exchange,  		a report discussing the current and future role of QIOs in the development of  		HIE. This report consists of: (1) input from an Advisory Panel that included  		QIO representatives, federal agencies, stakeholder groups, and industry  		experts; and (2) results from a national 2005 survey of QIOs. Findings from the  		report indicated that 42 of 53 QIOs were "substantially engaged in local HIE  		efforts, many in leadership roles." The report further broke down the types of  		involvement that QIOs are playing, ranging from liaising with physicians on  		issues related to HIE, to developing business plans for entire HIE networks.  		Results from the survey indicate that because QIOs are community-based and  		their primary goal is to improve healthcare quality, they are in an excellent  		position to further support HIE efforts (AHQF, 2006). HIE support also is  		evident through QIO work within the recently finalized CMS contracted 8th SOW,  		which includes a policy focus on physician and hospital adoption of HIE systems  		(e.g., EHRs, e-prescribing). Once again, however, there is little reference to  		HIT and PAC/LTC settings in this report.</p>
<p><b><i>3. AHIMA LTC Summit Report and Recommendations</i></b></p>
<p>The AHIMA is composed of over 50,000 members interested in facilitating  		and promoting the sharing of health information. In August 2005, AHIMA  		organized a "Summit on Health Information Technology and its Implications for  		Long-Term Care." More than 125 stakeholders from 14 organizations attended and  		participated in the summit. The result of their efforts is a list of 11 action  		steps to promote EHRs and other technology in LTC settings that should be taken  		over the next two years (AHIMA, 2005). Although all 11 recommendations are  		critical, three action steps are particularly pertinent to this project. </p>
<p>One salient recommendation is to "advocate for and adopt data content  		and messaging standards that support a unified language and promote  		interoperability across care settings." This recommendation highlights the need  		for interoperable data content and messaging standards for health and social  		status, cognitive ability, and functioning domains. The recommendation states  		that standardized assessments/data sets (for example, MDS and Outcome and  		Assessment Information Set [OASIS]) must incorporate HIT content and messaging  		standards. Any new data collection tools developed and mandated must also  		incorporate HIT content and messaging standards. Identifying the need for  		vocabulary and messaging standards for required patient assessments and  		functional status is a critical for encouraging the use of HIT in PAC/LTC  		settings. As noted earlier in this report, NCVHS endorsed in September 2006 the  		CHI content and exchange standards needed for functioning and disability  		content and patient/client assessments.</p>
<p>The second noteworthy recommendation is to "promote the design,  		development, and implementation of a standardized patient transfer/summary of  		care document to enhance the coordination of care across settings and reduce  		risk to the patient." Participants at the LTC Summit indicated that the value  		of a standardized transfer document in the provision of care cannot be  		understated. Patients are particularly vulnerable to errors at times of care  		transitions because of the various mechanisms that are currently used to  		transfer information. The HL7 CCD Implementation Guide balloted in December  		2006, holds promise for the development of a standardized summary document.  		However, the likely HITSP endorsement of a subset of the CCD content will not  		include clinical content critically important for patients treated by PAC and  		LTC providers (e.g., advance directives, functional status, etc.). The impact  		of such a limited endorsement (e.g., on the specification of CCHIT criteria) is  		unknown. A more comprehensive discussion of the relevant content necessary in a  		transfer document is presented in <a href="#sectionIV.B.2">Section IV.B.2</a>  		of this report. </p>
<p>The third recommendation that is particularly important for successfully  		advancing and implementing several of the recommendations that emerged from the  		LTC HIT Summit is [f]or the LTC community to engage in the national  		agenda, benefit from interoperability, and participate in HIEs, they must fully  		participate in standards activities" (AHIMA, 2005). Participation by members of  		the LTC community in the various SDOs that specify standards for EHRs and other  		HIT applications is essential if LTC providers wish to influence how  		interoperable HIT standards are developed. As noted through out this report,  		many standard setting activities do not include a focus on the content and  		messaging standards needed when treating chronically ill disabled and elderly  		persons who will receive a variety of services across numerous settings and  		providers. Establishing collaborations across stakeholders (i.e., various LTC  		provider types, vendors, physicians, nurses) could create opportunities for the  		perspectives of the LTC community to be considered when identifying and  		developing standards needed for interoperable HIT and EHR systems. </p>
<p><b><i>4. Indiana Health Information Exchange</i></b></p>
<p>The University of Indiana and the Regenstrief Institute have long been  		in the front in terms of adopting HIT to support clinicians and provide them  		with the information necessary to do their jobs. Building upon previous work  		led by Drs. Clem McDonald and Marc Overhage, the Indiana Health Information  		Exchange (IHIE) was established as a non-profit venture joined by a number of  		HDSs in Indiana. The is comprised of over 48 hospitals and has approximately  		3,000 physicians who access the network (Stakeholder call with Marc Overhage on  		February 22, 2006). With AHRQ funding and a variety of other sponsors including  		BioCrossroads, regional and local hospitals, and the Regenstrief Institute, the  		recently implemented a community-wide clinical messaging project. Each  		participating partner has access to patients' clinical results using a single  		-controlled electronic mailbox (eHealth Initiative, 2006). </p>
<p><b><i>5. Utah Health Information Network</i></b></p>
<p>The Utah Health Information Network (UHIN) is a community health  		information network that began in 1993 (Stakeholder call with Jan Root on March  		17, 2006). It is a coalition of healthcare providers, payors, and state  		government with the common goal of reducing costs by standardizing  		administrative data, particularly payment data. The network community sets the  		data standards that providers and payors voluntarily agree to adhere  		(Stakeholder call with Jan Root on March 17, 2006). The UHIN standards are then  		incorporated into the Utah state rule via the Insurance Commissioners  		Office.</p>
<p>UHIN operates as a centralized secure network through which the majority  		of healthcare transactions pass in the state. Nearly all payors and hospital  		providers are participating in this project. PAC and LTC providers recently  		began submitting Medicaid claims data through the UHIN, as it became mandatory  		in the state in the summer of 2006. </p>
<p>The UHIN developed a tool, which they provide free of charge to  		providers for use in electronically submitting claims. The tool is provided so  		that even the smallest provider can submit claims and electronically receive  		remittance advices. This has drastically reduced the amount of paper processing  		required for payors and has streamlined the payment of claims and remits, which  		has resulted in providers receiving payment more quickly. Under an AHRQ grant,  		they will use what they have learned standardizing the administrative data and  		pilot test the exchange of a limited set of clinical data (medication history,  		discharge summaries, history and physical, and laboratory results) with a small  		number of hospital providers, including an Intermountain Healthcare hospital,  		and one or two physician offices. This pilot began in August 2006.</p>
<p><b><i>6. Montefiore Medical Center</i></b></p>
<p>Montefiore Medical Center (Montefiore) is an integrated delivery system  		in Bronx, New York, providing a full range of services, including specialty  		care to both local and outside populations. It serves a medically underserved  		population, a large number of whom are young, minority, and poor (Burke, 2006).  		Montefiore owns a large HHA and contracts with a number of SNFs in the area.  		They are using information technology to support the use of clinical pathways  		and retrospective assessments of practice and outcomes to improve quality of  		care. Montefiore is one of several acute care hospitals involved in the  		formation of the non-profit entity called the Bronx RHIO. The other  		collaborators include other acute care hospitals, over 40 community-based  		primary care centers, two nursing homes, two HHAs, payors, physician offices,  		and laboratories. They recently received a grant from the New York Department  		of Health's initiative called HEAL-NY to start-up a data exchange RHIO in the  		Bronx. The focus of the Bronx RHIO is to facilitate the sharing of clinical  		data among providers with disparate systems and levels of sophistication in  		using EHR systems. </p>
<p><b><i>7. New York Presbyterian Hospital</i></b></p>
<p>New York Presbyterian Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in the  		country and is the university hospital for the Cornell and Columbia Schools of  		Medicine. AHRQ funded the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical  		Center as an Integrated Delivery System Research Network (IDSRN) partner, one  		of nine IDSRN grant recipients. In collaboration with the Visiting Nursing  		Service of New York (VNSNY), New York Presbyterian developed an electronic home  		health plan of care, known as the e-485. CMS requires that a plan of care be  		developed and signed by a physician and be followed by the HHA staff. This plan  		of care needs to be updated every recertification period (currently 60 days).  		Historically, the 485 form was the plan of care, and although the form itself  		is no longer required by CMS, the development and updating of the plan of care  		is still mandated. Furthermore, although the form is not required by CMS, the  		information on the form is required for billing purposes, so most HHAs have  		elected to continue to use the form.</p>
<p>At present, New York Presbyterian is able to generate this form using  		data from their EHR system, print it out, and fax it to the VNSNY. The benefits  		of the electronic 485 are that it: (1) is legible; (2) provides a more complete  		order set; (3) facilitates the co-management of patient care between the  		physician and the HHA staff; (4) incorporates evidence-based order sets and  		prompts; and (5) involves the physician in developing the home health plan of  		care. The electronic 485 now is being used for multiple HHAs that receive  		referrals from New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. In November and December  		2006, they pilot tested the electronic transmission of the care plan to a few  		HHA teams within the VNSNY via a web-based portal. The electronic transmission  		will allow for more interaction between the referring providers and the HHA,  		and will create a data-rich environment that allows for more active  		co-management of patients between physicians and HHA teams. This pilot was  		funded by a new AHRQ task order under the IDSRN contracting mechanism  		(Stakeholder call with Dr. Mark Callahan, February 16, 2006, and timeframe  		clarified by personal communication with Dr. Robert Rosati on January 4,  		2007).</p>
<p><b><i><a name="sectionIII.D.8" id="sectionIII.D.8">8. Erickson Retirement  		Communities</a></i></b></p>
<p>Erickson Retirement Communities, Catonsville, Maryland owns and operates  		13 Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) in the United States. Four of  		their communities are considered "mature campuses" and include a medical  		center, a certified HHA, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services, a  		SNF, and an assisted living facility (ALF) (Stakeholder interview, Daniel Wilt,  		March 23, 2006). Erickson does have some specialists on campus that are  		employed by Erickson and some that are not (e.g., podiatry and dentistry). </p>
<p>Erickson does not own or operate most specialty clinics and does not own  		or operate any acute care centers. Erickson has developed an electronic chart  		summary, which is generated out of their electronic medical record and can be  		accessed via the web or at any of their facilities' workstations.  The  		chart summary includes relevant current and historical information such as  		advanced directives, medication lists, laboratory results, problem lists,  		contact information for patient and caregivers, etc. This chart enables  		electronic HIE between the physician and other Erickson providers who work in  		other health settings such as the HHA on the Erickson campus. Care coordination  		is facilitated as physicians can access this information on or off-campus and  		can then coordinate in a timely manner with the emergency department physician  		if a patient requires acute care. In November 2005, Erickson launched a  		website, <a href="https://myhealth.erickson.com">https://myhealth.erickson.com</a>, which is provided to their residents  		free of charge. Patients can have read-only access to their own medical record  		including the chart summary discussed above. Patients can download it to a USB  		(that Erickson provides free of charge) and take it with them (should they  		travel or be away for extended periods of time).  Alternatively, patients  		can access this information via the web.</p>

<p><font><i>Upon arriving on the inpatient orthopedic  				floor, she undergoes a comprehensive nursing intake evaluation by a floor nurse  				and is seen by both the orthopedist and a hospital physician (hospitalist) who  				each undertake a different medical assessment in preparation for surgery. The  				patient also has contact with the anesthesiology service, and different nursing  				staff in the operating room and in the recovery center before returning to the  				orthopedic ward. The next day, she has contact with a physical therapist and  				occupational therapist, and a new floor nurse. Next she interacts with a  				discharge planner who arranges transfer to a SNF for her to continue with her  				rehabilitation. In transit, she has contact with two ambulance drivers.  				</i></font></p>
<p><font><i>Upon arrival at the SNF, she again  				undergoes an intake assessment by a nurse and an evaluation by either a  				physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant. The SNF staff also  				will complete the required MDS assessment. In addition to meeting new SNF  				nurses, an SNF physical therapist, and an occupational therapist, the patient  				meets a new discharge planner who arranges for her to return to her apartment  				with skilled home care services. </i></font></p>
<p><font><i>Upon returning home, she undergoes a  				comprehensive assessment by a home care nurse that includes the required  				Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). She also is seen by a home care  				physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and may receive visits from a  				home health aide. Once home, she returns to her primary care physician and  				nursing team to provide ongoing continuity and coordination of her medical  				care.</i></font></p>
<p><font><i>At each of these transition points the  				patient is asked many of the same (or similar) demographic, insurance, and  				health-related questions. </i></font></p>
</div>
<p>This case illustrates the many transitions that occur for a fairly  		circumscribed and straightforward episode of care. For all of these  		transitions, a successful "hand-off" of health information between  		professionals in each setting is critical to achieving an optimal outcome. In  		many respects, this case has been oversimplified. For example, the patient did  		not develop any complications such as an infection or blood clot that would  		require transfer back to the hospital. The patient could have had dementia and  		therefore would have been unlikely to be able to provide accurate information  		regarding her medical history or her insurance. It also does not address the  		multiple medications that are likely to have been prescribed to this patient or  		the multiple medication changes that are likely to have occurred as the patient  		transitions from one setting of care to the next. </p>
<p>This scenario exemplifies why improved HIE is a critical step toward  		reducing medical errors, improving quality, and increasing efficiencies for  		patients who receive care across settings. HIT offers great potential to foster  		improved communication across these settings. However, to be effective, the  		technology needs to support and be integrated into workflow processes and be  		acceptable to practicing clinicians and patients.</p>
<p>The 2005 White House Conference on Aging recommended that the unique  		needs of older adults be identified and included in the development of a  		blueprint for a national health information system (White House Conference on  		Aging, 2005). Implementation of interoperable HIT would permit that, as  		Americans age, essential longitudinal health information be available to all  		healthcare providers across care settings. Interoperable HIE is particularly  		important to older adults with chronic illness in general and frail older  		adults in particular. As the case of the woman who suffers a hip fracture  		illustrates, this population often receives care in multiple, disparate  		settings. In addition, family caregivers play a significant role in executing  		the care plans and ensuring quality and safety before, during, and after care  		hand-offs. HIT could support the capture of patient and caregiver preferences  		and patient entered data. The AHIC has established a workgroup on Consumer  		Empowerment which has as its broad charge the need to promote wide spread  		adoption of a personal health record that is easy-to-use, portable,  		longitudinal, affordable, and consumer-centered (HHS, 2006c).  		Consumers use of PHRs is one strategy that would enable the exchange of  		longitudinal health information as patients transition from one healthcare  		provider to another. In addition, HIE between patients/caregivers and  		clinicians is another focus of another of the AHIC use cases (HHS, 2006b),  		confirming the importance of this information being included in an EHR.</p>
<p>However, as previously described, research has found HIT adoption rates  		are relatively low across healthcare settings. To date, most of the  		technological developments largely have occurred in hospitals and to a lesser  		extent in ambulatory settings. PAC and LTC settings face many of the same  		challenges as confronted by hospital and physician offices when considering HIT  		investments including: (i) concerns about how the market will change and  		whether the HIT/EHR products acquired today will continue to be functional as  		the market evolves; (ii) lack of understanding about HIT standards and  		uncertainty about which standards should be included in EHR/HIT products; and  		(iii) lack of standardized EHR/HIT products from which PAC and LTC providers  		may select. These uncertainties are believed to have contributed the low rates  		of more functional EHR/HIT solutions by PAC and longer care providers. </p>
<p>The supply of more robust and standardized EHR/HIT solutions have not as  		available to PAC settings, including HHAs and SNFs, and other LTC settings such  		as nursing homes and ALFs, to the same degree as has been the case for  		hospitals and physician offices (Kramer et al., 2004). Among the many possible  		reasons for this discrepancy is that care is delivered differently in acute and  		PAC/LTC settings. First, care in PAC and LTC settings is delivered primarily by  		certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and nurses, but also a more prominent role  		is played by a wide array of other healthcare professionals including dietary,  		social work, physical and occupational therapy, and recreational therapy. Thus,  		an EHR system must accommodate the needs of these professionals and  		paraprofessionals for gathering, synthesizing, and communicating information to  		support successful implementation of the overall care plan. </p>
<p>Discussion of interoperable EHR systems must acknowledge other key  		differences between care settings. Acute, post-acute, and LTC settings often  		have different staffing ratios, different clinical information needs, different  		orientations and approaches to assessment and management, and face different  		regulatory and reimbursement requirements. These disparate requirements  		translate into different data needs. For example, in PAC and LTC settings,  		healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals place greater emphasis on  		improving functional and cognitive status as patients in these settings  		generally have limitations in physical and/or cognitive functioning,  		assessments of these clinical domains are required by regulation, and payment  		for services in these settings is determined, in part, based on each  		patients physical and cognitive status. </p>
<p>PAC and LTC settings also face some unique challenges with respect to  		HIT implementation. As observed, in nursing homes, for example, CNAs deliver a  		large proportion of care. CNAs are characterized by a high degree of turnover,  		may speak English as a second language, and may have limited health and/or  		computer literacy (Hernandez-Medina, Eaton, Hurd &amp; White, 2006; Stone &amp;  		Wiener, 2001). Nonetheless, the information CNAs collect is very important to  		care planning and reflects many of the services delivered in nursing homes.  		Further, from a financial perspective, the typical operating margins in nursing  		homes are much lower than in hospitals and therefore may not support investment  		and maintenance of EHR systems (AHIMA, 2005; AMDA, 2005). Thus, while HIT could  		support data collection and exchange in PAC/LTC settings, the staff  		characteristics and turnover rates, and limited operating margins for  		facilities also may limit the ability to invest in HIT and support ongoing  		training costs. </p>
<h3>B. Overview of Clinical Information Exchanged at Times  		of Transition</h3>
<p>While HIT can support the collection and exchange of information  		collected by nurses, CNAs, and other staff in PAC/LTC settings (e.g.,  		therapists, physicians), the level of detail typically captured at the point of  		care may not be the type of information needed at times of transitions (e.g.,  		discharge or transfer from PAC/LTC settings to hospitals). As previously  		mentioned, members of the LTC community identified priority action steps needed  		to advance the use of HIT in LTC settings in the Roadmap for Health IT in  		Long-Term Care (AHIMA, 2005). One of the identified action steps was the  		need to design, develop, and implement a standardized patient transfer/summary  		of care document to enhance the coordination of care across settings and reduce  		risk to the patient. The Roadmap suggested starting with developing a  		standardized patient transfer/summary of care record or document, and  		integrating data format, content, definitions, and messaging to enable  		interoperable exchange of this information. </p>
<p>Based on a review of published literature, summaries of large national  		conferences, and documents produced by professional societies, at present there  		is no consensus on the specific content and type of information exchange needed  		between acute, post-acute, and LTC settings. Despite this lack of consensus,  		when data elements are proposed, most authors and organizations arrive at a  		very similar list of data elements that will be described herein. What is clear  		is that standardized core content needs to directly inform care delivery during  		the immediate time period at or around the time of transfer to facilitate the  		immediate provision of care by the receiving team (Coleman, Foley &amp;  		Phillips, 2003; Coleman, 2003; Terrell et al., 2005). Too much information can  		be distracting to clinicians. Moreover, including a large number of data  		elements could create serious inefficiencies given that at each transfer point,  		these data may need to be reviewed and updated. Eventually, the process could  		buckle under its own weight. </p>
<p>Identifying and standardizing the needed core content of a transfer  		summary creates opportunities to support safe and efficient care transitions  		between settings, and could facilitate better decision making when it comes to  		matching patient care needs with the care setting. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Medium Used to Transmit Information</b></i></p>
<p>Each of the various mediums offers certain advantages and disadvantages.  		The sources consulted in preparing this report uniformly confirmed that sending  		paper documents with the patient and facsimile transmissions remain the two  		most frequently used communication approaches to support HIE to and from  		PAC/LTC settings. The information is predominantly handwritten, supplemented by  		photocopies of pertinent information such as the medication administration  		record, recent laboratory results and diagnostic imaging results, or recent  		assessments. Fax machine usage is nearly ubiquitous in most healthcare  		settings, which is a distinct advantage. However, it is possible for faxed  		pages to become misplaced or for the fax machine to fail and legibility of  		information continues to be an issue. While continued reliance on paper or fax  		transmission does not require the initial and ongoing costs associated with HIT  		implementation, continued reliance on paper and/or fax to exchange information  		at times of transition does not address the identified problems related to  		incomplete and/or untimely HIE. In addition, transmission of information in  		paper or fax form limits efficient reuse of information as patients transfer  		across settings. Because limited EHR adoption rates and limits on the ability  		of many existing HIT solutions to exchange and reuse content, healthcare  		systems that possess this technology often have to continue to utilize another  		medium to exchange information at the time of transfer. This may include  		printing a computer-generated summary to send with the patient or fax it to the  		next care setting. </p>
<p>Not all information exchange necessarily has to occur from provider to  		provider. There are distinct advantages to patients managing their own  		information during transfers (Coleman, 2003; Coleman, Parry, Chalmers &amp;  		Min, 2006). There is a growing interest in exploring the feasibility of  		providing patients with up-to-date health information in an electronic format  		that they could convey from one provider to the next. Conceptually, the patient  		and caregiver would continue to function as a conduit through which clinicians  		in different settings would communicate key information, except now HIE would  		occur electronically. This could be accomplished using simple technology such  		as a Microsoft Word or Excel document contained in a binder, a CD-Rom, or a  		jump drive. A more advanced approach is to store the information in a shared  		care plan on a password-protected website. PeaceHealth, an integrated delivery  		system located in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington received an AHRQ grant to  		implement such an approach and the resultant PHR website can be viewed at  		<a href="https://www.sharedcareplan.org/Default.asp?Javascript=Yes">https://www.sharedcareplan.org/Default.asp?Javascript=Yes</a>. Erickson Retirement  		Communities, discussed in <a href="#sectionIII.D.8">Section III.D.8</a>, also  		provides their patients with access to a web-based summary document of their  		medical chart. </p>
<p><i><b><a name="sectionIV.B.2" id="sectionIV.B.2">2. Content of Information</a></b></i></p>
<p>The transfer of timely and accurate information across settings is  		critical to the execution of effective care transitions. Practitioners need an  		understanding of the patient's goals, baseline functional status, active  		medical and behavioral health problems, medication regimen, family or support  		resources, durable medical equipment needs, and ability for self-care (HMO  		Workgroup on Care Management, 2004; Coleman, 2003; Coleman, 2002). Without this  		information, service duplications may occur, important aspects of the care plan  		may be overlooked, and conflicting information to the patient may be conveyed.  		Incomplete information transfer can result in critical errors, such as the  		patient returning home without life-sustaining equipment (e.g., supplemental  		oxygen or equipment used to suction respiratory secretions). The absence of  		information about an older patient's baseline level of cognitive function may  		result in an acute decline in cognitive status being mistaken for chronic  		dementia. Furthermore, a lack of understanding of a patient's functional health  		status, including both physical and cognitive, may result in transfer to a care  		venue that does not meet his or her needs. </p>
<p>As stated earlier, there is no consensus as to what comprises the core  		clinical information that practitioners require as patients transition from  		setting to setting. However, there are several efforts underway that will  		attempt to describe the content that is needed as patients transition across  		healthcare settings. With support from the John A. Hartford Foundation, the  		Society for Hospital Medicine (SHM) has undertaken a consensus effort to create  		a model for Idealized Hospital Discharge Planning. This effort emphasizes the  		importance of creating a discharge summary that is explicitly focused on the  		receiving healthcare team rather than a historical document that is created to  		satisfy the requirements of the medical records department (Halasyamani et al.,  		2007). Within its Transforming Care at the Bedside initiative, the Institute  		for Healthcare Improvement has launched a transition out of the hospital  		initiative that includes an emphasis on information transfer to the next care  		setting (Institute for Health Care Improvement, 2006b).</p>
<p>In addition, a review of different national efforts that have attempted  		to define important clinical content needed at times of transition is  		potentially instructive for describing the types of information needed to be  		exchanged. Included among these efforts is the HL7/ASTM CCD work. The CCD not  		only describes the type of information needed for clinical summary documents  		(using the domains identified by the CCR), but also specifies in an  		implementation guide, being balloted by HL7, the structure and semantics  		of clinical documents for the purpose of [electronic] exchange (Health  		Level Seven and ASTM, 2006). The CCD and three other efforts that specify the  		types of information needed at times of transition are highlighted herein: </p>
<ul><li><a href="#table2">Table 2</a>: Continuity Care Document (CCD) (Health  		  Level Seven, Inc. and ASTM, 2006);</li>
<li><a href="#table3">Table 3</a>: Uniform Patient Assessment for  		  Post-Acute Care tool proposed by the University of Colorado at Denver Health  		  Sciences Center to CMS (CMS, 2006c);</li>
<li><a href="#table4">Table 4</a>: The HMO Care Management Workgroup  		  (which is comprised of medical and nursing operations leaders from many of the  		  nation's exemplar Medicare Advantage programs (HMO Workgroup on Care  		  Management, 2004); and</li>
<li><a href="#table5">Table 5</a>: The Veterans Affairs Geriatrics and  		  Extended Care (GEC) Referral Discharge Planning Tool (Department of Veterans  		  Affairs, 2006). </li>
</ul><p>The type of clinical information specified in each of these efforts is  		presented in Tables 2-5. Generally, the intent of these efforts is to help the  		receiving care team quickly develop an understanding of an individual patient  		from the standpoint of functional status (pre-morbid as well as present  		status), the immediate care needs that require attention, an accurate and  		up-to-date medication list, self-care ability and family support, and insurance  		coverage. Although there are some differences between these four efforts, what  		is most instructive is the observed high degree of overlap among the identified  		domains. The overlapping domains of clinical information may be instructive to  		the LTC Community, SDOs, and others as they consider the type of clinical  		content that needs to be exchanged and continue to advance the standards needed  		for the exchange of patient transfer/summary documents.</p>

</tr></table><p>The CCHIT Certification <b>Functional</b> Criteria for Ambulatory EHR  		Products includes requirements related to an EHR systems capacity to  		produce reports, including a requirement to produce hard or electronic copies  		of summary information (such as hospital discharge summaries (CCHIT, 2006c).  		The CCHIT final <b>interoperability</b> criteria for Ambulatory EHR products  		recognizes the need to exchange clinical documentation to "refer or transfer  		clinical care of patient" and indicates that the work HL7/ASTM CCD is  		conducting may address this need. The CCHIT placed consideration of this  		standard on its Roadmap for May 2007 (CCHIT, 2006d).</p>
<p>The 2007 CCHIT roadmap for interoperability criteria for Ambulatory EHR  		Products identifies several criteria for which the HL7/ASTM CCD will be  		considered, including the ability to send a medical summary when referring or  		transferring the clinical care of patients, the receipt of medical summaries  		and importing them into the EHR for consultations or for transfer, the ability  		to send summary data to PHRs, and the receipt of data from PHRs for import into  		EHRs (respectively, item numbers IA-5.7, IA-5.8, IA-5.9, and IA-5.10). CCHIT  		anticipates specifying EHR interoperability certification criteria for these  		functions in 2008 (CCHIT, 2006a). </p>
<p>The proposed CCHIT <b>Functional</b> Certification Criteria for  		Inpatient EHR Products includes criteria for managing, documenting, and  		tracking referrals between care providers or healthcare organizations (whether  		internal or external to the referring organization), and supporting the  		creation of health service reports at the end of an episode of care (including,  		but not limited to, discharge summaries), (respectively, criteria #IF-2.11.1  		and #IF-2.14.1) (CCHIT, 2006e). CCHIT anticipates specifying these (and other)  		functional requirements for inpatient EHRs in 2008. </p>
<p>The CCHIT roadmap for inpatient EHR criteria indicates the need to  		include interoperability criteria for exchanging clinical documents such as  		hospital discharge summaries. The criteria to be considered include sending and  		receiving medical summary documents to referral settings or transferring the  		clinical care of patient to other clinicians. The CCHIT will consider HL7 CDAr2  		and HL7/ASTM CCD as possible exchange standards  		(<a href="http://www.cchit.org/work/inpatient+criteria.htm">http://www.cchit.org/work/inpatient+criteria.htm</a>). </p>
<p>As noted above, in November 2006, CCHIT announced an expansion of its  		certification efforts to include additional medical specialties and healthcare  		settings. At this time, it is unknown which settings will be selected. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Preference by Provider and Practitioner Type</b></i></p>
<p>There is not an extensive literature that documents providers' and  		practitioners' preferred methods of cross-setting communication. What is known  		suggests moderate variation. For example, more recent graduation from training  		is associated with higher levels of comfort with using EHR systems to exchange  		health information (Healthcare Financial Management Association, 2006). In some  		practice settings, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants  		are given privileges to remotely access clinical information from EHRs based in  		hospital or ambulatory settings. Under these circumstances, clinicians can care  		for patients in remote locations (e.g., nursing homes, in patients homes)  		by using HIT to access and exchange health information at these locations.  		However, it should be noted that case studies and stakeholder informants  		indicate PAC and LTC health professionals (e.g., nurses, CNAs, physical and  		occupational therapists) are not usually granted this same access (Kramer et  		al., 2004).</p>
<p>Electronic communication offers greater efficiency and less need to  		re-create information. However, it also has the potential to propagate  		inaccurate information more widely (i.e., garbage in, garbage out), making it  		particularly important that the information is verified and updated in a timely  		manner as needed. In the current environment where most healthcare providers  		are not HIT-enabled, there are advantages to paper communication. For example,  		if an ambulance that is in transport between a nursing home and a particular  		hospital is diverted to a different hospital, the paper information may be the  		only information available to health professionals in the receiving hospital.  		</p>
<p>Despite the opportunity to access health information electronically,  		some physicians prefer to continue to receive discharge/transfer information  		via fax. In a survey of rural physicians completed by the University of  		Nebraska, the majority of physicians explained that the daily workflow in their  		offices already was established for receiving information via fax and that to  		use the hospital's EHR system would disrupt this flow and create additional  		work for office staff (Xu, 2004). </p>
<p><i><b>4. Volume, Frequency, and Timing of Clinical Information  		Exchange</b></i></p>
<p>There is a growing literature exploring information transfer at the time  		of hospital discharge. Studies by van Walraven and colleagues have documented  		not only failures in information transfer, they also have documented that the  		transferred information frequently is incomplete and even inaccurate (van  		Walraven et al., 2002a; van Walraven et al., 2002b). Leaders from the AMDA have  		shown that SNFs do not receive legible transfer information from the hospital  		approximately 28% of the time (Coleman et al., 2003). </p>
<p>A nursing home in Galveston, Texas gathered input from its local  		emergency department as to what information was pertinent and what information  		was irrelevant to send with the patient. Through its consensus process, the  		essential data elements were identified. These included medical history,  		current medications, chief complaint, change from baseline, resuscitation  		status, family member name and contact information, and a contact number if  		more information. A form was designed to ensure that this information could fit  		on a single page. By achieving "buy-in," the facilities were able to agree on a  		standard transfer document (Davis, Brumfield, Smith, Tyler &amp; Nitschman,  		2005).</p>
<p>Timely information transfer can financially benefit both the hospital  		and the PAC/LTC setting. Under the Diagnostic Related Group payment system, the  		hospital has the financial incentive to transfer the patient as soon as s/he is  		stable. Under the nursing home Resource Utilization Groups III (RUGs III)  		reimbursement system, the nursing facility receives a daily payment rate that  		is based, in part, on the patients medical problems and co-morbid  		conditions. To determine whether a facility can meet a patient's care needs  		under the prevailing daily rate, timely communication of a patient's PAC needs  		from the hospital can facilitate a more timely and appropriate transfer.  		Ensuring that the SNF has comprehensive information on a patients current  		needs and plan of care can facilitate appropriate classification under the RUGS  		III system. Thus, within this context, more timely information transfer may  		enable hospitals to more efficiently discharge patients into SNFs in which the  		appropriateness of a particular patients placement is prospectively  		determined.</p>
<p><i><b>5. Available Information</b></i></p>
<p>In general, practitioners have little time to gather, review, and  		incorporate clinical information into a new care plan in the new care setting.  		Thus, whether in paper or electronic form, the content needs to be found easily  		and flow in an intuitive way (e.g., medication information should be contiguous  		with medication allergy information). Providing too much information or  		requiring searching and clicking on too many data fields may ultimately be  		counterproductive.</p>
<p>The Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the SHM have advanced  		specific recommendations concerning the type of medication information that  		should be exchanged at times of transition. They have recommended that not only  		should medications be reconciled prior to transfer, but that every medication  		should be identified in one of the following categories: (1) new medication;  		(2) continued medication, new instructions; (3) continued medication, same  		instructions as before; and (4) discontinued medication. In addition, both  		generic and brand names of medications should be listed and every medication  		also should include its indication for use (Institute for Health Care  		Improvement, 2006a).</p>
<p>Unaffiliated providers have the opportunity to delineate the timing and  		types of information transferred during their contract negotiations (Coleman et  		al., 2004a; HMO Workgroup on Care Management, 2004). For example, a healthcare  		system can require that the SNFs and HHAs with which they contract contribute  		to or update the patient's problem list, allergies, medications, advance  		directives, and recent diagnostic tests while patients are under their care. In  		this instance, a payor can mandate that contract providers adopt protocols for  		HIE at the time of transfer as a condition to receive payment. </p>
<p><i><b>6. Regulatory and Organizational Requirements </b></i></p>
<p>Within Medicare's regulatory framework, the Conditions of Participation  		(CoPs) explicitly include requirements concerning information exchange at the  		time of transfer for hospitals, HHAs, clinics, rehabilitation agencies, and  		public health agencies (<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>). The Joint Commission  		and Accreditation of Healthcare Organization has deemed status from CMS to  		provide oversight for these CoPs (Hughes, 2003). Health information transfer  		for nursing homes is largely governed by state regulations not the CoPs.</p>
<p>Notably absent from each of the preceding requirements are any  		requirements clearly specifying the timing of the exchange of the required  		discharge/transfer documents.</p>
<p>The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires hospitals with  		emergency departments to provide a medical screening examination to any  		individual who comes to the emergency department and requests such an  		examination, and prohibits hospitals with emergency departments from refusing  		to examine or treat individuals with an emergency medical condition. If a  		decision is made to transfer the patient to another hospital, the sending  		hospital is required to send all pertinent records to the receiving  		hospital.</p>
<p>The HIPAA allows the exchange of patients' health information for  		purposes of treatment, payment, and healthcare operations without patient  		authorization. However, misinterpretations of HIPAA regulations are common  		(Coleman et al., 2003). Clinicians may be apprehensive to share information for  		fear of violating HIPAA laws and facing accompanying penalties. In addition,  		States may establish privacy protections that exceed those established by HIPAA  		and organizations may have established different business practices to comply  		with federal and/or state privacy requirements. Thus, the complexity and  		variation in privacy requirements have created challenges to HIE.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="future" id="future">V. IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS</a></h2>
<p>To summarize the prior sections of this report, the need for complete,  		legible, accurate and timely information at time of transitions is critical to  		ensuring patient safety and high quality patient care. Lack of access to a  		patient's most recent clinical information further contributes to rising  		healthcare costs as it often leads to duplicative testing or patient referrals  		to higher intensity care settings for unnecessary or redundant evaluations. Yet  		despite requirements outlined in the Medicare CoPs, HIE among acute, PAC, and  		LTC providers currently has been found to be lacking both in terms of the  		timing and content of the exchange. The purpose of this final section is to  		discuss the implications of the findings from the literature review,  		stakeholder calls, and what is understood about the current state of  		play with respect to HIE. This section will conclude with a look ahead to  		this projects planned site visits that will explore HIE in greater depth  		in four exemplar HDSs/organizations/regions across the country. </p>
<h3>A. Implications</h3>
<p>HIE is still predominantly conducted with paper documents that are  		transferred with patients and/or communicated via facsimile. To date,  		implementation of electronic health information systems has been more prevalent  		in hospitals and ambulatory care clinics compared with PAC and LTC settings  		(Kaushal et al., 2005a; Grossmank &amp; Reed, 2006). Further, the percentage of  		HIT/EHR products deployed in PAC and LTC settings that support HIE is suspected  		to be low. To date, in contrast to hospital and physician office settings, no  		EHR certification criteria (including EHR functional and interoperability  		criteria) have been specified for PAC and LTC settings. These differences have  		and will undoubtedly influence the extent to which electronic HIE can be  		accomplished across settings. In addition, while the HL7/ASTM Implementation  		Guide for the CCD holds considerable promise for an exchange standard for  		summary documents, this standard is only currently being balloted. The goal of  		widespread interoperability only can be met if the respective care settings  		implement HIT/EHR solutions and, if standards exist and are adopted across  		healthcare settings, for the standardized HIE of information needed at times of  		transfer/discharge/referral.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier in this report, PAC and LTC settings face unique  		challenges with respect to adopting emerging HIT, particularly among smaller  		providers. In general, these health settings operate with much lower profit  		margins, experience higher staff turnover, and receive referrals and  		information from a broad array of healthcare providers. If implementation of  		standardized HIT in PAC/LTC facilities continues to lag behind hospitals and  		ambulatory clinics, this will limit the ability to realize the promises of a  		nationwide interoperable health information infrastructure including limiting  		the realization of needed quality and safety improvements, and cost reductions.  		Stakeholders and industry experts have attempted to speak to this concern and  		are aware of the ramifications of lower rates of implementation by these  		providers (Kaushal et al., 2005a). </p>
<p>In addition to specifying standards for HIT/EHR applications used in PAC  		and LTC settings, closing the gap of HIT implementation will require that  		industry leaders articulate a compelling business case for PAC and LTC settings  		to adopt standardized, electronic HIT to support HIE. To date, however, there  		is a dearth of information on the costs and benefits of HIT implementation in  		the literature, including the costs and benefits that are incurred when  		HIT/EHRs are implemented in caring for patients in PAC and LTC settings. Yet  		relatively straightforward elements to support the business case are apparent.  		For example, one important leverage point might include the potential of  		electronic HIE to facilitate more efficient referrals that could potentially  		financially benefit both the sending and receiving providers. Just as small  		physician offices have questioned whether adoption of an EHR system will  		ultimately impact their practice, PAC and LTC providers are seeking information  		about the costs and benefits of HIT implementation, including how these  		products will address their business needs (e.g., facilitating the production  		and exchange of information at times of transition) and how to minimize their  		risks of making unsound HIT/EHR investment decisions. </p>
<p>Several public and private sector activities may provide much of the  		foundation for advancing standardized HIT/EHR implementations in PAC and LTC  		settings. The CHI/NCVHS-endorsed standards for patient assessments and  		functional and disability content establishes standards by which the content of  		federally-required patient assessments may be standardized and exchanged. ASPE  		is funding research examining the costs and benefits of HIT/EHR acquisition and  		use in PAC and LTC settings. Some of this work includes the development of a  		taxonomy of HIT applications that are used or could be used in PAC and LTC, as  		well as a plan to identify the cost and benefits metrics that could be used to  		evaluate HIT applications. This study requires case studies of PAC and LTC  		settings to begin gathering HIT cost/benefit information and the development of  		a quantitative data analysis plan to understand more completely the costs and  		benefits. </p>
<p>While research has found that most nursing homes and HHAs have  		implemented HIT solutions for administrative functions, members of the LTC  		provider community have conducted preliminary surveys and data collection  		efforts to explore the implementation of more robust HIT/EHR applications. In  		addition, involvement of the LTC community in standards development activities  		has contributed to the advancement of HIT standards needed in this sector. For  		example, the LTC community is working to specify a LTC EHR Profile using the  		HL7 EHR-System Functional Model. In addition, participation by LTC  		representatives in the development of the HL7/ASTM CCD implementation guide  		(presently being balloted) has contributed to the inclusion in that guide of  		the patient assessment standards recently endorsed by NCVHS-CHI. The LTC EHR  		Profile and successful balloting of the CCD implementation guide could be  		considered by the CCHIT as it evaluates which settings it will include in its  		expanded SOW to specify EHR certification criteria. Finally, the CAST and AHIMA  		efforts to demonstrate interoperable exchange of a summary document including  		wellness and functional status information using the HL7/ASTM CCD standard is  		important to demonstrate the exchange of this content to and heighten the  		awareness of the vendor, provider, and consumer communities of how this  		standard can be used for this type of exchange.</p>
<p>Implementation of e-prescribing by the Medicare Part D drug benefit may  		further help drive improvements in HIE. Implementation of this program required  		the identification of e-prescribing standards that have now been required for  		use by the Medicare program. Implementation of the Medicare e-prescribing  		program and the related pilots required under the MMA may stimulate PAC and LTC  		providers, attending physicians, and affiliated pharmacies to identify how to  		implement standardized e-prescribing in SNFs/nursing homes. As the LTC  		community and SDOs (such as the NCPDP LTC workgroup) work to identify  		e-prescribing standards that are particularly pertinent to LTC providers, it  		will be especially important to explore how nursing home contract pharmacies  		can support electronic medication orders on behalf of institutionalized  		patients not just during static times when patients are receiving care in the  		facility, but also during more dynamic times during transfers to higher or  		lower intensity care settings. This type of HIE is critical to comprehensive  		medication reconciliation, an essential function needed to avoid and  		potentially reduce medication errors. Standards are needed for HIT/EHR  		applications that are used in caring for PAC and LTC patients that include  		requirements for electronic medication reconciliation. </p>
<h3>B. Areas of Further Study</h3>
<p>The work of the public and private sector entities is still evolving.  		While several critical HIT infrastructure issues have been addressed to support  		the standardized exchange of health information at times of transition, many of  		these solutions have yet to be implemented and key gaps that remain.</p>
<p>Additional work is needed to identify and implement standards/criteria  		for more robust EHR/HIT applications needed for patients with PAC and LTC  		needs. For example, as described, medication reconciliation is an important  		function, particularly with respect to PAC and LTC patients. Nursing home  		patients receive on average 6-7 prescribed medications per day. As these  		patients are transferred to and from hospitals, medication changes are common  		due to clinical conditions, admission assessments, and hospital formulary  		requirements, etc. (Boockvar et al., 2004). Medication reconciliation is very  		time consuming, accountability for who performs reconciliation is unclear, and  		this task is rarely performed electronically. The AHRQ/CMS e-prescribing pilot  		being conducted in nursing homes will identify several standards needed for  		medication ordering in nursing homes. Medication reconciliation is a critical  		function that likely could be supported and enhanced with a standardized HIT  		solution. </p>
<p>Findings from the literature and stakeholder interviews suggest that the  		exact clinical content needed at the time of transition varies based on the  		status of the patient and the types of health settings involved in providing  		his/her care. In addition, although providers can negotiate the timing and type  		of information to be exchanged with the healthcare organizations with which  		they do business, the health information that is actually exchanged is often  		lacking in terms of its timeliness, completeness, and/or accuracy. Future  		studies may want to ask clinicians/specific care settings what they believe is  		the desired content needed at time of transition and explore barriers to  		timely, complete, and accurate HIE. </p>
<p>In addition, it will be important to ensure that the data elements that  		are particularly relevant for older and more complex patients and are needed to  		be exchanged at times of transition can be represented in the CCD standard for  		electronic HIE for summary documents. Needed data for this population includes,  		for example, a prominent place to feature the role, strengths and limitations  		of family caregivers, as well as the patients baseline and current  		physical and cognitive functional status. Inclusion in the ballot of standards  		to represent functional status content and assessments is one critical  		component of information that needs to be exchanged on behalf of this  		population. The CAST/AHIMA demonstration of the use of the CCD standard will be  		an important step for demonstrating the utility of this standard. </p>
<p>Finally, the dearth of peer-reviewed literature on studies related to  		EHR and HIT adoption in PAC and LTC studies is telling. To make informed  		decisions about how to increase and enhance HIT adoption rates, there is a need  		for empirical evidence on the current status of EHR/HIT adoption in these  		settings, as well as trending for future adoption.</p>
<h3>C. Next Steps</h3>
<p>The next step in this project is to conduct four site visits to  		locations that have implemented or have planned HIE strategies. Each site visit  		will be comprised of a visit to a host site such as an acute care hospital,  		CCRC, or HIE entity, and three or more unaffiliated PAC/LTC settings. The  		purpose of the site visits is to: (1) gather information from clinicians about  		what health information they want/need at times of care transitions; (2)  		determine how information is shared across both affiliated and unaffiliated  		settings; and (3) identify the facilitators and barriers to the exchange of  		health information across these settings. </p>
<p>These site visits will enhance our understanding about HIE on behalf of  		patients who receive PAC and LTC services, including the barriers to more  		timely and complete health information (in both electronic and paper form) and  		what collaborative solutions may have emerged to address some of these  		barriers. Some of these locally derived solutions may be generalizable to other  		healthcare communities nationwide. These site visits also will offer the  		opportunity to explore additional important areas that are not well described  		in the literature. For example, one area of interest will be how  		clinicians workflow patterns are affected by the introduction of emerging  		technologies. </p>
<h3>D. In Closing</h3>
<p>Greater understanding of the factors that contribute to the current  		state of HIE (both electronically and non-electronically) across acute, PAC and  		LTC settings is important for identifying opportunities for improvement.  		Drawing from the lessons in the literature and the insights of national leaders  		and stakeholders, this report has attempted to elucidate many of these  		contributing factors and begins to suggest promising areas for further  		exploration. With a growing number of groups representing both the private and  		public sectors beginning to consider the unique needs of patients in need of  		PAC and LTC services in the development and implementation of electronic HIE  		standards, the opportunity for significant advancement in the field has become  		possible.</p>
