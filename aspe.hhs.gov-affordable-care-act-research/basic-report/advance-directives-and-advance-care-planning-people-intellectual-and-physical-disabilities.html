</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The concerns, perspectives, and values of people with disabilities have  		often been overlooked in the extensive research, programs, and policies  		regarding advance directives, advance care planning and end-of-life care more  		generally. In spite of the limited programming and research, people with  		disabilities need to plan for times of serious illness in order to receive good  		end-of-life care and have their wishes respected. Following lengthy histories  		of societal abuse, neglect, and prejudice, advance care planning is necessary  		to assure that people with disabilities have access to necessary care,  		services, and supports, as well as inclusion in the societal dialogue about  		care near the end-of-life.</p>
<p>This paper describes the current status of advance directives and  		advance care planning in the disability community and identifies where gaps  		exist in policy, practice, and research. The aim is to better assure that the  		needs and issues of people with disabilities are considered and integrated into  		new policies designed to promote effective advance care planning. This report  		reviews professional literature, consumer materials, and Internet sites  		pertaining to advance care planning, surrogate decisionmaking, and end-of-life  		care for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p>
<h2><a name="who" id="who">II. WHO ARE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES?</a></h2>
<p>Although there is no general consensus as to who are people with  		disabilities, comparable definitions of disability have been developed for a  		range of clinical, policy, demographic, and research purposes. Asch and Mudrick  		have found agreement that people with disabilities:</p>
<ul><li>have a permanent or chronic physical or mental impairment or  		  condition;</li>
<li>the impairment or condition may differ in degree of severity;</li>
<li>the impairment or condition may differ in degree of visibility to  		  others; and</li>
<li>the age of onset of the impairment or condition varies by  		  individual.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Legal/policy definitions of disability have been developed in recent  		decades to protect individuals from discrimination in the most important  		components of American life -- employment, housing, and public accommodations  		that include schools and universities, settings for the delivery of health care  		and social services, business and commercial services, recreational/cultural  		programs, transportation, and telecommunications. Functional definitions of  		disability are provided by the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (for federal  		agencies) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (for state and  		local governments and private entities). Although the parameters of these  		definitions have been expanded and narrowed by various court decisions, in  		essence:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term disability means, with respect to an individual:  		  (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of  		  the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment;  		  or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the ADA  		covers persons with impairments that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Substantially limit major life activities such as seeing, hearing,  		  speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, learning, caring for  		  oneself, and working[I]ndividual[s] with epilepsy, paralysis, HIV  		  infection, AIDS, a substantial hearing or visual impairment, mental  		  retardation, or a specific learning disability [are] covered.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act  		of 2004, which applies to educational services for children requiring special  		instructional methodologies, provides definitional guidance on the conditions  		that affect a child with a disability. These conditions include  		children who need special education and related services due to: mental  		retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language  		impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional  		disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other  		health impairments, or specific learning disabilities.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> This illustrative listing of  		conditions in children might be used to apply to individuals throughout the  		lifespan.</p>
<p>Professional and consumer literature may use the following terms to  		characterize people with disabilities:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Physical disability, to describe orthopedic and mobility  			 impairments, as well as sensory limitations such as vision and hearing, and  			 speech impediments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developmental disability, defined as a severe,  			 chronic disabilitythat: (i) is attributable to a mental or physical  			 impairment or a combination of mental and physical impairments; (ii) is  			 manifested before that individual attains age 22; (iii) is likely to continue  			 indefinitely; (iv) results in substantial functional limitations in three or  			 moremajor life activit[ies].<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> More commonly, the term developmental  			 disability is used to apply to people with intellectual disabilities as a  			 result of mental retardation. In recent years, the terms  			 developmental and intellectual disabilities are  			 preferred as descriptive terms to mental retardation.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cognitive disability, resulting from neurological  			 impairment at any age. Such a disability may be early onset and also called an  			 intellectual or developmental disability, or later onset due to traumatic  			 injury (such as head trauma from automobile or other accidents) or medical  			 condition (such as Alzheimers or Parkinsons diseases).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychiatric disability to describe long-lasting  			 behavioral, mental health, or emotional conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals may be dually diagnosed; in other words,  			 have concurrent diagnoses or labels of multiple disabilities, such as  			 intellectual and psychiatric disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The <i>2005 Disability Status </i>Reports, compiled by the  		Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Disability Demographics and  		Statistics at Cornell University estimates that 7.8% of the United States  		population has a physical disability, defined as a condition that  		substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking,  		climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> In addition, The Arc estimates that between 1%  		and 3% of Americans has an intellectual disability.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Although a variety of definitions of disability are used, for the  		purposes of this paper, we are using the following definitions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Intellectual disability refers to people with cognitive  			 limitations, primarily resulting from mental retardation, at varying degrees of  			 severity (commonly diagnosed through IQ measures as mild, moderate, severe, or  			 profound), with onset at birth or very early in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical disability refers to individuals with  			 irreversible, serious orthopedic and mobility impairments, such as spinal cord  			 injury, paralysis, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and  			 congenital conditions. This paper focuses on physical disability acquired  			 during childhood, adolescence, or as a younger adult, although these  			 individuals may have limitations comparable to with those with chronic illness  			 (such as heart disease, cancer, renal disease, or HIV) or age-related medical  			 impairment (such as Alzheimers or Parkinsons diseases). In  			 addition, while individuals can have both physical and intellectual  			 disabilities, the term physical disability, as used in this paper,  			 does not include those with limited intellectual capacity. The purpose of this  			 narrower definition is not to further balkanize people with  			 disabilities, but to assure that the unique perspectives of this often  			 overlooked community are appropriately addressed; there is substantial  			 literature and discussion on advance care planning for people with chronic  			 illness and age-related medical impairment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="disability" id="disability">III. DISABILITY COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVES</a></h2>
<p>Are issues of advance care planning the same for all individuals,  		regardless of the presence of a physical or intellectual disability? Or does  		having a physical or intellectual disability -- and responding to the reaction  		of health care professionals and the wider society to disability -- influence  		ones experiences, attitudes, and values on matters related to advance  		care planning? Because of a lack of research, the answers to these questions  		are largely unknown.</p>
<p>As a starting point, the framework for advance care planning applies  		equally to all. All individuals have legal rights and personal interests in  		preparing advance directives and engaging in planning conversations with family  		members, significant others, and health care professionals. Although these  		rights may be constrained by diminished decisionmaking capacity, even those  		with limited capacity should be encouraged to participate in advance care  		planning to the extent their abilities allow. So why consider advance care  		planning for people with disabilities as a separate, significant issue?</p>
<p>There is an extensive history of discrimination and stigma against  		people with disabilities that has often impeded their full participation in  		society. In enacting the ADA -- designed to remediate years of discrimination,  		stereotyping, and neglect -- Congress found that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who  		  have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of  		  purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political  		  powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the  		  control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not  		  truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate  		  in, and contribute to, society.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, such discrimination has also included mistreatment by the  		health care system and lack of access to care.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> Such bias may come in the form of  		paternalistic attitudes,<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> institutional abuse,<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> environmental barriers,<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> and questionable  		care.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Articles and websites of disability organizations evince a profound  		struggle in the community for respect, humanity, and access to care. This  		worldview has been well-articulated by attorney Harriet McBryde Johnson in  		<i>The New York Times Magazine</i> in an article describing her dialogues with  		bioethicist Peter Singer:</p>
<blockquote><p>The peculiar drama of my life has placed me in a world that by and  		  large thinks it would be better if people like me did not exist. My fight has  		  been for accommodation, the world to me and me to the world. As a disability  		  pariah, I must struggle for a place, for kinship, for community, for  		  connectionI am still seeking acceptance of my humanity.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguably, the similar experiences of stigma, isolation, rejection,  		and discrimination faced by all persons with disabilities foster the  		creation of a minority, perhaps cultural, community, whose unique needs should  		be considered, addressed, and included in policy analyses of advance care  		planning.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, advance care planning for people with disabilities may reflect  		some different considerations about specific life-supporting interventions.  		People with no significant history of disability may clearly indicate in their  		advance directives preferences to forgo life-sustaining measures, such as  		ventilators or artificial nutrition and hydration. However, for some people  		with disabilities, these interventions may represent routine care that supports  		everyday life. For example, some people with Duchennes muscular dystrophy  		use ventilatory supports successfully for many years;<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> individuals with certain developmental  		disabilities may obtain daily nutrition from feeding tubes.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> While such ongoing care may be  		desirable for these individuals, some non-disabled people may find these  		interventions unacceptable. Although it is not known whether such views  		regarding life-sustaining care, which often focus on specific medical  		interventions rather than the clinical circumstances, differ between persons  		with disabilities and non-disabled persons. Knowing whether different  		preferences exist is central to understanding how to better promote advance  		care planning among diverse groups. </p>
<h3>A. Advance Care Planning for People with Physical  		Disability</h3>
<p>There are limited research studies, position papers, or materials on  		advance care planning about or for people with physical disabilities. In view  		of the extensive professional literature and discourse during the past two  		decades on end-of-life and palliative care, as well as on advance care planning  		and health care decisionmaking, it may appear that the attitudes and concerns  		of people with physical disabilities have largely been absent from the radar  		screen of many in the health professions, even in the literature concerning  		end-of-life care and diverse cultural communities.</p>
<p>While the literature on advance care planning for people with physical  		disabilities is limited, disability theorists, advocates, and organizations  		have addressed related issues of autonomy in end-of-life decisionmaking, mainly  		in the context of assisted suicide and surrogate decisionmaking. First, because  		of a history of unequal access to health services, advocates forcefully  		responded to societal discussions during the 1990s and beyond on whether or not  		assisted suicide should be legalized and on the impact of assisted suicide on  		the disability community. At the same time, the legal battle over the care for  		Terri Schiavo encouraged discussion regarding the parameters of surrogate  		decisionmaking on behalf of people with disabilities who lack decisional  		capacity. Debate regarding these matters provides some insight on the  		disability community concerns that may influence advance care planning, such as  		the degree to which health care professionals (and society) value and respect  		the lives and perspectives of people with disabilities, as well as overall  		access to health care.</p>
<p>Policy and professional discussion on the legalization of assisted  		suicide resulted in numerous articles, primarily (although not entirely)  		opposed to physician aid-in-dying.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> Gill examines the literature on the  		attitudes of health care professionals on disability, and relates these  		attitudes to perspectives on assisted suicide and a lack of regard for people  		with disabilities. In contrast to studies finding that most people with  		disabilities are glad to be alive and rate the quality of  		their lives as good to excellent, regardless of degree of physical  		impairment, she describes research on the attitudes of health care  		professionals towards people with disabilities that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are as negative as public attitudes, and sometimes more so. More  		  specifically, health professionals significantly underestimate the quality of  		  life of persons with disabilities compared with the actual assessments made by  		  persons with disabilities themselvesSuch pessimistic professional views  		  of life with disability are implicitly conveyed to patients and their families  		  while they are in the midst of decisionmaking about new disabilities[and]  		  are related to professionals views about whether or not to offer  		  life-sustaining treatment options to persons with disabilities.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These attitudes are found to carry over into medical care, through  		recurrent distressing encounters with physicians and other health  		professionals described as lacking aware[ness] of disability issues,  		patronizing, and disrespectful. A common concernis, Doctors need to  		realize that I have a real life and its a valuable  		life.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, research suggests that physician attitudes regarding  		disability may predict whether or not life-sustaining care is provided. In a  		study of ventilator use with patients with severe neuromuscular diseases, such  		as Duchennes muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou  		Gehrig's Disease), Bach reported that clinic directors who most  		underestimated the ventilator users life satisfactionwere least  		likely to encourage ventilator usePhysicians assessment of  		patients quality of life and about the relative desirability of certain  		types of existence determine the likelihood of individuals receiving  		therapeutic interventions like mechanical ventilation.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> Bach concludes that the  		patients attitude towards the use of ventilatory aids seems to  		reflect his/her physicians attitude and the nature of the treatment  		options being presented rather than his/her own informed rational  		decision.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Gills findings are reflected in the numerous websites of  		disability advocacy organizations, such as Not Dead Yet and the Disability  		Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF), that post documents opposing  		assisted suicide.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note24">24</a></font></sup>  		DREDF lists 12 nationally prominent disability organizations that have stated  		their opposition to the legalization of assisted suicide.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> The National Council on  		Disability issued a position paper summarizing the perspective of disability  		groups:</p>
<blockquote><p>Current evidence indicates clearly that the interests of the few  		  people who would benefit from legalizing physician-assisted suicide are heavily  		  outweighed by the probability that any law, procedures, and standards that can  		  be imposed to regulate physician-assisted suicide will be misapplied to  		  unnecessarily end the lives of people with disabilities and entail an  		  intolerable degree of intervention by legal and medical officials in such  		  decisions.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hwang attempts to deflect attention from national disability advocacy  		organizations to emphasize the views of individuals with physical disabilities  		regarding assisted suicide. Using websites frequented by members of the  		physical disability community, she conducted polls on attitudes towards  		assisted suicide, self-perceptions of vulnerability, and  		acceptability of assisted suicide for oneself. While the sample was  		self-selected and relatively small, Hwang uses her exploratory  		findings to show that people with disabilities hold a wide variety of  		views with regard to [physician-assisted suicide] that cannot be easily summed  		up by any one positionUltimately, the question, What kind of life  		is worth living? is a highly individual one that transcends the  		positions of disability advocacy groups.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The concerns of disability advocates regarding the withholding or  		withdrawal of life-sustaining interventions are a logical extension of the  		assisted suicide debate. For example, Werth argues that many more people with  		disabilities will die through decisions to forgo treatments than through  		assisted suicide.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> Therefore, the fears behind the assisted  		suicide debate -- societal (and more specifically, physician) devaluation of  		the lives of people with disabilities, the costs of care, and resource  		allocation -- are equally applicable to decisions to withhold or withdraw  		treatments and to futility decisions.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In response to the legal debates and public attention surrounding the  		care of Terri Schaivo, leading disability advocacy organizations issued policy  		statements on life-sustaining care. <i>A Statement of Common Principles on  		Life-Sustaining Care and Treatment of People with Disabilities</i>, coordinated  		by The Center on Human Policy at Syracuse University, declared that the  		rights to life-sustaining care and treatment and to self-determination  		and autonomy are fundamental rights. The <i>Statement</i>  		notes that [d]isability has been used as a justification for depriving  		people of their fundamental rights. Therefore,</p>
<blockquote><p>Absent clear and convincing evidence of the desires of people with  		  disabilities to decline life-sustaining care or treatment, such care and  		  treatment should not be withheld or withdrawn unless death is genuinely  		  imminent and the care or treatment is objectively futile and would only prolong  		  the dying process.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>

<p>Although not explicitly stated, it can be presumed that advance  		directives are clear and convincing evidence of desires -- informed  		decisions [that] must be respected<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note31">31</a></font></sup> and could be encouraged.</p>
<p>Likewise, United Cerebral Palsy (UCP), The Arc, and the American  		Association of People with Disabilities declared that the provision of  		medical treatment must always be non-discriminatory and never denied, delayed  		or withheld due to the existence of a disability. The organizations  		argued: [t]he courts, the political system and the general public must  		not allow policy to develop that will de-value any individual, no matter what  		the extent of that individuals disability or incapacity.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> This statement also notes that  		individuals may document their preferences through advance directives.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that these organizational statements explicitly  		support the use of advance directives by individuals with disabilities. A  		handful of other disability organizations have taken a more direct approach in  		support of advance care planning. For example, the Multiple Sclerosis  		Association of America (MSAA) published a detailed article for consumers  		explaining the importance advance directives as part of life-planning, with  		instructions and resources for their completion.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> Clinical practice guidelines developed for  		the Paralyzed Veterans of America supported discussion of advance directives  		with patients following spinal cord injury to determine the validity of  		documents completed prior to traumatic injury.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> These guidelines might also encourage  		discussion of advance directives among patients with capacity following spinal  		cord injury when there are no earlier documents. Finally, Allen and her  		colleagues described a unique effort to use American Sign Language to survey  		Deaf seniors on end-of-life concerns and present educational information on  		health care directives and end-of-life care.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. Advance Care Planning for People with Intellectual  		Disability</h3>
<p>There is a legal presumption that all persons have the capacity to make  		their own health care decisions unless they are declared incompetent through a  		legal process. However, adults with intellectual disability have  		historically been excluded from various spheres of decisionmaking about their  		lives, on the presumption that they are incapable of making informed  		decisions.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note36">36</a></font></sup>  		Health care providers, administrators, and families commonly assumed a  		protective stance toward people with intellectual disabilities, even when  		decision-specific capacity may have existed.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note37">37</a></font></sup> Recent trends have encouraged providers,  		researchers, and advocates to question this paternalistic approach for three  		reasons.</p>
<p>First, medical advances are increasing the longevity of people with  		intellectual disabilities. For example, life expectancy for people with  		Downs Syndrome has doubled during the 1980s and 1990s.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note38">38</a></font></sup> As individuals with  		intellectual disabilities age, they and their caregivers face issues of aging  		and chronic illness as never before. Second, this time period has witnessed  		significant cultural changes regarding medical decisionmaking, end-of-life  		care, and advance care planning, as bioethical principles evolved from a  		paternalistic to an autonomy-based approach.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note39">39</a></font></sup> Third, although the needs of people with  		intellectual disabilities were largely absent from early discussions to promote  		advance care planning and palliative approaches to care, providers and  		advocates have sought to bolster the autonomy of community members and brought  		their concerns to the table.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Decisional Capacity</b>. Advance care planning by and for people with  		intellectual disabilities is complicated by the wide range of cognitive  		abilities and limitations and by differing needs for assistance among members  		of this community.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note41">41</a></font></sup>  		For example, those with mild impairments may reside independently in the  		community, with a support system that includes social services staff, personal  		care attendants, family and community advocates, and vocational and residential  		services. These individuals usually need information on their service  		options when confronting life-threatening illness, especially on hospice and  		palliative care services, assistance in documenting their preferences through  		advance directives, and support in navigating their way through complex health  		care systems.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note42">42</a></font></sup>  		Others with more serious cognitive impairments have intermittent decisionmaking  		abilities or have never had the capacity to make health care decisions. Their  		health-related decisions are made by surrogates, primarily parents and  		other (public or private) guardians, who act in their childs or  		wards best interest and need information and support in selecting the  		most appropriate health care.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note43">43</a></font></sup></p>
<p>People with intellectual disabilities should not be presumed to lack  		capacity for making health care decisions. A panel convened by the Midwest  		Bioethics Center (now known as the Center for Practical Bioethics) in 1996  		issued guidelines to facilitate individual decisionmaking and more accurate  		professional assessments of decisional capacity. The guidelines provide  		recommendations to assess whether patients meet a minimum level of  		understanding. Limitations in intellect and communication abilities are  		bolstered by supporting areas of individual strength and by offering  		assistance.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Clinical practice and legal standards have moved away from global  		determinations of capacity to more finely-tuned task-specific determinations of  		capacity. The capacity to make health care decisions has been defined as the  		ability to understand the information about a proposed care plan, appreciate  		the consequences of a decision, and reach and communicate an informed  		decision.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note45">45</a></font></sup> Unlike  		competency, which is an all or nothing judicial determination,  		capacity is specific to the decision at hand.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note46">46</a></font></sup> This more flexible methodology to assessing  		abilities creates a multi-tiered approach to decisionmaking. For example,  		individuals who lack abilities to express preferences or goals of care in a  		living will may be able to appoint a health care proxy. Similarly, those unable  		to make decisions about life-sustaining interventions may have the capacity to  		make less complex decisions, such as on low-risk medications, diet, or  		recreation. Beltran summarizes the challenge in accurately assessing  		decisionmaking capacity: There is a need to balance protection from harm  		with the patients right to self-determination. This balancing requires  		skilled listening, the proper level of advocacy from caregivers, and pragmatic  		models of shared decisionmaking.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note47">47</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A 2003 study assessed health care capacity among adults with mild,  		moderate, and no mental retardation to make low-risk medical  		treatment decisions. The study used standardized treatment vignettes to measure  		the capacity of adults to reason about treatment-related information. Cea and  		Fisher found that most adults with mild [86%] and no [95%] mental  		retardation and almost half of adults with moderate mental retardation [45%]  		were able to make and justify treatment choices and fully or partially  		understand treatment information.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note48">48</a></font></sup> These findings are used to support claims  		that many adults with mild mental retardation, and some adults with moderate  		retardation, do indeed have the ability to provide adequate consent to  		standard low-risk health-related treatments. Moreover, capacity to  		consent could be enhanced with supportive decisionmaking or educational  		techniques in preparation for treatments or procedures requiring their  		consent.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note49">49</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Policy Statements</b>. Key intellectual disability organizations  		support efforts to promote rights to autonomy and self-determination. The  		American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD,  		formerly called the American Association on Mental Retardation -- AAMR) issued  		a <i>Position Statement on Caring at the End of Life</i> in 2005. The statement  		advocates:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Discovering and honoring the treatment wishes of persons with  			 intellectual disabilities through: observing and interacting with individuals  			 over time to understand what is important to them; encouraging expressions of  			 preferences regarding end-of-life care before situations requiring  			 decisionmaking occur; and for capable individuals, documenting  			 preferences through living wills, personal vision statements, health care  			 proxy instructions, and other indicators of ones wishes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrawing or withholding care may be appropriate in some  			 situations, but not because the person has a  			 disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The presumption should always be in favor of  			 treatment[but] may be overcome inclearly specified  			 situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These situations, where continued life may not be in the  			 persons best interest include: (1) where life-sustaining treatment  			 is clearly ineffective and would only prolong the process of dying with no  			 prospect of reversing it; (2) the person is in an irreversible coma or  			 permanent vegetative state; or (3) the treatment itself would impose excessive  			 pain and suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hospice care and adequate pain relief should be available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permissible treatment options at the end-of-life are the same  			 for persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities as for everyone  			 else.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note50">50</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Similarly, a 2002 joint policy statement of The Arc of the United States  		(formerly called the Association for Retarded Citizens) and AAIDD, supported  		the availability, use, and honoring of advance directives for  		individuals with mental retardation whenever informed consent is  		assured. In addition, the decisions involving the refusal of  		medical treatments, or nutrition and hydration when such refusal will result in  		the death of the individual,should be confined to those situations in  		which the persons condition is terminal, death is imminent, and any  		continuation or provision of treatment, nutrition and/or hydration would only  		serve to prolong dying.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note51">51</a></font></sup> Unlike the 2005 policy statement of AAIDD,  		the earlier position does not list irreversible coma or permanent vegetative  		state as permissible reasons to forgo life-sustaining care.</p>
<p><b>Resources and Innovations</b>. Materials and innovative approaches to  		advance care planning have been developed to promote better end-of-life  		decisions. Last Passages, a three-year public-private partnership funded by the  		U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities and the Project on Death in  		America, provides an array of electronic materials to assist service providers,  		policymakers, and consumers.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note52">52</a></font></sup> Resources include descriptive information, a  		manual about end-of-life care for people with developmental disabilities,  		sample documents for advance care planning, links to national organizations and  		projects, and an extensive bibliography.</p>
<p>NYSARC, Inc., in collaboration with Last Passages, developed a monograph  		and resource manual (primarily focused on New York State) to inform consumers,  		family members, and providers about hospice and end-of-life care, advance care  		planning, and bereavement.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note53">53</a></font></sup> The Center for Practical Bioethicss  		<i>Healthcare Treatment Decision-Making Guidelines for Adults with  		Developmental Disabilities</i> provides model standards for policymakers  		considering revisions to public or institutional policies on health care  		decisionmaking or advance directives.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note54">54</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Kingsbury advocates person-centered planning to help  		consumers, family members, and providers identify and document preferences for  		end-of-life care. Person-centered planning is not an event; it is a  		process for advance care planning discussions with people with  		intellectual limitations. Person-centered planning can help people  		identify their wishes, such as who they would like to have present, how they  		would like to be made comfortable, what kinds of treatment they wish to have or  		not have, [and] what religious or spiritual support they want.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note55">55</a></font></sup> Planning tools involve  		deliberate, ongoing communication that emphasizes listening, learning,  		understanding, and acting on what is important to support people who are aging  		and dying, and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Is it possible to augment the decisionmaking capacity of individuals  		with cognitive limitations? Friedman supports the concept of assisted  		capacity, through which individuals who may be unable to make  		advance directives decisions completely independently, but who could  		participate in decisionmaking with the proper degree of assistance and support  		from others.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note56">56</a></font></sup>  		Such support could come from families, friends, clergy, advocates, and formal  		health care and service providers. While this strategy may facilitate advance  		care planning, there is the potential for helper influence to act as a coercive  		force in decisions that are made.</p>
<p>To help elicit the preferences of people with disabilities with varying  		degrees of decisional capacity, the Center for Practical Bioethics and  		Missouris largest public guardianship office (the Jackson County Public  		Administrator), established Project BRIDGE. Through an intensive process of  		inviting public wards to express their health care preferences,  		listening carefully when the invitation is accepted, and  		reporting relayed stories and preferences to public guardians,  		project staff offered individuals who were often overlooked the opportunity to  		express and document their preferences to inform the guardians who made  		decisions for them.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note57">57</a></font></sup>  		Although this approach requires significant staff time, it offers a creative  		way of understanding the wishes and values of people with limited capacity, as  		well as those with limited communication abilities.</p>
<p>For individuals with limited and no decisionmaking capacity, Beltran and  		Martyn propose a standard of best respect (similar to a best  		interests decisionmaking standard), with heath care choices made by a team  		rather than an individual surrogate. The proponents of best respect  		suggest convening those individuals most familiar with the patients life  		and values for an informed dialogue that results in a consensus on treatment  		decisions. This shared decisionmaking (distinguished from the  		shared decisionmaking between patient and provider) should occur within the  		context of the patients community of care, which may be a  		developmental center, community group home, or independent living arrangement.  		An ethics committee could convene key parties, such as family members, friends,  		or other supportive caregivers, as well as the interdisciplinary team caring  		for the individual.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note58">58</a></font></sup>  		In the best respect model, physicians offer objective information  		about the patient, including diagnosis, prognosis, available treatment choices,  		and quality of life issues. Subsequently, the:</p>
<blockquote><p>search for subjective information[examines] what the person has  		  communicated in the past about her own life and its pleasures, pains,  		  dignities, indignities, and dependencies. Second, the group should consider  		  what this information tells them about the subjective value of life to this  		  patient. Finally, given what has been shared, [a determination would be made  		  on] which decision best respects the individual expression of this unique  		  individual.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note59">59</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With more effective public outreach promoting the benefits of advance  		care planning, some parents and guardians of individuals with limited or no  		capacity desire to complete advance directives on their childrens or  		wards behalf. These parents and guardians, motivated by the desire to  		plan for their own death or incapacity, are surprised to learn that they cannot  		do so -- that directives may be completed only by individuals with capacity to  		do so. In response, Beltran encourages parents/guardians to write a  		letter expressing their values and concerns for placement into their  		childs/wards permanent planning records. While noting that such  		values letters have no legal force, they can provide guidance  		to health care providers seeking to provide treatments that are in keeping with  		the patients values.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note60">60</a></font></sup> Beltran recommends the development of a  		legal mechanism for parents to document values to assure their wishes are  		carried out after they die.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note61">61</a></font></sup> Physician orders -- such as Physician Orders  		for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), where patient and surrogate preferences  		are incorporated into doctors orders,<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note62">62</a></font></sup> or out-of-hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders  		-- may provide models for such long-range planning if the hurdles regarding  		decisionmaking can be surmounted.</p>
<p>Professional education has been recognized as a critical component to  		improving end-of-life care and promoting better informed advance care plans and  		medical decisions. Frequently, health care professionals (physicians, nurses,  		social workers, clergy, and others), including hospice and palliative care  		staff, lack training on the special needs of people with intellectual  		disabilities and on methods to assess their decisional capacity.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note63">63</a></font></sup> Furthermore, staff of public agencies and  		private organizations serving people with disabilities should be trained in the  		special needs of people with intellectual disabilities for advance care  		planning, options for hospice and palliative care to manage life-threatening  		illnesses, and special concerns in providing and consenting to care.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note64">64</a></font></sup> For example, in a rare study of  		end-of-life decisions in a developmental center (where residents commonly have  		more severe intellectual disabilities than those living in community  		placements), Lohiya and her colleagues found that among 38 residents who had  		died during a 2½ year period, only ten residents (26%) had an  		end-of-life decision made on their behalf. Of 850 residents, only two had ever  		completed an advance directive. The researchers suggest that more frequent  		discussions of patients best interests before death might lead to better  		end-of-life care.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note65">65</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="gap" id="gap">IV. GAPS AND BARRIERS</a></h2>
<p>While the process for advance care planning for people with physical and  		intellectual disabilities is the same as for non-disabled people, there are  		unique community perspectives and issues to be addressed in policies seeking to  		promote such plans. For people with all disabilities, and especially for people  		with physical disability, the literature demonstrates over-riding concerns  		about under-treatment for serious medical conditions due to:</p>
<ul><li>devaluation of and lack of respect for the lives of people with  		  disabilities;</li>
<li>negative attitudes of health care professionals and the public,  		  including overly pessimistic perceptions of quality of life and misconceptions  		  about life satisfaction; and</li>
<li>lack of access to care and services based on discrimination, cost  		  concerns, and environmental barriers.</li>
</ul><p>Advance directives guiding care toward the end-of-life are irrelevant  		when ones concern is the denial of care: unwanted interventions at the  		end-of-life are not the central issue (although individuals could specify in  		their directives a preference for continuing with aggressive, curative care).  		There is a need for more information on access to and quality of end-of-life  		care for people with all disabilities, and how this may be different or the  		same from non-disabled individuals generally.</p>
<p>In addition, for people with intellectual disability, there is a need to  		replace paternalistic attitudes and stereotypes about cognitive limitations  		with skilled, careful assessments of decisional capacity and abilities,  		strategies for assisted and shared decisionmaking and life-planning, and more  		thoughtful communication about medical options. Research and discussion of  		these issues is relatively recent, and much more needs to be done.</p>
<p>The following gaps and barriers should be addressed:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Limited Research, Programs, and Attention</b>. There are few  			 studies, service programs, and educational outreach efforts on advance care  			 planning, and improved end-of-life and palliative care for people with physical  			 and intellectual disabilities. To develop effective care and services, more  			 information is needed on:</p>
<ul><li><i>Attitudes, concerns, and values about end-of-life care:</i>  				What do diverse disability populations regard as desirable care in times of  				life-limiting illness and severe adverse health states?</li>
<li><i>Experiences regarding and strategies for advance care  				planning:</i> How do health care professionals approach advance care planning  				among patients with diverse disabilities? Are these strategies different from  				non-disabled patients? Which approaches are most effective among diverse  				disability communities?</li>
<li><i>The quality of end-of-life care:</i> Are perceptions of  				quality end-of-life care among disability communities the same or different  				from non-disabled populations? Do people have access to quality hospice and  				palliative care services based on current professional guidelines? Is this the  				type of care that individuals with diverse disabilities prefer?</li>
<li><i>The impact of health care professional and public  				attitudes:</i> What are the perceptions and attitudes regarding the care of  				life-threatening illness among diverse disability populations? Have attitudes  				changed over time? How have attitudes influenced patient care?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Research and Guidelines for Assessing Decisional Capacity</b>.  			 Balancing respect for autonomy and self-determination among people with  			 intellectual disability with protection of vulnerable individuals from harm is  			 a most difficult challenge. There are needs for research and practice  			 guidelines to assist professionals in assessing decisional capacity, especially  			 the ability to make difficult and complex choices near the end-of-life.  			 Moreover, evaluation research is needed on various approaches to assisted or  			 shared decisionmaking and life-planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Community Distrust</b>. A history of discrimination, neglect, and  			 abuse toward people with disabilities has occasionally led to distrust among  			 some community members toward health care professionals. Negative experiences  			 with health care providers, which research has shown to be all too common,  			 results in fears about discriminatory practices and denial of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Advance Directives May Be Inappropriate For Some</b>. The model  			 for advance care planning -- legal documents completed by people with  			 decisional capacity -- is insufficient for many people with intellectual  			 disability. Many individuals with limited decisionmaking capacity cannot  			 complete advance directives; parents, family members, and guardians would  			 benefit from additional legal options for end-of-life planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Conflict Management</b>. End-of-life choices present complicated  			 dilemmas for patients, surrogates, families, health care providers,  			 administrators, policymakers, and the legal system. Parents and guardians may  			 disagree with their adult children and wards, especially those legally  			 adjudicated as incompetent. People with disabilities may disagree  			 with their health care providers. Providers and administrators are always  			 mindful of the potential for legal liability when parties disagree.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="trend" id="trend">V. TRENDS</a></h2>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Inclusionary Dialogue</b>. To promote respect for people with  			 disabilities among health care providers and policymakers and to help overcome  			 years of community distrust, end-of-life researchers, policymakers,  			 programmers, and educators should include meaningful participation by members  			 of disability communities, as well as advocacy and service organizations  			 serving the community, as part of the planning, implementation, and oversight  			 of their activities. Health care professionals and consumers with disabilities  			 should be recruited to participate on ethics committees and programs. As stated  			 by Asch, recent events demonstrate how desperately the disability  			 perspective needs to become part of the conversation rather than being excluded  			 from it.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Research Needs</b>. Innovative research design, as well as public  			 and private funding, is needed to inform new service initiatives to improve  			 end-of-life and palliative care, and advance care planning for people with  			 physical and intellectual disabilities. Specific topics for research are  			 suggested for each of the gaps noted in the section above, including:</p>
<ul><li>attitudes, concerns, and values about end-of-life care;</li>
<li>experiences regarding and strategies for advance care  				planning;</li>
<li>the quality of end-of-life care for diverse disability  				populations; and</li>
<li>the impact of health care professional and public attitudes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Understanding and Assessing Decisional Capacity</b>. Research is  			 needed on approaches and tools for assessing the parameters of decisional  			 capacity among people with intellectual disability, especially regarding the  			 range of complex choices near the end-of-life. Prior research using vignettes  			 of low-risk health-related treatments may provide a model.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note67">67</a></font></sup> In addition, studies should  			 examine the effectiveness of strategies and tools for advance care planning  			 among those with limited capacity, such as shared decisionmaking and assisted  			 capacity. More information is needed on which strategies support decisionmaking  			 abilities, and whether these approaches unintentionally influence decisions  			 that are made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Integrating Policy Statements</b>. Several disability  			 organizations and advocacy groups -- such as AAIDD, The Arc of the United  			 States, the National Council on Disability, and the Center on Human Policy  			 Study at Syracuse University -- have developed major policy statements  			 regarding health care decisionmaking and the quality of end-of-life care. These  			 statements bring powerful voices to advocate for respecting the rights of  			 individuals with disabilities to make autonomous decisions, and for access to  			 the full-range of care and services. The dialogue on these issues should  			 continue to evolve. Furthermore, policy announcements should be acknowledged  			 and respected by providers and policymakers. Future practices, policies, and  			 research should integrate these statements, while reconciling, justifying, and  			 bridging differences, wherever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>New Models for Advance Care Planning</b>. Legal and planning  			 mechanisms are needed to better enable parents, families, and guardians of  			 people with limited decisional capacity to plan for serious illnesses affecting  			 their loved ones and wards. Family and guardian values letters  			 present one such approach, but lack a legal basis. Policymakers, in conjunction  			 with the disability community, should consider new planning mechanisms for  			 end-of-life planning. In addition, guidelines to better integrate end-of-life  			 planning into current person-centered habilitation and life-plans  			 would be helpful for family members and other guardians, as well as for service  			 and residential programs. These guidelines should be evaluated for usability  			 and effectiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Outreach on Advance Care Planning</b>. Many organizations  			 advocating on behalf of people with disabilities recognize the importance of  			 advance directives to provide evidence of an individuals preferences for  			 end-of-life decisions. Furthermore, several innovative approaches -- such as  			 Last Passages, life-centered planning, assisted capacity, shared  			 decisionmaking, the best respect standard for decisionmaking, Project BRIDGE,  			 and staff training -- have been developed to assist people with intellectual  			 disability. Similarly, organizations representing people with mental health  			 disabilities generally support the legalization and use of psychiatric  			 advance directives for use during times of incapacity due to psychiatric  			 conditions.<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note68">68</a></font></sup> These  			 programs and policies provide unique opportunities for community outreach to  			 encourage more effective advance care planning among people with diverse  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Models for Consensus-Building</b>. Models for ethics committees  			 and conflict resolution provide opportunities for mediating disputes involving  			 persons with disabilities;<sup><font><a href="advance-directives-and-advance-care-planning-people-intellectual-and-physical-disabilities.html#note69">69</a></font></sup> providing patient, family, provider, and  			 community education; formulating institutional policy; and appropriately  			 resorting to the courts when all else fails. Research and resources should be  			 developed to promote various models for consensus-building, policymaking,  			 professional training, and community outreach to improve advance care planning  			 and patient care on behalf of all people with disabilities.</p>
