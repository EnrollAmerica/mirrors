<p>With the relationship between increasing age, chronic illness and  		disability, and growing long-term care needs well documented, new models of  		delivering health-related and supportive services are being sought that are  		attractive and affordable to low and modest-income older adults. One promising  		but under explored strategy, affordable housing plus services (AHPS), links  		older residents of subsidized multi-unit housing to health and supportive  		services so that they can age in place. The U.S. Departments of  		Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development and the A.M.  		McGregor Home in Cleveland, Ohio, funded the Institute for the Future of Aging  		Services (IFAS), the policy and applied research arm of the American  		Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, to examine the potential of  		AHPS strategies to meet some of the long-term care needs of low and  		modest-income seniors. IFAS defines AHPS as having three elements: </p>
<ul><li>Independent, unlicensed, primarily subsidized, multi-unit housing  		  where large numbers of low and modest-income older adults live in close  		  proximity.</li>
<li>Health-related and supportive services, funded separately from the  		  housing, and available to at least some older residents (e.g., personal care,  		  housekeeping, meals, transportation, health and wellness services, etc.).</li>
<li>A purposeful linkage mechanism connecting residents to needed  		  health-related and supportive services so that they are able to age in  		  place in the face of declining health and increasing disability. </li>
</ul><p>The study examined the literature on integrating affordable housing and  		health and supportive services for older adults, developed an inventory of  		promising AHPS strategies and programs, and brought together several hundred  		stakeholders from the fields of affordable housing and aging services in four  		workshops convened in four regions of the country. The study found a wide  		variety of AHPS programs in operation, typically at the initiative of  		individual housing providers. Hard evidence on the impact of these programs is  		lacking. Stakeholders at the workshops generally agreed that AHPS strategies  		could be effective in helping some publicly subsidized housing residents  		maintain independent living, even in the face of declining health and  		increasing disability. Programs they deemed most successful: (1) bridged the  		different worlds of housing and aging services; (2) involved housing providers  		committed to a broader role; (3) possessed the skills to develop collaborative  		relationships with community partners; and (4) pro-actively sought out funders  		and overcame regulatory barriers. The study concluded that wider replication  		and dissemination of AHPS programs will require additional numbers of committed  		housing providers, increased provider capacity, and concrete demonstration and  		evaluation of the impact of AHPS programs. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p>The aging of the baby boomers is a significant economic and social  		issue. By 2030, older adults are expected to make up 20 percent of the  		population, doubling from 35 to 70 million people. The relationship between  		older age, chronic illness and disability, and higher use of long-term care  		services is well established. In response to the rising demand for long-term  		care, consumer advocates, policy makers, and service providers have encouraged  		the development of new models of organizing and delivering health-related and  		supportive services that are attractive and affordable to older adults,  		particularly those who are poor or of modest means. </p>
<p>Assisted living facilities (ALFs) are a residential model of care that  		has received considerable attention as a potentially less expensive and more  		appealing alternative to nursing homes. The Assisted Living Quality Coalition  		has defined assisted living as a congregate residential setting that provides  		or coordinates personal services, 24-hour supervision and assistance (scheduled  		and unscheduled), activities, and health-related services and is designed to  		minimize the need to move; to accommodate individual residents' changing needs  		and preferences; to maximize residents' dignity, autonomy, privacy,  		independence, and safety; and to encourage family and community  		involvement.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> While the  		number of ALFs across the country has rapidly expanded over the last decade,  		they have remained largely cost prohibitive for older people with limited  		incomes. Many states have secured waivers allowing Medicaid to cover ALF costs;  		however, assisted living remains primarily private pay. In 2002, Medicaid  		helped pay for approximately 11 percent of the total number of assisted living  		residents in 41 states.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>A less well-publicized residential care model providing  		  lower-income seniors with access to health-related and supportive services is  		  emerging in publicly subsidized housing communities. This service delivery  		  model, referred to in this report as affordable housing plus  		  services (AHPS), is intended to integrate independent, unlicensed, and  		  primarily subsidized multi-unit housing environments for older adults with  		  services and supports. The goal is to enable older residents who are frail  		  and/or disabled to remain in their housing community even as their health  		  declines and disability increases. </i></b></p>

</ul><p>This report presents the findings from the AHPS workshops. </p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">II. METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The study findings synthesized in this report were generated through a  		combination of methods, including:</p>
<ol><li>A review of the research and evaluation literature.</li>
<li>Two informal workgroup meetings, held with AAHSA members and staff  		  and other experts, to develop study definitions and identify policy and  		  practice issues to be addressed in the invitational workshops. </li>
<li>Telephone and in-person discussions with AAHSA members, other housing  		  providers, and aging and housing experts to identify exemplary AHPS  		  programs.</li>
<li>Four invitational workshops attended by housing and aging services  		  stakeholders to discuss the merits of, challenges to, and opportunities for  		  AHPS. </li>
</ol><h2><a name="finding" id="finding">III. FINDINGS FROM THE LITERATURE</a></h2>
<p>About 1.8 million older adults, mostly low-income single women in their  		mid-70s to early-80s, live in federally subsidized housing--more than the  		numbers who live in nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> The majority live in public housing, housing  		with Section 8 assistance, Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly,  		Section 515 Rural Rental Housing, and Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)  		properties. Unknown numbers of low-income seniors also live in rental  		properties subsidized through state and municipal programs and in privately  		financed unsubsidized housing, rented or sold at market rates without regard to  		income. </p>
<p>Research shows that many of these older residents need assistance with  		routine activities. The 2002 American Community Survey found that subsidized  		older renters were twice as likely to be disabled as were older  		homeowners.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> Over half  		reported limitations in activities like walking and climbing stairs, compared  		to one-quarter of older homeowners. A third reported difficulty with shopping  		or going to the doctor, twice that of older homeowners. Likewise, surveys of  		Section 202 property managers indicate the proportion of residents having  		difficulty preparing meals or performing personal care tasks increased almost  		four fold between 1988 and 1999. Managers in the 1999 survey also reported 30  		percent of vacancies occurred because of a transfer to a nursing  		home.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Renters in subsidized senior housing are also less likely than  		unsubsidized renters to live in properties that offer supportive services.  		According to analysis of Wave 2 of the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics  		among the Oldest Old, 36 percent of subsidized senior housing properties offer  		transportation services, 26 percent offer group meals, about 12 percent offer  		housekeeping and 6 percent offer personal care. In contrast, over 75 percent of  		unsubsidized elderly renters live in independent senior housing that offers  		group meals and transportation, 67 percent live in properties that offer  		housekeeping, and 43 percent offer personal care.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Connecting older residents who are frail and/or disabled to needed  		assistance is not straightforward. Discontinuities between the agencies  		responsible for housing and for long-term care are well documented.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> For example, housing policy is  		largely about bricks and mortar. With few exceptions, federal  		housing funds cannot pay for services. Conversely, most public funding for  		health and supportive services (e.g., Medicaid, the Older Americans Act,  		the Community Services Block Grant) cannot be used to cover room and board (the  		exception being Medicaid, which covers room and board as part of a per diem  		payment if an eligible recipient is in a nursing home). Regardless of whether  		the absence of supportive services in subsidized housing can result in the  		residents transfer to a nursing home, diverting this transfer is rarely  		the goal of housing policy. Nor is the availability of AHPS typically  		considered in developing long-term care policy. </p>
<p>Older residents themselves also face practical barriers to obtaining  		needed supports.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> Senior  		residents of publicly subsidized housing are less likely than older homeowners  		to have family members they can rely upon. Community providers may incorrectly  		believe the housing provider, not them, is responsible for service provision.  		Other tenants may pressure management to evict residents who look too old and  		frail. Families may face difficulty in locating willing service providers.  		Housing managers may worry about their liability, for example, if residents  		with age-related dementias leave on the stove or disturb other residents. Most  		often, housing providers and community services agencies simply view their  		missions through different lenses and lack experience working together.</p>
<p>The impact of AHPS is largely untested. In the mid-1990s, HUD evaluated  		two of its programs designed to help seniors age in place with case management  		and supportive services--the Congregate Housing Services Program and the Hope  		for Elderly Independence Demonstration Program. The evaluation found high  		levels of satisfaction among the participants of both programs. However, no  		significant differences were reported for nursing home use or the length of  		time in independent housing as a result of participation in either program.  		These findings are not surprising given that participants were found to be less  		disabled than those eligible for nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> The lack of research leaves policy makers and  		providers with little guidance on whether or which AHPS strategies are wise  		investments. However, absent large national research experiments, a wide  		variety of AHPS programs have emerged in states and localities that could act  		as natural laboratories for measuring the impact of AHPS strategies with a  		critical mass of older people.</p>
<h2><a name="inventory" id="inventory">IV. INVENTORY OF AHPS STRATEGIES AND  		PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<p>As part of the AHPS study, IFAS developed an inventory of AHPS  		strategies that have been implemented across the county. The inventory is  		organized around two broad categories of affordable housing: privately financed  		and publicly subsidized. The inventory is summarized below. Examples of AHPS  		programs that incorporate many of the features of each strategy are also  		identified. </p>
<p><b><i>A more detailed description of the inventory can be found at  		</i></b><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports.shtml</a><b><i>  		or</i></b> <a href="http://www.huduser.org">http://www.huduser.org</a>.</p>
<ol type="A"><li>
<p><b>Privately financed housing</b> refers to multi-unit owner and  			 rental housing that receives no public subsidies, but is still affordable to  			 low and moderate-income older adults. It may also include neighborhoods of  			 single-family homes with large concentrations of senior households. Strategies  			 include:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Housing Cooperatives</b> allow residents to own and control  				  their apartment through a corporation in which they own stock and are actively  				  involved in management and programming. Maintaining affordability is difficult  				  and is typically achieved by capping the resale price (limited-equity  				  cooperatives). Services can be informal or formal, involving joint purchasing  				  and/or scheduling of services or a coordinated and managed services program  				  staffed by community agencies or the cooperative. <b>Penn South Cooperative,  				  New York, NY</b>, is a limited-equity co-op built in 1961 with 6,200 residents.  				  As Penn Souths residents began to age, the co-op set up a collaborative  				  program with community agencies to provide supportive services. Now a separate  				  non-profit agency, Penn South Social Services, Inc., offers cultural and  				  educational programs, case management, adult day care, home care services,  				  personal care, primary health care and wellness services, and a variety of  				  other supportive services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Shared Housing involves</b> two or more unrelated individuals  				  living together in a private single-family home. Some programs match up elderly  				  homeowners with individuals willing to help with household chores in return for  				  reduced rent. Others involve small numbers of older people living together and  				  providing mutual support. Accessory housing is a shared housing arrangement  				  where a trailer or portable manufactured home is placed next to a main home,  				  enabling a frail senior to maintain independence and still be close to a family  				  member or other willing caregiver. <b>HomeShare Vermont, Burlington, VT</b>,  				  assists seniors and persons with disabilities to live independently by linking  				  them with other people seeking affordable housing or caregiving opportunities.  				  Typically, a student or working-age adult is matched with an elderly homeowner  				  for whom they carry out household chores in exchange for free or reduced rent.  				  </p>

<p><b>Mobile Home Parks/Manufactured Home Communities</b> provide  				  homeownership opportunities to some lower-income seniors. Usually the housing  				  unit is owned, the lot is leased, and upkeep and maintenance are included in  				  the lot fee. Social and recreational amenities are often shared. While many  				  mobile home parks have been disappearing as land values increase, some are  				  being converted to cooperative ownership to preserve their existence and  				  affordability. Formal programs to link residents to services are hard to find,  				  although aging in place is an issue. <b>Millennium Housing, Newport Beach,  				  CA</b>, operates several senior parks in California. A monthly magazine is  				  distributed to residents with information on where to get help with meals,  				  bills, etc. A partnership with a community program provides homebound residents  				  with home repairs and emergency response systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Single Room Occupancy Hotels (SROs)</b> rent small private  				  rooms, usually in depressed downtown areas, to low-income individuals on a  				  weekly or monthly basis. Some space--like bathrooms, living rooms, and  				  kitchens--is typically shared. Urban renewal has eliminated many SROs; however,  				  several cities have tried to reverse this trend, converting run down hotels to  				  SROs with supportive services. <b>Project Alert, Los Angeles, CA</b>, receives  				  funding from the citys Department of Aging to provide older adults living  				  in SROs a wide range of services, including case management, information and  				  referral, transportation, meals programs, and medical screening. One SRO is  				  specifically designed to serve frail elderly with wheelchair accessible  				  bathrooms.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Publicly subsidized housing</b> refers to multi-unit rental  			 housing owned or subsidized by federal, state, or municipal governments.  			 Strategies for integrating services include:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Co-location</b> is a low-cost approach in which the housing  				  manager encourages local providers to locate health and/or supportive services  				  programs on or near the housing property. Often housing and services providers  				  recruit volunteers to fill some services gaps. Commonly co-located services  				  include meal sites under Title III of the Older Americans Act, senior centers,  				  or health and wellness programs. <b>Golden West Senior Residence, Boulder,  				  CO</b>, a 255-unit refinanced Section 202 property, provides space to a health  				  care agency for operation of a wellness center. The agency staffs the center  				  with a physical therapist and an exercise physiologist. Golden West also  				  partners with several other programs and volunteers to provide services such as  				  foot care, massage, hearing aid maintenance, and banking services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Service Coordination</b> entails a full or part-time staff  				  person employed by the housing manager or sponsor to help residents identify  				  and arrange for needed services, advocate on their behalf, and provide  				  educational programs. The service coordinator may formally assess service needs  				  or respond to resident identified needs on an ad hoc basis. Services may be  				  arranged by staff or directly by the resident. About 37 percent of Section 202  				  housing communities employ service coordinators.<sup><font><a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#note10">10</a></font></sup><b>National Church Residences (NCR),  				  Columbus, OH</b>, employs 154 service coordinators serving 194 of their Section  				  202 and LIHTC properties for seniors. Service coordinators typically conduct an  				  intake evaluation of residents requesting assistance; assess behavior,  				  functioning, and needs; develop a case management plan; and refer residents to  				  community agencies. NCR has also developed a quality assurance system to track  				  service coordinator performance. <b>Schwenkfeld Manor, Lansdale, PA</b>, is a  				  Section 202 housing community employing nurses as service coordinators. In  				  addition to traditional information and referral and case management, they  				  informally observe changes in resident status, provide health education, and  				  advise residents when they should call a doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Enriched Services and Formal Services Coordination</b> are  				  strategies offering residents formal assessment, case management, and a range  				  of personal care and supportive services provided by on-site staff and/or by a  				  service agency owned by or under contract to the housing provider. Although the  				  amount and intensity of services varies, 24-hour oversight, personal care,  				  medication management, home making, and transportation are likely to be  				  available. <b>Peter Sanborn Place, Reading, MA</b>, gives priority, with HUD  				  approval, to prospective residents with high levels of need. Frail residents  				  receive a comprehensive assessment, and a care plan is developed and monitored  				  on an on-going basis. Resources freed up from the refinance of a Section 202  				  loan were reinvested in building renovations and resident services. The  				  property operates its own home care agency, which provides case management,  				  personal care, medication monitoring, homemaker services, and transportation to  				  eligible residents and the surrounding community. Nursing care and  				  rehabilitation services are provided under contract by the Visiting Nurses  				  Association. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>NORC Service Programs</b> target naturally occurring  				  retirement communities (NORCs), defined as a geographic area, neighborhood, or  				  building originally populated by people of all ages, which has evolved over  				  time to contain a high proportion of older adults. In some NORCs, property  				  managers, residents, and community services providers have collaborated to  				  develop service programs to respond to the changing needs of elderly residents.  				  A key characteristic of a NORC service program is that it is available to all  				  NORC residents regardless of income, health, or functional status. <b>Vladeck  				  Cares/NORC Supportive Services Program, New York, NY</b>, serves seniors living  				  in Vladeck House, a public housing project with 27 buildings and 3,000  				  residents, 860 of who are elderly. Funded by the City, the state Department on  				  Aging, and private sources, the program provides preventative health and social  				  services, medical and health services, case management, mental health  				  counseling, and educational and cultural opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>State Supportive Housing Partnerships</b> involve a  				  collaboration between state housing agencies, subsidized housing properties,  				  and state aging and health agencies to expand services to state subsidized  				  housing residents, generally with the goal of reducing Medicaid costs by  				  delaying institutionalization. State designated providers are licensed to  				  deliver personal care and supportive services to residents. <b>The Marvin,  				  Norwalk, CT</b>, is a senior congregate housing community funded through the  				  LIHTC program and low-interest loans from the state. Residents have access to  				  supportive services through Connecticuts Congregate Housing for the Frail  				  Elderly program, including a daily meal, weekly housekeeping, and the  				  assistance of a resident service coordinator. On-site, 24-hour oversight, an  				  on-call nurse, health and wellness services, and emergency transportation are  				  also available. Residents pay a monthly congregate services fee based on their  				  income. Those who are eligible for assisted living services under the  				  states Medicaid waiver receive nursing and personal care assistance.  				  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Assisted Living as a Service Program</b> is a state strategy  				  to provide licensed assisted living as a package of services rather than as  				  facility-based care. In <b>Minnesota</b>, most assisted living services are  				  provided in facilities registered with the Department of Health as  				  housing with services establishments. These facilities offer, for a  				  fee, one or more regularly scheduled health-related services or two or more  				  regularly scheduled supportive services. If the property provides the services  				  directly, it must have the appropriate home care provider license from the  				  Department of Health. Otherwise, it must contract for services with a licensed  				  home care provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>A Campus Network Strategy</b> takes advantage of independent  				  senior housing and licensed assisted living on the same campus to provide low  				  and modest-income residents some of the benefits of a continuing care  				  retirement community. There is no entrance fee, and residents pay separately  				  for different levels of care. <b>Eaton Senior Programs (ESP), Lakewood, CO</b>,  				  operates Eaton Terrace Residence (ETR), a 162-unit subsidized senior housing  				  property funded through low-interest state bonds and an adjoining ALF (Eaton  				  Terrace II or ET II). ESP is able to leverage resources across both residential  				  properties. ET II has an assisted living license and a home care license, which  				  allows staff to provide services anywhere in the community. ETR residents may  				  purchase personal care, housekeeping, and medication monitoring services at  				  whatever level they need. Residents pay out-of-pocket, unless Medicaid covers  				  their costs. ESP also has created a care consultation team to  				  support resident needs, which includes a nurse, social workers, activities  				  coordinators, pastoral counselors, resident assistants, and other staff.  				  Although each property has staff that focuses specifically on their residents,  				  they are able to leverage expertise and resources across the team. Staff from  				  the assisted living property is also able to provide after hours emergency  				  response to ETR. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Integrated Housing, Health Care, and Supportive Services</b>  				  enable residents to age in place by offering access to medical, health, and  				  long-term care services. They involve a formal collaboration between one or  				  more affordable housing providers, neighborhood health care providers, and  				  aging services agencies. <b>Lifelong Medical Care, Oakland, CA</b>, anchors a  				  collaboration between a Section 202 property, a federally qualified health  				  center, and a Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) program to  				  provide an assisted living level of care. PACE is the federal/state certified  				  program that provides a full range of primary, acute, and long-term care  				  services to a nursing home eligible population under a capitation arrangement  				  with Medicare and Medicaid without special licensing. The health center serves  				  healthy and moderately disabled seniors, providing primary care, mental health  				  services, adult day care, podiatry, dental care, and other services. PACE  				  serves residents eligible for skilled nursing facilities with a full spectrum  				  of primary, acute, and long-term care services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Housing/Health Partnerships</b> are collaborations between  				  one or more health providers and low-income housing sponsors to increase the  				  supply of affordable housing. The potential exists for the two partners to  				  create programs providing residents access to medical and health-related  				  services. <b>Mercy Housings Strategic Health Partnerships</b> is an  				  initiative between Mercy Housing and seven Catholic health care systems to  				  increase the supply of affordable housing for low-income seniors and poor  				  families by leveraging health system resources. <b>The Sixty Plus Program,  				  Atlanta, GA</b>, run by Piedmont Hospital, partners with four affordable  				  housing properties to send a nurse to each weekly. Residents can schedule  				  appointments, and the nurse follows up with patients discharged from the  				  hospital.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="lesson" id="lesson">V. LESSONS FROM THE WORKSHOPS</a></h2>
<p>As part of the AHPS study, IFAS also convened four invitational  		workshops across the country. These workshops brought together 230 stakeholders  		from 14 states to examine the merits of, challenges to, and opportunities for  		the development of AHPS strategies. Participants represented housing, health  		care, and aging services providers; federal and state policy makers; investment  		bankers; insurers; and consumer advocates. The first workshop, targeting the  		Cleveland metropolitan area, was hosted by the A.M. McGregor Home. The other  		three, hosted by AAHSA state affiliates in California, Rhode Island, and  		Georgia, were organized to facilitate statewide and regional participation. The  		following summarizes lessons learned. </p>
<p><b><i>A more detailed report of the workshops can be found at </i></b><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports.shtml</a><b><i>  		and </i></b><a href="http://www.huduser.org">http://www.huduser.org</a>. </p>
<p><b><i>Do AHPS strategies work?</i></b> Although most workshop  		participants understood that the impact of AHPS programs had not been carefully  		evaluated, they noted several apparent strengths:</p>
<ul><li>AHPS programs are attractive to their residents. Vast majorities of  		  seniors want to stay at home, even as their health declines.</li>
<li>AHPS programs allow health professionals and aging services providers  		  to more efficiently target services because potential consumers are clustered.  		  </li>
<li>Co-location of services such as adult day care and health services,  		  particularly in larger housing communities, helps seniors with significant  		  disabilities, including dementia, stay in their apartments.</li>
<li>Exploiting economies of scale through bulk purchasing of services and  		  supplies, and/or coordinated scheduling of providers, might save residents and  		  providers money.</li>
<li>Since many communities already have a rich array of services,  		  purposefully linking residents to these services helps to meet needs at  		  marginal costs. </li>
<li>AHPS programs transfer much of the responsibility of caring for aging  		  residents from housing providers to community services agencies, which  		  typically have more capacity.</li>
</ul><p>However, some participants disagreed about the extent to which AHPS can  		or should support residents, regardless of their health condition or level of  		disability. Several housing providers believed all residents should be able to  		live out their lives in the property, maintaining that services comparable to a  		nursing home can be provided effectively. Others said maintaining residents  		with significant disabilities who may need access to services 24/7--especially  		those with significant cognitive and/or mental health problems--is not possible  		or even appropriate. By and large, most participants agreed that objectively  		evaluating and comparing the outcomes of alternative AHPS approaches for  		different populations was important. </p>
<p><b><i>What does an effective strategy look like?</i></b> No one strategy  		was endorsed as appropriate for all environments and all situations. Some  		participants said caregiving staff should be employees of the housing property.  		Others thought housing providers should not engage in direct service delivery,  		except for services coordination. Most agreed that a wide range of models could  		work, as long as they were anchored by a services coordination mechanism. Most  		participants thought the selection of specific AHPS strategies should grow out  		of the characteristics of the state regulatory environment, the housing  		providers capacity, and service availability in the surrounding  		community. Several also emphasized that AHPS models must be responsive to the  		changing characteristics of residents, such as the growing prevalence of  		cognitive impairments and mental health conditions. Participants noted that an  		increasing number of new residents were entering their housing communities with  		pre-existing disabilities. Some also said attention should be paid to the  		differences in the demand for and the availability of services in rural areas  		in developing new AHPS models.</p>
<p><b><i>Which services are critical?</i></b> Discussants emphasized the  		need for AHPS strategies to provide residents access to a full range of  		health-related and supportive services. They ranked transportation as highly  		important, but also noted the limited capacity of many housing communities to  		organize access to needed transportation. Much less agreement was expressed  		about the desirability of incorporating primary health care and chronic care  		management into an AHPS program. Some thought these services were too complex  		and risky for many housing providers and were only feasible in partnership with  		a PACE program. Others noted the growing experience with house  		calls type programs, where physicians and nurses offer primary care,  		preventative services, and chronic care management in a residents own  		apartment. Some espoused house calls programs as ideally suited to affordable  		housing arrangements with large numbers of seniors who live close to one  		another.</p>
<p><b><i>What are the prerequisites of a successful strategy?</i></b>  		Participants identified three fundamentals for AHPS strategies:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Informed housing providers who understand the need for  			 services</b>. Housing providers must see themselves as more than property  			 managers collecting rent and maintaining the physical plant. They must  			 understand their residents service needs, accept at least some  			 responsibility for meeting these needs, and ensure that service coordinators  			 and on-site managers share this understanding. In addition to employing a  			 service coordinator, many participants believed housing providers must be  			 prepared to make financial and human resource investments to fill gaps in the  			 communitys services system and be flexible enough to allow residents to  			 refuse services and make some bad choices. Learning how to support aging  			 residents to take risks was perceived to be essential to maintaining a truly  			 independent living environment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Persistence and creativity</b>. The workshops highlighted the  			 importance of leadership at the community level to bring housing and aging  			 services agencies together. Some participants pointed out that successful  			 organizations are proactive--seeking out community partners, networking with  			 policy and practice stakeholders, staying on top of new funding opportunities,  			 and working around policy and regulatory barriers. Participants emphasized the  			 importance of knowing how to work the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>A catalyst</b>. Some individual or organization must take  			 ownership of the goal, identify and convene stakeholders, facilitate  			 information gathering, mobilize resources, and coordinate on-going activities.  			 Many participants emphasized that without a catalyst, even well-intended and  			 widely supportive efforts to implement AHPS strategies are likely to  			 fail.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>What are the obstacles?</i></b> Participants noted a number of  		barriers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Licensing/regulation</b>. Licensing and regulation was identified  			 as an impediment to the ability of independent housing providers to support  			 residents aging in place. For example, Internal Revenue Service rulings  			 appear to limit the level of health and medical services that can be provided  			 in LIHTC properties. LIHTC properties also may not pay for health services with  			 rent proceeds. Some states prohibit independent housing providers from  			 providing direct services. In most states, Medicaid assisted living services  			 can only be provided to Medicaid recipients who live in a licensed facility.  			 Many housing providers at the workshops expressed strong opposition to becoming  			 licensed caregiving facilities to obtain services for residents. Participants  			 said licensing requirements often result in increased costs, forcing them to  			 rely on Medicaid, for which not all residents may be eligible. Participants  			 pointed to assisted living regulations as an example of what they wished to  			 avoid. Publicly reimbursed assisted living services were judged too rigid,  			 serving only a narrowly defined population, which is at odds with the mission  			 of affordable housing providers to serve healthy and frail residents. A number  			 of participants urged the Federal Government to review their regulations  			 governing Section 202, LIHTC, HUDs Assisted Living Conversion Program,  			 HUDs Service Coordinator Grant Program, and fair housing laws to identify  			 and remove regulatory obstacles to the development of AHPS programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Liability</b>. Some participants expressed concerns about how to  			 balance resident choice, including freedom to reject services, with their  			 perception that housing providers would be liable for poor choices that  			 compromised resident health or safety. Obtaining liability insurance was also  			 identified as a difficult hurdle to overcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fair housing laws</b>. Participants expressed a variety of  			 concerns regarding these laws. Some housing providers believed they should be  			 able to give move-in preference to frail and disabled seniors, a point of view  			 at odds with fair housing requirements, unless special HUD waivers are  			 obtained. Some providers also observed that fair housing laws have an  			 unintended effect on their ability to plan services, citing prohibitions  			 against asking prospective and current residents about their physical and  			 mental health status. Some participants also thought that fair housing rules  			 were unclear about the circumstance under which a tenant can be evicted,  			 particularly when the residents decision making is impaired through  			 Alzheimers disease or other cognitive impairments. Several attendees  			 suggested that HUD should clearly spell out the implications of fair housing  			 laws for AHPS. <b><i>See HUDs clarification of fair housing laws as they  			 apply to AHPS in the <a href="synthesis-findings-study-affordable-housing-plus-services-low-and-modest-income-older-adults.html#append">Appendix</a> at the end of this  			 document</i></b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Difficulty of bridging housing and aging services</b>.  			 Participants widely agreed that housing and aging services providers know  			 little about each others programs or policies. Several said the workshop  			 was the first time they had even been together in the same room. Some  			 participants observed that housing providers rarely participate in long-term  			 care policy forums and vice versa. According to many workshop attendees, both  			 the housing and aging services communities need to be educated about their  			 mutual interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Resources</b>. Finding funding was regarded as the major  			 challenge facing AHPS program development. Several participants indicated that  			 relying on a single funding source, such as the Section 202 program or  			 Medicaid, is shortsighted. In their view, future needs cannot be accommodated  			 without putting together a mix of funding, both to develop new housing  			 opportunities and to link them to needed services. Several pointed out that  			 AHPS strategies must be designed around resident needs rather than allowing a  			 particular funding source to determine who is served and how. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Limited understanding/capacity of certain housing providers to  			 meet resident services needs</b>. Housing representatives were more likely than  			 others to observe that a number of their colleagues saw their roles in very  			 traditional terms--leasing, collecting rents, and maintaining the physical  			 plant--rather than as architects of a housing environment that must adapt to  			 changing needs of increasingly frail residents. They said it is not unusual for  			 housing managers to interpret the term independent housing  			 literally--if a resident needs help, she must find it herself or move. Housing  			 providers may also lack sufficient knowledge about community resources and have  			 limited skills in developing partnerships with their community service  			 agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Resident opposition</b>. Several housing providers said residents  			 themselves sometimes oppose aging in place strategies. Many do not want to be  			 reminded that they may loose independence as they age. To overcome this  			 challenge, residents must be educated about and have sustained involvement in  			 planning AHPS programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Affordability</b>. Participants said AHPS programs must minimize  			 costs to residents, the housing sponsor, and public entities. Several  			 participants thought it was valuable to work with a home health agency or other  			 community provider to break down the amount of services that can be purchased  			 in short increments. In their view, residents do not always need, nor can they  			 afford, the two or four-hour blocks of time typically available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Nursing home influence</b>. Attendees had differing perspectives  			 on the role of nursing home providers in AHPS. Some thought they would oppose  			 AHPS strategies. Others thought nursing homes could be valuable partners,  			 particularly if the rules that governed their reimbursement rewarded them for  			 maintaining the sickest and most disabled patients.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Funding Opportunities.</i></b> The workshops clearly demonstrated  		that funding is a primary challenge in developing new AHPS programs. Having  		concluded that neither the Medicaid nor Section 202 programs were likely to be  		reliable future funding resources on their own, participants identified other  		ideas to expand access to resident services that include:</p>
<p><b>New Public Initiatives</b></p>
<ul><li>Creating a state tax credit or bond program to fund resident services  		  as well as affordable housing. </li>
<li>Developing health-related and supportive services savings  		  accounts where pretax contributions of housing providers and residents  		  could accumulate over time.</li>
</ul><p><b>Housing Provider Strategies</b></p>
<ul><li>Developing mixed-income properties where the costs of services for  		  lower-income residents are cross-subsidized by wealthier ones, as in nursing  		  homes.</li>
<li>Developing win-win partnerships between housing  		  communities and health care entities. These partnerships can enhance resident  		  access to primary care and chronic care management and increase referrals to  		  cooperating providers and improve their ability to monitor and manage the  		  residents care. </li>
</ul><p><b>Education and Marketing Opportunities</b></p>
<ul><li>Documenting and disseminating the probable return on  		  investment for housing providers if they contribute their own resources  		  to resident services.</li>
<li>Educating service coordinators on how to reduce services costs (e.g.,  		  capitalizing on economies of scale, working with community providers to deliver  		  services in smaller, more affordable increments, etc.).</li>
<li>Documenting the benefits of renting out commercial space for needed  		  resident services to housing communities.</li>
<li>Encouraging wider participation in the HUD-funded service coordinator  		  program.</li>
<li>Educating Section 202 housing providers about the potential of  		  refinancing old Section 202 loans to invest in services.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="next" id="next">VI. NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED BY WORKSHOP  		PARTICIPANTS</a></h2>
<p>The workshops brought together a variety of stakeholders from the fields  		of housing, health, and supportive services, some of whom were meeting together  		for the first time, to identify common interests and seek common ground. For  		that alone, most participants judged them a success. Several broad initiatives  		were proposed to move an AHPS agenda forward:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Resident and Family Education Programs</b>. Residents and their  			 families often are not aware of the services available in their community. As  			 one participant put it, many residents see services as a light switch, either  			 on or off. This participant thought the concept of a  			 dimmer switch was more appropriate, with residents and families  			 learning how to seek services as they are needed, rather than waiting for a  			 crisis. Some participants suggested AAHSA and its state affiliates, area  			 agencies on aging, AARP chapters, the Red Cross, local Alzheimers groups,  			 and other community agencies should develop outreach initiatives targeted at  			 subsidized housing residents and their families so they know about the  			 communitys service resources and how to use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Provider Education and Technical Assistance</b>. Participants  			 stressed the value of educating affordable housing providers about the service  			 needs of aging residents, available community resources and how to access them,  			 the characteristics of promising AHPS strategies and programs, and how to  			 overcome regulatory barriers that impede effective implementation. Some  			 participants suggested that AAHSA develop and operate a clearinghouse for its  			 members to provide such technical assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>National Awareness Campaign</b>. There was significant support  			 for raising the visibility of AHPS as a potential vehicle for meeting the  			 long-term care needs of at least some low and modest-income seniors.  			 Participants spoke of subsidized elderly housing residents as being off  			 the radar screen of advocates and policy officials seeking long-term care  			 solutions. Some observed that while funding has significantly grown for home  			 and community-based services over the past several decades, little is known  			 about the extent to which seniors in subsidized housing have benefited. One  			 suggestion was to move AHPS onto the agenda of the Conference of Mayors since  			 municipalities are now dealing with the problem of poor seniors who are unable  			 to maintain independent living. It was also noted that advocates for the  			 homeless have been very effective in educating government at all levels about  			 the importance of linking housing options with services to sustain independent  			 living. Affordable housing providers might consider developing a platform based  			 on a similar model for aging seniors in affordable housing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Replication of Workshops in Rural Areas</b>. All workshops were  			 held in urban areas, primarily for an urban or suburban audience. It was noted  			 by some participants that the characteristics of AHPS strategies that work in  			 rural communities may be different than those discussed. Holding one or more  			 workshops in rural areas was suggested, possibly in partnership with the U.S.  			 Department of Agriculture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Developing AHPS in Market Rate Housing</b>. The experience of  			 subsidized housing providers dominated the workshops. Participants were unable  			 to identify more than a handful of AHPS programs in privately financed housing  			 arrangements. Several workshop participants thought future work should be  			 directed at identifying and supporting housing cooperatives, mobile home parks,  			 neighborhood-based NORCs, and other market rate housing to develop AHPS  			 programs.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2><a name="agenda" id="agenda">VII. APPLIED RESEARCH AND EVALUATION AGENDA</a></h2>
<p>The information base on AHPS programs and their impact is extremely  		weak. Discussions with workshops participants, AAHSA members, and other housing  		and community services experts over the course of the study identified a  		variety of questions in need of answers before the widespread replication of  		AHPS programs is likely. For example:</p>
<ul><li>What proportion of senior residents living in affordable housing  		  arrangements want and need additional health and supportive services to  		  maintain independent living? What are the characteristics of these seniors?  		  What services do they need?</li>
<li>Do AHPS programs improve resident access to services over the  		  informal arrangements that now prevail and do they improve resident quality of  		  life and quality of care?</li>
<li>Are AHPS programs cost-effective from the perspective of housing  		  providers and public policy makers? Are they as or more effective and less  		  costly than ALFs for some residents? Do they reduce transfers to nursing homes?  		  Do they reduce the use of emergency health services and hospital stays?</li>
<li>What types of strategies and practices work best and under what  		  circumstances?</li>
<li>What regulatory and practice barriers impede widespread replication  		  of AHPS and how can they be overcome?</li>
</ul><h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">VIII. CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>In the eyes of the authors of this report, the study of AHPS underscores  		the potential value of AHPS strategies for meeting some of the long-term care  		needs of low and modest-income older adults. The study has shown us that  		committed individuals working at the community level are able to overcome  		fragmented funding and bureaucratic and policy resistance to implement AHPS  		programs in all parts of the country, often on a shoestring budget. However,  		before more systematic and widespread replication of AHPS is likely, the study  		highlights a number of issues for further consideration. First, greater numbers  		of affordable housing providers must be convinced of the benefits of supporting  		older residents who want to age in place rather than moving to a  		higher level of care. Second, the capacity of affordable housing providers to  		respond to resident services needs must be nurtured and strengthened--by  		matching them with other more experienced providers and developing and  		disseminating technical assistance tools. Third, AHPS models and practices must  		be documented and evaluated, showing how they work, under what conditions, and  		with what impact on residents, providers, and costs. Finally, governmental and  		private funders should be encouraged to support the evaluation of new AHPS  		models. </p>

<h2><a name="append" id="append">APPENDIX: HUDs Clarification of Fair Housing  		Laws as They Apply to AHPS Programs</a></h2>
<ol><li>
<p><b>If a provider is offering housing which also includes supportive  			 services, what kinds of questions can a provider ask prospective tenants about  			 their health or disability status?</b></p>
<p> Under the federal Fair Housing Act, it is generally unlawful for a  			 housing provider to: (1) ask if an applicant for a dwelling has a disability or  			 if a person intending to reside in a dwelling or anyone associated with an  			 applicant or resident has a disability, or (2) ask about the nature or severity  			 of such persons' disabilities. Housing providers may, however, make the  			 following inquiries, provided these inquiries are made of all applicants,  			 including those with and without disabilities:</p>
<ul><li> An inquiry into an applicants ability to meet the  				requirements of tenancy.</li>
<li> An inquiry to determine if an applicant is a current illegal  				abuser or addict of a controlled substance.</li>
<li> An inquiry to determine if an applicant qualifies for a dwelling  				legally available only to persons with a disability or to persons with a  				particular type of disability.</li>
<li>An inquiry to determine if an applicant qualifies for housing  				that is legally available on a priority basis to persons with disabilities or  				to persons with a particular disability.</li>
</ul><p> Courts have held that providers should not inquire as to whether a  			 prospective tenant can live independently, as that inquiry  			 encompasses information which may be unrelated to the eligibility requirements  			 for tenancy, and calls for inquiries into the nature and severity of a  			 persons disability. The inquiry should focus on eligibility for the unit  			 and the ability to meet the requirements of tenancy (i.e., maintenance of the  			 unit, payment of rent, etc.). </p>
<p> Nothing in the Act prohibits providers who offer services from  			 asking applicants interested in the services to demonstrate that they qualify  			 for those services. Housing providers making such inquiries should ask only for  			 the specific information they actually need to determine eligibility for the  			 services, rather than making broad sweeping inquiries about a persons  			 medical history. If the housing provider offers services for persons with  			 disabilities through contractors or other independent enteritis, then only the  			 service provider should be making the inquiries related to qualifying for the  			 services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In planning for the provision of supportive services, how should  			 a provider go about surveying residents needs?</b></p>
<p> Providers may ask tenants to participate in voluntary surveys about  			 services that they would like the provider to offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What criteria are needed for a provider to evict tenants whose  			 service needs can no longer be met?</b></p>
<p> It is lawful under the Fair Housing Act to refuse to rent or to  			 evict a person with a disability because he or she cannot meet the requirements  			 of the lease (which includes the ability to care for a dwelling apartment and  			 to pay rent). If a resident with a disability needs services that are not part  			 of the housing program to enable him or her to meet the requirements of the  			 lease, and the provider cannot meet those needs, then it would be the  			 residents responsibility to obtain those services if he or she wishes to  			 remain in the unit. </p>
<p> If a resident qualifies as a person with a disability under federal  			 civil rights laws including the Fair Housing Act and where applicable, Section  			 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, then the resident has the right to  			 request a reasonable accommodation to policies, practices, and procedures of  			 the housing provider. If a provider has a practice of limiting the kinds of  			 services that a resident may use while living in the unit, then the resident  			 with a disability may make a request for a reasonable accommodation that the  			 provider change that policy to allow him or her to obtain and pay for the  			 additional services that are needed. A housing provider must grant the request  			 unless doing so is an undue financial and administrative burden or a  			 fundamental alteration of the housing program. For a full discussion of the  			 Fair Housing Acts definition of person with disability and the right to  			 receive a reasonable accommodation, see, the Joint Statement of the Department  			 of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice: Reasonable  			 Accommodations under the Fair Housing Act, dated May 17, 2004. This joint  			 statement is available at <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/disabilities">http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/disabilities</a>  			 .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Once services are provided to prevent institutionalization of a  			 frail resident, do federal civil rights laws require the housing provider to  			 find subsequent services to maintain that resident in their own home?</b></p>
<p> The Fair Housing Act does not require housing providers to provide  			 requested accommodations that constitute fundamental alterations of their  			 programs. Thus, if a resident requested skilled care nursing services in their  			 home as a reasonable accommodation, and the provider only provided limited  			 services such as meals, then the provider would not be required to provide the  			 skilled care nursing services, because such a request would constitute a  			 fundamental alteration of the providers program. See Joint Statement of  			 the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice:  			 Reasonable Accommodations under the Fair Housing Act, dated May 17, 2004.  			 </p>
