</dl><h2><a name="overview" id="overview">OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<p>Expanding managed care coverage to individuals with disabilities is a  		relatively new phenomenon. While managed care poses great opportunities for  		people with disabilities in the way of more emphasis on preventative services,  		continuity of care and lower out of pocket payments resulting from the  		elimination of co-payments and deductibles, it poses risks as well. The  		economic incentives embedded in managed care may also result in more limited  		access to basic services, particularly the specialty care required by people  		with special health care needs, and it may result in unaffordable premiums as  		insurers attempt to compensate for expected higher costs of enrolling disabled  		persons. In addition, few managed care providers have the expertise necessary  		to treat people with significant disability. </p>
<p>In an era marked by rapidly growing health care expenditures, the public  		and private sectors are increasingly looking toward managed health care systems  		to control health care costs and improve access to a coordinated continuum of  		services. The reason for this interest is clear, people with disabilities  		constitute a disproportionate share of the overall health care expenditures,  		and until payers can contain the costs and more effectively manage the care of  		people with disabilities, savings in overall health care expenditures will be  		difficult to realize. Yet designing managed care systems for the disabled has  		proven to be extremely difficult to achieve, mostly because there is a great  		deal of variation between the needs of people with disabilities, and unclearly  		defined clinical practice standards of care. Designing cost-effective,  		outcomes-oriented, and consumer-sensitive managed care systems for people with  		disabilities continues to be extremely challenging for both the private and  		public health care sectors. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, at present the U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services and the private sector has little information on the experience of  		disabled populations in the traditional health care system and virtually none  		on what happens to these populations when they are enrolled in managed care  		plans. The absence of accurate and reliable data in this area makes it  		increasingly difficult to determine if managed care has a significant potential  		to improve quality health care services while containing costs, or if managed  		care will limit access to specialty providers and services important for people  		with disabilities. </p>
<p>In an effort to better understand the impact of managed care on disabled  		populations, staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation's (ASPE) Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Tenn Care Policy  		(DALTCP) and the Office of Health Policy (HP), in collaboration with HCFA, have  		developed a series of research and evaluation efforts focused on managed care  		and people with disabilities. This research plan includes a variety of projects  		to promote knowledge on the experiences of disabled populations in managed care  		in public health care systems such as Medicaid and Medicare, as well as in  		employer-based and self-insured plans. Research projects include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Conducting statewide Medicaid managed care demonstration evaluations  			 collaboratively with staff from HCFA's Office of State Health Demonstrations so  			 that they include an analysis of impacts on persons with disabilities who  			 receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documenting the experiences and effects of managed care for disabled  			 populations who are privately insured through large employer insurance plans.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding grant awards which use disability-relevant data to examine  			 effects of enrolling people with disabilities into managed care systems.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying public and private managed care sites that serve  			 children with disabilities and conducting descriptive analyses and site visits  			 in order to identify barriers to integrating acute and long-term care services  			 for children with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examining the health and long-term care expenditure patterns of  			 children with disabilities using Medicaid tape-to-tape data in four states as  			 well as private employer data. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying innovative public and private managed care plans serving  			 working aged adults with disabilities (ages 18-65) and conducting site visits  			 in an effort to develop a guidebook to aid states in developing more  			 accountable and efficient managed care systems serving people with  			 disabilities. This project includes a focus on both public (Medicare, Medicaid)  			 and private managed care systems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convening a national conference on managed care for people with  			 disabilities to synthesize and share research results, disseminate best  			 practices information, and stimulate thinking on the future potential for  			 managed care plans which serve disabled populations. This conference will  			 include research from both public and private health delivery systems which  			 serve people with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying public and private managed care sites that have  			 developed interdisciplinary education and training programs for professionals  			 caring for persons with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying and describing particular settings where professionals  			 and students in the health care and human service professions receive  			 interdisciplinary instruction and practicuum experience in the provision of  			 health care to people with disabilities across a continuum of care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conducting a three-year Disability Supplement to the Health  			 Interview Survey to provide detailed information on the prevalence and  			 characteristics of children, working-age adults, and elderly Americans with  			 disabilities; what type of health care plans they belong to, their perceived  			 health status, their use of non-medical services, including frequency of use,  			 who pays for these services, and out-of-pocket costs. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>These proposed research projects will contribute information on issues  		of access, quality, cost, and outcomes for disabled populations within managed  		care systems to assist decision-makers, administrators, and providers in  		developing thoughtful and appropriate policies. Moreover, improvements in our  		knowledge base regarding the experiences of disabled populations enrolled in  		managed care may facilitate more prudent and informed decisions on the part of  		purchasers and consumers. Furthermore, by providing reliable condition-specific  		utilization and cost data on people with disabilities, it may be possible to  		promote more efficient rate-setting, reinsurance and risk adjustment strategies  		for various disabled populations. The following materials provide a more  		detailed description of the ongoing project. </p>
<h2><a name="project1" id="project1">ISSUE PAPER AND EXPERT MEETING ON MANAGED CARE FOR  		PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b>: Andreas Frank </p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: This issue paper highlights policy-relevant research on  		managed care plans serving people with disabilities in an attempt to outline  		research areas in DALTCP's 1995 research agenda on managed care. This paper was  		intended to stimulate discussion and feedback from experts which participated  		in DALTCP's meeting on managed care and people with disabilities. The paper  		provides a brief overview of existing research, summarizes policy issues of  		importance to the Department, and suggests research priorities for the future.  		Issues addressed in the paper include functional and demographic  		characteristics of people with disabilities in managed care systems; impact  		issues including consumer satisfaction, quality of care, accessibility, range  		of services, targeting issues; financing and reimbursement issues and quality  		assurance and monitoring issues. </p>
<p><b>RESULTS</b>: This paper was presented at the second research agenda  		meeting, in December, 1995. Experts in the field discussed the research  		presented in the paper, and recommended areas of potential research and data  		collection. A summary of the meeting, and the experts' recommendations are  		available. </p>

<h2><a name="project2" id="project2">NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGED CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH  		DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b>: Mimi Bernardin, MedStat Group</p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The goal of the national conference is to bring together  		researchers, policy makers, providers, and consumer representatives to examine  		the available empirical evidence regarding the impact on people with  		disabilities of Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans as well as managed  		care in the private sector. The conference would be organized along four broad  		themes: </p>
<ul><li>The service needs of people with disabilities and how well these  		  needs are met in the current health care system. </li>
<li>How people with significant disabilities actually fare vis-a-vis  		  cost, quality, and access in different types of managed care arrangements (e.g.  		  HMO's, PPO's, point of service plans, plans which integrate acute and long term  		  care services) and how their experience in managed care compares with what  		  would otherwise occur in the fee for service system. </li>
<li>The strengths and weaknesses of methods available to providers for  		  incorporating people with disabilities into managed care plans. </li>
<li>Methodologies for measuring the outcomes of managed care for disabled  		  populations. </li>
</ul><p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>: A steering committee comprised of key  		governmental individuals will meet in February, 1996 to formalize the agenda,  		the invited guest speakers, the commissioned papers, and the date of the  		conference. A report of their meeting will be available in late February, 1996;  		a report of the conference will be available in Fall, 1996. </p>

<h2><a name="project4" id="project4">INNOVATIVE MANAGED CARE PLANS SERVING PEOPLE WITH  		DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b>: Sally Bachman, MedStat </p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: In spite of the rising level of interest by public and  		private payers in expanding managed care enrollment to include people with  		disabilities, there are few systematic data available about plans that  		successfully serve individuals with complex health care needs. The purpose of  		this project is to gather qualitative data about public and private managed  		care plans that provide efficient yet clinically appropriate care to working  		age adults with disabilities. Data will be gathered through site visits to  		approximately six plans and telephone interviews with another ten plans.  		Research questions will focus on consumer participation, provider training and  		recruitment, quality of care, risk adjustment and risk sharing arrangements,  		service delivery models, disease specific practice guidelines, and outcome  		measurement. </p>
<p><b>PROGRESS TO DATE</b>: All site visits will be completed by February,  		1996. To date, over 15 plans have been contacted. Sites to be visited include:  		Health Alliance, Intermountain Health Care, Group Health of Puget Sound,  		Community Medical Alliance, Arizona's Physician IPA, and others. Sites on which  		information has been collected on include: Fallon Community Health Plan, FHP,  		Harvard Community Health Plan, Kaiser Permanente - Colorado, MCARE, Pacificare,  		United HealthCare Corporation, and others. A written report will be available  		in April, 1996 and will be presented at the National Conference planned in  		September, 1996. </p>

<h2><a name="project10" id="project10">DISABILITY SUPPLEMENT TO THE NHIS SURVEY</a></h2>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: DALTCP has a longstanding commitment to improving basic  		data on disability, aging and long-term care. Typically, ASPE works with other  		DHHS agencies to augment planned or existing surveys; in particular ASPE's  		staff expertise and funding are used to (a) fill gaps in planned data  		collection activities, (b) make sure that surveys contain policy relevant  		questions (c) make sure that samples are of sufficient size to represent small  		but policy-significant populations (e.g. mentally retarded and developmentally  		disabled persons) and (d) help set priorities for data analysis. </p>
<p>One of the most significant activities currently underway is the  		<b>Disability Survey</b> conducted from 1994 through 1996. Among multiple  		agencies, DALTCP staff worked to coordinate plan, develop, coordinate, and  		identify sources of support for the Disability Survey. For the first time ever,  		the resulting analyses will provide detailed information on the prevalence and  		characteristics of children, working-age adults, and elderly Americans with  		disabilities; how they live, work, and go to school; health care utilization,  		income, assets, participation in Federal programs, health insurance; and non-  		medical services, including frequency of use, who pays for these services, and  		out-of-pocket costs. </p>

<h2><a name="project11" id="project11">HEALTH AND LONG-TERM CARE EXPENDITURE PATTERNS OF  		CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b>: Bill Crown, SysteMetrics </p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: Because childhood disability is relatively rare, most  		surveys and data sets have relatively little information on the number of  		children with disabilities, their service use and expenditures. This project  		examines two very large claims data sets which are likely to contain a  		significant number of children with disabilities. The first of these comes from  		the Medicaid Tape-to Tape Project, and contains claims and enrollment data for  		every child covered by Medicaid in 1992 in selected States. The second comes  		from the MEDSTAT Market Scan data, and contains claims information from  		numerous employer-based private health insurance plans throughout the U.S. </p>
<p>Using diagnosis codes and other criteria, an attempt will be made to  		identify all children in the data set with severe disabilities. Data on the  		amounts and types of services that they use will be tabulated. Every child who  		receives Medicaid services will be included in the study, not just those who  		receive Medicaid coverage through SSI. This project builds upon a previous ASPE  		study which focused on children who were either high cost or who received  		Medicaid through SSI. </p>

<h2><a name="project12" id="project12">COMPARATIVE OUTCOMES AND PROCESSES OF PREPAID  		MANAGED CARE FOR HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS</a></h2>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b>: Richard Kronick, University of California  		at San Diego </p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The purpose of this study is to learn more about the  		effects of managed care on persons with disabilities. Specifically, this study  		will add new information in five areas: 1) In what ways, if any, do providers  		reorganize the delivery of care to persons with disabilities under managed  		care? 2) When given a choice between capitated HMOs and providers paid under  		fee-for-service reimbursement, what subsets of people with disabilities are  		attracted to HMOs? 3) What are the effects of managed care on health care  		utilization and on health expenditures for persons with disabilities? 4) What  		are the effects of managed care on health outcomes and patient satisfaction? 5)  		What conditions, health care consumption patterns, or other indicators are  		particularly good markers of sever disability in working age adults and  		children? How can this information be used to construct reimbursement systems  		that encourage health plans to serve severely impaired subsets of persons with  		disabilities? </p>
<p>The study will conduct this research in four widely different settings:  		1) The Community Medical Alliance, a health plan in Massachusetts that was  		created to develop specialized delivery systems for a small number of Medicaid  		eligibles with end-stage AIDS and with severe physical disabilities, 2) Detroit  		and surrounding areas in Michigan, where over 30,000 SSI recipients are  		receiving care in full at-risk HMOs and another 90,000 SSI recipients are  		receiving care in a primary care case management model, 3) Health plans in  		Columbus and in Cleveland that are centered around academic health centers, and  		4) a health plan in central Missouri that is attempting to develop delivery  		systems that serve the needs of persons with disabilities in a rural setting.  		</p>

<h2><a name="project13" id="project13">PRIVATE PAYORS SERVING DISABLED INDIVIDUALS AND  		RESEARCH SYNTHESIS ON MANAGED CARE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b>: Brian Burwell, MedStat Group </p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: In spite of the rising level of interest by public and  		private payers in expanding managed care enrollment to include people with  		disabilities, there are few data available about the experience of people with  		disabilities in either public or private managed care plans. The proposed  		research project will focus on two areas: 1) an evaluation of employer-based  		managed care plans for people with disabilities and 2) a synthesis of policy  		relevant research results produced by other investigators about the impact of  		managed care on people with disabilities. </p>
<p>The employer-based study will address policy issues in five major areas.  		The first issue that will be addressed is how to develop a methodology to  		identify people with disabilities in databases constructed from private  		insurance claims. Second, cost and utilization analyses will be conducted to  		determine the health care utilization patterns, and care coordination of people  		with disabilities in private health care plans. Third, cost data will be  		analyzed to examine the impact managed care has on total health care costs and  		various components of these costs for people with disabilities. Fourth,  		risk-adjustment methologies of private payers will be examined in an attempt to  		learn more about how employers set rates with managed care plans, and how plans  		respond to various risk adjustment methodologies. Finally, the employer-based  		study will examine policy issues related to the functional status of people  		with disabilities serves in managed care plans (i.e. what functional data do  		employers collect? how do employers use this data to set rates? what types of  		outcome data do employers collect about persons with disabilities?, etc.) </p>
<p>In addition to the employer-based study, this project will attempt to  		synthesize ASPE-wide research related to managed care and people with  		disabilities with other privately and publically sponsored research related to  		managed care and people with disabilities. This synthesis will address some of  		the following questions: How does participation in managed care plans for  		people with disabilities vary by payment source, disability group or geographic  		area? Are the healthcare needs of people with disabilities being met through  		managed care arrangements? What are financing arrangements that are most likely  		to lead to both consumer satisfaciton and appropriate care management in  		managed care plans? </p>
