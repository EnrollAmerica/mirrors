<h2><a name="supply" id="supply">I. SUPPLY, DEMAND AND FINANCING ISSUES</a></h2>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>The Office of Social Services Policy (SSP) has undertaken a number of  		related projects to model the demand for and financing of long-term care. The  		initial work, the ICF, Inc. study, <b>Private Financing of Long-Term Care</b>,  		prompted the Brookings Institution to work with ICF, Inc. to develop the  		Brookings-ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model. This model is used to predict the  		effects of various financing and organizational reform options on future  		utilization and public and private expenditures for nursing home and home  		care.</p>
<p>The Brookings-ICF model was undergoing final testing when Secretary  		Bowen began his study of Catastrophic Illness Expenses which included a  		sub-study on private long-term care financing. SSP contracted with Brookings to  		use the model to estimate participation and expenditures under a series of  		private long-term care insurance and individual Medical Account proposals. (See  		below: <b>Modeling the Effects of Private Financing Options on Public and  		Private Expenditures</b>.) </p>
<p>After conducting several special studies of the models treatment  		of key variables (described below, <b>Financing of Long-Term Care</b>), ASPE  		made a decision to bring it in house. A contract was let in September 1988 to  		acquire the Brookings-ICF model, update it, train HHS personnel in its use, and  		provide technical assistance (<b>Long-Term Care Microsimulation Model</b>).  		While reports have been completed for all of the above projects, readers should  		note that the long-term model is undergoing substantial change as more current  		data bases are added. The results from these original studies are now being  		updated.</p>
<p>Three additional studies of demand and financing are now underway. The  		first will convene an expert panel to assist in specifying public and private  		long-term care financing reforms, which will then become the basis for new  		simulations (<b>Analysis of Long-Term Care Financing Options</b>). The second  		is a grant to Brookings (<b>Premium Pricing of Prototype Private Long-Term Care  		Insurance Policies</b>) to develop prototype long-term care insurance policies,  		and estimate premium prices for them. The third study is an independent look at  		the future demand for long-term care under a series of dynamic assumptions  		(<b>The Future of Long-Term Care: Projections and Challenges</b>).<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two related projects are being considered for 1989. The first is a  		seminar on long-term care supply to develop methods for projecting supply. The  		second will provide an economic analysis of the market for home care  		workers.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Private Financing of Long-Term Care:  		Current Methods and Resources, Phase I and Phase II</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  David Kennell, Lewin/ICF,  		Inc., Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This early work identified private long-term  		care financing strategies, barriers to their growth and the potential effects  		of reducing barriers. It also developed a long-term care financing model to  		estimate the impact of private long-term care insurance on government long-term  		care costs. The study describes various types of pooled financing arrangements  		including long-term care insurance, prepaid health plans and life care centers,  		and identifies some untested alternatives e.g., single premium annuity,  		combination life/LTC insurance, IRA and pension benefit options. The study also  		estimates how many elderly people might be able to afford long-term care  		insurance.</p>
<p><i>Note</i>: The findings from this study are out of date. It is  		discussed here because it provided the initial conceptual work behind much of  		the later research.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</i>:     Joshua  		Wiener, The Brookings Institution, Washington, DC  		     David Kennell, Lewin/ICF, Inc., Washington,  		DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study was undertaken in support of the  		Secretarys Technical Work Group on Private Financing of Long-Term Care  		for the Elderly. It employed the Brookings-ICF Long-Term Care Model to estimate  		the effects of private insurance and tax-sheltered savings for long-term care  		on private out-of-pocket and Medicaid expenditures (both Federal and State).  		Some of the results are reported in <b>Report to the Secretary on Private  		Financing of Long-Term Care for the Elderly, <i>Technical Work Group on Private  		Financing of Long-Term Care for the Elderly, November 1986</i></b> [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/pfltce.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/pfltce.htm</a>].  		The analyses indicated that private long-term care insurance was likely to  		attract far more participation than tax sheltered savings vehicles such as  		individual Medical Accounts. The analyses also suggested that broad market  		penetration of private long-term care insurance can most quickly be achieved by  		providing some tax incentives.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Financing of Long-Term Care</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  David Kennell, Lewin/ICF,  		Inc., Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The analyses carried out for the  		Secretarys study of private long-term care financing raised several  		questions about the validity of the long-term care model estimates and  		forecasts, and identified issues in need of future research. In this project,  		four tasks were undertaken:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Analysis of the Causes of Nursing Home Admission</i>. Using the  			 1982-84 National Long-Term Care Survey, eight statistically significant  			 predictors of nursing home admission were identified: age, race, a prior  			 nursing home stay, level of disability, use of paid home care, living  			 situation, mental capability, and a rating of self health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Analysis of the Correlation Between Nursing Home Entrance and  			 Income</i>. The long-term care model did not vary the probability of nursing  			 home admission by income. This analysis explored the relationship between  			 income and nursing home admission. The analysis found the income of nursing  			 home entrants is lower than all elderly but that controlling for age, sex,  			 marital status and employment earnings eliminates most of the  			 differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Analysis of Spend-down of Assets to Medicaid Eligibility</i>.  			 This analysis explored the effect of the models assumptions about asset  			 transfers on Medicaid expenditures. It will be redone using the updated  			 model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Model Simulations</i>. Simulations were conducted to investigate  			 the effects of current long-term care proposals and to test the sensitivity of  			 results to various assumptions about the rate of inflation and disability in  			 the future. This work will be revised once the model has been updated.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Long-Term Care Microsimulation  		Model</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  David Kennell, Lewin/ICF,  		Inc., Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The Brookings-ICF Long-Term Care Model has  		been recently acquired by SPE and will be used to simulate the utilization and  		financing of nursing home and home care by elderly persons for the period 1986  		to 2020. It is being updated to include the results of the 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Survey and the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey. This project  		acquires the model; rewrites the code to make it useable by a variety of users  		in the Department; adapts it for HHS computers; and benchmarks it to permit  		checking on the accuracy of subsequent uses.</p>
<p>The long-term care model is based on the PRISM model developed by ICF,  		Inc. with the addition of a disability module developed by Brookings and ICF,  		Inc.. It begins with a nationally-representative sample of the adult population  		with a record for each persons age, sex, income, assets, and other  		characteristics. The model also simulates changes in the population each year,  		including changes in each individuals age, economic status, disability  		status, utilization of long-term care, and method of paying for care.</p>
<p>It generates a base case projection which assumes that current public  		programs and private financing remain unchanged. It also simulates changes in  		financing methods. These simulations are greatly affected by the choice of  		assumptions about the economy and individual behavior. The model can produce  		estimates using alternative assumptions to show how sensitive the results are  		to the ones chosen.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Bob Applebaum, Miami  		University of Ohio, Scripps Gerontology Center, Oxford, OH</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study is designed to provide  		comprehensive information about future long-term care needs in the United  		States. Using data from the U.S. Decennial Census of Population and Housing,  		National Long-Term Care Survey and National Nursing Home Survey, the study will  		develop detailed projections of the need for long-term care among the elderly  		in the years 2000, 2020, and 2040. Estimates of long-term care needs have  		traditionally relied on static models which assume that mortality and morbidity  		rates will remain constant over the projection period. This study will employ a  		dynamic projection model. Three different sets of projections will be estimated  		based on varying assumptions about changes in life expectancy and rates of  		impairment.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Pamela Doty, ASPE, Washington,  		DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This ongoing research involves tracking  		developments in long-term care financing and delivery in other countries. The  		current focus is on lessons to be learned from the recent implementation of  		Israels new long-term care insurance law. Past research has focused on  		comparative cross-national institutionalization rates, the balance of medical  		to non-medical comparative cross-national institutionalization rates, the  		balance of medical to non-medical long-term care institutional use,  		effectiveness of funding home and community-based care to prevent or postpone  		institutionalization, relative reliance on public versus private financing and  		differences in public financing mechanisms. A paper on comparative financing  		methods was presented at a Brookings Institution conference in May 1988 and a  		general overview of long-term care in international perspective, highlighting  		comparative institutionalization rates, will be forthcoming in the Health Care  		Financing Review 1988 Supplement.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Projects in this area reflect a continuing emphasis on basic and  		descriptive research to understand the characteristics and service use patterns  		of the long-term care population and to develop predictors of service use  		(<b>Long-Term Care Service Use: Longitudinal &amp; Predictive Models</b>;  		<b>Characteristics of the Elderly Long-Term Care Population and Its Service  		Use</b>; and <b>Risk of Institutionalization Comparison 1977 to 1985</b>.) The  		Division has also devoted considerable attention the effects of Medicares  		Prospective Payment System on the service use of impaired older persons. (See  		<b>Effects of Medicares Prospective Payment System on Medicare  		Beneficiaries</b> described below; and <b>A Pilot Study of the Adequacy of  		Post-Hospital Community Care for the Elderly</b> in <a href="#home">Section  		III</a>, Quality of Care.)</p>
<p>Also of interest are several policy issues about how the economic  		characteristics of people who receive long-term care affect service use and  		well being. For example, the effects of Medicaid eligibility requirements on  		spousal impoverishment and Medicaid spend-down have received attention (<b>The  		Effects of Medicaid Nursing Home Policies on Surviving Spouses in the  		Community</b>; <b>The Use, Cost, and Economic Burden of Nursing Home Care in  		1985</b>; <b>Medicaid Spend-Down and Long-Term Care: How High the Risk?</b> and  		<b>An Analysis of Spend Down Dynamics in Nursing Homes</b>.) The Division  		sponsored a meeting of many of the people working on Medicaid spend-down  		studies for HHS, and further efforts are planned to coordinate related  		projects, and to discover the reasons for contradictory findings.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The purpose of this study was to determine  		how PPS has affected the patterns of care received by Medicare beneficiaries  		with chronic disabling conditions. The study used the 1982-1984 National  		Long-Term Care Survey to provide an empirical analysis of differences in the  		utilization patterns of hospital, skilled nursing facility and home health  		services under Medicare, before and after the implementation of PPS. Findings  		indicate that there were overall reductions in hospital lengths of stay after  		PPS, although the reductions were not uniform and appeared to be concentrated  		in subgroups of the disabled population. Importantly, the most disabled  		subgroup showed no change in length of stay. Virtually no changes were observed  		in post-PPS Medicare SNF use although one would have hypothesized an increase.  		There was an overall increase in post-PPS home health utilization. No  		differences were observed in overall readmission or mortality rates pre- and  		post-PPS.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>The Effects of Medicaid Nursing Home  		Policies on Surviving Spouses in the Community</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Korbin Liu, Urban Institute,  		Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The structure of the Medicaid program  		permits a wide variation among States in how eligibility for nursing homes is  		established. The consequence is that in some States relatively wealthy spouses  		of nursing home residents provide no financial support for nursing home costs,  		while in other cases, the spouse who remains in the community is literally  		impoverished. Although the Medicare Catastrophic Act of 1988 liberalized the  		amount of family income available to the non-institutionalized spouse, States  		have retained the flexibility to set the amount between an upper-bound ($1,600  		month) and lower-bound (pegged to a percentage of the Federal poverty level for  		a 2-person household).</p>
<p>This study used the National Long-Term Care Survey to provide estimates  		of persons who would be affected by the different policy options to reduce the  		incidence of spousal impoverishment due to nursing home use. Using the weighted  		estimates of disabled and non-disabled sample members who were in a married  		status in the 1982 survey and subsequently reflected as institutionalized in  		the 1984 survey, the conclusion was reached that 79,000 persons per year could  		be affected by spousal impoverishment policies because they were in a married  		status in 1982 and subsequently entered nursing homes for long-term care.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Tom Rice, University of North  		Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study uses the 1985 National Nursing  		Home Survey to examine the use and cost of nursing home care among the elderly  		population of the United States. The following questions are addressed: How  		many persons aged 65 and older use nursing homes in a given year? How long do  		they stay and what are their annual charges? How often, and, to what extent, do  		residents spend down to Medicaid? How much of the annual charges  		are paid by the various payers; in particular, what are annual out-of-pocket  		costs?</p>
<p>The study found that approximately 2.1 million persons aged 65 and older  		(7.5% of the U.S. elderly population) spent some time in a nursing home during  		1985. Over 70% were women and nearly two-thirds were single, widowed or  		divorced women. Mean charges per nursing home user in 1985 were $9,600 and  		median charges were $7,700. About 53% of 1985 nursing home costs were paid  		privately, out-of-pocket, 35% by Medicaid, 8% by Medicare, and 4.0% by other  		sources. About 22% of nursing home residents who initially entered nursing  		homes as private pay patients became eligible for Medicaid during their  		stay.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>The major research project of the Division in the area was the National  		Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration co-sponsored with the Health Care  		Financing Administration and the Administration on Aging. This multi-year, 10  		State randomized experiment was designed to test the cost-effectiveness of  		comprehensive case management and home care. The 25 reports from the  		demonstration contain a great deal of information on the provision of home and  		community-based services, and the data base should be a rich source for further  		research for years to come. The final report on Channeling and the public use  		tapes were published in 1986 (<b>National Long-Term Care Channeling  		Demonstration</b>). A recent project which uses the Channeling datais  		<b>Reducing Nursing Home Utilization Costs Through Community-Based Long-Term  		Care: An Optimalization Analysis Using Data from the National Channeling  		Demonstration</b>. Other Division studies in this area include: a comparison of  		the structure of community-based care systems across States; an analysis the  		role of informal care giving in the long-term care system; and a synthesis of  		community-based care research and its implications for public policy. Future  		work will examine board and care issues and the delivery of personal care  		services under Medicaid.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>National Long-Term Care Channeling  		Demonstration</i></b></p>
<p><i>PROJECT DIRECTOR</i>:  George Carcagno, Mathematica Policy  		Research, Princeton, NJ</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The National Long-Term Care Channeling  		Demonstration was designed as a rigorous test of comprehensive case management  		of community care as a way of containing long-term care costs while providing  		adequate care to those in need. A randomized experimental design was employed  		to evaluate the demonstration. Two models of Channeling were tested: (a) Basic  		Case Management Model (five sites) and (b) Financial Control Model (five  		sites). Channeling enrolled an extremely frail elderly group whose average age  		was 80 years. The intervention was implemented largely according to plan.  		Channeling increased formal community service use. It had no significant effect  		on nursing home use, increased client confidence in receipt of care and  		increased life satisfaction. Neither model had a major effect on the proportion  		of informal caregivers giving care; however, Channeling increased informal  		caregivers satisfaction with service arrangements and satisfaction with  		life. Overall, the evidence indicates that the expansion of case management and  		community services beyond what exists does not lead to cost savings. It does  		yield benefits in the form of increased home care, reduced unmet need and  		greater life satisfaction for clients and their informal caregivers who bear  		most of the care burden.</p>
<p>The results of the Channeling demonstration are summarized in a special  		issue of the <b>Health Services Research Journal</b> (HSRJ), published in April  		1988 [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/hsres.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/hsres.htm</a>]</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  A generally consistent finding of  		community-based long-term care demonstration, including Channeling, is that  		these programs do not lead to net reductions in long-term care expenditures.  		Even though reducing nursing home costs was a goal of these demonstrations,  		none involved systematic managerial and resource allocation strategies  		specifically designed to reach this goal. Rather, resource allocation decisions  		were left largely to the professional judgment of case managers. This study  		will address whether long-term care resources can in fact be allocated  		strategically among clients to reduce nursing home use and costs. It will make  		use of the techniques of econometrics and mathematical optimization to address  		this question, using data from the Channeling demonstration.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Sustaining Family Caregiving of the  		Elderly: Housing, Family Support, and the Demand for Institutional  		Care</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</i>:  Sandra Newmand and Raymond  		Struyk, The Urban Institute, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The study explored whether type of housing,  		presence or absence of relatives, and availability of informally or formally  		provided long-term care services reduce the risk of institutionalization among  		the impaired elderly, and the nature of the relationship between support and  		risk. The principal data source was the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey  		(NLTCS), supplemented with data on whether or not the respondent had entered a  		nursing home between 1982 and 1984 from the 1984 NLTCS, and with data from the  		National American Housing Survey.</p>
<p>The results of the study are reported in Urban Institute Report No.  		3533, Overwhelming Odds: Caregiving and the Risk of  		Institutionalization, [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/ovrwhles.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/ovrwhles.htm</a>]  		by Sandra Newman, Michelle Rice, and Raymond Struyk, June 1987. In general, the  		analyses do not find any relationship between type of housing and risk of  		institutionalization. They also do not find any relationship between presence  		of relatives and risk of institutionalization. The analyses fail to confirm the  		notion that informal support and formal support play important roles as  		predictors of institutional risk. The same investigators are continuing the  		research using the 1984 Long-Term Care Survey, under a grant from the National  		Institutes on Aging.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Baila Miller, University of  		Illinois, Chicago, IL</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This project differentiates three major  		dimensions of informal caregiver burden: personal burden (worsening health,  		costs of care), relational burden (elder forgets things, embarrasses  		caregiver), and time burden (limitations on work of other activities,  		elders need for constant attention). Using data from the community and  		caregiver components of the 1982 and 1984 National Long-term Care Survey, the  		study will measure the association between caregiver burden on the various  		dimensions as reported in 1982 and outcomes such as institutionalization,  		hospital use, and changes in caregivers as reported in 1984.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>The rapid growth of home care services, both medically-oriented home  		health care and social service oriented supportive care for the chronically ill  		and disabled, has raised questions about whether the quality of such care is  		being adequately monitored and safequarded. Quality concerns with regard to  		Medicare financed home health care arose principally from allegations that  		hospital payment reform had resulted in patients being sent home from the  		hospital quicker and sicker. Critics charged that home health  		agencies could not adequately serve patients with heavier care needs than  		previous clientele and that a certain percentage of hospital discharges to home  		health care were inappropriate or premature. The Division initiated a joint  		study with HCFA to develop and test guidelines for measuring minimally adequate  		post-hospital care in the community (<b>A Pilot Study of the Adequacy of  		Post-Hospital Community Care</b>). To address broader issues of defining  		quality and developing outcome measures and structural and process  		indicators of quality in home care services for chronically disabled and for  		post-acute care populations, the Division sponsored a <b>National Conference on  		Home Care Quality: Issues and Accountability</b> (described below). In  		addition, a study of State activity in improving home care quality has recently  		been completed (<b>Review of State Quality Assurance Programs for Home  		Care</b>.)</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>A Pilot Study of the Adequacy of  		Post-Hospital Community Care for the Elderly</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Barbara Phillips, Mathematica  		Policy Research, Princeton, NJ</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  One prominent response of hospitals to the  		necessity of controlling costs under the Medicares Prospective Payment System  		(PPS) has been a reduction in hospital lengths of stay. Patients appear to be  		sicker when they are discharged now than was the case prior to PPS. Sicker  		patients probably require more health and personal care services upon  		discharge.</p>
<p>The current evidence on the adequacy of post-hospital community care is  		largely impressionistic. A systematic assessment is required to develop  		objective evidence on the extent of problems and whether they lead to adverse  		health outcomes for patients. The methodology available up to now has not been  		adequate to support a systematic assessment of national scope. The primary  		limitations of this methodology is that it has required physician review of  		individual cases, which is difficult to implement in a national study and has  		often been found to be unreliable.</p>
<p>This study, sponsored jointly with the Office of Research and  		Demonstrations in HCFA, has developed and tested a new methodology intended to  		overcome these limitations and to permit a systematic, national assessment of  		the adequacy of post-hospital care in the community for elderly patients and  		whether inadequate care leads to adverse health outcomes. The key to this  		methodology is a series of guidelines which specify standards for  		the amount of care that is minimally adequate to prevent adverse health  		outcomes for elderly patients with a wide variety of conditions commonly  		requiring post-hospital care in the community.</p>
<p>The methodology has been implemented in a pilot study in nine hospitals  		in two states. The conclusion of the pilot is that the methodology is generally  		valid, feasible, and effective although some refinements are required. The  		guidelines (taken as a group) provide a reasonable definition of minimally  		adequate care.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The purpose of this project was to examine  		State activities designed to assure the quality of home care. Nineteen States  		were surveyed to identify activities related to the assessment and monitoring  		of home care quality. This included Older Americans Act Long-Term Care  		Ombudsman Programs in five States that have expanded to cover home care  		services. Study findings indicate that: a wide variety of mechanisms addressing  		home care quality are in place in the study sites; quality in home care  		programs is not perceived to be a major public or political issue in most of  		the States; the lack of a standardized framework for defining and measuring  		quality is a major barrier to understanding and ensuring the quality of home  		care services; and expansion of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program to include  		home care clients is an untested and unproven quality mechanism.</p>

<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Most of the Division's research in this area is concentrated on persons  		with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities likely to need  		long-term services and supports. Studies have been sponsored to look at where  		people with severe disabilities live and how needed services are financed.</p>
<p>In 1986, the Division prepared a report to Congress on <b>Medicaid  		Financing of Services to Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled  		Persons</b>. As a follow-up to this report and in response to proposed  		legislation expanding Medicaid funding for community-based services to this  		population, the Division coordinated a Departmental Working Group on MR/DD  		Policies. The charge of the Working Group was to examine Federal policy  		barriers to community-based services and to develop cost-effective policy  		reforms. Several studies were sponsored to assist the Working Group in its  		analysis (<b>e.g., An Analysis of Federal and State Policies Affecting Services  		to Mentally Retarded and other Developmental Disabled Persons: State  		Perspectives and Analysis of Federal MR/DD Policies</b>). ASPE has recently  		released the final report of the Departmental Working Group (<b>Report to the  		Secretary from the Working Group on Policies Affecting Mentally Retarded and  		Other Developmentally Disabled Persons</b>).</p>
<p>Future research will examine new approaches in financing and service  		delivery to those individuals with the most severe impairments. One planned  		project will analyze national and state level data on severely disabled  		children and the financial burdens their health and medical care place on  		family caregivers.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Martin Kotler, Macro Systems,  		Inc., Silver Spring, MD</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This project synthesized research on the  		cost of care for three vulnerable subgroups: the mentally retarded and  		developmentally disabled at risk of institutionalization; the frail or impaired  		elderly; and the physically handicapped. The analysis concluded that the  		current body of research cannot substantiate claims that either institutional  		care or community-based care is consistently less expensive for the three  		population subgroups identified for this study. Comparative analysis is  		restricted due to a number of factors including problems in defining comparison  		groups, incomplete cost data and lack of cost comparability. However, findings  		suggest that costs for some individual clients, generally those who do not have  		severe impairments, may be less for home and community-based care. There is  		also some evidence that the movement of people from institutional settings to  		community settings has greater potential for costs savings than the deferral of  		initial institutionalization. The study further revealed that there is a  		paucity of data on the cost of care of physically handicapped persons.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The purpose of this project was to identify  		the numbers of disabled children and adults in foster homes administered by  		child welfare or social service agencies. All State welfare agencies were  		surveyed as were staff in adult services offices and State mental retardation  		agencies. In addition, three counties in ten States were surveyed. Study  		findings indicate that as of December 1985, there were approximately 54,000  		handicapped children in out-of-home foster care including 14,000 with mental  		retardation. There were an additional 6,400 mentally retarded children and  		10,700 adults in specialized foster care homes administered by State mental  		retardation agencies. The amount of information on disabled children and adults  		in generic foster care is limited because States collect information  		differently. Nevertheless, the findings indicate foster care is a significant  		form of community care for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The study revealed that State policy decisions and overall emphasis on  		community-based, as opposed to institution-based services, are the result of  		interactions between a complex array of factors including the philosophical  		commitment of the State, a healthy State economy and the existence of strong,  		well-organized advocacy on behalf of family and community services.

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>National Long-Term Care  		Survey</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Kenneth Manton, Duke  		University, Durham, NC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  A current grant from the National Institute  		on Aging (NIA) to Duke University supports the creation of a longitudinal data  		set that will be comprised of three waves of the National Long-Term Care Survey  		(NLTCS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census (1982, 1984 and 1989) and data  		extracted from Medicare Part A files (1980-1989). The focus is on changes in  		functional and health characteristics as well as long-term care service use  		among a nationally representative sample of elderly impaired persons.</p>
<p>The Division has supplemented the NIA grant to permit data collection in  		three areas: (a) the effects of supply on the use of long-term care services,  		(b) the treatment of income and assets by persons with nursing home stays, and  		(c) patterns of informal caregiving.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Gloria Kapantais, National  		Center for Health Statistics, Rockville, MD</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The 1986 National Follow-Back Survey is a  		nationally representative sample of 20,000 persons who died in 1986. The survey  		contains a great deal of information about health and functional status of the  		decedent and the use of acute and long-term care services in the year prior to  		death. The survey was designed and managed by the National Center for Health  		Statistics (NCHS); data collection was carried out by the Census Bureau. Nine  		agencies inside and outside the Department provided funding and technical  		support. ASPE provided funding and support to acquire data on impairments and  		use of long-term care services in the last year of life.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Craig Thornton, Mathematica  		Policy Research, Princeton, NJ</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study will analyze methods for  		collecting nationally representative data on people with mental retardation and  		other developmental disabilities living in the community. An operational  		definition of the proposed survey population will be developed and functional  		measures identified. The project will analyze existing surveys which include  		information on the target population, recommend modules for enhancing the  		usefulness of existing surveys and develop a prototype data collection  		instrument and sampling frame for a new survey. A Technical Advisory Group  		comprised of Federal and State officials as well as outside consultants will  		provide oversight.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>National Long-Term Care Survey Users  		Forum</i></b></p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS)  		is a very rich yet complex data base involving three separate interview waves  		(1982, 1984 and 1989) and multiple components. The complexity of the data base  		had led to a number of issues related to utilization of the Survey for research  		purposes. As part of its objective to encourage the utilization of data bases,  		sponsored by HHS, ASPE held a one-day forum for users of the NLTCS.</p>
<p>The purpose of the forum was to discuss problems experienced in using  		the survey, strategies for circumventing those problems and to hear suggestions  		regarding what the Government can do to improve the usefulness of the  		survey.</p>
<p>A number of concerns and ideas ranging from issues of weighting the  		population to improving the technical assistance available were generated by  		the participants. A summary of the proceedings, including recommendations of  		the participants and planned next steps by the Government will be made  		available.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Board and Care Survey Design</i></b></p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Board and care living arrangements for  		dependent populations are an increasingly important part of the long-term care  		continuum. Very little national data on board and care are available. This  		study is intended to develop survey design options including sampling from data  		collection protocols and instrumentation and to offer a recommended approach  		for a national board and care survey.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Analysis of Prevalence Estimates of the  		Functionally Impaired Elderly</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  To be determined.</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Because of differences among surveys on  		analytic samples, question working and selection of items for measurement,  		there is considerable variation in the published estimates of the number of  		functionally impaired elderly made from existing health and long-term care  		surveys. This project will develop estimates from several national surveys and  		examine the bases for differences among them. It will also propose ways of  		identifying and using the most appropriate survey data on functional  		limitations in response to long-term care legislative proposals.</p>
