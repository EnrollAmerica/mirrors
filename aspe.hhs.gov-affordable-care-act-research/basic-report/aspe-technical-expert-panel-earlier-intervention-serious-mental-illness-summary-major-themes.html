<hr /><h2>I. Purpose</h2>
<p>On May 13, 2009, the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care  		Policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at  		the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services convened a Technical Expert  		Panel (TEP) to advise on the development of a research and policy agenda to  		prevent individuals with serious mental illness from long-term dependence on  		Social Security disability and related health care programs. The TEP discussed  		the intersection of policies relating to health care coverage and delivery,  		income support, disability benefits, employment supports and rehabilitation  		services and strategies for better aligning these policies; and evidence-based  		interventions to better support individuals at risk of losing jobs due to  		mental illness, or to increase the likelihood that they return to work and do  		not become permanently dependent on disability benefits and other public  		programs following a spell of mental illness. The goals of the TEP were to  		understand the policy issues relating to earlier intervention, discuss the  		current evidence-base, outline a series of policy responses, and develop a  		potential research agenda for ASPE. A list of TEP participants is provided in  		<i><a href="aspe-technical-expert-panel-earlier-intervention-serious-mental-illness-summary-major-themes.html#append1">Appendix 1</a></i>.</p>
<h2> II. Building a Rationale for Earlier Intervention</h2>
<p>A central issue discussed by the TEP was that of the need for earlier  		interventions to preserve or promote connections to the labor force. Dr. Howard  		Goldman prepared and presented a commissioned paper that provided a foundation  		for the discussion by summarizing some of the seminal research related to  		mental health, employment, and the disability trajectory. The evidence-based of  		research, domestic and international, regarding successful interventions  		continues to grow. For example, evidence-base interventions such as  		individual placement and support (IPS) demonstrated effectiveness  		for returning people to work and at least one study demonstrates the potential  		for preventing them from joining the disability rolls altogether. IPS models  		have been shown to be effective for older and younger working-age clients, for  		those with different diagnoses and levels of severity, for those with substance  		abuse comorbidities, for those with different disability statuses, and for  		those with different work histories.<sup><font><a href="aspe-technical-expert-panel-earlier-intervention-serious-mental-illness-summary-major-themes.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The commissioned paper also underscored the growing recognition in the  		mental health field that employment is a fundamental concern for people with  		serious mental illness because loss of employment results in loss of income,  		social supports, health insurance, and a way to participate in mainstream  		society. In fact, the American Psychiatric Association and other prominent  		groups regard the threatened loss of a job due to onset of a mental illness as  		a psychiatric emergency because so much is at stake in their recovery.  		Maintenance of employment may be a protective factor and prevent the long chain  		of negative consequences and disability associated with mental illness, as well  		as preventing dependency on public disability benefits such as Supplemental  		Security Income/Social Security Disability Insurance (SSI/SSDI). </p>
<p>However, as Dr. Goldman notes, a recent <i>Health Affairs</i> article by  		Drake and colleagues<sup><font><a href="aspe-technical-expert-panel-earlier-intervention-serious-mental-illness-summary-major-themes.html#note2">2</a></font></sup>  		identifies four key policy barriers that deter persons with serious mental  		illness from seeking or staying connected to employment:</p>
<ul><li>The link between eligibility for public health care programs and  		  disability status.</li>
<li>Limited integration of employment supports (including evidence-based  		  supported employment) with mental health services.</li>
<li>Disincentives for people who qualify for SSI or SSDI benefits to  		  work.</li>
<li>Lack of access to supported employment and mental health services  		  early in the course of mental illness to avoid disconnection from the  		  workplace.</li>
</ul><p><b>Current Research Efforts</b></p>
<p>Several current research efforts cited in the commissioned paper served  		as a reference point for the TEP discussion throughout the day, including: (1)  		Mental Health Treatment Study (MHTS); (2) Demonstration to Maintain  		Independence and Employment (DMIE); and (3) psychopharmacology treatment  		recommendations and other related research. The focus of these studies ranges  		from targeting persons with serious mental illness already on disability to  		those at risk of going onto disability.</p>
<p><b>1. Mental Health Treatment Study</b></p>
<p>The Social Security Administrations (SSA's) MHTS is an  		experimental trial testing the effectiveness of integrating evidence-based  		supported employment with behavioral health services for individuals currently  		receiving SSDI. Participants are assessed during and after the intervention for  		changes in workforce participation, mental health status and use of services.  		The program presently has 2200 enrollees with schizophrenia and mood disorders  		and early results are positive. Insurance premiums are paid for intervention  		group participants and they are reimbursed for all out-of-pocket behavioral  		health services and some work-related expenses. Assuming the study continues to  		show successful outcomes, there will be a policy challenge in terms of taking  		the program to scale due to financing issues. The majority of the expenses  		associated with the intervention are for supported employment, which is not  		covered by Medicare and has partial Medicaid coverage in some states.</p>
<p><b>2. Demonstration to Maintain Independence and Employment</b></p>
<p>Two states (Minnesota and Texas) are implementing DMIE programs, funded  		by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS's), that target  		employed individuals with severe mental disorders or people with a chronic  		physical health condition who also have a co-occurring mental health problem  		who are not currently eligible for Social Security benefits. The goal of the  		demonstration is to prevent or delay a person with mental illness from becoming  		disabled and losing their connection to the workforce. Intervention  		participants receive an expanded Medicaid benefit set, which includes health  		and behavioral health services, as well as employment supports, including  		assignment to a navigator to assist in assessing needs and accessing services.  		Navigators, using motivational interviewing and goal setting strategies,  		provide a vital, yet relatively low-cost intervention component. Preliminary  		results demonstrate that participants have improved health and mental health  		outcomes and are less likely to apply for public benefits. These findings are  		especially promising because the programs are being implemented by Minnesota  		and Texas in the context of real-world public health systems rather  		than more tightly controlled experimental environments. </p>
<p><b>3. First episode psychosis Psychopharmacology Treatment  		Recommendations and Other Related Research</b></p>
<p>The group also discussed emerging evidence around psychopharmacological  		interventions for first episode schizophrenia. The current assessment of the  		evidence relating to first episode schizophrenia by the Schizophrenia Patient  		Outcomes Research Team is that existing evidence is not adequate to put forward  		a specific recommendation for intervention. Some psychosocial interventions,  		such as cognitive-behavior therapy, family psychoeducation and supported  		employment show promise. In addition, a participant mentioned several  		as-yet-unpublished research efforts on IPS by Patrick McGorry, Keith  		Nuechterlein, Eoin Killackey, and Miles Rinaldi with populations that have not  		already qualified for disability benefits. This area of research will be  		strengthened by the new National Institute of Mental Health research project,  		Recovery After Initial Schizophrenia Episode, which will test two different  		multi-faceted interventions for first episode psychosis, as well as by research  		being funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to implement the Portland  		Identification and Early Referral model in four additional states.</p>
<h2>III. Defining Earlier Intervention</h2>
<p>The TEP was asked to assist in the development of a definition of  		earlier intervention in terms of: (1) Target Population; (2)  		Timing; (3) Service Types; and (4) Settings.</p>
<p><b>1. Target Population</b></p>
<p>The panel acknowledged the complexity of identifying a target population  		for earlier intervention, including a concern about limiting the definition to  		a particular diagnosis. Although consensus was not reached regarding how best  		to target a population at risk for long-term disability, participants agreed  		that the definition needs to be functionally-related using a standard measure  		such as the International Classification of Function. The panel also agreed  		that the at risk population is likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia,  		bipolar disorder, or major depression. The group suggested a potential focus on  		consumers with psychosis because this is likely to be more predictive of  		long-term disability than depression. A focus on psychosis pushes the targeting  		of the intervention to young adults since this is typically the age of onset of  		schizophrenia. </p>
<p>A panel member developed a conceptual framework for understanding the  		population for earlier intervention that spans the continuum of illness from  		the prodromal phase prior to first onset of mental illness to the point at  		which a person might apply for public benefits, but is not yet disabled enough  		to qualify. Interventions at any point along the continuum below would still be  		considered early in the context of current practice. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/69981/TEPonEI-fig1.JPG" alt="Organizational Chart: Before First Onset leads to At Onset, leads to Symptom Pattern Well Established, leads to Application for Public Benefits Denied" /></div>
<p>The panel acknowledged that there are multiple opportunities for earlier  		intervention along the continuum across specific mental conditions and age  		ranges, each with different implications for the evidence-based practice that  		should be used and the site at which the intervention would be delivered.  		Discussion of population is closely related to timing and services in that  		way.</p>
<p><b>2. Timing and Strategies for Identification and Outreach</b></p>
<p>Participants agreed that the best time to intervene is at the initial  		onset of a persons mental illness, or as early as possible. Because  		mental health conditions launch people on a declining trajectory, it is  		critical to identify and treat people during their first or second episode and  		to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis. The effectiveness of  		interventions diminishes over the illness course. </p>
<p>A subject of much conversation was how best to identify people in the  		early stage of mental illness. Participants suggested that early intervention  		should be targeted at illnesses that have observable markers. Clinical research  		is currently engaged in identifying prodromal signs that indicate a coming  		episode of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia. </p>
<p>Participants also noted that the Minnesota and Texas DMIE programs  		successfully identified participants with mental health conditions through  		pharmacy and health care claims data. The panel also discussed a variety of  		settings where individuals could be identified, including: the vocational  		rehabilitation system, prisoner re-entry, and youth transition programs.  		However, interventions targeted at people before they even meet the mental  		health system is a major departure from current practice and there is not  		currently a policy orientation that supports this concept.</p>
<p><b>3. Types of Services</b></p>
<p>The panel also discussed the types of services that are needed for early  		intervention and agreed that services offered should attend to employment and  		educational settings to keep people connected with their functional environment  		as much as possible. As previously discussed, IPS is one of the most promising  		models, though it can be difficult to fund because it crosses health and  		employment sectors. Benefit structures used in the MHTS and DMIE were designed  		specifically to fill the current gap in funded services, using flexible funding  		to pay for the additional benefits. There is less evidence for  		cognitive-behavioral therapy and peer support models at this time.</p>
<p>The participants recommended that services be customized, culturally  		competent, and person-centered. Interventions should consider potential  		modifications to address needs across age groups, populations, personal  		resource levels (i.e., insurance status), settings, and financing mechanisms.  		They also identified the need for a central case manager or navigator to  		coordinate services and maintain accountability for a persons treatment.  		Services should also account for co-occurring substance abuse or untreated  		ambulatory health conditions, which both tend to accelerate the trajectory of  		disability. </p>
<p><b>4. Systems for Outreach and Service Delivery</b></p>
<p>The TEP generally agreed that early interventions should take place in  		settings separate from services offered to long-term psychiatric patients,  		potentially in primary care clinics, self-help centers, or other  		community-based settings. In addition, the group discussed the possibility of  		working through employment related services, such as Employee Assistance  		Programs, as a strategy to identify and reach persons who do not self-identify  		as mental health consumers. There has been effort to involve the mental health  		system more closely in the Workforce Investment System, but it has not been  		very successful so far. A participant commented on the iatrogenic effects  		of the mental health system and urged that workplace and education  		settings be used wherever possible to counteract those effects. </p>
<p>State mental health systems currently focus on the most severe cases,  		leaving limited resources to serve people with less debilitating illnesses.  		Integrating and coordinating employment interventions through the public mental  		health system could be a viable strategy, but more resources would need to be  		invested in community mental health.</p>
<h2>IV. Knowledge Gaps and Future Research</h2>
<p>When asked if the current evidence is sufficient to inform policy in  		this area, the TEP called for more research, acknowledging that there are a  		number of efficacious interventions that restore and enhance independent  		functioning, but implementing them in the real world is an ongoing challenge.  		Moreover, many intervention models were devised in European countries that have  		the benefit of a national health system and have not yet been tested in the  		United States. </p>
<p>Translation of research to practice has been a major issue for SSA and  		their demonstrations; they continue to gather evidence from MHTS, Ticket to  		Work, and the employment network, but they need more impacts and practices to  		be translated broadly and sustained beyond the duration of demonstration  		funding. </p>
<p>The TEP discussed the need to plan research so that its outcomes are  		policy relevant. One participant recommended that careful consideration be paid  		to defining the outcome that is being tested and the need to incorporate  		evaluation and policy issues from the very beginning that will answer the  		questions: Who is at risk? Who is willing to pay for that risk? Who will need  		the intervention? Does the intervention directly link to the outcome?</p>
<p>An area of much discussion was the need for longitudinal research and  		long-term follow-up of study participants. TEP members asserted that research  		should include follow-up for as long as ten years in order to vary the length  		of the intervention, observe its full impact on disability, or to be able to  		model the decay of its effects. There is a need to understand the effectiveness  		of early intervention in changing the trajectory of participants future  		experience. The economic benefits of continuing employment are especially  		apparent after many years elapse. </p>
<p>In particular, many participants commented that there is a need to  		continue the DMIE beyond its currently scheduled end date. They argued that it  		now has economy of scale and much remains to be found from replicating the  		model. However, the demonstration is currently scheduled to end in September  		and an extension would require Congressional action. </p>
<h2>V. Potential Policy Levers and Suggested Next Steps</h2>
<p><b><i>Community Mental Health System and Workforce Issues:</i></b> TEP  		participants noted the scarce resources available to and the eroded condition  		of the public mental health system due to poor training, an overemphasis on  		medication, and a workforce in crisis. Regarding the workforce, panelists noted  		the lack of training and capacity to carry out evidence-based interventions  		with fidelity, as well as limited experience implementing early interventions  		or interventions designed to promote employment. </p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid Buy-In:</i></b> Participants discussed the experience of  		Medicaid Buy-In programs and why they are and are not effective. One  		participant noted distrust of the Medicaid and Social Security programs among  		mental health consumers, and that the programs successes have not been  		well-communicated. Though all states programs are different, they  		generally place too much emphasis on personal care attendant benefits rather  		than supported employment benefits, a mismatch of services for this population.  		</p>
<p><b><i>Framework for Early Intervention:</i></b> Building on the  		conceptual framework put forward in the meeting, TEP members identified the  		need to develop a detailed framework to identify and assess opportunities for  		earlier intervention along the continuum of disability. This would help  		identify populations and service settings for intervention and support policy  		prioritization. </p>
<p><b><i>CMS Community-Based Services Waivers:</i></b> Another major area  		of discussion was Medicaid and the role of waivers in providing community-based  		services to mental health consumers, including workplace supports. It was also  		proposed that people who have been rejected or otherwise delayed from receiving  		vocational rehabilitation might be offered the same types of services under a  		Medicaid benefit; this would require a change in statute or interpretation of  		statute.</p>
<p><b><i>Further CMS Guidance and Clarification Needed on Coverage for  		Employment Support Services:</i></b> A participant from state government  		commented that states need clear guidance from CMS about how to build supported  		employment benefits in the Medicaid program. There is a need to translate the  		mental health language of supported employment to the CMS  		language of reimbursement, at the individual code level, in order  		to build common understanding. </p>
<p><b><i>Potential Role of the Private Sector:</i></b> Participants  		considered the current and potential roles of schools and employers in  		identifying mental health needs, helping people to obtain good treatment and  		services, and maintaining connection to mainstream workplace or educational  		settings and associated insurance. Participants also discussed involving  		private sector health and disability insurers to learn about their experiences,  		models for coordinating benefits, and potential cost savings resulting from  		coordination. Participants suggested that ASPE might bring more insurers and  		large employers together to exchange information and inform a 2-3 year agenda.  		</p>
<p><b><i>Relevant Lessons from Welfare Reform:</i></b> The TEP raised the  		issue of what might be learned from experiences with welfare reform.  		Vulnerability is very intense in both populations; one thing going wrong can  		cause a cascade of negative consequences. The welfare reform effort was largely  		a success and may offer relevant lessons, but mental health and disability  		policy changes would face a different set of obstacles because of the need to  		cooperate across agencies. </p>
<p>Proposed Research Questions Suggested by Participants</p>
<ul><li>Identify what characteristics the currently disabled population had  		  before they became disabled. </li>
<li>What volume of people might potentially be involved in a broad-based  		  early intervention effort?</li>
<li>What crises precipitate mental health conditions?</li>
<li>Evaluate the differences in success rates for consumers who accept  		  the label of person with a mental illness versus those who do  		  not.</li>
<li>Evaluate the role of parents insurance benefits on the  		  treatment of mental health conditions in young adults and the potential for  		  public/private coordination of benefits.</li>
<li>How can we ensure that services are integrated and coordinated enough  		  to be effective for individuals and also sustainable at a system level?</li>
<li>What are the real and perceived barriers to states using Medicaid  		  waivers, such as 1915c or 1115 waivers, to implement employment support  		  services and programs for people with mental illness?</li>
<li>How similar are the TANF population and the population of mental  		  health consumers? Do they face similar issues related to child care,  		  employment, transportation, etc.?</li>
<li>What are the impacts of the two year wait for Medicare for SSDI  		  beneficiaries on their mental health and functioning? </li>
