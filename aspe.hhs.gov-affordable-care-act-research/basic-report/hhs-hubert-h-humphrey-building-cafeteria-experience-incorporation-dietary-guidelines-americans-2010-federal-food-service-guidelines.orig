<div class="report-abstracttitle">Abstract</div>
<div class="report-abstract">      This case study describes the inception, development and implementation of the Health and Sustainability Guidelines for Federal Concessions and Vending Operations.  Based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 and sustainability best practices, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the General Services Administration (GSA), with other partners, developed the Health and Sustainability Guidelines to focus on improving the health of the thousands of employees and others who eat at federal facilities each day and conserving vital environmental resources.  HHS and GSA developed a request for proposal (RFP) to issue a new contract to pilot the Health and Sustainability Guidelines at the HHS Hubert H. Humphrey Building Cafeteria.  As of March 2012, all of the GSA’s 32 federal facilities in the Capital Region are incorporating the guidelines in full or in part.  NORC at the University of Chicago developed a case study to document the collaborative process used by HHS, GSA, and others to incorporate the Health and Sustainability Guidelines into an RFP, and to describe vendors’ perspectives on the implementation of the guidelines in current and future cafeteria contracts.   </div>

<p class="Casestudytext">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is implementing     an array of programs to address the increasing prevalence of obesity in the     U.S. population. The HHS Healthy Weight and Obesity Initiative encompasses     many of these programs, policies, and initiatives, which are taking place in     a range of community, clinical, and marketplace settings. These     interventions target multiple socio-ecological levels; engage stakeholders across     sectors of influence (e.g., government, industry); and are designed to     affect various outcomes (e.g., social norms and values, or changes to the     social and physical environments in which health behavior occurs).  </p>
<p class="Casestudytext">The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for     Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) contracted with NORC at the University of     Chicago to conduct evaluation and reporting activities spanning several of     these initiatives. Through a 24-month project, “Evaluation and Analytic     Support for the HHS Healthy Weight and Obesity Initiative,” NORC is     assisting HHS by tracking progress on activities to reverse the obesity     epidemic. NORC is collecting data from a selected portfolio of HHS healthy     weight projects, preparing reports for HHS, and providing technical     assistance and evaluation support to selected projects. The project began in     September 2010.</p>
<p class="Casestudytext">NORC’s activities for this project include: 1) data     collection and reporting, and 2) evaluation technical assistance and     support. To help monitor progress and inform future program development,     NORC is collecting, analyzing, and reporting on qualitative and quantitative     data and information submitted by various offices and agencies. NORC is also     complementing the work of HHS technical evaluation specialists by providing     technical assistance and evaluation support to selected projects.  </p>

The Humphrey Building was the first federal  food service operation to implement the <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines. </i>As of March 2012, all of the GSA’s 32 federal facilities in the  Capital Region are incorporating the guidelines in full or in part. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Between May 2011 and 2012, NORC at the  University of Chicago developed a case study to document the collaborative  process used by HHS, GSA, and others to incorporate the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i> into an RFP, and to describe vendors’  perspectives on the implementation of the guidelines in current and future  cafeteria contracts. </span></p>

<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>What lessons can be learned from the RFP development process? </p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>To what extent will vendors that bid on federal food service  contracts face new challenges or opportunities as a result of the  implementation of the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>?</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Based on the Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor’s experience—as  well as feedback from other federal food service vendors—to what extent does  adherence to the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> impact cafeteria  sales, menu offerings, and food delivery? </p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Methods included  a document review on the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> and  interviews with nine federal staff </span>who <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">participated in  the development and implementation of the guidelines, and nine federal food  service vendors, including the vendor that implemented the guidelines in the  Humphrey Building Cafeteria.

Key stakeholders from HHS and GSA  identified the HHS Hubert H. Humphrey Building Cafeteria in Washington, DC as  the pilot location. Federal employees at the Humphrey Building were eager for  healthier food options and greener products, which helped HHS to rebid the  current contract that was up for renewal. HHS and GSA collaborated to develop </span>an  RFP<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> that incorporated the <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i>. Many of the same individuals who developed the guidelines also  participated in the process of translating the guidelines into a RFP.

To  overcome these challenges, GSA built flexibility into the RFP. For example, the  guidelines suggest that 25 percent of the product offerings must be<span> organically, locally or “sustainably” grown. </span>In the  event that reasonably priced local food is not available year-round, the vendor  can choose to source organic or fair trade items instead.

<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Meeting the sodium guidelines.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> The Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor and other vendors that  serve federal facilities reported that a key challenge has been meeting the  sodium criteria in the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>. According  to the guidelines, all individual food items must contain ≤ 480 mg sodium  as served, unless otherwise specified. All meals must contain ≤ 900 mg  sodium as served (approximately 39% of the <i>Dietary Guideline</i>  recommendation of 2,300 mg for daily intake). The following offerings must  contain ≤ 230 mg sodium per serving: all cereal, bread and pasta  offerings; all vegetable offerings; processed cheeses; and vegetable juices. There  are two key challenges associated with sodium. The first challenge is a lack of  availability of lower sodium products, especially in the institutional pack  size, in the marketplace. According to vendors, the marketplace does not offer  a wide variety of lower sodium products that meet the guidelines’ standard  criteria. Specifically, the Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor reported that it  is difficult to identify bread, deli meat, and cheese products that meet the  sodium criteria. The second challenge is that vendors believe customers are  acclimated to the high levels of sodium in foods like pizza and deli meats.  Therefore, a few of the vendors expressed concerned that reductions in sodium  could impact customer participation. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Sourcing specialty products.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> The Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor reported challenges related  to sourcing specialty products</span> such as lower sodium deli meat<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">. The vendor indicated that food service distributors are reluctant  to purchase specialty products with a limited shelf life from manufacturers.  The vendor explained that in order for the product to be profitable—due to high  fuel costs and other factors—manufacturers have high shipping requirements and  products are shipped in bulk pallets and inventory quantities. However, the  cafeteria may not be able to sell a large volume of specialty products</span>,  and/or<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> fresh items</span>,<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> before they  expire, and therefore, could lose money. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Access to local and organic  produce.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  The <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i> have standard criteria related to offering organically, locally  or documented sustainably grown products as well as seasonal varieties of  fruits and vegetables. Vendors described challenges associated with meeting the  guidelines on organic and locally grown produce (e.g., to meet the standard  criteria, 25 percent of the product line must be organic, local or sustainably  grown). Vendors commented that food service operations on the East Coast face  challenges in securing organic and local produce year round. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b>Cost. </b>A majority of the vendors <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">expressed concern that their profit/loss ratio</span> could<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> be affected by the guidelines</span>. Vendors noted that<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> healthy items cost more to purchase and prepare. Foods that are  more costly include fresh vegetables and fruits, depending upon the time of the  year, and any item that is fresh and not processed. </span>Vendors reported  that compostable and disposable products are more costly. Other costs include  infrastructure costs related to upgrading facilities for fresh cooking and  fresh product storage, and front-of-house updates to offer chilled tap water. <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Additionally, vendors reported that they would need to provide  additional training to chefs and other staff to prepare healthier options  rather than using as many ready-made products. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Customer acceptance</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">. Some vendors were concerned that the food that fulfills the guidelines  would only appeal to a health conscious consumer, affecting sales. Vendors  acknowledged that this challenge could be addressed through educational  efforts. For example, the Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor indicated that  consumers were initially dissatisfied with the transition to organic, bird  friendly coffee because it cost patrons 10 to 15 cents more per cup. The vendor  addressed this challenge by collaborating with GSA and HHS to launch a  successful marketing and education campaign about the benefits of purchasing  organic, bird friendly coffee. Today, coffee is one of the vendor’s best-selling  products.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Vendors noted other concerns</span>  such as <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">the cost of organic products; the increased labor  associated with providing locally produced items; the ongoing costs associated  with updating and printing nutrition materials; and a lack of local composting  facilities in some areas. Several vendors said that they expected the  guidelines would have an impact on their menu offerings, by limiting the types  of beverages they could offer and reducing the variety of dry cereal products  (i.e., cereals must have at <span>least 3g of fiber and  less than 10g total sugars per serving</span>). </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span class="Heading3Char"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Opportunities.  </span></span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The guidelines present a number of  opportunities. The Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor found that the experience  of implementing the guidelines has changed the way their company offers and  markets foods—not only in their HHS contract, but in others as well. Other  vendors commented that the guidelines are an opportunity for cross-company  learning for their management, staff, and marketing and communications  departments. Additionally, some thought the guidelines would enable vendors to  be more creative and innovative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="NORCExhibitCaptionOrangeOnly">Lessons Learned</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The Humphrey Building Cafeteria  vendor’s experience implementing the guidelines offers a model for other federal,  state and local agencies, organizations, and businesses. The guidelines have  changed the way that food is purchased, prepared and presented in the Humphrey  Building Cafeteria. Since the implementation of the guidelines, HHS and GSA  have collaborated to promote the guidelines to other federal agencies. GSA  frequently engages vendors that serve both government and non-government  cafeterias to discuss opportunities for creating healthier menus and more  sustainable food products. </span>As of March 2012<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">, all of  the GSA’s 32 federal facilities in the Capital Region are incorporating the  guidelines in full or in part. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Key stakeholders involved in developing  the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> and the RFP for the Humphrey  Building Cafeteria offer several valuable lessons learned for government staff;  food service vendors; and other public and private agencies that may consider  implementing the guidelines in the future.  </span></p>
<h3><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Lessons Learned for Government </span></h3>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal </span></b><b>staff<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> found that having a multi-disciplinary cross-agency partnership  was instrumental to their success in developing the guidelines and translating  them into an RFP.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The <i>Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</i>, and the resulting RFP that incorporated  them, are products of a </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">cross-agency, multi-disciplinary  collaborative. Federal </span>staff<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> noted that the  development of the guidelines, and translation of these guidelines into an RFP,  was a team </span>approach<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">, and that the collaboration across  agencies to bring the best available nutrition science to vendors facilitated  their success. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">There is a need for more industry  education about the guidelines, and specifically, the flexibility associated  with the implementation of the guidelines. </span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">GSA’s  contract with the Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor contains flexible terms  about the implementation of the guidelines. For example, </span>according to  the RFP, <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">the current Humphrey Building cafeteria vendor </span>must  <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">ensure that 40 percent of their product offerings meet the  guidelines. Discussions with other federal cafeteria vendors suggested that  they may not be aware of the flexibility associated with implementing the  guidelines and the standard criteria for some of the guidelines. As the  guidelines are implemented more broadly within state, local and private  organizations, more direct-to-</span>new <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">vendor education may  be needed about the standard criteria and the possibility of a flexible  implementation strategy.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Lessons Learned for Food Service Vendors</span></h3>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Industry experts provided valuable  feedback on the feasibility of implementing some of the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i>, which impacted the content of the RFP. </span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> In addition to consulting nutrition and sustainability experts  from across the federal government, GSA solicited feedback </span>from <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">current federal cafeteria vendors to determine the feasibility of  the guidelines. Vendor feedback confirmed</span> the challenges that were noted  by federal staff<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">, such as requesting specific products from food  purveyors or developing a composting program. Therefore, GSA created an RFP that  can be easily adapted to different agencies in different locations with  different timelines and priorities.  </span></p>
<h3><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Lessons Learned for Other Public and Private Agencies or  Organizations</span></h3>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Consumers played a major role in  the successful implementation of the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>  at HHS.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Another lesson learned was the importance  of support from HHS cafeteria patrons. Prior to the guidelines, HHS employees  expressed a desire for healthier and more sustainable food choices and  practices, making the Humphrey Building Cafeteria an ideal location to pilot  the guidelines. The HHS Cafeteria Patrons Committee gathered feedback from  employees, and found that patrons were willing to invest more for healthier  options and greener products. Federal stakeholders commented that cafeteria  patrons’ awareness of the importance of sustainable practices and their  commitment to making healthier choices contributed to a smooth transition to  the guidelines. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The successful implementation of  the guidelines at HHS can be attributed, in part, to effective education and  marketing efforts about health, wellness and sustainability.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Federal stakeholders commented that consumer education about  healthier products and sustainability practices contributed greatly to the  success of the implementation of the </span>guidelines<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">. When  the </span>guidelines<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> were piloted at the Humphrey Building,  HHS collaborated with the vendor to communicate the value of the initiative and  other important changes to consumers. Key strategies included marketing through  interactive menu boards, promotions of healthier meals, and information about  specific changes such as composting and sustainable coffee. Federal  stakeholders reported that agencies or other entities that wish to implement  the guidelines may achieve better outcomes if they collaborate with their  vendor to provide education about nutrition and sustainability, and changes to  product offerings and pricing.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal staff offered guidance to  other public and private entities developing a similar RFP based on the <i>Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</i>.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Federal staff  responded to a final and important question: “If another public or private  entity were to develop a similar RFP based on <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i>, what advice would you give them?” First,</span> federal  operations staff<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> said that it is important to appoint a person  to oversee the implementation of the guidelines in the facility and hold the  vendor accountable to meeting the standards. Second, stakeholders talked about  the importance of the relationship between GSA, the tenant agency</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">, and the vendor. This trio is best suited to create a process for  working within the constraints of the supply chain to maximize the guidelines  and push beyond them. A final theme was the need for the tenant agency to  demonstrate their commitment to health and wellness programs and communicate  that commitment to employees before they ever enter the cafeteria. Stakeholders  believe that the </span><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> and the RFP developed as part of this  process will help agencies and vendors to customize their offerings based on  the targeted consumer base while still driving improvements. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Fu</span>ture<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  research should track the long-term impacts of the guidelines on consumer  demand, the food supply chain, and the hospitality and manufacturing  industries, more generally. </span>Additionally, future studies on the  guidelines could incorporate customer feedback about whether they select  healthier menu offerings and why.  <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Based on this study, GSA  may consider developing a mechanism for</span> documenting vendors’ progress  over time; identifying challenges and opportunities; and sharing best practices  that would be of interest to other food service operations that are  implementing the <i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Health and Sustainability Guidelines.</span></i></p>

<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The purpose of the case study was  two-fold: 1) to document the collaborative process used by HHS, GSA, and other  agencies to incorporate the newly released <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i> into an RFP, so that other agencies and vendors may learn from  this experience, and 2) to describe vendors’ perspectives on the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i> and their ability to implement these guidelines  in current and future cafeteria contracts. This is the first case study to  document the process used by HHS and GSA to develop the <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i>.</span></p>

In May 2011, NORC and ASPE defined the objective of the case study. They identified key stakeholders from HHS and GSA to support the case study in a work group, and they subsequently convened a work group. NORC and ASPE met with the workgroup to discuss feedback on the abstract, and then developed research questions and a research abstract. In June 2011, NORC and ASPE met with the workgroup to discuss key issues, and then conducted a document review and brainstormed about key issues. In August 2011, NORC and ASPE met with the workgroup to discuss feedback on protocols and then developed key informant interview protocols and obtained IRB approval. In October 2011, NORC and ASPE met with the workgroup to discuss interviews, and then identified, recruited, and scheduled interview participants, with assistance from GSA. In November and December 2011, NORC and ASPE conducted an environmental scan of vendors selected for interviews. They conducted the interviews in November 2011 and January 2012. They analyzed interview and cafeteria sales data in January and February 2012. They developed a case study draft in February 2012. They reviewed the case study draft in March and April 2011. They finalized the case study in May 2012. " /></p>

They developed “standard criteria,”  which refers to standards that are expected to be implemented during daily  concession operations. They also included “above standard” criteria which  represents the highest value and best practices to the government.

Sodium was  identified as one of the greatest challenges in developing the guidelines, given  that it is largely driven by manufacturing.

One  stakeholder commented: “We were able to wrap both [health and sustainability]  into a business drive. </span>[We have also]<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> recently identified  that our concessions </span>[weren’t]<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> working. We were  putting out the same RFPs and getting back the same proposals and wondering why  our food wasn’t getting any better and our operations were not getting any  greener.” The goal in developing the RFP was to use the guidelines to demand  stronger aspects of health and sustainability through concessions. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Many of the same individuals who  developed the guidelines also participated in the process of translating the  guidelines into a</span>n<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> RFP. Staff from GSA developed the  RFP, </span>in collaboration with HHS operations and management staff.  Other <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">HHS staff </span>(i.e., experts in sustainability and nutrition) <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">were also involved throughout the review and vendor selection  process.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">HHS stakeholders guided the aspects of  the RFP that promote healthier menu planning and wellness. In developing the  RFP, GSA developed a crosswalk between the previous RFP and the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i>, and “sharpened the language” from the previous  RFP. Additionally, GSA met with each federal vendor to evaluate the feasibility  of including some or all of the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> in  the Humphrey Building RFP. Their goal in speaking with vendors was to determine  whether any of the guidelines would place an “undue hardship” on specific types  of vendors—for example, small businesses. One stakeholder commented:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>“I know of the challenges that [vendors]  are facing, because I have had the opportunity to meet with every single one of  our vendors. My objective is to evaluate, in my own mind, how far can I push  the envelope? How much can I get out of these guidelines, in reality, on the  table? We had lengthy discussions with all vendors...because we are not only  looking at one contract…we are also looking at future and past contracts. We  are looking at vendors who have been under contract for years to revamp and  revise their menu offerings.”</i></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc336512283" id="_Toc336512283">Characteristics of the Final RFP</a></h2>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The final Humphrey Building Cafeteria RFP  incorporated the </span>preliminary draft of the <i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">, with an  understanding that the industry would evolve and both the guidelines and the  RFP would require future revisions. Specifically, in the RFP, vendors were  asked to comply with nutrition and sustainability requirements:</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span class="Heading3Char"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Nutrition  requirements. </span></span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">On the nutrition side, GSA and  HHS encouraged vendors to offer<span> a variety of food  options to customers, including vegetarian, vegan, organic, light eater and </span>lean-meat  entrees<span>.

Additionally, the RFP asked vendors to offer food that is  organically, locally or sustainably grown and labeled accordingly, and seafood  identified as “Best Choices” or “Good Alternatives” on the Monterey Bay  Aquarium’s Seafood Watch List or certified by the Marine Stewardship Council  (or an equivalent program). </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Finally, </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">the RFP suggested that </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">vendors  develop creative plans for product placement, for example, by arranging</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> healthy menu offerings in the front of each serving line or at key  places that are closest to eye level, or by offering marketing promotions for  specific meals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc336512284" id="_Toc336512284">Challenges and Solutions Related to the Development  of the RFP</a></h2>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Key stakeholders that were involved in  this process did not report challenges related to interpreting the <i>Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</i> or translating the information into contract  language. The main challenge was trying to “find a balance between what [GSA  and HHS] would like to see in the cafeteria and what the industry can support.”  For example, there were concerns about meeting the sodium guidelines and  identifying local products at all times of the year. There was also some  concern about vendors’ ability to implement the composting guidelines. Further,  there was uncertainty as to how much time the vendor would require to meet all  of the guidelines (i.e., would it be a matter of weeks?  Months?)</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">To overcome these challenges, GSA built  some flexibility into the RFP. For example, the guidelines suggest that 25  percent of the product offerings should be<span>  organically or locally or documented sustainably grown (e.g.</span></span><span>, </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">integrated  pest management, pesticide free, other labeling programs, etc.).<b> </b></span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">In some regions, reasonably priced local food is not available  year-round. Therefore, the vendor can choose to source organic or fair trade  items instead. Similarly, the RFPs allows for different combinations of menu  choices so that vendors have some flexibility in meeting the guidelines.  According to the GSA, the vendor must ensure that 40 percent of their menu  meets all of the guidelines (i.e., for every 10 items in the cafeteria, four  must meet all of the guidelines). The GSA selected the 40 percent benchmark  because industry averages show that 31 percent of people are interested in  healthy foods.</span><a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="" id="_ednref29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">[29]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">A GSA stakeholder commented that the goal  was for vendors to achieve a higher target: “[The target] was aggressive, which  is okay, but we mitigated that by how we valued the requirements. If we had  required all items to meet the guidelines, then no one can meet that.” This  stakeholder also commented that the target may need to change in the future,  depending on demand for healthy foods.  </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Another challenge was related to  timing. GSA was developing the RFP for the Humphrey Building Cafeteria around  the same time that the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> were developed  and finalized. While </span>the draft of the <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">guidelines </span>was  completed<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> in December 2010, GSA and HHS were awaiting the  release of the <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</i>.</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The draft of the  <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> was based on the <i>Dietary  Guidelines for Americans, 2005</i>. The <i>Dietary Guidelines</i></span><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> for Americans</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> is reviewed, updated if necessary,  and published every 5 years.</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Stakeholders knew that any  updates in the <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i> would need to be reflected  in the</span> final <i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Health and Sustainability Guidelines</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">. Given that some of the key HHS staff were involved in developing  the <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</i>, the team was able to  anticipate some of the changes to specific recommendations. The </span>final <i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Health and Sustainability Guidelines</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  was released after the Humphrey Building Cafeteria RFP was awarded.

Post-award, the vendor had one month to prepare  for their opening in January 2011.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> The  first few months of the contract required extensive coordination among the  vendor’s president, professional dietitian, purchasing manager, and district  manager. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">One of the first steps towards  implementing the guidelines was sourcing food, paper and chemical products. The  vendor collaborated with manufacturers and distributors to identify products  that would meet the guidelines as well as the avenues of distribution. In some  cases, the vendor identified new manufacturers to obtain products that meet the  guidelines. Prior to the start date of service, the vendor also developed a  price/portion book for the account (e.g., hamburger patty size and selling  price; ounces of meat for a deli sandwich). The vendor reported that they were  able to meet the vast majority of the nutrition guidelines and all of the  sustainability guidelines, with no phase-in time needed. </span></p>

Additionally, the vendor commented that even changes with respect to their  product offerings (i.e.</span>,<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> no longer offering whole milk  products) and reduced portion sizes did not result in customer dissatisfaction.  Rather, their main challenges were related to implementation—the availability  of products in the marketplace that meet the sodium guidelines; purchasing  specialty products in bulk from food service distributors; customer  dissatisfaction with respect to the increased cost of organic, bird friendly  coffee; and cost increases.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Availability of products in the marketplace  that meet the sodium Guidelines.</span></i></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> The Humphrey  Building Cafeteria vendor reported that their greatest challenge has been  meeting the sodium criteria in the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>:  </span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>All individual food items must contain ≤ 480 mg sodium as  served, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>All meals must contain ≤ 900 mg sodium as served  (approximately 39% of the <i>Dietary Guideline</i> recommendation of 2,300 mg  for daily intake).</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>The following offerings must contain ≤ 230 mg sodium per  serving: all cereal, bread and pasta offerings; all vegetable offerings;  processed cheeses; and vegetable juices.</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Mixed dishes containing vegetables must contain ≤ 480 mg  sodium as served. </p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Canned or frozen tuna, seafood and salmon must contain ≤  290 mg sodium per serving.</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Canned meat must contain ≤ 480 mg sodium.</p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">According to  the vendor: “It was challenging because in some cases [the products that the]  government was looking for did not yet exist by manufacturers.” A GSA stakeholder  reflected on the challenge of identifying low</span>er s<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">odium  substitutes that meet the guidelines: “The big thing for manufacturers is to  find a substitute for salt—salt has so much impact on flavor. The challenge is  not only reduce the salt, but also to maintain the flavor profile. If you  don’t, no one will buy it.”</span></p>

</div>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">To meet the sodium criteria, the  vendor does not use salt to prepare foods and the chef </span>uses a lowered<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> sodium base (e.g., low</span>er<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> fat cottage  cheese, low</span>er<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> sodium mayonnaise). However, the main  challenge has been identifying bread, meat, and cheese products that meet the  sodium criteria. For example, the vendor has not been able to meet the standard  sodium criteria for deli sandwiches. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">In the vendor’s portion guide, a ham  or turkey deli sandwich contains four ounces of meat. However, the vendor found  that it was “extremely difficult” to find ham or turkey </span>deli <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">meat that meet the sodium criteria at four ounces—only two ounces  of meat, or one slice of bread rather than two, would satisfy the sodium criteria.  The vendor contacted the</span> major meat<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> manufacturers, but  they were not able to provide deli meat that would satisfy the sodium criteria.  Rather than eliminating deli meat from the menu, the vendor uses low</span>er <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">sodium meat; deli sandwiches do not precisely satisfy the sodium  criteria. The vendor also offers a half-sized sandwich to reduce the sodium  content of the meal.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Key stakeholders commented that  manufacturers have made strides since the <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i> were first released in March 2011. However, while they offer  lower sodium alternative meats, such products are not available in bulk from  food service distributors. The Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor is  investigating the possibility of cooking deli meat on site, which would help to  reduce the sodium in deli sandwiches. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Operational challenges related  to purchasing.</span></i></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Other challenges that the  vendor reported are related to sourcing specialty products</span>. <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The vendor indicated that food service distributors are reluctant  to purchase specialty products with a limited shelf life from manufacturers.  The vendor explained that in order for the product to be profitable—due to high  fuel costs and other factors—manufacturers have high shipping requirements and  products are shipped in bulk pallets and inventory quantities. However, the  cafeteria may not be able to sell a large volume of specialty products and  fresh items before they expire, and therefore, could lose money. </span>When  discussing the challenges related to sourcing lower sodium deli meats, the  vendor noted<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>“The other  piece of it is—if you find the product that you need, how does it get from the manufacturer  to the distributor? The shipping minimums in many cases are one and two  palettes of product, and one or two facilities…would never rotate that product  fast enough...it’s not so difficult if it is a frozen item, because shelf life  is longer, but if it is a fresh item, you are probably talking about a 30 to 40  day shelf life and it just doesn’t get the movement. The distributor is very  reluctant to bring this product in.”</i></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Customer dissatisfaction related  to the higher cost of organic, bird friendly coffee.</span></i></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> The vendor indicated that cafeteria customers were, in general,  satisfied with the product offerings and services at the Humphrey Building  Cafeteria. However, one specific challenge was related to the transition to  organic, bird friendly coffee. The guidelines’ standard criteria for beverages  state that “if offering coffee or tea, include coffee or tea offerings that are  Certified Organic, shade grown, and/or bird friendly.”</span><a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="" id="_ednref34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">[34]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The vendor transitioned the cafeteria’s  regular coffee to organic, fair trade, bird friendly coffee, which costs  patrons 10 to 15 cents more per cup. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">At first, customers were dissatisfied  with the change. The vendor addressed this challenge by collaborating with GSA  and HHS to launch a successful marketing and education campaign about the  benefits of purchasing organic, bird friendly coffee. A GSA representative  commented: “Because we did a marketing campaign about how this is fair trade  coffee and you are helping local farmers, the negative feedback died down.”  Today, coffee is one of the vendor’s best-selling products. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The vendor also initially received  some complaints that French fries and fried foods were no longer served with  daily specials; over time, patrons have become more receptive to these changes.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Cost increases.</span></i></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> The Humphrey Building vendor purchased several new products to  meet the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>. Such products—sodium-free  and low</span>er <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">sodium products, cage-free eggs, organic  vegetables and yogurt, compostable paper products, and certified green seal  chemicals—are 30 to 50 percent more expensive than everyday items. According to  the vendor, the unit cost is not the only challenge. The vendor observed increased  labor costs associated with preparing organic foods. For example, the chef must  spend more time preparing organic vegetables. One individual noted: “Organic  locally grown products are not as uniform and nice looking…it takes a bit more  work in terms of peeling and slicing and making it look nice.” Additionally,  the guidelines also required the chefs and dietitians to modify recipes and  preparation methods, another indirect labor cost.</span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc336512290" id="_Toc336512290">Performance Oversight in the Humphrey Building  Cafeteria</a> </h2>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor  meets on a monthly basis with HHS to discuss mutual objectives, including but  not limited to service levels, wellness, sustainability menus and marketing  programs. Many individuals commented that GSA and HHS do not “regulate” adherence  to the guidelines. Rather, GSA oversees the process, providing guidance to the  vendors and discussing their progress on meeting the guidelines and next steps.  To do so, GSA meets on a quarterly basis with the vendor to conduct an  operational review of the menu, and review monthly reports on customer  participation and sales. GSA uses a similar operational review process in all  of its 32 facilities that incorporate the <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i>. </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> </span>Additionally, GSA continues to  provide guidance to all vendors about the guidelines through meetings, emails,  and newsletters.  </p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Over time, GSA expects that demand for  healthy products will escalate. GSA plans to increase the percentage of the guidelines  that vendors must meet in response to customer demand and industry direction, resulting  in tiered production of healthy menu items. A representative from GSA noted: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>“We started with  the average of 40 percent [of the menu items meeting the guidelines]…so we  monitor consumption. As the demand is escalating, and that is really consumer  driven, we can up the ante on the number of offers…We tier the production of  menu items that meet the health and wellness criteria alongside demand.”</i></p>

The guidelines recommend that vendors provide <span>consumers with calorie and nutrient information at the  point of choice on a menu board or posted on signs adjacent to the food items.</span>  One of the vendors provides calorie count information on their menu boards, and  supplies a nutrition card with the items that are not on the menu board. This  vendor also plans to promote menu information on LCD screens in the cafeteria.  Another vendor provides calorie information<i> </i>for items at the point of  purchase.

One of the vendors commented that they eliminated the use  of partially hydrogenated oils a couple of years ago by making different  purchasing decisions. Another vendor commented that the company has moved away  from trans-fat products, but some of products contain palm or coconut oil as  substitutes; these oils contain saturated fat. </span></p>

According to  one vendor, while they must follow their clients’ direction and cannot “impose  guidelines on them,” they encourage and help them to establish standards for  healthier and more sustainable food choices. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Vendors also commented that the  guidelines are an opportunity for cross-company learning for their management,  staff, and marketing and communications departments. Three of the vendors  commented that the guidelines might impact the “look and feel” of their  facilities in a positive way. One noted that they have developed “bright and  colorful” materials to engage people at the point of purchase in a “positive  way.” The other two vendors have not changed their marketing approaches as a  result of the guidelines. One vendor remarked that the guidelines offer  opportunities to the vendors that can meet all of the guidelines and make a  profit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc336512296" id="_Toc336512296">Challenges Associated with Implementing the Guidelines</a></h2>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Most vendors acknowledged that  implementing the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i> is a process that  will take time. Each vendor also discussed the challenges associated with  implementing specific guidelines. The most common challenges are described  below.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Meeting the sodium guidelines.</span></i></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Like the Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor, all of the vendors  reported that the sodium guidelines are the “the biggest stumbling block” on  the nutrition side of the <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>. There  are two key challenges associated with sodium: lack of availability of lower sodium  products in the marketplace and consumer acceptance of lower sodium products.  According to vendors, while sodium reduction is a key focus area of the guidelines,  the marketplace does not offer a wide variety of lower sodium products that  meet the guidelines’ standard criteria that all individual food items must  contain ≤480 mg sodium as served. Multiple vendors identified the  availability of lower sodium products as “the biggest problem” and “hurdle”  that they face. Also, vendors noted that customers are acclimated to the high  levels of sodium in foods like pizza and deli meats. Therefore, a few vendors expressed  concern that reductions in sodium could impact customer participation rates: </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> “The average sodium  consumption in the American diet is recommended to be 2,300 [mg], but is  probably in the range of 3,000 to 3,500 [mg] on the low level and 4,500 to  5,000 [mg] [on] the high level in terms of average consumption...If you look at  an average slice of pizza sold on the street...you may be looking at  significantly over 1,000 mg of sodium in a slice of pizza. If you take that  slice of pizza and take it to 480 [mg of sodium] or below, you will have people  going elsewhere for food without a doubt. And we have experienced that.”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> “By just changing something  and saying, across the board, everything is going to be less than 480 mg of  sodium...a person will purchase it and not like the way it tastes, and never  purchase it again. And that’s the end of the experience—finished and over. You  get one shot, I believe.”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i>“<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">We are in a competitive  environment</span></i><i>…<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">customers can easily go outside of  the building and get the products they are looking for if we are not able to  offer them. We are looking at that from the customer perspective.</span></i><i>”</i></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Several vendors commented that the guidelines  should support a more gradual reduction in sodium—such as 10 to 20 percent over  two to three years, and 25 percent over three to six years—or that the guidelines  should place a lower priority on sodium reduction: </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">“The guidelines should be on  cooking with less fat, getting people to eat more whole grain, and leaner meet,  more fruits and vegetables. We can work on sodium later.”</span></i></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Access to local and organic  produce</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  On the sustainability  side, vendors described challenges associated with meeting the guidelines on  organic and locally grown produce (e.g., to meet the standard criteria, 25  percent of the product line must be organic, local or sustainably grown).  Vendor commented that food service operations on the East Coast face challenges  in securing organic and local produce year round: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>“Being on the East Coast, the quality of  organic products is horrible. Trying to meet the guidelines as far as a  percentage of local/organic can be a challenge…We are outside of our local  growing season. May to end of September you can get squashes and greens, but  the availability of local produce drops off the charts. So unless we move our  government to warmer states, the produce will always be an issue for organic  products.”</i></p>
<p class="Casestudytext">At least one vendor commented that<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  there is </span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">no single definition of ‘local:’ </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">“One challenge to implementing the guidelines is the lack of an  objective, accepted definition of ‘local.’” This vendor define</span>d<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> a local product as one that travels less than seven hours by truck  from point of origin to point of consumption. </span>The guidelines use the  USDA definition of local which specifies the number of <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">food  miles (i.e.</span>,<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> transporting a product less than 400  miles from its origin). Another vendor also commented that their company needs  greater specificity on whether the standard criteria in the guidelines related  to local and sustainable apply to limited time offerings in the product line.  </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i>Cost<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">.</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> </span></b>A majority of the vendors <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">expressed  concern that their profit/loss ratio </span>could<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> be affected  by the guidelines. </span>They expressed concern that<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> healthy  items cost more to purchase and prepare. Foods that are more costly include  fresh vegetables and fruits, depending upon the time of the year, and any item  that is fresh and not processed. For example, one vendor explained that tomato  based products are a staple in cafeterias, but they contain a great deal of  sodium. This vendor said that developing tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes rather  than canned tomatoes could be cost prohibitive: “It costs more in labor to be  able to make things from absolute scratch versus 50 percent from scratch.”  Additionally, vendors reported that they would need to provide additional  training to chefs and other staff to prepare healthier options rather than using  as many ready-made products. </span>Another vendor was concerned about  infrastructure costs, noting that <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">some facilities </span>might  need to be upgraded to <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">allow for fresh cooking</span> and  fresh<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> product storage</span>; other facilities might need new  equipment to <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">offer chilled </span>tap <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">water</span>.</p>

<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Vendors identified several factors  that have facilitated (or are expected to facilitate) successful implementation  of the guidelines. </span></p>

One vendor noted that it was important for upper level management to be  supportive of the guidelines and flexible. Their managers and chefs are often  evaluated based on cost—specifically, the cost of the food that they are  producing. This vendor found that implementing the guidelines is associated  with a higher cost, and therefore their management “needs to be more flexible”  in evaluating their profit/loss ratio. Other vendors found that because of the  specialized nature of some of the guidelines, it is helpful to have a dietitian  on staff to interpret the guidelines and plan menu offerings: “Companies will  need to work with a dietitian or food service wellness professional to maintain  the standards and create a menu that reflects these standards.” Finally,  vendors noted that other important players were team members that are  experienced in sourcing products within the supply chain, a designated person  to oversee the operation, and a creative culinary group that can implement the  guidelines on a day-to-day basis.  </span></p>

Specifically, vendors  found that they needed to educate both their own staff as well as consumers  about the guidelines: “The education component is so important. That means  educating the customers but also educating the employees. It really is  important that everybody knows what is going on.” </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Education was described as a  particularly important strategy when transitioning to composting. For example,  one vendor commented that they spent time educating consumers about how to separate  compostable items into various bins, and also educated their back-of-house  staff so that they were able to separate the products to prepare for  composting. Another vendor discussed their efforts to educate consumers about  the value of agricultural best practices. The education piece was thought to be  as critical as offering healthier and more sustainable products. Through  education and marketing, vendors found that they were able to help consumers to  make healthier choices. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Size of Business</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">.</span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> Some vendors found that the size of  their company would contribute to their ability to implement the guidelines.  Larger companies were thought to have the ability to “shift and adjust” to  accommodate the guidelines. A couple of vendors commented that smaller  operations may not be able to offer the same range of product offerings as a  larger company because of cost: “The size of the [cafeteria] may make it more  difficult for smaller businesses to implement the sustainability guidelines  because they do not have the same resources [as a larger business].”  </span></p>

<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Developing and implementing the <i>Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</i> was a transformative process for the  participating agencies and the Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor that piloted  the guidelines. <span>In the past, GSA worked with vendors  to incorporate the <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i> into food service  contracts, though specific recommendations for translating these guidelines  into menu practice were not available. </span>The <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i> represent the first effort to translate the best available  nutrition science and sustainability initiatives into guidance for food service  vendors and provide them with tools to create an environment that is conducive  to wellness.

Further,  the guidelines support vendors in helping consumers to make more informed  decisions about their food.</span></p>

Finding the right products in the marketplace and  identifying purveyors to supply products that meet the guidelines have been  challenges. For example, vendors that serve federal facilities reported that  identifying a range of lower-sodium products is a problem that has yet to be  resolved. However, the guidelines also create a number of opportunities. </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal staff that participated in this process believe that the  guidelines will not only increase food choices available to consumers, but in  the long run, they may gradually improve the market for healthy and sustainable  foods for everyone by impacting the production and manufacturing side of the  food supply chain. </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The Humphrey Building Cafeteria  vendor also found that the experience of implementing the guidelines has  changed the way their company offers and markets foods—not only in their HHS  contract, but in others as well.

Many of these stakeholders also participated in the  development of the RFP and the review of proposals for the Humphrey Building  Cafeteria.

The HHS Café Patrons  Committee garnered feedback from employees, and found that patrons were willing  to invest more in healthier options and greener products. Federal stakeholders  commented that cafeteria patrons’ awareness of the importance of sustainable  practices and their commitment to making healthier choices contributed to a smooth  transition to the guidelines. </span></p>

But that     doesn’t happen unless the customer is in tune and is accepting of the fact     that they will need to pay more for a better product.

<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">The successful implementation of  the guidelines at HHS can be attributed, in part, to effective education and  marketing efforts about health, wellness and sustainability.</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> </span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal stakeholders commented that  customer education about healthier products and sustainability practices  contributed greatly to the success of the implementation of the guidelines.  When the guidelines were piloted at the Humphrey Building, HHS collaborated  with the vendor to communicate the value of the initiative and other important  changes to consumers. Key strategies included marketing through interactive  menu boards, promotions of healthier meals, and information about specific  changes such as composting and sustainable coffee. Federal staff commented that  their educational efforts were important in creating this policy change.  Federal stakeholders reported that agencies or other entities that wish to  implement the guidelines may achieve better outcomes if they collaborate with  their vendor to provide education about nutrition and sustainability, and changes  to product offerings and pricing.</span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal staff offered guidance  to other public and private entities developing a similar RFP based on the Health  and Sustainability Guidelines.</span></i></b><b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> </span></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal staff responded to a final and important question: “</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">If another public or private entity were to develop a similar RFP  based on <i>Health and Sustainability Guidelines</i>, what advice would you  give them?” </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Overall, there were a few categories of  responses. First, </span>federal operations staff<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> said that  it is important to appoint a person to oversee the implementation of the guidelines  in the facility and hold the vendor accountable to meeting the standards.  Federal staff explained that health, wellness, and sustainability are hallmarks  of HHS’ business and mission, and this contribtued to a smooth implementation  of the guidelines. Other public agencies and private entitites that are  implementing the guidelines must be involved in the implementation process and  frequently on site to ensure that the products being provided are healthy and  sustainable.  </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Second, other stakeholders talked  about the importance of the relationship between GSA, the tenant agency</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">, </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">and the vendor.</span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  This relationship is particularly important because these parties are best  suited for creating a process to work within the constraints of the supply chain  to maximize the guidelines and push beyond them. The agency and vendor, in  particular, must collaborate to show the consumer the benefits of supporting  healthier and more sustainable options—both for their own lives and for the  food system. As another stakeholder noted: “The marketing and education…you  cannot underestimate the importance of those pieces.” A high level of buy-in  and commitment from all parties was found to be critical. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">A final theme was that responsibility of  the tenant agency to demonstrate their commitment to health and wellness  programs and communicate that commitment to employees before they ever enter  the cafeteria. One stakeholder commented that </span><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">“one of  the things that we have learned is that vendors say that they will give you whatever  you want, but if your people don’t want it, they will go back to selling what  makes money.” The tenant agency needs to be involved in driving the changes  that they have asked for in the RFP. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Stakeholders believe that the <i>Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</i> and the RFP developed as part of this process  will help agencies and vendors to customize their offerings based on the  targeted consumer base while still driving improvements. </span></p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Fu</span>ture<span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">  research should track the long-term impacts of the guidelines on consumer  demand, the food supply chain, and the hospitality and manufacturing  industries, more generally. </span>Additionally, future studies on the  guidelines could incorporate customer feedback about whether they select  healthier menu offerings and why.  <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Based on this study, GSA  may consider developing a mechanism for</span> documenting vendors’ progress  over time; identifying challenges and opportunities; and sharing best practices  that would be of interest to other food service operations that are  implementing the <i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Health and Sustainability Guidelines.</span></i></p>

<p class="Casestudytext"><b><i><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Federal staff interviews.</span></i></b><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE"> NORC conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with seven  federal staff from HHS and GSA. The purpose of the federal official interviews  was to gather detailed information about the development of the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i>, and the implementation of those guidelines in  the Humphrey Building Cafeteria RFP. HHS and GSA collaborated with NORC to  identify the appropriate federal staff to participate in the interviews. NORC  recruited each individual by sending that individual an advance letter via  email. The letter explained the purpose of the case study and requested  participation in an interview. Topics for the interviews included: </span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Process used to develop the Health and Sustainability Guidelines</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Process used to develop the RFP for the Humphrey Building  Cafeteria</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Factors that facilitated the development of the RFP</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>How the implementation of the guidelines may impact vendors</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Lessons learned</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Telephone  interviews with federal staff lasted between 45 and 60 minutes each, and were  conducted between October and December 2011. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Vendor interviews.</i></b>  Interviews were conducted with nine representatives from seven different  federal food service vendors that serve the Capital Region, including the  current Humphrey Building Cafeteria vendor. The purpose of the interviews was  to learn about federal food service vendors’ perspectives on the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i> and possible implications for their business  and/or the industry as a whole.  </p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Two representatives of the vendor that currently holds the  Humphrey Building Cafeteria contract. </p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Seven individuals that represented six other vendors (two individuals  represented the same vendor organization). Four of the six vendors reported  that they have implemented all or some of the <i>Health and Sustainability  Guidelines</i>. Two vendor representatives were familiar with the <i>Health and  Sustainability Guidelines</i>, but their organization has not yet implemented  them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">GSA identified the  company representatives for the vendor interviews from the food service  industry to participate in the interviews. NORC developed an advance letter,  and GSA sent the advance letter to each vendor via email to secure their  participation. The advance letter explained the purpose of the case study and  how the information would be used. Specifically, the advance letter informed  the individuals that their name and the name of their organization would not be  used in the case study. However, NORC did not promise confidentiality given the  limited number of vendors that serve federal food service contracts in the  Capital Region. GSA also contacted a representative from each vendor to  personally invite them to participate in the case study. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The vendor  representatives who participated in the interviews may or may not have  submitted a response to the Humphrey Building Cafeteria RFP. Not all of the  vendors that were selected to participate in interviews were implementing the <i>Health  and Sustainability Guidelines</i> at the time of the interview. Prior to each  interview, NORC sent each individual the following list of possible discussion  topics: </p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Familiarity with the Health and Sustainability Guidelines</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Implications of the guidelines for their business (e.g., profits  versus costs, food delivery, product offerings, look and feel of the cafeteria,  sustainability, green purchasing)</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Experience incorporating the guidelines, if applicable</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Types of challenges and opportunities that food service vendors  may face as a result of the guidelines</p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span>►<span>       </span></span>Factors that may facilitate the implementation of the guidelines  by food service vendors</p>
<p class="Casestudytext"><span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">Positions held by vendor  representatives included: president (1), vice president (3), communications  director (1), wellness director (1), corporate chef (1), and purchasing manager  (1). One vendor elected to invite a consultant who provides support to their  organization on health and wellness topics to represent the vendor. Telephone  interviews lasted between 45 and 60 minutes, and were conducted between  December 2011 and January 2012.</span></p>

The work group was first convened in the early stages of  the project. Through several conference calls, and one in-person meeting, federal  staff played a key role in framing the goals of this research, and provided  feedback on the study design and data collection instruments at multiple points  in the project. HHS and GSA were also involved in selecting the </span>interviews  <span lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE">for this study.
