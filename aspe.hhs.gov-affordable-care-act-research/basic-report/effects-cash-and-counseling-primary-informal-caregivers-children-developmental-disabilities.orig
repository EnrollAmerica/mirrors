<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p><b>Cash and Counseling Is a Promising Model of Medicaid Supportive  		Services </b></p>
<p>Because parents and other relatives provide vital, unpaid personal care  		to children with developmental disabilities, promoting the well-being of these  		informal caregivers is an important policy objective. The <i>paid</i>  		supportive services that children receive in addition to unpaid care could  		profoundly affect the informal caregivers who help them most. This study  		assesses the effects of consumer direction on the experiences and well-being of  		the primary informal caregivers of children who participated in Florida's Cash  		and Counseling demonstration. Instead of Medicaid home and community-based  		services (HCBS) waiver benefits, the demonstration program, Consumer Directed  		Care (CDC), provided a monthly allowance and let parents hire providers and  		manage the other services and goods their child needed. </p>
<p><b>A Rigorous Design and Comprehensive Survey Data Provided Definitive  		Evidence </b></p>
<p>Our analysis included the 829 caregivers--mostly mothers--who were  		providing the most unpaid assistance to children when the children were  		randomly assigned to participate in CDC (the treatment group) or to continue  		receiving HCBS waiver benefits as usual (the control group). We hypothesized  		that the amounts, types, and quality of services and goods that parents  		arranged for their children under CDC, with the support of the program's  		counseling and fiscal services, would affect caregivers' emotional, physical,  		and financial well-being. Becoming a child's paid worker or the  		"representative" responsible for managing a child's care also could affect  		these outcomes. </p>
<p>We constructed outcome variables from computer-assisted telephone  		interviews conducted with caregivers between April 2001 and June 2002, about 10  		months after children's random assignment. We asked caregivers factual  		questions about the frequency, amounts, timing, and types of assistance they  		provided, as well as about their labor force participation and income. We asked  		their opinions on the quality of their relationship with the child they  		assisted, their satisfaction with the child's overall care arrangements, and  		their own health and emotional, physical, and financial well-being. To estimate  		program effects, we compared these outcomes for the caregivers of treatment  		group children with those for the caregivers of control group children.  		Regression models controlled for the baseline characteristics of children and  		the demographic characteristics of caregivers. </p>
<p><b>Caregivers Reported Greater Well-Being Under CDC </b></p>
<p>At the time of our interviews, treatment group caregivers still provided  		as much overall assistance as did control group caregivers, yet they reported  		greater satisfaction with the child's care and less physical strain on  		themselves. Treatment group caregivers were more likely than their control  		group counterparts to be in the labor force and less likely to say that  		caregiving caused them great financial strain. Treatment group caregivers also  		were more likely to be very satisfied with how they were spending their own  		lives. As expected, some treatment group caregivers (21 percent) were paid for  		caregiving during the follow-up period. The program's estimated impacts on some  		outcomes were especially large for these sample members. </p>
<p>These findings, coupled with earlier findings about the effects of the  		CDC program on children's service use and care quality, suggest that the  		program may be a desirable option to offer the parents of children receiving  		HCBS waiver benefits. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver programs  		provide vital supportive benefits to children with developmental disabilities.  		For some families, however, the programs have drawbacks. States limit the  		types, amounts, and providers of HCBS that they cover, and case managers or  		support coordinators often decide which of the covered benefits a child  		receives. If parents find HCBS benefits unsatisfactory or too inflexible to  		meet their child's needs, they may forgo benefits or try to compensate for  		their shortcomings by placing more burden on themselves or other unpaid  		caregivers. </p>
<p>In contrast to traditional HCBS waiver programs, Cash and Counseling  		programs provide parents with a monthly allowance to arrange and pay for their  		child's supportive service benefits as they see fit. Parents who control their  		child's benefits may be more satisfied with the benefits. In turn, parents' own  		well-being, or that of other caregivers, might improve. </p>
<p>This report describes the effects of Florida's Cash and Counseling  		demonstration program, Consumer Directed Care (CDC), on the caregivers who were  		providing the most unpaid assistance to children when their parents voluntarily  		enrolled those children in the demonstration. This report follows another one  		containing earlier findings, which showed that the parents of children randomly  		assigned to participate in the CDC program were more satisfied with the  		children's care than were the parents of children randomly assigned to receive  		traditional HCBS (Foster et al. 2004). </p>
<h2><a name="model" id="model">A NEW MODEL OF MEDICAID SUPPORTIVE SERVICES</a></h2>
<p>About 1.4 million Medicaid beneficiaries receive disability-related  		supportive service benefits in their homes (Harrington and Kitchener 2003).  		Most receive traditional HCBS or state plan personal care services, but states  		increasingly are allowing beneficiaries or their parents to direct some aspects  		of their care, as service "consumers" (O'Brien and Elias 2004). In 1999, an  		estimated 139 publicly funded consumer-directed programs served adults or  		children with physical or developmental disabilities (Flanagan 2001). </p>
<p>Compared with programs that merely allow consumers to choose paid  		workers, Cash and Counseling programs represent a fairly expansive model of  		consumer-directed care. The programs give consumers the opportunity to receive  		a monthly allowance with which to hire workers and purchase services and goods  		related to their care (within state guidelines). Parents manage the allowance  		for children, and adult consumers can designate a representative decision maker  		(such as a family caregiver) to help them manage their care. The programs also  		offer counseling and fiscal services to help consumers and representatives  		handle their program responsibilities. These tenets of Cash and Counseling--a  		flexible allowance, freedom to use representatives, and availability of  		counseling and fiscal services--are meant to make the model adaptable to  		consumers of all ages and abilities. </p>
<p>As part of a three state demonstration, Arkansas, Florida, and New  		Jersey have each tested the Cash and Counseling model in their Medicaid  		programs. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the U.S. Department of Health  		and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation, funded the demonstration. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services issued the waivers required for states to implement it. The National  		Program Office for the demonstration, at Boston College and the University of  		Maryland, coordinated the overall demonstration, provided technical assistance  		to the states, and oversaw the evaluation. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.  		(MPR) is the demonstration evaluator. </p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY OF THE DEMONSTRATION IN FLORIDA</a><sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></h2>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>By participating in the Cash and Counseling demonstration, Florida  		wished to promote the independence of people with disabilities, offer services  		that would better meet families' needs, and encourage the prudent use of public  		resources. Parents who participated in focus groups conducted to aid the design  		of the demonstration said they wanted a program that would give them  		decision-making power, flexibility, and privacy; allow them to choose  		caregivers whom they trusted and their children liked; and help them obtain  		respite for themselves without unduly infringing on others (Zacharias 1998;  		Simon-Rusinowitz et al. 1998). </p>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>Children 3-17 years of age who were receiving benefits under Florida's  		HCBS Developmental Disabilities (DD) waiver program were eligible to  		participate in the Cash and Counseling demonstration.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a>, <a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> Children qualified for  		the DD program on the basis of level of need; intelligence quotient; a  		diagnosis of mental retardation, autism, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, or  		Prader-Willi syndrome; and limitations in self-care, understanding and use of  		language, learning, mobility, or self-direction or capacity for independent  		living (Florida Medicaid 2004). </p>
<h3>Covered Benefits</h3>
<p>The CDC program offered an allowance instead of the benefits the DD  		program usually provided. For example, in the DD program, children with spina  		bifida might have received supplies to care for incontinence and pressure  		sores. Children with autism might have received behavior therapy to address  		self-injurious tendencies. In general, according to Medicaid claims data, the  		benefits that had most commonly been provided to children who enrolled in the  		Cash and Counseling demonstration were supplies and equipment (provided to 71  		of children in their preenrollment year), personal care services (provided to  		53 percent), and therapy services, such as behavioral, mental health, and  		habilitation therapy (32 percent). Smaller proportions of children had received  		such benefits as environmental modifications (6 percent), professional services  		(3 percent), private-duty nursing (1 percent), and transportation (0.5  		percent).<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Enrollment and Random Assignment</h3>
<p>Florida, like the other demonstration states, was responsible for its  		own outreach and enrollment activities, including the collection of informed  		consent and basic intake data (such as contact information). Florida introduced  		the demonstration to all eligible families through a letter from the governor's  		office and during routine home visits conducted by support coordinators in the  		DD program. Later in the enrollment period, dedicated enrollment specialists  		conducted home visits. Within a week of each child's enrollment, MPR conducted  		a baseline telephone interview with one of the child's parents, then randomly  		assigned the child to the treatment group (to participate in CDC) or the  		control group (to receive DD benefits as usual). The enrollment and random  		assignment of Florida children began in June 2000 and continued until the  		evaluation target of 1,000 enrollees was met in August 2001.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Half the children were randomly  		assigned to the treatment group. </p>
<h3>Calculation of the CDC Allowance</h3>
<p>When parents expressed an interest in the demonstration, CDC program  		staff calculated a baseline program allowance for their child. The allowance  		amount was equal to the costs of the benefits in the child's existing DD  		support plan times a discount factor (0.92). The costs of support coordination  		services were excluded from the allowance, because the state would use  		equivalent funds to pay for the consulting services provided under CDC.  		(Florida used the term "consulting," rather than "counseling," in its  		demonstration program.) The discount factor was used to help Florida meet  		federal budget neutrality standards for the demonstration. At baseline, the  		median allowance for children who enrolled in the demonstration was $768 per  		month. (The mean was $1,109.) </p>
<h3>Permitted Uses of the Allowance</h3>
<p>After a child was assigned to participate in CDC, the parent (or  		guardian) serving as the child's representative in the program had to write a  		plan that specified the goods and services to be purchased with the monthly  		allowance. Although purchases had to be related to the child's needs for home  		and community support, the state viewed needs broadly. Parents could use the  		allowance to hire their choice of workers--including themselves and other  		family members--to care for their child.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> They could also use it, for example, to pay  		professional therapists and nurses, purchase experimental therapies, or buy  		bulk-rate care supplies. They could save a portion of the allowance for large  		purchases (such as home modifications) or receive up to 20 percent of it as  		cash each month for incidental expenditures specified in the spending plan  		(such as fare for public transportation). District-level staff reviewed all  		spending plans and approved or denied them. </p>
<h3>Consulting and Fiscal Services</h3>
<p>Parents were offered the assistance of a CDC consultant and fiscal  		agent. Consultants interacted with parents to: (1) develop, review, and revise  		the allowance spending plan; (2) offer advice about recruiting, hiring, and  		training workers; (3) monitor children's well-being; and (4) monitor use of the  		allowance. This interaction took place during monthly telephone calls and  		periodic home visits, including a mandatory initial home visit. During these  		interactions, consultants were to serve as advisers, not decision makers.  		Moreover, unlike support coordinators in the DD waiver program, consultants did  		not coordinate and access goods and services on behalf of families. Consultant  		services were offered at no direct charge to parents. </p>
<p>Parents also were offered assistance with fiscal tasks. They could  		choose to have the CDC fiscal agent maintain their program-related accounts,  		withhold payroll taxes for paid workers, file payroll tax returns, and write  		checks against the allowance to pay wages and purchase other goods and  		services. Alternatively, parents who showed they could handle such tasks  		themselves, by passing a skills examination, could perform the tasks and submit  		to a monthly "desk review" of their program-related records. Nearly all parents  		chose the comprehensive fiscal services. They paid $5 per check, up to a $25  		per month maximum. (The program charged $10 per month for desk reviews.) </p>
<h2><a name="consumer" id="consumer">CONSUMER DIRECTION AND CHILDREN'S INFORMAL  		CAREGIVERS</a></h2>
<h3>Previous Research</h3>
<p>This report provides rigorous, empirical evidence on how an innovative  		model of paid supportive services affects the well-being of children's unpaid  		caregivers. It thus bridges an extensive literature on caring for children with  		developmental disabilities and a more nascent one on consumer-directed care.  		</p>
<p>In trying to obtain adequate services for a child with developmental  		disabilities, parents face many challenges. According to a recent national  		survey, 48 percent of parents with a child who was eligible for home health  		care services had difficulty finding skilled, experienced, or reliable workers  		or could not obtain enough services for the child (Wells et al. 2000).  		Moreover, substantial proportions of parents said the child had unmet needs for  		nutritional supplements (38 percent), durable medical equipment (31 percent),  		or disposable medical supplies (26 percent). </p>
<p>Parents also face obstacles as they attempt to preserve their own  		well-being and that of other family members while meeting the needs of a child  		with disabilities. According to the national survey just cited, 46 percent of  		parents were dissatisfied with respite services, or needed them but could not  		get them. According to another national survey, 53 percent of parents of  		children with developmental and intellectual disabilities reported that caring  		for such children caused a family member to make a major accommodation (such as  		not taking a job, working fewer hours, or changing sleep patterns) or caused  		severe financial problems (Anderson et al. 2002). </p>
<p>The literature also identifies a paradox in which supportive services  		designed for children with developmental disabilities at times conflict with  		the interests of parents and other family members (Rosenau 2000). Indeed, in  		1997, when a representative sample of Florida parents were asked about their  		potential interest in Cash and Counseling, 55 percent thought consumer  		direction would make their job easier, but 37 percent were unsure, and 7  		percent thought it would make their job harder (Loughlin et al. 2004). Since  		then, the Cash and Counseling evaluation has yielded ample evidence that the  		CDC program positively affected parents' satisfaction with children's care and  		quality of life (Foster et al. 2004). However, the effects of the program on  		the well-being of parents or other primary informal caregivers merit attention.  		Do children's benefits translate into caregiver benefits or greater caregiver  		strain? What mechanisms lead to gains or losses? </p>
<h3>Hypotheses About Caregiver Outcomes</h3>
<p>As noted earlier, parents in the CDC program could change their child's  		use of Medicaid supportive services in many ways. These changes, in turn, could  		affect:</p>
<ul><li>The amount of assistance that primary informal caregivers  		  provided.</li>
<li>The quality of relationships between caregivers and children.</li>
<li>Caregivers' satisfaction with children's supportive services.</li>
<li>Caregivers' emotional and physical well-being.</li>
<li>Caregivers' job performance and financial well-being.</li>
<li>Caregivers' satisfaction with life. </li>
</ul><p>The amount of assistance that primary informal caregivers provided could  		increase or decrease, depending on whether they were hired to perform  		additional tasks for children (beyond those performed without pay) or whether  		other workers were hired to relieve them of some burden. </p>
<p>The quality of relationships between caregivers and children could  		improve if the arrangements made under CDC helped both parties feel more at  		ease. Similarly, caregivers' satisfaction and well-being could be favorably  		affected if the program allowance was used to: (1) relieve caregivers of some  		difficult, unpleasant, time-consuming, or inconvenient tasks; (2) replace  		unsatisfactory service providers with ones whom the caregivers or children  		preferred; or (3) purchase assistive devices that enhanced children's  		independence and lessened caregivers' physical strain. Caregivers' financial  		well-being could improve if they became paid workers in the CDC program or if  		children's participation in the program gave caregivers enough flexibility to  		enter the labor force or change jobs. </p>
<p>Conversely, children's participation in the CDC program could be  		detrimental to the caregivers who had helped them most. Caregivers could  		experience physical and emotional stress if they assumed responsibilities that  		agency workers had handled or if parents could not recruit qualified service  		providers. Serving as children's CDC representatives could be a burden for  		caregivers if they felt the program's consulting and fiscal services did not  		give them enough professional support. </p>

<h3>Data Collection and Sample</h3>
<p>Data on the types of outcomes listed in the previous section were  		collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews with the primary  		informal caregivers of children who participated in the Florida demonstration.  		(Appendix <a href="#tableB1">Table B.1</a> lists all the outcome measures  		examined.) The interviews were conducted about 10 months after children were  		randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. Parents had named their  		child's primary informal caregiver and provided the caregiver's telephone  		number during the baseline interview. To identify the primary informal  		caregiver, we asked the responding parent which person (if any) had provided  		the most unpaid assistance to their child during the previous week with  		personal care, doing things around the house and community, routine health  		care, and transportation. Between April 2001 and June 2002, interviews were  		completed with 829 caregivers. (Proxy respondents were not allowed.) The  		response rates were 87 percent for the caregivers of children in the treatment  		group and 82 percent for the caregivers of children in the control group. </p>
<p>To preserve the benefits of random assignment and obtain a complete  		picture of caregivers' experiences, interviews were conducted even if the child  		who was the care recipient had disenrolled from CDC (12 percent of children had  		disenrolled; not shown). The few caregivers (1.7 percent of the sample) who had  		not helped children during a two week reference period used throughout the  		interview also were included in the sample. Interviewers generally asked these  		caregivers to recall the period when they were last helping. However, questions  		were skipped if recall error seemed likely (for example, in questions measuring  		hours of assistance). </p>
<h3>Estimation of Program Effects</h3>
<p><b>Models</b>. The analysis used logit models to estimate program  		effects on categorical outcomes, an ordered logit to estimate effects on  		caregivers' level of household income, and ordinary least squares (OLS) models  		to estimate effects on the amount of assistance caregivers provided. </p>
<p>Many outcome measures were constructed by converting responses to survey  		questions with four-point scales (for example, degree of satisfaction) into two  		alternative binary measures. One measure represented the most favorable rating  		(very satisfied), the other an unfavorable rating (somewhat or very  		dissatisfied).<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> We used  		this approach so readers could easily see the basis on which we drew inferences  		about the key questions for each outcome: Did consumer direction increase the  		proportion of highly satisfied caregivers, reduce the proportion of  		dissatisfied ones, or have both (or neither) effects? </p>
<p>Except for treatment-control differences in the amount of care provided  		(which were estimated with OLS regression), we measured program impacts by  		using the estimated coefficients from the logit models to calculate the  		treatment-control difference in average predicted probabilities that the binary  		dependent variable took a value of 1. The p-values of the estimated  		coefficients on the treatment status variable are reported in our tables and  		were used to test whether treatment-control differences were significantly  		different from zero. </p>
<p><b>Control Variables</b>. The models controlled for many characteristics  		measured during baseline interviews. (Appendix <a href="#tableB2">Table B.2</a>  		lists all the control variables.) These included children's demographic  		characteristics, health and functioning, use of paid and unpaid supportive  		services, and month of enrollment in the demonstration. They also included the  		responding parent's hiring and supervisory experience, satisfaction with the  		child's overall care arrangements, perception of the child's unmet needs, and  		attitudes about consumer direction. The models controlled for the familial  		relationship between children and the primary informal caregiver, and whether  		caregivers were employed and interested in being paid for caregiving, as  		reported by parents at baseline. Finally, the models controlled for the basic  		demographic characteristics of the primary informal caregivers, which were  		collected during interviews with them. </p>
<p>Although nearly all the characteristics were distributed similarly  		across the treatment and control groups (as expected with random assignment), a  		few treatment-control differences emerged within the subset of children whose  		primary informal caregivers responded to our survey, whether by chance or  		differential attrition (Appendix <a href="#tableB2">Table B.2</a>). As noted,  		the regression models controlled for these differences.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b> Statistical Power</b>. With 829 primary informal caregivers in the  		analysis sample, we had 80 percent power to detect impacts of 8.6 percentage  		points for binary outcome variables with means of .50, assuming two-tailed  		tests at the .05 significance level (Appendix <a href="#tableB3">Table  		B.3</a>). For binary variables with a mean of .10 or .90, the detectable  		difference was 5.2 percentage points. For the 736 live-in caregivers who  		reported the number of hours of (paid and unpaid) care they provided to the  		child during a two-week reference period, a continuous variable, we had 80  		percent power to detect impacts of 8.7 hours (10 percent of the unadjusted  		mean), again assuming a two-tailed test at the .05 level. </p>
<h3>Baseline Characteristics of Children and Their Primary  		Informal Caregivers</h3>
<p>Two-thirds of the children who received assistance from the caregivers  		in our sample were boys, 8 of 10 were White, and 7 of 10 were younger than age  		13 (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Slightly more than half the children lived  		in parts of Florida that parents described as rural or as having high crime or  		poor public transportation--conditions that could make it difficult for home  		care agencies to recruit staff or for treatment group families to hire workers  		other than nearby family and friends. At baseline, about 13 percent of parents  		said their child's health was poor, and many said the child needed help with  		basic activities. </p>

<h3>Receipt and Use of the Allowance in the Treatment  		Group</h3>
<p>As noted earlier, the parents of children randomly assigned to the CDC  		program could receive their child's monthly allowance if they developed an  		acceptable spending plan. By the time caregivers were interviewed for this  		analysis, 72 percent of children had started on the allowance. Furthermore,  		although this analysis is of people who provided unpaid care at baseline, 21  		percent of treatment group caregivers were paid for caregiving during the  		follow-up period. On average, these caregivers were paid for about 19 hours of  		care per week and earned $12 an hour. </p>
<h3>Estimated Program Effects</h3>
<p>As noted, program effects were estimated over all responding primary  		informal caregivers for treatment and control group children, whether or not  		the CDC allowance was received or used to hire workers. Because payment of  		caregivers was a program effect, however, it and its influence on other  		outcomes are important to measure. Thus, following the presentation of overall  		program effects, this report discusses the characteristics associated with  		becoming paid, describes caregivers' self-reported reasons for remaining  		unpaid, and examines the extent to which outcomes differed by whether  		caregivers became paid workers. </p>
<p><b>Amounts of Assistance</b>.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> The caregivers in this analysis devoted  		substantial amounts of time to activities that exclusively benefited the child  		who was the care recipient (such as help eating and bathing) and to activities  		that may also have benefited others in the household (such as preparing meals  		and doing laundry). The CDC program did not seem to affect the amount of  		assistance caregivers provided (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>). During a  		two-week period shortly before we interviewed them, caregivers who lived with  		the care recipient (96 percent of the sample) provided roughly 157 hours of  		assistance to the child or to the child and other household members. Slightly  		more than half these hours were spent meeting the needs of the child  		exclusively (82 hours in two weeks--or 5.8 hours per day--among caregivers in  		the treatment group, and 86 hours in two weeks--or 6.2 hours per day--among  		caregivers in the control group). </p>
<p><b>Quality of Relationships with Children</b>. Of three outcomes used to  		measure the quality of relationships between caregivers and children, the CDC  		program seemed to affect one (<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>). It did <i>not</i>  		affect the proportion of caregivers reporting that the child sometimes refused  		to cooperate when they tried to help the child (as about half of both groups  		reported) or the proportion who said they got along very well with the child  		(as roughly 9 of 10 in both groups reported). However, treatment group  		caregivers were significantly more likely than control group caregivers to say  		their relationship with the child had improved since the child's enrollment in  		the demonstration (39 versus 30 percent). </p>

Smaller proportions of treatment group caregivers than of control group  		caregivers said they worried quite a lot that the child who was their care  		recipient would not get enough care in their absence (47 versus 65 percent),  		that the child's safety was at risk (44 versus 57 percent), or that someone  		would take money or other family belongings (25 versus 35 percent).

</tr></table><p><b>Job Performance and Financial Well-Being</b>. Although many sample  		members said caregiving adversely affected their job performance and financial  		well-being, treatment group caregivers fared somewhat better than control group  		caregivers on three important measures (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>).  		Treatment group caregivers were somewhat more likely than control group  		caregivers to work for pay (other than through the CDC program) (62 versus 57  		percent). They also reported higher household income and less financial strain,  		on average. Specifically, a somewhat larger proportion of treatment group  		caregivers than control group caregivers reported household income of more than  		$3,000 per month (34 versus 28 percent). Treatment group caregivers were about  		a fifth less likely than control group caregivers to experience a great deal of  		financial strain as a result of caregiving, and they were about two-thirds more  		likely to experience little or no strain (-11.9/55.6 = -.214; 8.0/12.0 = .666).  		</p>
<p>Within the subset of caregivers who worked for pay (other than through  		the CDC program), however, those in the treatment group were not significantly  		less likely than those in the control group to say they quit their job or  		reduced their hours, or declined a better job or promotion, because of  		caregiving (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>). Caregivers in both groups were  		equally likely to miss work or arrive late. </p>

</tr></table><h3>Primary Informal Caregivers Who Became Paid Workers</h3>
<p><b>Explanatory Variables</b>. Under the CDC program, treatment group  		caregivers continued to provide many hours of assistance to children, but only  		about one-fifth were paid for some of those hours. We estimated the odds that  		caregivers became paid workers as a function of their observable  		characteristics and those of children. (The dependent variable was a binary  		self-reported measure of whether the caregiver had been paid for helping the  		child at any time since enrollment, even if he or she was not the  		<i>primary</i> paid worker.) </p>
<p>The amount of the CDC allowance and children's needs for personal care  		were strongly associated with primary informal caregivers becoming paid  		workers. The larger the allowance, the greater the likelihood of payment.  		Compared with caregivers for children in the lowest allowance category (less  		than $150 per week), caregivers had 1.8 times the odds of becoming paid if the  		allowance was between $150 and $299, 2.4 times the odds if the allowance was  		between $300 and $499 per week, and 3.4 times the odds if the allowance was  		$500 or more per week. Moreover, if children had unmet needs for personal care  		at baseline in their parent's opinion, their primary informal caregiver was 2.6  		times more likely to get paid for caregiving than if there were no perceived  		unmet need. </p>
<p>All else equal, the primary caregivers <i>least</i> likely to become  		paid workers were children's parents (the odds ratio was 0.3) and those who  		were married (the odds ratio was 0.5). (Appendix <a href="#tableC4">Table  		C.4</a> shows the estimated odds ratios of all variables in the model.) </p>
<p><b>Reasons for Remaining Unpaid</b>. Treatment group caregivers who were  		<i>not</i> paid for caregiving at the time of their interview were asked why  		not. (The survey question was openended, but interviewers used a precoded list  		to record responses.) Fully 38 percent of caregivers said they did not know  		they could be paid or believed it was against program rules (Appendix  		<a href="#tableC5">Table C.5</a>). Helping the child out of love, devotion, or  		family tradition was the second most common reason caregivers remained unpaid  		(cited by 35 percent). Smaller proportions of caregivers said that someone else  		was available for hire or that they could not perform the required tasks, lived  		far away, or had other obligations (8 percent). Others said the monthly  		allowance was not large enough to pay them or was needed for other things (7  		percent). Three percent of caregivers said they intended to become paid as soon  		as the plan for spending the child's allowance was approved. </p>
<p><b>Estimated Effects of Payment</b>. To explore whether the CDC program  		affected paid and unpaid treatment group caregivers differently, we estimated  		separate program effects for each of these subsets. For 8 of 14 measures of  		well-being and satisfaction, paid and unpaid treatment group caregivers both  		fared significantly better than did control group caregivers. In most of these  		instances (six of the eight), however, the estimated program effects were  		substantially larger for paid caregivers than for unpaid ones. Thus, it seems  		that getting paid for caregiving was not the sole reason treatment group  		caregivers reported better outcomes than control group caregivers, but getting  		paid did seem to increase the magnitude of most treatment-control differences.  		We discuss specific findings below.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Both subsets of treatment group caregivers (paid and unpaid) fared  		better than control group caregivers with respect to being very satisfied or  		dissatisfied with the child's care arrangements, being very satisfied or  		dissatisfied with their own lives, worrying quite a lot about insufficient  		care, and experiencing physical health problems as a result of caregiving  		(Appendix <a href="#tableC6">Table C.6</a>). However, except for being  		dissatisfied with care arrangements and worrying a lot about insufficient care,  		the estimated effects were a good deal larger for paid than unpaid caregivers  		(relative to all caregivers in the control group). </p>
<p>For four of the remaining six satisfaction and well-being outcomes, paid  		treatment group caregivers fared significantly better than control group  		caregivers, but unpaid treatment group caregivers fared about the same as  		control group caregivers. Specifically, only paid treatment group caregivers  		fared better than control group caregivers with respect to privacy and free  		time, experiencing a great deal of emotional strain as a result of caregiving,  		and feeling well informed about the child's condition and service needs  		(Appendix <a href="#tableC6">Table C.6</a>). For the other two  		variables--rarely worrying about insufficient help and feeling little or no  		emotional strain--unpaid treatment group caregivers fared better than control  		group caregivers, while paid treatment group caregivers fared no differently  		than control group caregivers. </p>
<p>Although the CDC program seemed not to affect the amount of assistance  		caregivers provided overall (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>), we examined  		whether this was true for both paid and unpaid treatment group caregivers. We  		found two effects of borderline significance. Paid treatment group caregivers  		provided assistance more frequently than did control group caregivers (on 0.4  		more days of 14) (Appendix <a href="#tableC7">Table C.7</a>). In addition,  		live-in unpaid treatment group caregivers provided seven fewer hours of  		assistance to the child who was the care recipient than control group  		caregivers provided during the two-week reference period. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<h3>Summary and Interpretation</h3>
<p>Florida's CDC program tested the Cash and Counseling model of delivering  		Medicaid HCBS to children with developmental disabilities. The program had the  		primary goal of improving care quality and satisfaction by increasing parental  		control over children's benefits. In turn, the program was expected to improve  		the well-being of each child's primary informal caregiver, who was typically  		(but not always) a parent. However, because program participation imparted  		considerable responsibility to parents, we speculated that caregiver well-being  		might not improve, even though the program met its primary goal. </p>
<p>Regardless of children's random assignment status, the informal  		caregivers who responded to our survey devoted many hours to caregiving and to  		meeting the needs of all household members. Many caregivers experienced  		emotional, physical, and financial strain. Although CDC did not eradicate  		strain, it appeared to alleviate it, according to most of the measures used.  		Overall, treatment group caregivers provided as much assistance as did control  		group caregivers, yet they reported better satisfaction and well-being.  		Treatment group caregivers were substantially less prone to worrying about  		insufficient care and safety, and they were much more likely to be very  		satisfied with the child's overall care arrangements. Treatment group  		caregivers were somewhat more likely than their control group counterparts to  		work for pay (other than through CDC itself), and they were considerably less  		likely to say caregiving caused them a great deal of financial strain. They  		were also less likely to say caregiving was physically harmful. Treatment group  		caregivers were more likely than control group caregivers to be very satisfied  		with their own lives. </p>
<p>These findings indicate that caregivers derived benefits from the  		control and flexibility that the CDC program gave parents. Viewed with findings  		from the nine-month follow-up survey of parents (see Foster et al. 2004), they  		suggest that caregiver well-being improved because parents successfully  		recruited qualified service providers, assigned tasks appropriate to the  		abilities and availability of those providing paid and unpaid assistance to the  		child, paid some of the caregivers in this sample, and freed some to pursue  		other paid work. </p>
<p>Although Florida did not impose hiring restrictions during the  		demonstration, only a minority of caregivers (21 percent of those in the  		treatment group) were paid during the follow-up period. Parents, in particular,  		were less likely than other caregivers to become paid. Interview responses  		suggest that not getting paid was a choice for some and a misunderstanding of  		program policies for others. The observed associations between caregiver  		payment and sample members' baseline characteristics suggest that caregivers  		were most likely to become paid if children had unmet needs for personal care  		or if the monthly allowance was sufficiently generous. The estimated effects of  		payment on caregiver outcomes suggest that caregivers fared better under the  		CDC program than they would have under Florida's traditional DD program,  		whether or not they became paid workers. However, those who became paid seemed  		to fare especially well--differences between their outcomes and those of  		control group caregivers often were larger than differences between unpaid  		treatment group caregivers and control group caregivers. </p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>This analysis was based on a randomized design and yielded estimated  		program effects that were quite large and consistent across many types of  		measures. Moreover, the effects were consistent with those for the primary  		informal caregivers of adult consumers in Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey  		(Foster et al. 2005). Nonetheless, a few caveats are warranted about study  		duration, possible reporting bias, and the desirability of additional data.  		</p>
<p>First, because our follow-up period was short, we do not know whether  		the positive effects observed for treatment group caregivers would persist. For  		example, improvements in the satisfaction and well-being of caregivers might  		not last if the gratification derived from getting paid for caregiving were to  		diminish, or if parents made short-term or otherwise unstable care  		arrangements. </p>
<p>Second, some treatment group caregivers might have inflated reports on  		some outcomes, such as their own health status, because they believed CDC  		served the child's (or their own) interests and wanted the program to continue  		or because they valued the income earned by household members who were paid as  		part of the program. Conversely, some caregivers for control group children  		might have overstated their dissatisfaction or burden because they were  		disappointed that the child had not been randomly assigned to the treatment  		group. </p>
<p>Third, having data on additional caregiver characteristics would enrich  		our analysis. For example, having data on caregivers' baseline health status  		and levels of strain would have enabled us to determine how CDC affected  		subgroups of caregivers defined by those characteristics. In addition, if the  		models used to estimate program effects had controlled for such variables, we  		would be more confident in concluding that observed differences in the outcomes  		between paid and unpaid caregivers actually resulted from their payment status  		and not from unobserved differences between the groups. </p>
<h3>Policy Implications</h3>
<p>In providing children with Medicaid HCBS waiver benefits, policymakers  		need to know whether granting their parents more freedom--and more  		responsibility--to manage those benefits promotes or detracts from their  		well-being or that of another primary informal caregiver. The demonstration  		evaluation found strong evidence that the CDC program improved the quality of  		children's care and parents' satisfaction with that care, but accompanying  		benefits for primary informal caregivers were not guaranteed. The fact that  		benefits did accrue to both caregivers and children suggests that CDC is an  		option worth continuing and offering to families with children who may have  		joined the DD program after the demonstration period. </p>
<p>The findings also might quell possible concerns that allowing family  		members, especially parents, to become children's paid workers erodes  		traditional values about familial responsibility and could lead some parents to  		seek waiver services in order to pay themselves for caregiving. The option to  		be paid did not seem to increase enrollment into the Florida demonstration.  		Parents were significantly less likely than other caregivers in this analysis  		to become paid workers, and less than a third of all children in the treatment  		group had a parent for a primary paid worker (Dale et al. 2005). Moreover,  		family members who were paid continued to provide many hours of unpaid  		assistance, and anecdotal evidence suggests that some parents used the wages  		they earned through the CDC program to buy care supplies or other items for  		their child. Overall, the results from this report and the companion piece on  		children's care quality suggest not that Medicaid funds were used to pay  		parents merely for raising their children, but that the CDC program enabled  		parents to use those funds to effectively purchase the supportive benefits  		their child was authorized to receive. This greater control and flexibility  		substantially lessened the strain of the family members and friends these very  		dependent children relied on most. </p>

<h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A: WAIVER BENEFITS</a></h2>
<p>Florida's Developmental Disabilities (DD) waiver, which serves children  		and adults, covers the benefits listed in <a href="#tableA1">Table A.1</a>. The  		allowance provided to treatment group children was set at the amount the state  		expected to spend for all the benefits, except support coordination, in  		children's DD support plans. To calculate the amount it expected to spend, the  		state multiplied the costs of benefits in the support plan by a discount factor  		that accounted for the fact that, on average, some benefits are not delivered  		as planned. Florida used the funds it would have spent on support coordination  		to pay for the consulting services it offered to help parents manage their  		child's monthly allowance in the CDC program. (The state paid consultants and  		support coordinators the same rates.) </p>

<p>This appendix provides additional information on analytic methods.  		<a href="#tableB1">Table B.1</a> lists all the outcomes measured,  		<a href="#tableB2">Table B.2</a> shows the distribution of control variables  		for the treatment and control groups, and <a href="#tableB3">Table B.3</a>  		shows the minimum program effects we could confidently detect. Here, we  		describe in detail the approaches we used to estimate logit models, measure  		care hours, and impute missing values for control variables. </p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p><b>Use of Logit Models</b> </p>
<p>As noted in the body of the report, we used the estimated coefficients  		from logit models to measure most program effects on primary informal  		caregivers. We calculated two predicted probabilities that Y = 1 (for example,  		whether very satisfied with life) for each primary informal caregiver in the  		sample--first assuming the case was in the treatment group, then assuming it  		was in the control group--then calculated the mean probability for these two  		series to get predicted treatment and control values, and the difference  		between these means. This approach provides a more intuitive measure of the  		size and importance of an impact than does the traditional odds ratio, which is  		obtained by exponentiating the logit coefficient on the treatment status  		variable. </p>
<p><b>Measuring Outcomes Derived from Scales </b></p>
<p>As noted in the body of the report, we converted outcome measures  		derived from survey questions with four- or five-point scales into two binary  		measures--one for the most favorable rating and one for an unfavorable rating.  		We then estimated impacts on each of these two measures. Although we could have  		measured both impacts with one multinomial logit model, the resulting estimates  		would be less precise because of the large number of parameters involved.  		Moreover, ordered logit models are designed for outcome measures derived from  		scales, but they can mask important nonlinear patterns of impacts. Therefore,  		after examining simple frequencies and determining that using two binary  		measures would not obscure important results, we proceeded with this approach.  		</p>
<p><b>Statistical Power </b></p>
<p>As noted in the body of the report, we had 80 percent power to detect  		impacts of the sizes listed in <a href="#tableB3">Table B.3</a>, assuming a  		two-tailed test at the .05 significance level. </p>
<p><b>Measuring Hours of Assistance Provided </b></p>
<p>Data on hours of assistance were collected for live-in and visiting  		caregivers who provided any help with routine health care, personal care, or  		tasks around the house or community during a two-week reference period (the  		most recent two weeks in the month before the caregiver interview during which  		the child was at home). </p>
<p>For visiting caregivers (n = 30), we asked for the number of hours spent  		actively helping the child during the reference period, excluding purely social  		visits, or time spent on paperwork or travel to and from the child's home. For  		live-in caregivers (n = 736), we separately asked for: (1) the number of hours  		spent helping the child with personal care, routine health care, or  		transportation; and (2) the number of hours spent on other things around the  		house and community. We did this to distinguish hours that benefited the child  		exclusively from those that also may have benefited others in the household.  		</p>
<p>For live-in caregivers, we then calculated the total hours of assistance  		by adding these "care recipient hours" and "household hours." In 28 cases (nine  		in the treatment group and 18 in the control group) where total reported hours  		exceeded 336 (the total number of hours in a two-week period), we made the  		following adjustments, so that no case had more than 336 total:</p>
<ul><li>If the caregiver reported the same number of hours for time spent  		  helping the child (the "care recipient") as for time spent on other tasks  		  around the house and community, we divided both types of hours in half and  		  summed the halved amounts (for example, see case 1, <a href="#tableB4">Table  		  B.4</a>).</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the caregiver reported that care recipient hours  		  equaled 336 and household hours were less than 336, we kept the household  		  value, decreased the care recipient value by that amount, and summed those  		  values (case 2).</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the caregiver reported different totals for care  		  recipient hours and household hours, we kept the lesser value, decreased the  		  greater value by that amount, and summed those values (case 3). </li>
</ul><p>Before these adjustments, the average total hours for the 18 control  		group caregivers reporting excessive hours was 486--150 hours more than the  		maximum possible of 336--while the nine treatment group caregivers averaged 159  		hours more than the maximum possible. The adjustments reduced the mean hours  		for all live-in control group caregivers from 167 per two weeks to 159, and the  		mean unadjusted hours for live-in treatment group caregivers from 159 to 155.  		(The total hours presented in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> were estimated with  		regression models that controlled for baseline characteristics; thus, they  		differ slightly from the numbers just presented.) </p>
<p><b>Missing Values for Control Variables </b></p>
<p>When children or caregivers were missing data on one or two control  		variables, the sample mean of the missing variable(s) was imputed to keep the  		case in the analysis. </p>
