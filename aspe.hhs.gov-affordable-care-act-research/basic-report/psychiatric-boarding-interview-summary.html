<p>The U.S Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation contracted with The Lewin Group to  		interview physicians and other clinical staff on the issue of psychiatric  		boarding. The interviews were designed to gain the perspective of Emergency  		Department (ED) Directors/ED Physicians, Department of Psychiatry  		Chairs/on-call Psychiatrists, and Nurse Case Managers/Social Workers in nine  		hospitals. Where possible, community stakeholders of these hospitals were also  		interviewed. These stakeholders were from community mental health centers  		(CMHCs), state facilities, and state mental health departments. These  		interviews were intended to provide additional information on the issue of  		boarding to supplement the literature review conducted by The Lewin Group,  		A Literature Review: Psychiatric Boarding,<sup><font><a href="psychiatric-boarding-interview-summary.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> in light of the limited amount of published  		research on the topic. </p>
<p>Key areas of interest discussed during the interview included:</p>
<ol><li>The extent to which psychiatric boarding is perceived as a problem;  		  </li>
<li>Reasons why psychiatric patients are boarded; </li>
<li>The impact of psychiatric boarding on patient care and the capacity  		  of hospitals to provide effective emergency services; and </li>
<li>The views of those interviewed concerning potential short-term  		  practice improvements and long-term solutions to reducing the frequency with  		  which psychiatric patients are boarded in EDs. </li>
</ol><p>The following paper is a summary of the interviews conducted by The  		Lewin Group. </p>
<h3>A. Methodology</h3>
<p>The Lewin Group identified a sample of nine hospitals based on  		geographic location across the United States, urban or rural status, bed size,  		public or private status, presence of a psychiatric ward, and state rank in a  		national study on mental illness to identify state leaders and laggards in  		mental health care.<sup><font><a href="psychiatric-boarding-interview-summary.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> Of  		the nine hospitals interviewed, eight are urban or suburban, all are non-profit  		and seven have a psychiatric ward. Three of the nine hospitals included in the  		interviews had implemented psychiatric emergency services (PES) in an attempt  		to provide better diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill in the ED. </p>
<p>From September 19 to November 6, 2008, The Lewin Group interviewed seven  		ED Directors/ED Physicians, eight Nurse Case Managers/Social Workers, and seven  		Department of Psychiatry Chairs/on-call Psychiatrists at these nine hospitals,  		and six community stakeholders. Community stakeholders included representatives  		from CMHCs , state facilities, outpatient psychiatric facilities and state  		mental health departments. Given the small number of individuals interviewed  		during this process, the findings presented here are indicative of the issues  		relating to the boarding of psychiatric patients in emergency rooms and should  		not be considered representative or definitive. </p>
<h3>B. Summary</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Every month someone has died waiting. This is a problem of  		  great dimensions.</i></p>
<p><i>This is a systems issue that manifests itself in the ER,  		  which is a common pathway for the problem; but the real problem is about  		  capacity in other parts of the system, adequate funding, and being able to move  		  patients to the level of care they need.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no standard definition of psychiatric boarding among  		respondents. Interestingly, respondents within the same hospital differed on  		their definitions, including the time period cited in their definitions. With  		regard to the frequency of boarding, length of time boarded, and repeat users,  		most respondents stressed that they did not have exact numbers and did not  		track this data. However, a few respondents did track this data and noted that  		the purpose of such tracking was often to draw attention to the problem. </p>
<p>The majority of respondents interviewed found psychiatric boarding to be  		a serious problem when it occurred. The reasons for psychiatric boarding  		reported during the interviews included the general lack of inpatient beds,  		insurance pre-authorization necessary for admission, difficulty in  		placement/transfer to a receiving facility, and lack of outpatient  		facilities/community resources. However, most respondents indicated that  		psychiatric boarding is a symptom of a greater mental health system crisis.  		</p>
<p>In the majority of hospitals, ED physicians were in charge of deciding  		whether a psychiatric patient should be admitted to the hospital. Yet, of these  		hospitals, only one provided ED physicians with special training beyond that  		received in medical residency. Not surprisingly, liability was an important  		concern among respondents as most ED physicians and psychiatrists would rather  		admit a patient to an inpatient unit than have them harm themselves or others  		after being dismissed from the hospital. </p>
<p>Once the decision to admit is made and the boarding process begins,  		respondents indicated that medication is usually administered but rarely much  		else. Further, most respondents stated that although attempts have been made to  		reduce the use of restraints, they are still used, typically with an extremely  		violent patient. Additionally, all hospitals interviewed mentioned the  		overwhelming amount of resources that psychiatric boarders use during their  		stay. </p>
<p>Those hospitals that had implemented a model of PES found collaboration  		with the community to be strong, while other respondents reported either poor  		or moderate collaboration between the ED and the community. PES models focus on  		providing better diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill in the ED which  		can reduce psychiatric boarding. PES can take the following forms: a  		psychiatric consultant to the ED is called when needed; a separate psychiatric  		ED in a general hospital or the ED of a freestanding psychiatric  		hospital.<sup><font><a href="psychiatric-boarding-interview-summary.html#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Given the small sample size of the study, it is difficult to extrapolate  		findings. However, the views expressed by those interviewed do support the  		findings from the literature review and are an important supplement to existing  		research evidence.</p>
<h2><a name="exist" id="exist">II. EXISTENCE AND REASONS FOR PSYCHIATRIC  		BOARDING</a></h2>
<p>This section discusses the definition of psychiatric boarding and  		perceptions of the extent of boarding. This section also discusses reasons for  		the boarding of psychiatric patients, including estimates of the frequency of  		boarding and length of time boarded. </p>
<h3>A. Definition</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Patients that come into the ED  are triaged and  		  evaluated and admitted to floors, but [if] there is no bed, [they] are boarded.  		  We do not go by a time.</i></p>
<p><i>A patient who has to stay in the ED occupying a space while  		  waiting to be placed in a facility for inpatient treatment.</i></p>
<p><i>A patient kept in the ER for lack of a psychiatric bed for  		  more than 12 hours.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents provided a range of definitions of psychiatric boarding,  		even when working within the same hospital. Generally, respondents defined  		psychiatric boarding as a patient waiting in the ED or hallway, awaiting  		placement, after a decision has been made to admit the patient. Respondents  		also included in their definitions the length of time a patient must wait  		before such waiting is deemed boarding. Respondents varied with  		regard to this pre-boarding time estimate: The most common amount  		of time was two hours or four hours, with a range of two to 24 hours. However,  		almost half the respondents did not provide a pre-boarding time period in their  		definition of psychiatric boarding. The variation in definitions of boarding  		indicates a lack of national practice standards. </p>
<h3>B. Extent of the Problem</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>It is the number one problem of my Emergency  		  Department.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of respondents interviewed agreed boarding was a  		significant problem in their hospitals. ED Directors/ED Physicians tended to  		perceive boarding as a more serious problem than other types of clinical staff,  		for example psychiatrists. Further, hospitals that had implemented a PES model  		did not rate the problem significantly higher than those without a PES model.  		This suggests that the implementation of PES alone may not be adequate to  		address the problem of boarding. </p>
<h3>C. Frequency of Boarding and Length of Time Boarded</h3>
<p>All hospitals indicated that they boarded patients every week, although  		not necessarily every day. Estimates of the number of patients boarding per day  		or per week varied by hospital and by respondent within each hospital,  		indicating knowledge disparities between respondents within the same hospital.  		Three hospitals tracked data on psychiatric boarders generally to show  		legislators and other stakeholders that psychiatric boarding was a problem in  		their hospitals. In addition, one state hospital and two outpatient facilities  		tracked data on psychiatric boarders in an attempt to identify high utilizers  		and set up case management. It was a commonly held view among respondents that  		psychiatric boarding involves repeat users. However, no reliable data was  		provided regarding the percent of psychiatric patients who were repeat  		users.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to provide the length of time that psychiatric  		patients boarded at their hospitals. Responses were typically given in ranges,  		with variance given by time of day, day of the week, insurance status, and  		voluntary/involuntary status. The range of boarding times was from two hours to  		two weeks, with one respondent recalling a patient who was boarded for 300  		days. However, typical responses included a patient waiting after the decision  		to admit for 2-3 hours, up to 3-4 days. </p>
<h3>D. Reasons for Boarding</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>It is a resource issue primarily. The closing of state  		  hospitals has backed up general hospitals for psychiatric patients with  		  disorders who are frequent patients.</i></p>
<p><i>There is not necessarily a shortage of inpatient beds, but a  		  failure at all other levels.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents were asked to explain the reasons for psychiatric boarding  		at their hospitals. A summary of the main reasons given for psychiatric  		boarding is provided below: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Lack of Inpatient Hospital Capacity</b>. Hospitals that do not  			 have available inpatient psychiatric beds must board psychiatric patients until  			 a bed becomes available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Liability</b>. A majority of respondents indicated that liability  			 was taken into consideration in the decision to admit as most ED physicians and  			 psychiatrists would rather admit a patient to an inpatient unit than have them  			 harm themselves or others after being dismissed from the hospital. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Insurance Status or Delays in Pre-authorization</b>. Boarding can  			 be exacerbated if a patients health plan requires authorization for an  			 inpatient admission. Further, several respondents noted that certain hospitals  			 screen a patients insurance status, and will admit patients  			 dependent upon their ability to pay, leaving uninsured patients to board  			 longer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Placement or Transfer Issues</b>. Some patients can be hard to  			 place for a variety of reasons. For example, they are uninsured or are viewed  			 as difficult patients. A significant amount of time can be spent  			 calling other facilities to locate a bed for these patients and completing the  			 necessary paperwork which prolongs boarding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Insufficient or Lack of Outpatient/Community Resources</b>. The  			 absence of community alternatives to EDs that are available 24 hours a day can  			 lead to greater use of ED services and greater demand for inpatient care for  			 psychiatric patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Insufficient Staffing</b>. Insufficient staffing can exacerbate  			 boarding if beds are available but psychiatrists or other staff, such as  			 psychiatric nurses, are not. For instance, one respondent mentioned that nurses  			 in the psychiatric inpatient wing of her hospital had to maintain a  			 nurse-patient ratio of 1:5. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Necessity of Medical Clearance</b>. In the ED, psychiatric  			 patients must be cleared medically before they can be screened for a  			 psychiatric evaluation. This medical clearance prolongs the time the  			 psychiatric patient must wait in the ED although many respondents did not count  			 this pre-boarding wait time in their length of boarding estimates. In the case  			 of substance abuse, patients will not be cleared until they are sober, causing  			 them to board longer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>EMTALA</b>. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act  			 (EMTALA) requires hospitals to screen and stabilize patients with emergency  			 conditions regardless of their ability to pay. Patients can board longer due to  			 uncertainty over whether they meet EMTALAs definition of  			 stabilized for transfer to a facility with a psychiatric bed.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Insufficient Housing Alternatives</b>. One respondent indicated  			 that if there were sufficient housing alternatives, some homeless, psychiatric  			 patients could be discharged more quickly from a hospital inpatient bed,  			 allowing new psychiatric patients to access these beds. </p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="care" id="care">III. CARE DELIVERY</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><i>Patients are taken to the general ED by ambulance, triage, or  		  the police. They are medically cleared and then transferred by security to the  		  psychiatric ED.</i></p>
<p><i>Upon arrival to the ED, the patient is evaluated by a triage  		  nurse. They ask if the patient is suicidal. If yes, he/she is immediately  		  placed on one-to-one supervision in the ED. If the patient is not suicidal, the  		  nurse makes the decision on how rapidly the patient needs to be seen (urgent,  		  emergent, non-emergent).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section describes the type of care received by psychiatric patients  		while boarded in the hospitals interviewed, including who treats the patient,  		whether previous patient assessments and collateral information are obtained,  		boarding placement, care administered during boarding and the use of  		restraints. </p>
<h3>A. Mental Health Professionals</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>For a patient who [I am]  not certain of whether to  		  admit, a psychiatrist is called. On rare occasions, a psychiatrist sees the  		  patient.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents noted that several health care professionals were generally  		involved in the care of mental health patients during the screening and  		boarding process. Typically, a medical screen is performed by a triage nurse or  		ED Physician. Respondents indicated that the decision to admit is more often  		made by an ED physician rather than by a psychiatrist. In fact, the role of  		psychiatrists in emergency psychiatric services was found to vary considerably.  		In some hospitals they were significantly involved in the screening process for  		admission, while in others they were only available by phone and rarely entered  		the ED. ED physicians indicated that, in general, it was difficult to reach  		psychiatrists by phone after hours and on weekends. Social workers are often  		involved in the transfer process, seeking outpatient or alternative treatment  		for the psychiatric patient. </p>
<p>The extent of training ED physicians had received in the management and  		care of patients with mental health conditions varied greatly. In some  		hospitals, training in crisis prevention and suicide evaluation was a  		requirement. Further, security staff was trained in de-escalation techniques.  		However, some ED physicians had not received any training since their  		residency. </p>
<h3>B. Assessments and Collateral Information</h3>
<p>ED staff in nearly all hospitals sought to obtain previous patient  		assessments and collateral information in assessing psychiatric patients.  		However, respondents noted the difficulty that exists in obtaining this  		information. Respondents mentioned Health Insurance Portability and  		Accountability Act constraints and the lack of availability of private  		psychiatrists and case managers after hours as factors leading to limited  		access to such information. </p>
<h3>C. Boarding Placement</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>There is no separate psychiatric room; that is our biggest  		  problem.</i></p>
<p><i>The ED is not the best place to deal with a psychiatric  		  emergency.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents described a variety of boarding locations depending on the  		hospital and on the services available. In the hospitals where psychiatric  		patients are boarded primarily in the ED, patients are generally placed in any  		available ED bed. Some hospitals reported using inpatient hallways, as these  		are less noisy and hectic than EDs. Some facilities have separate psychiatric  		EDs or separate areas for psychiatric patients, such as a behavioral health  		annex. Two hospitals mentioned the use of a locked unit for psychiatric  		boarders who become violent.</p>
<h3>D. Medication and Care</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>What they really need, they don't  		  get.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents were asked what type of psychiatric care patients received  		while boarding and whether necessary medication was given to patients during  		the boarding process. All hospitals indicated that patients are started on  		medication during the boarding process. However, few hospitals reported  		providing psychiatric therapy to boarded patients. Many respondents mentioned  		the lack of continuity of care that exists both within the hospital, (as  		patients are continually signed over with shift changes), and  		within community mental health facilities. A few respondents noted that  		psychiatric patients are given bright colored gowns or socks to distinguish  		them from the medical patients, and to prevent elopement. Several respondents  		noted that this only further stigmatizes the psychiatric patient.</p>
<p>Nearly all respondents indicated that chemical and/or physical  		restraints were used in their hospital. Most respondents stated that although  		attempts are made to reduce the use of restraints, they are still used,  		typically with an extremely violent patient. If restraints are used, hospital  		security and/or law enforcement are often involved. </p>
<h2><a name="impact" id="impact">IV. IMPACT</a></h2>
<p>This section details the impact of boarding on psychiatric patients and  		hospital staff. This section also includes the financial impact of psychiatric  		boarding. </p>
<h3>A. Impact on Patients and Staff</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>I cannot overemphasize the negative impact this has on  		  staff.</i></p>
<p><i>Often there are mentally ill patients on one side of a  		  curtain and medically ill patients on the other. One mother with a 5-year-old  		  with diarrhea had a roommate who was a crack addict. She was absolutely  		  petrified of her the entire time.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many respondents reflected on the negative impact psychiatric boarding  		has on hospital staff. They noted that boarding increases the workload of  		nurses, nurse practitioners, and ED physicians, and decreases the time spent  		with medical emergencies. Several respondents noted staff turnover due to this  		particular issue. </p>
<p>In many cases, mental health patients are next to or very close to  		medical patients in the ED or waiting room. If psychiatric patients are  		agitated or disturbed, this can cause concern among some medical patients. </p>
<h3>B. Financial and Overall Impact</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>The hospital eats the cost. There is a mental health fund,  		  but it is vastly inadequate.</i></p>
<p><i>"If the state is going to abandon its safety-net role, then it will  		  bankrupt the community hospitals."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hospitals interviewed shared the view that psychiatric boarding  		places a tremendous resource burden on hospitals. Respondents explained that  		boarders take up a considerable amount of time and space, often crowding  		hallways and EDs and tend to board longer than medical patients, consuming more  		hospital resources (i.e., meals, bedding, etc.) during their stay. One facility  		indicated that their mental health annex costs over a million dollars a year to  		maintain, and reimbursement is vastly insufficient to cover the cost of food,  		security, and staff. </p>
<p>Respondents were asked who pays for the care of the psychiatric  		patient when he/she is boarding, and what is the financial impact  		of boarding on the hospital. For uninsured patients, most hospitals  		reported absorbing the costs themselves. Some respondents indicated that the  		state pays for the care of uninsured patients. For insured patients, hospitals  		typically bill Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance for an ED visit or  		services rendered. However, total patient care is often rolled up into one  		charge, with the hospital receiving the same amount regardless of length of  		stay. </p>
<h2><a name="community" id="community">V. COMMUNITY COORDINATION AND  		COLLABORATION</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the transfer process of psychiatric patients  		between hospitals as well as the level of community coordination and  		collaboration with the ED regarding the care of psychiatric patients. This  		section also explores the involvement of law enforcement in the psychiatric  		boarding process.</p>
<h3>A. Transfer Process</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>If [they are] committed [patients], a privately owned  		  security company has an agreement with police to transfer the patient. If [they  		  are] voluntary [patients], the family can transfer the patient, and the crisis  		  stabilization unit often uses cabs to transfer the patient.</i></p>
<p><i>In our institution, it is not a problem with [not having]  		  insurance, it is only a matter of beds  It is more of a problem for the  		  insured because they need pre-authorization.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents indicated that patients are transferred to state hospitals,  		private acute care hospitals, crisis centers, and community alternatives with  		less acute settings. Most hospitals noted that they are aware of their transfer  		options. Some hospitals also give the patient a list of outpatient options at  		discharge, while others help the patient through the process, including  		appointment scheduling. </p>
<p>While some hospitals indicated that they transfer patients to nearby  		facilities, others indicated long transfer distances. In one instance, a  		stakeholder noted that a patient was transferred to a facility approximately  		100 miles away. Some hospitals interviewed made arrangements with  		transportation services (e.g., taxi services, bus companies, security  		companies) and/or law enforcement to ensure appropriate transfers are made.</p>
<p>Respondents indicated that the transfer process can frequently be  		extremely slow for hospitals. Of those interviewed, typically, social workers  		are tasked with calling local hospitals and facilities in search of a bed for  		patient transfer. ED physicians, and occasionally resident psychiatrists and  		on-call psychiatrists, handle pre-authorization and other paperwork involved in  		the transfer. Several respondents noted that insurance issues can delay  		transfer. The need for pre-authorization can cause delay. Transfer can also be  		delayed if hospitals with available beds are out-of-network and alternatives  		have to be found. In some hospitals, respondents reported that uninsured  		patients boarded longer than privately insured patients because it was harder  		for them to find facilities willing to take uninsured patients. </p>
<h3>B. Community Collaboration</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>We have a whole repertoire of referral  		  services.</i></p>
<p><i>Its housing thats the issue  or families  		  that bring them in and wont take them back; we have a good working  		  relationship with outpatient options but patients must wait because they [these  		  options] are not available 24/7. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDs reported having varying degrees of collaboration with the community  		regarding community outpatient alternatives. Generally, hospitals that have  		implemented a PES model had greater collaboration with outpatient facilities  		than those without a PES model. Hospitals in which community mobile crisis  		teams and diversion evaluation teams are placed in the hospital ED demonstrated  		the greatest degree of collaboration. Often these teams would triage  		psychiatric patients in the ED, helping to alleviate some of the burden on ED  		Physicians, nurses, and social workers. A few hospitals also reported being  		involved in committee meetings with local stakeholders, including hospital  		employees, law enforcement, and outpatient facilities, to discuss emergency  		issues for mental health patients. </p>
<h3>C. Law Enforcement</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>[There is] a large security force, and there is law  		  enforcement in the general ED. Law enforcement brings someone to the ED, and  		  wants a quick turnaround, but sometimes police have to wait on the  		  patient.</i></p>
<p><i>The hospital is limited in security, as there are 107  		  treatment spaces with two security guards. One is at the traffic, influx  		  ambulatory [side], the other at the ambulances, psych entrances. Both arrive if  		  there is an issue and there are additional security guards in the medical  		  center.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of respondents indicated that law enforcement and security  		guards were involved in some capacity in the boarding process. Law enforcement  		typically is involved in bringing a psychiatric patient to the ED on an  		involuntary commitment. Once the patient is in the ED, hospitals differ in  		their dependence on law enforcement, with police leaving immediately at some  		hospitals and others requiring one to one police observation until admission.  		Most hospitals utilize staff security in psychiatric boarding, primarily during  		chemical and physical restraints. A few hospitals noted that their local law  		enforcement has undergone training in mental health issues, primarily the  		Crisis Intervention Team model. </p>
<h2><a name="practice" id="practice">VI. PRACTICE IMPROVEMENTS AND SOLUTIONS</a></h2>
<p>Respondents were asked to provide suggestions for practice improvements  		and long-term solutions to address psychiatric boarding issues raised during  		the interviews. Practice improvements were characterized as practices that  		would not require a significant overhaul of the current mental health system.  		Long-term solutions were characterized as system-wide solutions that would aim  		to reduce or even eliminate boarding. </p>
<h3>A. Practice Improvements</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Best practices are only 'Band-aids' on the  		  problem.</i></p>
<p><i>Notwithstanding capacity, we need to provide psychiatric  		  evaluation by a mental health professional/psychiatrist within 90 minutes of  		  contact of the ED Doctor. This is a better model, so the patient can be  		  discharged instead of sitting for 18-36 hours.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following provides a summary of the practice improvements suggested:  		</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Increased Staffing/Number of Social Workers</b>. Given that  			 boarding is, at times, caused by lack of inpatient hospital staff to care for  			 the psychiatric patient rather than lack of inpatient psychiatric hospital  			 beds, having additional staff would alleviate this problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Better Case Management/Identifying Frequent Users</b>. Ensuring  			 that psychiatric patients receive care coordination regarding medication  			 adherence and outpatient appointments may prevent these patients from  			 presenting to the ED, and thus boarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Change Boarding/Placement Location within Hospital</b>. Some  			 respondents recommended moving boarders to inpatient hallways or designated  			 areas rather than the ED. These areas tend to be less chaotic and noisy and,  			 therefore, are less likely to exacerbate a mental health crisis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved ED Staff Training and Education</b>. Improved training  			 and education of ED staff would result in better screening and psychiatric  			 evaluations in the ED, which may reduce hospital admission rates of psychiatric  			 patients and decrease boarding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Better Screening/Psychiatric Evaluation</b>. Some respondents  			 indicated that improved screening and psychiatric evaluations in the ED,  			 including having a psychiatrist involved in the ED screening process, may  			 reduce hospital admission rates of psychiatric patients and decrease boarding.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved Throughput/Scheduling</b>. Improved throughput can  			 include discharging patients before noon to improve the patient flow in the  			 hospital and preparing for the busiest times of the week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved Community Collaboration/Relationship</b>. Better  			 knowledge of outpatient alternatives among ED staff and strong collaboration  			 between community crisis services and the ED are likely to lead to more  			 appropriate discharge of patients to outpatient facilities, and a reduction in  			 boarding.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Long-Term Solutions</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Longer term solutions include improving the infrastructure  		  that is not available in most communities at this time, but may help to  		  decrease the problem in 5-10 years.</i></p>
<p><i>A number of areas in the country have 24 hour psychiatric  		  crisis units. They are not inpatient facilities; they are evaluation facilities  		  where a patient is evaluated, has medical clearance and is transferred to a  		  crisis center.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many respondents noted that while practice improvements can lessen the  		impact of psychiatric boarding, system-wide solutions would have to be  		implemented to significantly address the problem. The following provides a  		summary of the long-term solutions recommended by respondents: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Increased Outpatient Capacity/Community Alternatives</b>.  			 Respondents indicated that because of the lack of outpatient and community  			 alternatives, they believed patients must wait in the hospital inpatient unit  			 for community outpatient placement. This, in turn, delays placement of a new  			 psychiatric patient to the inpatient unit, creating greater boarding in the  			 hospital. Two specific community services identified as part of system-wide  			 improvement of mental health services were crisis residential services and  			 mobile crisis teams. Crisis residential settings would care for patients who do  			 not need to be in a hospital setting, allowing the ED to see more acute  			 patients. Mobile crisis or diversion teams provide crisis intervention and  			 stabilization services to psychiatric patients in the community, preventing  			 many patients from ultimately presenting to the ED. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Separate Psychiatric ED/Behavioral Health Annex</b>. A separate  			 psychiatric ED or behavioral health annex is a component of the PES model in  			 which psychiatric patients are placed in a separate ED/annex after medical  			 clearance. This removes patients from the general ED, as well as increases the  			 likelihood that they receive care from trained mental health professionals  			 while boarding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increased Hospital Inpatient Capacity</b>. Additional  			 psychiatric, inpatient beds would help to alleviate boarding for those patients  			 who require hospital level care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Regionalization of Care</b>. The care of boarded patients could  			 be improved by implementing standard processes across hospitals within the same  			 region such as standard boarding procedures, as well as coordination across  			 hospitals and at the state level regarding capacity issues. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Innovative Psychiatry (Tele-Psychiatry &amp; Psychiatrists as  			 Hospitalists)</b>. Use of tele-medicine would allow psychiatrists to perform  			 evaluations and screenings of psychiatric patients when they cannot be  			 physically present in the ED. This may alleviate inappropriate inpatient  			 admission, and thus, lead to reduced boarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eliminate Out-of-Network Insurance Issues</b>. Hospitals that  			 have available psychiatric beds are not always authorized to accept patients if  			 these hospitals are not in the patients insurance network. Some  			 respondents noted that eliminating the in-network requirement would increase  			 available options for inpatient care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Community/State Mental Health Buy-In</b>. Some respondents said  			 that they believed that state health departments would have to be involved in  			 reforming the existing system in order to properly implement community-wide  			 solutions; such involvement to improve mental health access and quality and  			 reduce boarding would entail a fiscal commitment among partners at the  			 community or state level. </p>
