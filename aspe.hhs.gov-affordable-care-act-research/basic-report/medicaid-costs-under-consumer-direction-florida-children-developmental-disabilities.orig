<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>When the parents of children with developmental disabilities rely on  		Medicaid waiver services for home- and community-based services (HCBS), they  		may not have as much control over their child's benefits as they would like. If  		parents, rather than case managers, could allocate the resources for their  		child's assistance, supplies, and equipment, they might be both better able to  		obtain the care their child needs and better satisfied with that care. This  		study of Consumer Directed Care, Florida's Cash and Counseling Demonstration  		program for children, examines the ways in which consumer direction affects the  		cost of Medicaid personal care services, as well as the cost and use of other  		Medicaid services. </p>
<p>Demonstration enrollment, which occurred between June 2000 and August  		2001, was open to children age 3-17 who were receiving HCBS through Florida's  		Developmental Services Waiver program. After their parents completed a baseline  		survey, enrollees were randomly assigned to participate in Consumer Directed  		Care (the treatment group) or to continue receiving traditional waiver services  		(the control group). Parents of treatment group members were given the  		opportunity to receive a monthly allowance they could use to hire their choice  		of caregivers or to buy other services or goods to meet their child's care  		needs. Program consultants and fiscal agents were available to help them manage  		these responsibilities. The cost of Consumer Directed Care was expected to be  		similar to that of the traditional waiver program. </p>
<p>Outcome measures were drawn from Medicaid claims data for 1,002 children  		for the first two years post-enrollment. We used regression models to estimate  		program effects, while controlling for a comprehensive set of baseline  		characteristics. </p>
<p>Waiver expenditures per treatment group member were more than $3,000  		(about 25 percent) higher than waiver expenditures per control group member  		during the first post-enrollment year, and nearly $5,000 higher during the  		second. The treatment-control difference in waiver expenditures was due to two  		factors. First, control group members incurred waiver costs that were 18  		percent lower than expected in the first year and 9 percent lower than expected  		in the second year according to their discounted baseline support plans; and  		second, treatment group members' allowances were, on average, about 30 percent  		higher than expected in both years. </p>
<p>The treatment group's higher waiver expenditures were partially offset  		in both years by lower expenditures for Medicaid home health services. This  		difference in home health expenditures was due primarily to an increase in the  		proportion of control group members with high spending on Medicaid private-duty  		nursing after the demonstration began, whereas no such difference was observed  		for the treatment group. No other Medicaid costs were affected. Total Medicaid  		costs for treatment group children averaged nearly $30,000, about 3 percent  		($880) higher than the control group's cost. The difference was statistically  		insignificant. In year 2, the difference grew to $2,581 per child (p=0.081),  		about 8 higher than the control group's cost. </p>
<p>To control costs in the future, Florida may need to review its process  		for revising its support plans to ensure that allowances are not increased by  		counselors beyond those called for by a reasonable care plan. Conversely,  		Florida staff need to ensure that those in the traditional program (who had  		lower-than-expected costs) are able to receive the services they need. </p>
<p>Consumer Directed Care increased access to paid personal care and the  		quality of care received. Only individual states can decide whether they are  		willing to risk incurring somewhat higher total Medicaid costs in order to reap  		these sizable benefits. Ideally, states might be able to draw on Florida's  		experience to find ways to keep costs at the level incurred under the  		traditional system while preserving the highly favorable effects on children's  		well-being. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Although the parents of children with developmental disabilities have  		the primary responsibility for their child's health and welfare, some of them  		must rely on government programs for supplemental support or for the special  		resources parents need in order to manage their child's condition. Medicaid  		home- and community-based services (HCBS) waiver programs can offer such  		support; however, because state or agency staff decide the types and amounts of  		assistance families need, these programs leave some parents desiring greater  		control over their child's benefits. The Cash and Counseling model of consumer  		directed care, which gives parents more control over the funds for their  		child's care, is designed to improve the well-being of these families without  		increasing public costs. </p>
<p>While such programs as Cash and Counseling may appeal to consumers, in  		the current environment of tight state Medicaid budgets, costs are a crucial  		determinant of whether states can take on these programs. Recent research  		suggests that Florida's Cash and Counseling model--Consumer Directed  		Care--significantly increased the well-being of children with disabilities and  		their parents in Florida (Foster et al. 2004). Similarly, the Arkansas Cash and  		Counseling program increased the well-being of both non-elderly and elderly  		adults (Foster et al. 2003). The results on costs to date are less clear-cut.  		Arkansas' Cash and Counseling program increased personal care costs for adults,  		because many control group members received no personal care services (PCS) and  		those who did receive these services received only two-thirds of the care  		recommended in their care plan. However, because of savings on other Medicaid  		services, the higher costs were partially offset during the first  		post-enrollment year, and almost fully offset during the second (Dale et al.  		2003). </p>
<p>Florida's program for children, which cashes out numerous HCBS waivers,  		has features different from those of Arkansas' program for adults, which cashes  		out only personal care. Thus, the cost findings for adults in Arkansas may not  		be generalizable to the Cash and Counseling program for children in Florida.  		</p>
<p>Florida's Consumer Directed Care could affect public costs in several  		ways. Costs under consumer direction could increase (or decrease) if a state  		sets a monthly allowance for self-directing consumers that is higher (or lower)  		than the amount it would have paid for authorized services under the waiver  		program. Medicaid reimbursements for other services could increase or decrease  		if changes in the way that parents manage their children's care under consumer  		direction lead to changes in the child's need for the services of hospitals,  		home health care providers, nursing facilities, and other Medicaid service  		providers. </p>
<p>The randomized design of the evaluation of the national Cash and  		Counseling Demonstration enables researchers to rigorously analyze costs under  		traditional and consumer-directed approaches. In this report, we use results  		from Florida's Consumer Directed Care for children to investigate the program's  		effect on Medicaid waiver costs, other Medicaid costs, and Medicaid service use  		under consumer directed and traditional programs for the two-year period after  		demonstration enrollment. </p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a> </h2>
<h3>A New Model of Medicaid Supportive Services</h3>
<p>About 1.2 million people receive supportive services in their homes  		through state Medicaid plans or through HCBS waiver programs (Kitchener and  		Harrington 2003). These programs typically offer eligible children a wide range  		of supportive services, such as personal care, consumable supplies,  		professional therapies, and caregiver respite. Case managers, however, decide  		which services a particular child needs, while the states usually select the  		providers or vendors who supply them. This system leaves some parents desiring  		greater control over their child's supportive services. </p>
<p>As an alternative to these traditional service models, states are  		increasingly offering Medicaid beneficiaries and their families opportunities  		to obtain supportive services directly from individual providers (Velgouse and  		Dize 2000). This alternative has come to be known as "consumer directed care,"  		because beneficiaries decide what services they need and who to get them from;  		those who need personal care may hire, manage, and possibly terminate their  		paid caregivers (Eustis 2000). In 1999, there were an estimated 139 publicly  		funded, consumer directed care programs in the United States, about a third of  		which served children with physical or developmental disabilities (Flanagan  		2001). </p>
<p>Cash and Counseling expands upon more common models of consumer directed  		care by allowing consumers to do more than merely choose their paid providers.  		It provides a flexible monthly allowance that consumers--or the parents of  		consumers younger than age 18--may use to hire their choice of caregivers and  		purchase other services and goods, as states permit. Cash and Counseling  		requires that consumers, or parents, develop plans showing how they would use  		the allowance to meet their needs or those of their child. Instead of the case  		management or support coordination that traditional programs provide, Cash and  		Counseling offers counseling and fiscal services to help consumers, or parents,  		plan for and manage their responsibilities. These tenets of Cash and  		Counseling--flexible use of the allowance, availability of counseling and  		fiscal services, and use of representative decision-makers (such as parents,  		adult caregivers, or other designees)--are meant to make Cash and Counseling  		adaptable to consumers of all ages and with all types of impairments. </p>
<p>With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Office of  		the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services, waivers from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid  		Services, guidance and technical assistance from the National Program Office,  		Cash and Counseling was implemented as a voluntary demonstration in Arkansas,  		Florida, and New Jersey. Because the Medicaid programs and political  		environments differed considerably across the demonstration states, the states  		were not required to implement a standardized intervention; although the  		programs did have to adhere to the basic Cash and Counseling tenets summarized  		above. Arkansas and New Jersey designed their demonstration programs for adults  		and gave participants an allowance for their Medicaid PCS. In contrast, Florida  		designed its demonstration program for both adults and children, and based  		allowances on a variety of HCBS waiver benefits (not just PCS). Florida and New  		Jersey allowed legally liable relatives (that is, parents and spouses) to  		become workers, whereas Arkansas did not. Because of such differences, we are  		evaluating the programs separately. Moreover, we examine the experiences of  		Florida children--the subject of this paper--separately from those of Florida  		adults. </p>
<h3>Cash and Counseling for Florida Children</h3>
<p>Florida implemented Consumer Directed Care to promote the independence  		of people with disabilities, to offer services that would better meet the needs  		of families, and to encourage the prudent use of public resources. Parents who  		participated in early focus groups conducted to aid in the design of Consumer  		Directed Care said they wanted to participate in a program that would give them  		decision-making power, flexibility, and privacy; allow them to choose  		caregivers whom they trusted and their child liked; and enable them to obtain  		respite for themselves without unduly impinging on others (Zacharias 1998;  		Simon-Rusinowitz et al. 1998). </p>
<p>The demonstration was open to children age 3-17 who were receiving any  		waiver services through the state's home- and community-based Developmental  		Services waiver program.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> To be thus enrolled, these children required  		the level of care that is furnished in Florida's intermediate care facilities  		for people with developmental disabilities. Children who need this level of  		care have at least one of the following developmental disabilities: mental  		retardation, autism, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, or Prader-Willi syndrome (in  		descending order of prevalence in the United States population). They also have  		severe functional limitations in at least three of the following major life  		activities: self-care, understanding and use of language, learning, mobility or  		self-direction, and capacity for independent living (Florida Medicaid Program  		2000).<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Children covered  		under Florida's developmental services waiver require a level of care and  		additional health and developmental services that are well beyond those usually  		provided to children. For example, about 60 percent of children covered under  		the waiver need help getting into or out of bed. Overall, caring for these  		children requires substantial time and resources and must be integrated into  		the life of the family as a whole. </p>
<p>Before enrollment, the children in our sample were receiving a wide  		variety of benefits through the waiver program. For example, children with  		spina bifida may have received supplies to care for incontinence and pressure  		sores, whereas children with autism may have received behavior therapy to  		address self-injurious tendencies. According to Medicaid claims data, after  		support coordination (which was mandatory), the most commonly used benefits  		during the year prior to enrollment were supplies and equipment (71 percent);  		PCS (53 percent); and therapy services, including behavioral, mental health,  		and habilitation (32 percent). Children also received such benefits as  		environmental modifications (6 percent), professional services and therapies (3  		percent), and transportation (0.5 percent). Because these children require  		frequent and multiple services, parents can experience frustration if the  		service system is inflexible. Consumer Directed Care was intended to support  		families in their caregiving role by enhancing flexibility and choice and  		allowing them to integrate caretaking more easily into family life. </p>
<p>Most parents of children receiving waiver services were notified about  		the Consumer Directed Care program through a letter from the governor. Program  		administrators told parents who applied for the program what the child's  		monthly allowance would be if the child were assigned to the treatment  		group.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> As prepared by  		support coordinators under the traditional program, allowances were set equal  		to the expected costs of benefits in children's waiver support plans.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> In addition to services and goods  		needed regularly, waiver support plans could include "one-time" expenditures  		(for example, for remodeling a bathroom to make it wheelchair-accessible). In  		calculating the allowance amount, the value of the support plan was multiplied  		by a discount rate of 0.92 to reflect historical differences between expected  		and actual costs, so that the costs of serving similar treatment and control  		group children under the demonstration would be on a par with each other. At  		enrollment, the average allowance was $1,109 a month, or $256 a week.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Enrollment, which was voluntary, began in June 2000 and continued until  		August 2001, when the evaluation target of 1,000 enrollees was met.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> MPR conducted a baseline  		telephone interview with parents who enrolled their child in the demonstration,  		then randomly assigned each child to the treatment or the control group. After  		random assignment, the experiences of the treatment and control groups  		diverged. While control group children and their parents were to continue to  		rely on traditional waiver program benefits and support coordination, the  		parents of treatment group children were contacted by Consumer Directed Care  		consultants about starting on the allowance. </p>
<p>With assistance from program consultants, a "representative" of the  		child (all representatives were parents) in each treatment group family  		developed and implemented a written plan for using the child's monthly  		allowance. This plan did not have to conform to the waiver support plan, on  		which the allowance was based. The allowance could be used to purchase services  		or goods to meet the child's needs for home or community support, and purchases  		did not have to be furnished by Medicaid-certified suppliers or be covered  		under the traditional waiver program, so long as they were directed toward the  		child's disability. For example, parents could purchase experimental therapies  		not covered by Medicaid, and they could hire caregivers who were not certified  		by Medicaid, including themselves or other relatives. In many families, one  		parent served as the representative, the other as a paid caregiver.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The responsibilities of consultants in Consumer Directed Care were  		similar in some ways to those of support coordinators in the traditional waiver  		program but different in others. Coordinators were responsible for reviewing  		the support plans of control group members and revising them as necessary to  		ensure that needs were met. Consultants had comparable responsibility for those  		receiving the allowance. The reviews were conducted annually or upon a change  		in the child's circumstances. Thus, consultants could authorize changes to the  		amount of the allowance for the treatment group, and support coordinators could  		modify the value of the support plan for the control group. On the other hand,  		support coordinators in the traditional program were expected to access,  		coordinate, and troubleshoot goods and services on <i>behalf</i> of families,  		whereas consultants were not. Nonetheless, parents could call on program  		consultants for advice about recruiting caregivers, arranging backup  		assistance, and similar matters. In addition, consultants monitored  		satisfaction, safety, and the use of funds through monthly telephone calls and  		periodic home visits. </p>
<p>The payment for consulting services for the treatment group was  		identical to the payment for support coordination for the control group.  		Agencies or contractors who provided these services were paid $148 per month  		for each beneficiary on their caseloads. (Both consulting services and support  		coordination services were paid directly by Medicaid, not by families.) </p>
<p>With few exceptions, treatment group parents chose to have the fiscal  		agents maintain their program-related accounts, withhold paid caregivers'  		payroll taxes, file payroll tax returns, and write checks to cover caregivers'  		wages and other goods and services purchased with the allowance. Parents were  		charged $5 per check for this service, up to a monthly maximum of  		$25.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="expected" id="expected">EXPECTED PROGRAM EFFECTS ON USE AND COST OF MEDICAID  		SERVICES</a> </h2>
<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<p>Although Consumer Directed Care was expected to increase consumer  		satisfaction and reduce unmet needs, its expected effects on the use and cost  		of Medicaid services were not as clear. The program was required to meet CMS's  		budget neutrality requirements, which meant that costs per recipient per month  		for Consumer Directed Care and other core Medicaid services<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> for which use was expected to be  		affected by Consumer Directed Care could be no greater than the comparable,  		traditional per-person cost for those receiving traditional waiver services.  		Accordingly, the value of the allowance was set to equal the expected cost of  		waiver services under the traditional program, and the cost of consultants was  		exactly equal to the cost of support coordinators. Thus, Florida's Consumer  		Directed Care program was designed to cost the same as the traditional program  		per recipient-month.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup>  		Nonetheless, the costs per month for the treatment group could still be higher  		(or lower) than those for the control group if the discount rate (which was  		based on the period before the demonstration) was not accurate for the  		demonstration period. In addition, compared to control group members, treatment  		group members could be more (or less) likely to receive authorizations for  		revising their support plans, and could have been more (or less) likely to  		incur one-time expenditures. </p>
<p>In addition to affecting waiver costs, Consumer Directed Care could  		reduce the costs and use of other Medicaid services. Personal care or other  		goods and services purchased with the allowance might be substituted for  		services covered by Medicaid, such as home health services. The program also  		could affect the use and cost of Medicaid services that reflect the adequacy of  		waiver services, such as inpatient hospital use and physician visits. These  		costs could be higher (or lower) for the treatment group if workers hired under  		consumer direction provided higher (or lower) quality care. Self-reports in  		Foster et al. (2004) showed that Consumer Directed Care children were less  		likely than control group children to develop pressure sores, to have existing  		bed sores worsen, to experience shortness of breath, to have a urinary tract  		infection, or to fall--and were no more likely than control group children to  		suffer any of the other adverse events studied. Thus, if claims data are  		consistent with survey reports, we would expect the treatment group's  		expenditures for other Medicaid services for these problems to be similar to  		(or less than) those of the control group. </p>
<h3>Hypotheses About Subgroup Effects</h3>
<p>It is possible that program effects will differ--in magnitude or  		direction for certain subgroups of children. In particular, we hypothesize that  		differences may arise, depending on whether children:</p>
<ul><li>were receiving PCS under the waiver at baseline; </li>
<li>had an unmet need for PCS at baseline; </li>
<li>had a relatively high allowance; and </li>
<li>lived in a rural area. </li>
</ul><p>Costs might increase more under Consumer Directed Care for subgroups of  		children whose parents are more likely to request (and receive) increases in  		their allowances. For example, a parent who reported an unmet need for PCS at  		baseline might request that the allowance be increased in order to cover the  		cost of both a newly hired worker and the other goods and services in the  		child's support plans. Likewise, a parent whose child was not receiving PCS at  		baseline might hire a worker and then request an allowance increase. Further,  		costs might increase more for those with relatively high allowances than for  		those with relatively low allowances if control group members with high  		allowances have greater difficulty obtaining all the services they are  		authorized to receive. </p>
<p>Finally, we examine whether there are greater treatment-control  		differences in costs in rural areas where control group members might face a  		scarcity of Medicaid-certified providers; if the program increases access to  		care in underserved rural areas, it might also increase costs because control  		group members would receive only some of the services authorized in their  		support plans. </p>
<h2><a name="methods" id="methods">METHODS</a> </h2>
<h3>Data Collection and Sample</h3>
<p>Data for this analysis were drawn primarily from Medicaid claims data  		and a computer-assisted telephone baseline survey was administered to parents  		of treatment and control group members (or to their proxy respondents) between  		June 2000 and August 2001. We used Medicaid claims data for the first 24 months  		after enrollment to construct outcome measures for the full sample.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> We constructed control  		variables from claims data for the year preceding enrollment and from the  		baseline survey. Control variables from the claims data included the sample  		members' pre-enrollment Medicaid expenditures, as well as a "predicted case mix  		value" based on the costs that each sample member would be likely to incur  		according to pre-enrollment diagnoses.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Control variables from the baseline survey  		include the consumers' demographic characteristics, measures of health and  		functioning, and measures of unmet need for personal care. </p>
<h3>Outcome Measures</h3>
<p>Outcome measures included for the 24 months after enrollment were  		Medicaid waiver expenditures, Medicaid expenditures for other services, and  		selected measures of service use. We compiled these measures from Medicaid  		claims data supplied by Florida. Most of these measures are fairly  		straightforward and do not require further explanation. We must clarify,  		however, that the treatment group's waiver expenditures included costs for the  		allowance as well as payments for waiver services received after randomization  		but before receipt of the cash allowance, and for any waiver services  		disenrollees received after they left the Consumer Directed Care program. </p>
<p>For our key outcome measure--total Medicaid expenditures--we have 80  		percent power to detect an impact of +/-11 percent of control group mean costs  		(or about $3,600), assuming a two-tailed test at the 0.10 significance level.  		</p>
<h3>Estimation of Program Effects</h3>
<p>Because treatment group members did not necessarily receive the  		allowance during the full post-enrollment period that we examined, our impact  		estimates measure the effects of having the <i>opportunity</i> to receive the  		monthly allowance (by virtue of being assigned to the treatment group), rather  		than actually <i>receiving</i> it. Likewise, some control group members did not  		necessarily receive waiver services in every post-enrollment month. To avoid  		introducing selection bias, we based most of our analyses on the expenditures  		of all treatment group and all control group members. </p>
<p>We estimated program impacts for most continuous outcome measures  		(including all our expenditure outcomes) using ordinary least squares  		regression models. For continuous outcome measures with a high proportion of  		zero values, such as the number of inpatient days, we used tobit models. For  		binary outcome measures (such as whether a sample member had any visits to the  		emergency room), we used logit models to estimate program impacts. For all  		outcome measures, we measured impacts by calculating the treatment-control  		difference in predicted means. We estimated the mean predicted values for the  		treatment and control groups for each outcome by computing the predicted value  		of the outcome from the regression (or logit or tobit) equation twice for each  		sample member, first assuming that they were in the treatment group, then  		assuming that they were in the control group and computing the mean over all  		sample members for both sets of predicted values. (For outcomes estimated with  		least squares regression models, this approach is exactly equivalent to  		computing the predicted outcome for treatments and controls at the point of  		means for the regressors, but such equivalence does not hold for outcomes  		estimated with logit or tobit models.) </p>
<p>For each type of model, we used the p-values of the estimated  		coefficients on the treatment status variable to assess the statistical  		significance of the impacts and report these values in the tables. The impact  		estimates are almost always very similar to the treatment-control raw  		(unadjusted) differences in means. </p>
<p>All the models controlled for the sample members' baseline measures of  		demographic characteristics, health and functioning, unmet needs for personal  		care, pre-enrollment Medicaid expenditures, and predicted case mix value based  		on the sample member's pre-enrollment diagnosis. Means of the control variables  		used in the model are shown on <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. These models  		increased the precision of the impact estimates and ensured that any  		differences between treatment and control groups in these pre-existing  		characteristics that may have arisen by chance did not distort our impact  		estimates. </p>
<p>As expected, the mean values of the control variables are generally  		similar for the treatment and control groups. While the treatment group had  		significantly higher expenditures for therapy services than the control group,  		none of the other differences in pre-enrollment characteristics were  		statistically significant. However, the treatment-control difference in average  		home health expenditures was large (-$1,800), but not quite statistically  		significant (p = 0.12). By chance, 12 control group members had home health  		expenditures that were over $100,000 per year, while only six treatment group  		members had home health expenditures that were this high. Nevertheless, we  		should avoid any bias that would be introduced by this difference by  		controlling for pre-enrollment home health expenditures. </p>
<h3>Sample Description</h3>
<p>Our sample includes the 1,002 children who enrolled in Consumer Directed  		Care and whose parents completed baseline surveys. Most of the children in this  		analysis were white, male, and younger than 12 (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>).  		Slightly more than half of the sample lived in parts of Florida that parents  		described as rural or as having a high rate of crime or poor public  		transportation. (These conditions could make it difficult for agencies to  		recruit paid workers or for treatment group families to hire workers other than  		nearby relatives and friends.) About 40 percent of parents said their child's  		health was fair or poor (rather than excellent or good) compared with the  		health of the child's peers. Further, although 46 percent of the children were  		12 or older, about 60 percent could not get out of bed without help or  		supervision. During the year prior to baseline, total Medicaid costs were high,  		averaging about $20,000 per child, with more than one-third (about $7,500)  		being for waiver services. About half of their waiver expenditures (an average  		of about $3,400) was for personal care, about 20 percent (nearly $1,500) was  		for supplies, 15 percent was for support coordination (nearly $1200), and 13  		percent (or $1,000) was for therapy. At baseline, only about half of children  		received personal care under the waiver (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>). </p>
<p>Most treatment group members (68 percent) received allowances at the end  		of Month 12 after demonstration enrollment. However, because of delays in  		getting started on the allowance, only 22 percent of treatment group members  		received an allowance during Month 3, and only 52 percent did so during Month  		6. (Allowances were sometimes delayed because Consumer Directed Care  		consultants and district or state staff both had to approve spending plans  		before families could begin receiving their allowance.) On average, treatment  		group members received allowances for 5.4 months during the first  		post-enrollment year and for 8.5 months during the second (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> Most treatment group members received  		traditional waiver services during months in which they did not receive  		allowances; in fact, nearly all treatment group members and nearly all control  		group members received at least some waiver services during each month of the  		post-enrollment period. </p>

<h3>Effect of Consumer Directed Care on Waiver  		Expenditures</h3>
<p>During the first year post-enrollment, waiver expenditures for the  		treatment group were sizable ($15,966, <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>), $3,319  		(more than one-fourth) higher than those of the control group ($12,647). The  		expenditures rose for both groups in the second year post-enrollment, and the  		treatment-control difference ($4,812) was even greater. This difference in  		waiver expenditures occurred even though treatment and control group members  		had similar average support plan values at baseline. Their average annual  		"baseline waiver costs" (defined as the child's expected baseline costs  		according to the discounted value of their support plan at enrollment plus $148  		per month for consulting or support coordination) was $15,060 for the treatment  		group and $15,672 for the control group (not shown). We first discuss the  		reasons for this discrepancy and then return to a discussion of the other  		estimates in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>. </p>
<h3>Reasons for Treatment-Control Difference in Waiver  		Expenditures</h3>
<p>The treatment-control difference in waiver expenditures was due to two  		factors: (1) the control group incurring costs that were lower than their  		average baseline waiver costs, and (2) allowance recipients in the treatment  		group incurring costs that were higher than their average baseline waiver  		costs. The first explanation accounts for most (about three-fourths) of the  		treatment-control difference in Year 1. The second explanation accounts for  		most (about two-thirds) of the difference in Year 2. The treatment-control  		difference in waiver expenditures increased over time as more treatment group  		members received allowances, and the problem of allowances exceeding what was  		initially authorized continued. </p>
<p>During Year 1, the treatment group incurred costs that were 5 percent  		higher than their baseline waiver costs (<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>). This  		was due entirely to the fact that during months in which individuals actually  		received allowances, their expenditures were 30 percent greater than their  		average baseline waiver costs. During Year 2, the entire treatment group's  		actual costs were 24 percent higher than their average baseline waiver costs,  		due to allowance recipients' costs being 32 percent higher than their average  		baseline waiver costs. The average waiver expenditures for allowance recipients  		(nearly $1,800 during both years) did not appreciably increase over time, but  		the average number of children receiving an allowance during a given month  		increased from 226 to 351. </p>
<p>In contrast, the control group's average monthly waiver expenditure was  		$1,071, only 82 percent of the group's average baseline waiver costs ($1,306).  		During the second year, control group expenditures were higher but still only  		91 percent of their average baseline waiver costs. </p>

</tr></table><p>The fact that the control group incurred waiver costs that were lower  		than expected at baseline suggests that the discount rate used was inaccurate  		for the study period. Florida set its discount rate by calculating the ratio of  		actual expenditures to authorized support plan expenditures for a sample of  		several hundred people. It is possible, however, that those who actually  		volunteered for the demonstration were different from the typical waiver  		recipient in the sample.<sup><a href="#note14">14</a></sup> For example, the  		Consumer Directed Care program might appeal especially to those in rural areas  		who have difficulty finding Medicaid-certified providers and would like to hire  		their own worker. Because of difficulties in obtaining authorized services,  		those in rural areas might also receive less of their planned services than  		consumers in urban areas. However, we found that control group members in rural  		areas were not more likely to be underserved than those in non-rural areas. (We  		tested this finding by regressing the ratio of actual to baseline costs on  		whether a person lived in a rural area.) There was considerable variation in  		actual-to-baseline waiver cost ratios by district (see <a href="#tableA.2">Table A.2</a>), which suggests that people may have  		experienced greater difficulty than others in locating providers in some areas,  		but the ratio of actual to baseline waiver costs was higher for the treatment  		group than the control group in every area (except in the smallest district,  		which had only six sample members in each group). Thus, this finding is not due  		to consultants in a few areas being overly generous in revising the support  		plans for children in Consumer Directed Care. </p>
<p>The control group's apparent underutilization of services could also be  		an artifact of the way the discount rate was calculated. One method that could  		be used is to compute the ratio of actual to expected costs (according to the  		support plan) for each person, and then take the average ("average  		ratio").<sup><a href="#note15">15</a></sup> Over the first year in Florida, the  		average ratio was 0.98. Although information is not available on how Florida  		computed its discount rate, it is possible that the discount rate was  		calculated by using the average ratio in the pre-enrollment period. If this is  		the case, then its rate was consistent with the experiences of control group  		members during the demonstration period, since the average ratio (0.98) was  		very close to 1. However, from a budgetary standpoint, in order for the average  		actual expenditures for the entire control group to equal the average expected  		expenditures, the discount rate should have been calculated as the ratio of the  		average actual expenditures for the sample to the average expected expenditures  		for the sample ("ratio of averages"), which was 0.82 ($1,071 ÷ $1,306).  		</p>
<h3>Effect of Consumer Directed Care on Other Medicaid and  		Total Medicaid Services</h3>
<p>During the first year post-enrollment, the difference in total annual  		average Medicaid expenditures for the treatment group ($29,974) and the control  		group ($29,095) was small and not statistically significant (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>). About half the $3,319 difference in waiver  		expenditures was offset by the treatment group's lower expenditures for home  		health services ($1,574 less than those of the control group). For all the  		other non-waiver services, the treatment group's expenditures were not  		significantly different from the control group's during the first  		post-enrollment year. </p>
<p>During the second year post-enrollment, the treatment-control difference  		in average total Medicaid expenditures grew to $2,581 (p = 0.082). Again, the  		treatment group had significantly lower home health expenditures than the  		control group, by a somewhat greater margin than in Year 1. However, the  		treatment group's savings in home health expenditures ($2,041) offset less than  		half the treatment-control difference in waiver expenditures, which grew to  		$4,812. </p>
<h3>Effects of Consumer Directed Care on Other Measures of  		Service Use</h3>
<p>Because Consumer Directed Care reduced Medicaid home health  		expenditures, we examined the source of the reduction to assess whether quality  		of care may have been affected. Specifically, we estimated treatment-control  		differences in the percentage of sample members using any Medicaid home health  		services and in the percentage using selected types of Medicaid home health  		services, as well as average expenditures for selected types of Medicaid home  		health services. The percentage of treatment group members using any Medicaid  		home health services was similar to that of the control group (about 30 percent  		for both groups during both the first and second post-enrollment years;  		<a href="#table5">Table 5</a>). Similarly, the percentage of sample members  		using specific types of home health services was similar for the treatment and  		control group for each type of home health (private-duty nursing, aide, and  		therapy) that we examined. </p>
<p>Compared to the expenditures of the control group, those of the  		treatment group for private-duty nursing were $1,866 lower during the first  		post-enrollment year and $2,090 lower during the second.<sup><a href="#note16">16</a></sup> No meaningful differences were observed for any of  		the other home health expenditure measures we examined. Thus, it appears that  		the control group's greater spending on private-duty nursing is the sole reason  		for the treatment-control difference in total home health expenditures. The  		treatment-control difference in private-duty nursing is further illustrated by  		the distribution of expenditures: the number of control group members who spent  		more than $100,000 a year on private-duty nursing increased from 12 during the  		pre-enrollment year (about 2 percent of the sample) to 17 in the first  		post-enrollment year; conversely, the number of treatment group members  		spending more than $100,000 fell from 6 to 4 (<a href="#tableA.3">Table  		A.3</a>). </p>

</tr></table><p>If Consumer Directed Care affected the quality of care children  		received, we might expect children in the treatment group to experience more  		(or fewer) adverse events or health problems than those in the control group.  		This, in turn, might affect their use of inpatient services. Therefore, we  		examined whether the program affected children's use of any inpatient services,  		the number of inpatient days, inpatient expenditures, or the likelihood of  		having an emergency room visit. The program, however, did not affect any of  		these measures significantly. Only 5 or 6 percent of children used emergency  		room services in a given year. </p>
<h3>Subgroup Effects</h3>
<p>There were consistent patterns across subgroups (<a href="#tableA.4">Table A.4</a>). Within each subgroup, the treatment group  		generally had higher waiver expenditures, but lower home health expenditures,  		than the control group. There was one notable difference across subgroups: the  		increase in waiver expenditures (and, consequently, in total Medicaid  		expenditures), which was significantly higher for those who had high initial  		monthly allowances than for those with low ones. This difference was due mainly  		to control group members with high monthly allowances incurring only 77 percent  		of their expected waiver costs compared to control group members with low  		monthly allowances receiving an average of 102 percent of their expected waiver  		costs (not shown). This finding suggests that those with the greatest needs in  		the control group have difficulty obtaining all the services they are  		authorized to receive. </p>
<p>Policymakers might be concerned that the relatively valuable waiver  		benefits treatment group children received (in the form of the CDC allowance)  		was the main reason that the program increased parents' satisfaction with their  		child's care. To test this hypothesis, we estimated regressions on key quality  		outcomes that included an indicator variable for whether a person incurred  		monthly costs that were higher than the baseline value of their monthly care  		plan. Our results suggested that parents in both groups were more satisfied  		with their child's overall care when their child received higher-than-expected  		benefits (according to the child's discounted baseline waiver support plan).  		However, none of the estimated program effects on key outcomes were appreciably  		changed. For example, when we do not control for any cost ratio indicators,  		treatment group parents are 29.7 percentage points more likely than control  		group parents to be very satisfied with their child's overall care  		arrangements. When we do control for whether a child incurred higher costs than  		expected, the estimated treatment-control difference is 28.3 percentage points  		(<a href="#tableA.5">Table A.5</a>).<sup><a href="#note17">17</a></sup></p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>Waiver expenditures (both per sample member and per month of service)  		were higher for the treatment group than for the control group during both the  		first and second years post-enrollment, and the difference grew over time. The  		treatment group's higher waiver expenditures were partially offset by their  		lower expenditures for Medicaid home health services. The treatment-control  		difference in waiver expenditures was due to two factors. First, control group  		members incurred lower waiver costs than expected according to the discounted  		values of their baseline support plan. Second, treatment group members had  		higher-than-expected allowances. </p>
<p>Our results raise several policy questions and concerns. First, why were  		the allowances of treatment group members an average of 30 percent higher than  		expected? The Consumer Directed Care program, which was intended to be  		flexible, permitted consumers to use their allowance in a variety of ways. In  		the spirit of flexibility, consultants may have authorized requests from  		parents for support plan increases that would not have been authorized under  		the traditional waiver program. Also, training for consultants was limited, and  		each consultant served only a small number (an average of nine) consumers.  		Consultants, possibly uncertain of program rules, may have been overly  		permissive in granting parents' requests for increases in the allowance. </p>
<p>Another policy concern is the control group's receiving fewer waiver  		services than were authorized at baseline, similar to our findings in the  		Arkansas Cash and Counseling demonstration, which we attributed primarily to  		agency worker shortages (Dale et al. 2003). We do not have data on which waiver  		services control group children were authorized to receive, or why they did not  		get them. It could be that that control group children failed to receive  		authorized PCS; indeed, the control group was 14 percentage points less likely  		than the treatment group to receive paid personal care at nine months  		post-enrollment (Foster et al. 2004).<sup><a href="#note18">18</a></sup>  		Parents of children in the control group may have been uncomfortable having a  		stranger care for their child, and thus chose to forego the Medicaid PCS to  		which they were entitled. Alternatively, worker shortages in some parts of the  		state may have made it difficult for parents to find Medicaid certified  		providers. Another reason for the control group's lower-than-expected costs  		might be due to demonstration participants being different from the pool of  		waiver recipients from which the discount rate was calculated, or due to the  		discount rate being miscalculated. Finally, it is possible that support  		coordinators over-estimated the amount of care children needed. If that is  		true, however, it suggests that the treatment group's higher-than-expected  		costs are an even bigger problem. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the findings from both Arkansas and Florida point  		to the difficulty in setting a discount rate that will be accurate in a future  		period of time. To ensure that treatment group allowances are on a par with the  		costs of serving similar waiver recipients in the traditional program, discount  		rates may have to be reviewed (and, if necessary, changed) periodically. On the  		other hand, the use of fewer services than were authorized under the  		traditional program raises concerns about whether children are receiving  		adequate care in that program. Few policymakers would want to hold costs down  		by depriving children of services that assessment staff authorize as necessary.  		Thus, the focus may need to be less on initial discount rates than on ensuring  		that allowance amounts do not creep up faster for those on Cash and Counseling  		than do costs for children receiving waiver services from traditional sources.  		</p>
<p>The reduction in home health costs under Consumer Directed Care suggests  		that there are opportunities for offsetting savings. The difference was due  		primarily to an increase in the proportion of control group members with high  		spending on private-duty nursing after the demonstration began. In contrast,  		parents of treatment group members may have preferred to use the allowance to  		hire family members, friends, and other non-Medicaid providers to meet their  		child's additional needs rather than seek extra private-duty nursing, even  		though Medicaid would have paid for this nursing care. This reduction in  		private-duty nursing under Consumer Directed Care could be problematic if some  		children are not receiving as much skilled nursing care as they need. However,  		only a handful of children in the treatment group who received private-duty  		nursing prior to enrollment did not receive any such help after the  		demonstration began; moreover, the distribution of spending on private-duty  		nursing for the treatment group barely changed over the course of the  		demonstration. Thus, it appears that those who needed private-duty nursing in  		the treatment group continued to receive it--although those who needed more  		care than they had at enrollment likely obtained assistance from workers hired  		with the allowance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some parents did not like  		the way the private-duty nurses performed their duties. The allowance offered  		these parents the opportunity to reduce their dependence on these nurses  		somewhat. </p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Because the randomized evaluation design ensures that the impact  		estimates are unbiased, the limitations of the study described below do not  		cast doubt on the basic findings. Our study pertained to only one program in  		one state, however; so our findings may not apply to all programs featuring  		Consumer Directed Care. Impacts may differ for programs with other features  		(for example, those that target adults instead of children or that prohibit the  		hiring of parents, have benefits that are more or less generous, or cash out  		different services). Program effects on costs also will depend on the extent to  		which those receiving services under the traditional program receive the  		authorized amounts. Finally, only those who were already participating in the  		traditional waiver program were allowed to enroll in Consumer Directed Care.  		Programs that do not impose a prior-participation requirement might experience  		higher costs if the prospect of receiving a cash allowance leads to a greater  		influx of new applicants. </p>
<h3>Implications of the Findings</h3>
<p>Both past and ongoing research indicates that findings for Florida  		children were similar to those for adults in Arkansas, in several respects.  		Compared to the traditional program, parents reported greater access to paid  		care, higher levels of satisfaction, and fewer unmet needs under Cash and  		Counseling in Florida (Foster et al. 2004); likewise, adult consumers received  		similar benefits in Arkansas (Foster et al. 2003). In part because the control  		group received only some of the services they were expected to receive, Cash  		and Counseling cost more than the traditional program for both Arkansas adults  		(Dale et al. 2003) and Florida children. In both states, the higher costs for  		Cash and Counseling were offset somewhat by savings on other Medicaid services.  		However, between the first and second post-enrollment years, the  		treatment-control difference in total Medicaid costs decreased in Arkansas but  		increased in Florida. </p>
<p>The higher costs of the Consumer Directed Care program might discourage  		some states from adopting a similar program. However, this evaluation was  		conducted over a two-year follow-up period that started immediately after  		enrollment began, before Florida was able to identify and remedy any problems  		that occurred in implementing this innovative program. Since this  		demonstration, Florida has adopted for its current Consumer Directed Care  		program (CDC-Plus) many changes that might help control costs.<sup><a href="#note19">19</a></sup> Florida's Developmental Disabilities agency  		received a Real Systems Change Grant to develop better training for a smaller  		pool of consultants. Rules were also adopted to help control the costs of  		allowances and one-time purchases. For example, parents wishing to make  		one-time purchases must first use unspent funds in their child's account before  		consultants can authorize revisions to their support plans. Also, unspent  		balances that exceed 1.5 times the monthly allowance must be spent or be  		forfeited. Ongoing training is being implemented for district and regional  		staff, one goal of which is to make sure that there is a common understanding  		about program goals and policies regarding granting requests for additional  		funding for support plans. Florida is adopting a new assessment form, called an  		Individual Cost Guideline, which will standardize the method for determining  		the costs of services that a child needs. Finally, an audit is being conducted  		to explore recouping funds from those who died, disenrolled, or had significant  		unexpended funds in their accounts. </p>
<p>To control costs in the future, Florida should carefully monitor the  		ratios of actual to expected costs for those in the traditional program, as  		well as those in the CDC program. If these actual costs under Consumer Directed  		Care increase faster than those for comparable individuals in the traditional  		program, staff will need to review the process for making revisions to support  		plans, to ensure that allowances are not increased beyond what is necessary to  		meet beneficiaries' needs. Conversely, Florida agencies overseeing the waiver  		program may wish to investigate why those in the traditional program (who had  		lower-than-expected costs) receive such a low proportion of the services they  		are authorized for. If they find that care plans are routinely set at overly  		generous amounts or if children have other reasons for not getting all of the  		services authorized, setting the allowance at a smaller fraction of the care  		plan amount than was used in the demonstration based on more recent historical  		data may be appropriate. </p>
<p>Parents reported greater satisfaction and fewer unmet needs under  		Consumer Directed Care than under the traditional program, even after  		controlling for Consumer Directed Care's higher-than-expected costs (Foster et  		al. 2004). These findings suggest that the benefits of the program to children  		and their families would be sizable even if allowances were limited to expected  		amounts. If the savings on other Medicaid expenditures persist over time, and  		spending on cash allowances are controlled, the program might even generate  		savings to Medicaid. Future research will assess the robustness and  		generalizability of these findings by examining the effect of Cash and  		Counseling on Medicaid and Medicare costs and service use on adults in Florida  		and New Jersey. </p>
