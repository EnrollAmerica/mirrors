</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>An intriguing aspect of recent declines in elderly disability is the  		increased use of disability-related equipment, or assistive devices. Studies  		consistently have found declines in the overall disability rate among older  		Americans, with larger decreases in independent living activities, such as meal  		preparation and shopping, associated with lower levels of disability. Several  		national surveys also show declines since the mid 1990s in help with personal  		care activities, such as bathing and toileting, associated with more severe  		disability. Evidence is less clear, however, when personal care disability is  		defined to include use of assistive devices, because of the rising prevalence  		of equipment use. For only one activity, bathing, was an upward trend in the  		prevalence of equipment use associated with a downward trend in the prevalence  		of help.</p>
<p>A number of factors argue for the need to better understand the trend in  		device use and its implications for the growing older population. Research  		provides evidence that assistive devices may substitute for human assistance  		under some circumstances, although the full scope and implications of such  		substitution is not yet known. Nevertheless, if equipment use reduces or  		removes the need for help from other persons, it may reduce the demands of  		disability care on both families and public programs, and increase independence  		and quality of life for elders with disabilities and may have other desirable  		outcomes. Better understanding of trends may help identify where interventions  		to promote access to disability equipment may be most effective. </p>
<p>This study has four primary aims:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>To update information on trends in use of disability equipment,  			 using data from the 1984 through 1999 rounds of the National Long-Term Care  			 Survey (NLTCS), which has been a key source of earlier information on trends in  			 equipment use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To describe differences in characteristics of equipment users and  			 nonusers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To examine differences in the hours of care received by equipment  			 nonusers and by persons using equipment with and without help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To discuss implications for multivariate models of the relationship  			 between assistive device use and use of help and impacts of device use on hours  			 of care and other outcomes. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Review of the Literature</h3>
<p>A number of studies are reviewed that have contributed to understanding  		of factors associated with use of equipment or help and provided evidence for  		the intuitive hypothesis that devices may be able to substitute for personal  		assistance. Much remains to be understood, however, about the scope for  		potential substitution of device use for personal assistance. This is due in  		part to limitations in survey data available to address the questions and in  		part to the inter-relationships between the situation and characteristics of  		persons with disability and their choices of how to manage their disability.  		Such inter-relationships complicate both conceptual models and statistical  		methods required to accurately estimate the relationships between equipment use  		and hours of care. </p>
<p>Several key issues for modeling were identified from the review: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>It is important to understand how conclusions from global measures  			 of device use may differ from conclusions with respect to particular activities  			 or types of devices. The ability to employ assistive devices may differ  			 depending on the activity, and some devices, notably mobility devices, may have  			 larger impacts because they are used for multiple activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent device use for some or all activities intuitively is the  			 place to look for the largest impacts on hours of care, but modeling of  			 potential substitution of devices for hours, needs to take into account the  			 clustering at zero of hours for persons using only equipment and the  			 characteristics that affect the likelihood of being in this group. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to consider how--and whether--models can  			 differentiate different types of substitution, particularly in cross-sectional  			 data. For example, some types of substitution may not result in reduced hours  			 of care but rather release hours of care to other  			 activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other potential outcomes of device use besides reduced hours of care  			 are important for policy, such as slower functional decline, reduced health  			 care costs, or reduced physical and/or emotional stress on informal caregivers.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substitution or supplementation between disability equipment and  			 help occurs at the individual level over time. Equipment may substitute for or  			 supplement help, or the reverse. Whether there is a typical path in choice of  			 disability accommodation and if so what it is remains to be demonstrated. This  			 type of dynamic suggests use of longitudinal models and data to improve  			 understanding of how disability arrangements change as needs change and where  			 policy may be most effective. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Data and Methodology</h3>
<p>The NLTCS is a nationally representative survey of persons aged 65 or  		older designed to identify those who are chronically disabled in one or more  		activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living  		(IADLs), and to collect detailed data on their disability, service use, family  		support, and health and demographic characteristics. The survey provides both  		longitudinal and cross-sectional samples. For this study cross-sectional  		samples of community residents reporting chronic disability were selected from  		the four waves of the survey conducted in 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. </p>
<p>Disability items included in this study are six ADLs, and eight IADLs.  		The ADLs are bathing, dressing, getting around inside, getting in and out of  		bed (transfer), toileting and eating. The included IADLs are shopping, managing  		money, meal preparation, laundry, light housework, taking medicines, getting  		around outdoors, and telephoning. Disability data on the NLTCS differ from that  		on some other national surveys in that disability is defined by use of help,  		use of disability-related equipment, or reported need for help with ADLs and  		inability to perform IADLs. There is no universal screen for difficulty in  		performing or these activities or equipment use. Detail on types of equipment  		used is collected for four ADLs (transfer, getting around indoors, bathing, and  		toileting) and for getting around outside, the one IADL for which  		disability-related equipment use is collected.</p>
<p>The disability information is used to describe trends in use of  		disability equipment with and without help and trends in the types of devices  		used. In addition, disability characteristics, human and environmental support,  		and socioeconomic characteristics are examined for chronically disabled elders  		in 1999, grouped by whether they used only equipment, only help, or both. Hours  		of care were examined for persons using help only or help and equipment, and,  		among those using both help and equipment, for persons using equipment  		<i>with</i> help and persons performing some activities with only equipment.  		</p>
<h3>Major Findings</h3>
<p><b><i>Trends in Device Use</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Between 1984 and 1999, the proportion of chronically disabled  			 community residents using equipment, with or without help, for all activities  			 for which equipment use could be measured doubled to nearly 30 percent; the  			 proportion relying solely on help fell to 14 percent. Almost one million more  			 elders were using equipment with at least one activity in 1999 than in  			 1984.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the increase in equipment use was in independent use without  			 human help. Nearly one-quarter of disabled elders managed all chronic  			 disabilities with only equipment in 1999, and almost two-thirds used equipment  			 independently for at least one disability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bathing was the only activity with a strong upward trend in  			 independent use of equipment and a similarly strong downward trend in sole use  			 of help, but significant increases in independent use of equipment occurred for  			 all four mobility-related ADLs--bathing, getting around inside, transferring,  			 and toileting--and for getting around outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases in equipment were not the result of proliferation of  			 complex assistive technology. Simple devices for mobility, bathing, and  			 toileting--walkers, canes and crutches, tub or shower seats, and raised toilet  			 seats--continued to be most common and saw the largest increases, although  			 wheelchairs and scooters also nearly doubled in prevalence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When walkers, canes, crutches, wheelchairs and scooters were  			 combined, 70 percent of disabled elders in 1999 were using one of these  			 mobility aids, 50 percent with at least one other device. Only about 16 percent  			 of chronically disabled elders were using only other devices without one of  			 these mobility aids. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Characteristics of Users and Nonusers of Equipment</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>In 1999, 1.3 million persons age 65 or older, about one in four  			 chronically disabled community residents, used only equipment for all  			 disabilities; three million, or nearly 60 percent used a combination of help  			 and equipment; and only about 15 percent reported using only help with all  			 chronic disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons managing all chronic disabilities with only equipment were  			 significantly less disabled than persons using both help and equipment on all  			 measures, particularly with respect to mobility and the frequency with which  			 accommodation was needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minority who used only help for all chronic disabilities were  			 far less disabled than both groups using equipment. Nearly two-thirds were  			 disabled only in IADLs, only 12 percent reported needing help most of the time  			 with any ADL, and about 4 percent reported needing help most of the time for  			 transfer or indoor mobility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sole reliance on equipment did not indicate greater unmet need for  			 help. Essentially none of the group using only equipment for their chronic  			 disabilities reported any unmet need for help with ADLs, compared with about  			 one in five persons using a combination of help and equipment, and about one in  			 ten persons receiving only help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons managing all disabilities with equipment were most likely to  			 live alone, and to live in some type of senior housing; persons using both  			 equipment and help were most likely to live in an explicit community  			 residential care setting, such as assisted living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons using only help were most likely to live with a spouse and  			 far less likely than persons using equipment, with or without help, to have any  			 environmental accommodations, such as railings or raised toilet seats, or to  			 consider them desirable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both groups using equipment were relatively similar in age and  			 gender distribution, although persons using a combination of help and equipment  			 were more likely to be age 85 or older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons relying solely on equipment had higher education and higher  			 income than either group using help.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Hours, Equipment Use, and Independent Equipment Use</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>As expected, hours of care received in the last week rose with  			 disability level and generally were higher for the more disabled group using  			 both help and equipment than for the group using only help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequency of need for help or equipment and frequency of need  			 specifically for mobility or transfer were important; need for accommodation to  			 perform any ADL most of the time more than doubled the hours of help received.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the group using both help and equipment, persons with three  			 or more ADLs who used equipment <i>with</i> help received far more hours of  			 care than persons performing at least one activity only with equipment; they  			 also received more hours than similarly disabled persons receiving only  			 help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even controlling for the total number of ADL disabilities and the  			 number of activities performed with equipment, all persons with at least three  			 ADLs who used equipment <i>with</i> assistance received significantly more  			 hours of help than did persons who managed at least one activity with only  			 equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within each disability level hours rose as the number of activities  			 performed with both equipment and help increased, and fell as the number of  			 activities performed independently with equipment rose. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Implications for Conceptual and Empirical Modeling</h3>
<p>Better understanding of the relationship between assistive device use  		and use of help and impacts of device use on hours of care may require  		longitudinal analyses, more narrowly focused cross-sectional analyses, and more  		information on health status and changes in functional and other  		characteristics than have been typical in the literature to date. Studies to  		date have not determined whether exclusive use of one type of accommodation is  		most likely to be a transitional situation in a typical progression of  		accommodations used over time as functional status declines, or whether  		substantial heterogeneity exists. Longitudinal analyses may be able to provide  		insights into whether there is a typical ordering of the adoption of  		accommodations and what factors are associated with changes in accommodations  		or different orderings. </p>
<p>Analyses focusing on the majority of disabled elders who use some  		combination of help and equipment, abstracting from the probability of being in  		this group, may yield important insights into the scope for potential  		interventions to promote more independent function and into factors associated  		with greater or lesser hours of care when equipment is used with help. Such a  		focused analysis also reduces--but does not eliminate--the importance of  		empirical complexities such as endogeneity of living arrangement and choice of  		accommodations.</p>
<p>The ability to link Medicare claims history with the NLTCS can help  		control in either longitudinal or cross-sectional models for unobserved factors  		that may affect the ability to use equipment alone, such as differences in  		health and events, such as hospitalization for hip fracture or stroke, or use  		of post-acute care, and provide additional information on chronic conditions.  		In either cross-sectional or longitudinal modeling, it also may be important to  		consider the role of particular disabilities, notably mobility disability, in  		the accommodations used. </p>
<p>Finally, other outcomes than hours of care are important in studies of  		assistive device use, including unmet need, impacts on caregiver health,  		changes in functional status, and health and long-term care costs. The 1999  		NLTCS includes a supplemental interview of primary informal caregivers which  		may support analysis of caregiver outcomes for different patterns of  		accommodation. Recently, additional years of Medicare claims as well as  		assessment data have become available to federal contractors. These data offer  		the opportunity to examine the impact of choice of accommodations on outcomes  		such as nursing home admission, use of home health use, hospitalizations, and  		Medicare spending, as well as changes in functional status for persons who have  		assessment data as a result of either nursing home or home health care.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>One of the intriguing aspects of recent declines in elderly disability  		is the increased use of disability-related equipment, or assistive devices.  		Several studies using different data sources have found declines in the overall  		disability rate among older Americans, with larger decreases independent living  		activities, such as meal preparation and shopping, typically associated with  		lower levels of disability (Spillman 2004; Freedman, Martin, and Schoeni 2002;  		Schoeni, Freedman, and Wallace 2001; Waidmann and Liu 2000). One recent study  		also found consistent evidence across several national surveys of smaller  		declines in the mid to late 1990s in help with personal care activities, such  		as bathing and toileting that are associated with more severe disability  		(Freedman et al. 2004). Evidence of decline was not clear, however, when ADL  		disability was defined to include use of disability equipment as well as human  		help, because of the rising prevalence of equipment use. For only one activity,  		bathing, was an upward trend in the prevalence of equipment use associated with  		a downward trend in the prevalence of help (Freedman et al. 2004; Spillman  		2004). </p>
<p>A number of factors argue for the need to better understand the upward  		trend in device use and its implications for the growing older population.  		Research provides evidence that assistive devices may substitute for human  		assistance under some circumstances, although the full scope and implications  		of such substitution is not yet known. Nevertheless, if equipment use reduces  		or removes the need for help from other persons, it may reduce the demands of  		disability care on both families and public programs and increase independence  		and quality of life for elders with disabilities. At least some evidence exists  		that use of assistive devices also may be associated with slower functional  		decline and lower health care utilization. Finally, better understanding of  		which activities and which types of equipment have experienced the largest  		increases may help identify where interventions to promote access to disability  		equipment may be most effective. </p>
<p>This study adds to understanding by updating information on trends in  		use of disability equipment and exploring how disability and other  		characteristics differ for equipment users and nonusers. Data are from the 1984  		through 1999 rounds of the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), which has  		been a key source of earlier information on trends in equipment use (Manton,  		Corder, and Stallard 1993). We first examine several trends in the use of  		equipment over the period 1984 through 1999, including use of equipment with  		and without help, use of equipment for specific activities, and use of  		particular types of equipment. We then examine how disability, characteristics  		relating to the availability of potential caregivers and environmental  		accommodations, and socioeconomic characteristics differ for those using and  		not using equipment, and how hours of care vary by whether and how equipment is  		used. Finally, we discuss implications for of the findings for models relating  		to the role of assistive devices in managing disability.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>Disability is a determined not simply by physical limitations, but by  		the social and physical environment of the individual (Pope and Tarlov 1991).  		That is, more generally, disability may be defined as the inability to perform  		any accustomed or socially defined role without accommodation, either in the  		form of assistive devices or equipment or in the form of help from another  		person. Human assistance may be either unpaid, informal care from relatives or  		friends, or paid, formal care. In this study, as in most previous studies of  		assistive device use among the older population, disability and device use are  		defined specifically in terms of personal care activities, or activities of  		daily living (ADLs), such as getting around inside the home or bathing, and  		independent living activities, or instrumental activities of daily living  		(IADLs), such as shopping and meal preparation. </p>
<p>Devices and other environmental accommodations may either enhance the  		ability of the person to accomplish a task, for example, a walker or cane to  		assist in moving around the home, or may reduce the physical requirements of  		the task, for example, adding environmental features such as railings or grab  		bars or moving to a more accommodative setting (Agree 1999). Devices also may  		be used either independently or with help from another person and may either  		resolve difficulty in performing the task or reduce it, with the latter being  		more common (Verbrugge, Rennert, and Madans 1997). Studies using measures of  		global difficulty over multiple tasks have found that assistive devices may be  		more effective than personal assistance in reducing or eliminating disability  		(Verbrugge, Rennert, and Madans 1997; Agree 1999). On the other hand, Agree and  		Freedman (2003) found that for specific tasks, persons who used assistive  		devices without help were less likely to report a desire for personal  		assistance, even though they reported as much or more residual difficulty when  		using devices than did persons using assistance only.</p>
<h3>Factors Complicating Modeling</h3>
<p>A number of studies have contributed to understanding of factors  		associated with use of equipment or help and provided some evidence for the  		intuitive hypothesis that devices may be able to substitute for personal  		assistance. Much remains to be understood, however, about the scope of  		potential substitution of device use for personal assistance. This is due in  		part to limitations in survey data available to address the questions and in  		part to the inter-relationships between the situation and characteristics of  		persons with disability and their choices of how to manage their disability.  		Such inter-relationships complicate both the conceptual models and statistical  		methods required to accurately estimate the relationships between equipment use  		and hours of care.</p>
<p>While some characteristics, such as age, gender, and education for the  		older population, may be determined outside the model of disability  		accommodation, others such as choice of living arrangement, are jointly  		determined with choices about the type of disability accommodation needed  		(Pezzin, Kemper, and Reschovsky 1996). Failure to take these relationships into  		account or inability to do so because of data limitations may give misleading  		results. Plausible determinants related to one aspect of disability  		accommodation but not to others that may be used as instrumental variables are  		difficult to conceptualize and, if conceptualized, may not be available in  		survey data (Hoenig, Taylor, and Sloan 2003). For example, individuals who live  		alone may be more likely to use equipment independently because they lack  		readily available helpers, or they may be able to choose to live alone because  		their disability is such that they can manage it with assistive devices.  		Similarly, persons living with an able spouse may receive assistance as a  		matter of course and have less incentive to consider other options for managing  		disability. </p>
<p>Use of help itself may be a factor influencing whether devices are used  		if formal providers are more likely to educate clients about the efficacy of  		devices for some activities or if informal caregivers incorporate assistive  		devices in order to manage physical and time burdens of caregiving (Agree and  		Freedman 2000). In addition, disability in the older population, although it  		may be characterized by long periods of relatively stable function, is a  		dynamic process. Factors affecting the onset of device use or assistance as  		needs change may not be captured by the cross-sectional data most often used to  		study relationships between device use and assistance (Agree and Freedman 2004;  		Agree et al. 2005; Hoenig, Taylor and Sloan 2003; Allen, Foster and Berg 2001;  		Agree and Freedman 2000). Nevertheless, published studies provide a foundation  		on which to build.</p>
<h3>Review of Existing Studies</h3>
<p>The only randomized controlled trial to date was a small (104 frail  		elderly participants in western New York) study conducted by Mann et al.  		(1999). The study suggests that quality of life may be improved and costs  		reduced by introduction of assistive devices and environmental modifications. A  		treatment group was supplied with assistive devices and environmental  		modifications based on functional assessment and evaluation of their home  		environment. Relative to the control group, the treatment group had smaller  		decreases in function and smaller increases in pain scores than the control  		group. They also had significantly lower expenditures for institutional care,  		including nursing home and hospital stays, and for nurse and case manager home  		visits, although not for other home care or for total home care. Although not  		statistically significant, the difference in total costs, including the higher  		cost of devices and environmental modifications for the treatment group, was  		large--about $14,000 for the treatment group and about $32,000 for the control  		group. </p>
<p>Studies applicable to a more general population with disability have  		relied on survey data, primarily from the 1994-1995 National Health Interview  		Survey Disability Supplement (NHIS-D) and the 1994 NLTCS. A consistent and  		intuitive finding across all studies summarized here was that  		disability-related need was the most important determinant of use of equipment  		and help and that use of a combination of equipment and help was associated  		with higher levels of need. Where included, measures of cognitive difficulties  		have been found to be associated greater hours of care and a lower likelihood  		of using assistive devices (Verbrugge and Sevak 2002; Hoenig, Taylor, and Sloan  		2003; Agree and Freedman 2004; Agree et al. 2005). </p>
<p>Two studies using the NHIS-D made a distinction between the role of  		simple devices, which comprise the bulk of devices used by the older  		population, and more complex devices. Simple mobility devices (e.g., canes)  		were found to be associated a lower likelihood of using any unpaid, informal  		assistance among both persons age 65 or older and persons age 18 or older  		(Agree and Freedman 2000; Allen, Foster, and Berg 2001). Results were more  		mixed for use of formal care. Agree and Freedman (2000) found no evidence of a  		negative relationship between device use and use of formal care among the older  		population and found that complex devices were associated with a significantly  		higher likelihood of using formal care. Allen, Foster, and Berg (2001), on the  		other hand, found that among persons age 18 or older use of canes was  		associated with fewer hours of <i>both</i> informal and formal help, whereas  		use of more complex devices, defined as walkers or wheelchairs, was associated  		with more hours of both types of help.</p>
<p>Hoenig, Taylor and Sloan (2003) found evidence from the 1994 NLTCS that  		among those with at least one ADL disability, use of assistive devices for any  		ADL disability and use of equipment for all ADL disabilities versus none were  		associated with lower total hours of informal and formal help combined. Use of  		equipment for some (but not all) activities was not associated with  		significantly different hours of care relative to use of equipment for all  		activities. Their findings did not distinguish, however, between sole use of  		equipment and equipment used with assistance.</p>
<p>Verbrugge and Sevak (2001), in a study of persons age 55 or older using  		the NHIS-D, did study this margin of use and nonuse of equipment and help,  		examining characteristics associated with the likelihood of using only  		equipment, only help, or a combination of the two for bathing, transferring,  		toileting, and getting around inside. They found that living with a spouse or  		others generally had the largest impacts on use of only help and use of both  		help and equipment, relative to use of only equipment, but did not  		significantly affect use of both help and equipment, relative to use of only  		help. The most important predictors of using both help and equipment relative  		to help only were being unable to perform an activity versus having some  		difficulty, and the number of physical limitations among eight (e.g., lifting  		ten pounds, walking ten steps without resting). The total number of ADL  		disabilities significantly increased the likelihood of using help relative to  		using equipment only for most or all activities and the likelihood of using  		both help and equipment relative to help only for bathing and transferring.  		</p>
<p>Agree and Freedman (2004) also used the NHIS-D to examine the  		characteristics of persons using help only, equipment only, and help and  		equipment, in their study focusing on mobility disability among persons age 50  		or older. In their study they used multinomial logit modeling to examine  		factors related to having each profile of mobility disability accommodation, in  		each case relative to having mobility difficulty but using neither help nor  		equipment. Their findings suggest that severity of difficulty was the most  		important predictor of both use of equipment and use of help. The largest  		impacts were for use of equipment with either informal or formal help.  		Hospitalization within the previous year also was associated with all forms of  		accommodation. Cognitive difficulty and being married were associated with  		higher odds of help, alone or with equipment, and with lower odds of using  		equipment alone. </p>
<p>Agree et al. (2005) applied a more complex approach than other  		observational studies of the relationship between use of equipment and hours of  		help. They used a consistent set of covariates in three models: a probit model  		to explain whether any assistive devices were used and two Tobit models to  		explain hours of informal and formal care. To assess substitution and  		supplementation, they examined the signs of coefficients across equations and  		pairwise correlations between the error terms in the three models. For each  		characteristic in the model, a positive coefficient for equipment use and a  		negative coefficient for either hours measure was considered to be an  		indication of substitution of equipment use for hours of that type. Two  		characteristics, being unmarried and having higher education, were associated  		with a higher likelihood of using assistive devices and fewer hours of informal  		care. Both characteristics were associated, however, with greater formal care  		hours. They concluded that a combination of assistive devices and formal care  		may substitute for informal help. Cognitive problems, conversely, were  		associated with a lower likelihood of using assistive devices and more hours of  		each type of help. More severe difficulty and advanced age were associated with  		a higher likelihood of assistive device use and greater hours of each type.  		Error correlations were positive between assistive device use and both types of  		care and negative between the two types of care, leasing to the conclusion  		that, in general, devices supplement help. </p>
<h3>Key Issues for Model Building</h3>
<p>Several key issues for modeling can be gleaned from what the literature  		to date has and has not attempted to address:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It is important to understand how conclusions from global measures  			 of device use may differ from conclusions with respect to particular activities  			 and particular types of devices. The ability to employ assistive devices may  			 differ depending on the activity examined, and some devices, notably mobility  			 devices, may have larger impacts because they are able to be used for multiple  			 activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent use of devices for some or all activities would seem  			 intuitively to be the place to look for the largest impacts on hours of care.  			 Modeling of potential substitution of devices for hours, however, needs to take  			 into account the clustering at zero of hours for persons using only equipment  			 for all disabilities and the characteristics and other factors that affect the  			 likelihood of being in this group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to consider how--and whether--models can  			 appropriately differentiate different types of substitution that may occur,  			 particularly in cross-sectional data. For example, Agree et al. (2005) note  			 that some types of substitution may not result in reduced hours of care because  			 use of devices for some activities may release hours of care to  			 other activities that otherwise would be inadequately addressed. Equipment use  			 also may result in smaller <i>increases</i> in hours as disability level  			 increases than seen for persons not using devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other outcomes than reduced hours of care are important for policy.  			 As discussed, the only randomized controlled trial indicated both functional  			 and cost benefits associated with introduction of devices and environmental  			 modifications. Use of equipment also may reduce the level of physical and/or  			 emotional stress on informal caregivers, who themselves are often elderly  			 spouses, which in turn may prolong the period over which they can provide care.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, substitution or supplementation occurs at the individual  			 level, can only be observed over time, and may work in either direction. That  			 is, individuals may use assistance in the earlier stages of disability when the  			 need for help is less frequent and then adopt devices, either instead of or in  			 addition to help, as frequency and level of need increases over time. They may  			 find it easier to manage with only devices at milder levels of disability and  			 then need to incorporate help as difficulty increases over time. The dynamic  			 nature of substitution and supplementation suggests use of longitudinal models  			 and data to improve understanding of how disability arrangements may change  			 over time as needs change and where policy may be most effective. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The primary purpose of this study is to update information on trends in  		device use among the older population, both for all devices combined and for  		individual activities, as background for considering the best approaches to  		modeling the choice of accommodations among the older population and potential  		impacts of these choices. The focus is on distinguishing trends in sole use of  		equipment, use of both help and equipment, and use of help only. Three domains  		fundamental to understanding disability arrangements among the older population  		are examined: disability characteristics, support characteristics, and  		socioeconomic characteristics.</p>
<p>Finally, differences in hours of care are examined at two margins: (1)  		persons using only help versus persons using any combination of help and  		equipment; and (2) persons using equipment with help versus persons using  		equipment independently for at least one activity. Implications of the findings  		for both cross-sectional and longitudinal modeling of choice of accommodation  		and impacts on hours of care are then discussed.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA AND METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The NLTCS is a nationally representative survey of persons aged 65 and  		older designed to identify those who are chronically disabled in one or more  		ADLs or IADLs and to collect detailed data on their disability, service use,  		family support, and health and demographic characteristics. The samples are  		drawn from Medicare enrollment files and represent both community and  		institutional residents. Once selected for the survey, individuals continue in  		the longitudinal component, and in each wave a new sample of persons who turned  		65 since the previous survey is selected so that each round of the survey  		provides cross-sectional estimates representative of the population age 65 or  		older in addition to a longitudinal sample. In 1994 and 1999 new samples of the  		oldest old also were drawn to preserve precision for older age groups.</p>
<p>For this study cross-sectional samples of community residents reporting  		chronic disability were selected from the four waves of the survey conducted in  		1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. Unweighted samples sizes are 4,746 in 1984, 3,329  		in 1989, 2,962 in 1994, and 2,926 in 1999. All estimates are weighted and  		standard errors adjusted to take into account the complex survey design. </p>
<h3>Disability Measures</h3>
<p>Disability items included in this study are six ADLs and eight IADLs.  		The ADLs are bathing, dressing, getting around inside, getting in and out of  		bed (transfer), toileting and eating. The included IADLs are shopping, managing  		money, meal preparation, laundry, light housework, taking medicines, getting  		around outdoors, and telephoning. Disability data on the NLTCS differ from that  		on some other national surveys, such as the Health and Retirement Survey and  		the National Health Interview Survey, in that disability is defined in terms of  		use of help, use of disability-related equipment, or reported need for help  		with ADLs and inability to perform IADLs. Although some innovations in  		screening have been added in the 2005 survey scheduled for release this year,  		through 1999, there is no universal screen for difficulty in performing these  		activities on the NLTCS and no unconditional screen for whether devices are  		used independent of the disability questions. Rather, only new entrants into  		the survey and other persons who have not previously screened into the detailed  		interview are asked in a screening interview whether they have  		problems with ADLs when they do not use help or equipment or are  		unable to perform IADLs without help because of health or disability.</p>
<p>Persons reporting <i>chronic</i> problems or inabilities, defined as  		lasting or expected to last at least three months, continue to a detailed  		interview about their disability and other characteristics. Persons who have  		reported chronic problems or inabilities in previous rounds of the survey are  		automatically selected for detailed interview. Beginning in 1994, subsamples of  		persons reporting no difficulties or inabilities on the screening interview  		also have been selected for detailed interview, but they are not asked about  		help or equipment use in the year in which they are selected.</p>
<p>The significance of this structure for assessing the prevalence of  		assistive device use is that it reduces the ability to measure equipment use by  		persons who do not perceive difficulty or disability because it is resolved by  		using equipment. Notably, common fixtures such as railings and grab bars or  		raised toilet seats may not be perceived as assistive devices if there is no  		residual difficulty when they are used. A recent study suggests that the margin  		of persons who use assistive devices but report no difficulty may be sizeable,  		although limitations of available survey data preclude definitive estimates of  		the size of this group (Cornman, Freedman, and Agree 2005). </p>
<p><b><i>ADL Questions </i></b></p>
<p>ADL questions on the detailed interview ask about help and use of  		equipment in the week prior to interview. For each activity, those who report  		help are asked if they also use equipment for the activity. Those who report no  		help are asked if they used equipment to perform the activity, and if yes, they  		are asked if anyone usually stayed nearby in case help was needed (standby  		help). Detail on the types of equipment used also is collected for all persons  		reporting equipment use to perform four of the ADLs: getting in or out of bed,  		getting around indoors, bathing, and toileting. For these four activities,  		persons reporting that they do not or cannot do the activity at all are  		considered to have disability in the activity. Those who report not using the  		toilet are also asked about equipment, such as special underwear, portable  		toilets, and catheter or colostomy bag.</p>
<p>For each ADL, respondents reporting help, equipment, or both are asked  		whether help or equipment was used most of the time, some of the time, or only  		occasionally. Although these questions do not differentiate between equipment  		and help, they provide a measure of the frequency of need for accommodation.  		For those receiving help with an activity, frequency of need would be expected  		to be positively related to the number of hours of help required, and frequency  		for activities such as getting around inside or transferring, which occur more  		often and are related to other activities such as the ability get to and use  		the toilet or bathe independently. In the absence of an independent measure of  		difficulty, frequency of help or equipment also may measure severity.</p>
<p>Respondents also are asked how long help or equipment has been used for  		each activity, again with no differentiation between help or equipment for  		those using both. The information about how long the disability has lasted is  		used to determine whether each disability is chronic, defined as lasting at  		least three months.</p>
<p>After all ADL questions are asked, for each activity for which no help  		was reported, respondents are asked whether anyone stayed nearby in case help  		was needed and, for all activities combined, for how long such standby help has  		been needed. ADL help measures used in this study include this standby  		assistance, along with active and standby help reported in the main ADL  		questions. Two additional questions ask about need for help with each activity  		for which no help was received and need for more help with each activity for  		which help was received. </p>
<p><b><i>IADL Questions </i></b></p>
<p>IADL questions take the general form of asking whether the respondent  		<i>usually</i> performs the activity independently. Thus, unlike the ADL  		questions, which refer to the previous week, questions about IADLs, which may  		be performed more intermittently than ADLs, are not tied to a particular  		reference period. Respondents are considered to have disability in performing  		an IADL item only if they report that they do not usually perform the activity  		independently, could not if they had to, and that the reason for inability was  		health or disability. The additional probe for the reason for inability to  		perform IADLs is intended to eliminate persons who do not do the activity  		because of habit, preference, or social arrangement. A common example is  		husbands who report that they cannot prepare meals or do housework, although  		they would be physically able to. Persons who perform these activities  		independently are asked whether they need help, but there is no probe for the  		reason why they need help. Nevertheless, within the chronically disabled  		population examined in this study, it seems reasonable to assume it is an  		indicator of disability-related need. </p>
<p>Equipment use is assessed for only two IADLs, getting around outdoors,  		and telephoning. Questions about getting around outdoors are similar in form to  		the ADL questions about transfer and getting around indoors. Persons reporting  		that they do not get around outdoors at all are asked whether it is because of  		health or disability and if yes are included as having disability in that item.  		Persons who do get around outdoors are included as having disability if they  		receive help or use equipment. They are not asked about ability to get around  		without help if they had to or about the reason for use of help or equipment.  		For telephoning, respondents are first asked whether they have a special phone  		(e.g., amplified or with an enlarged dialer), and then are asked whether they  		usually make their own calls. Only those who report that they do not make calls  		and could not if they had to are asked whether the reason is because of health  		or disability. </p>
<p>A final difference in the way IADL information is collected is that  		there is a single question about the duration of disability in all IADLs  		reported, rather than separate questions about the duration of each activity.  		Thus, unlike for the ADLs, it is not possible to identify whether some IADLs  		are chronic and others are not.</p>
<p><b><i>Categorizing Help or Equipment Use </i></b></p>
<p>For this study, the analysis sample is persons reporting chronic  		disability, defined as using help or equipment for at least three months with  		at least one of the six ADLs or eight IADLs. In order to capture all equipment  		use, variables were created for each activity indicating whether equipment  		and/or help was used, including disabilities that were not reported to be  		chronic. These variables are used to examine overall trends in use of equipment  		or help and to examine trends in use of help only, equipment only, or both for  		individual activities.</p>
<p>In addition, trends in the prevalence of individual types of equipment  		are reported for each of the four ADLs for which detail on equipment types is  		collected and for getting around outdoors. Because phones with special features  		such as amplification, speakers, and enlarged or lighted keypads are common for  		the general population, the link between having a special phone and disability  		would seem less clear than for the ADLs and outdoor mobility. Therefore having  		a special phone is ignored in categorizing individuals according to their  		chronic disabilities. When the text refers to persons using equipment for all  		disabilities, it means all disabilities for which the NLTCS identifies  		disability-related equipment use. Persons who report disability only in IADLs  		other than getting around outside have no opportunity to report use of devices,  		even though they may use them. </p>
<p>In addition, to examine disability and other characteristics of users  		and nonusers of disability equipment, we categorized individuals in the 1999  		sample according to whether they received help or used equipment for their  		<i>chronic</i> disabilities. Those reporting help with any chronic disability  		are categorized as help only if they did not report using equipment  		with any chronic disability, and were categorized as help and  		equipment if they reported using a combination of help and equipment for  		any chronic activity or a combination of help only with at least one chronic  		activity and equipment only with others. Those receiving no help with any  		chronic disability were categorized as equipment only. This  		categorization also is qualified by the inability to measure use of devices for  		IADLs other than getting around outside. The duration of chronic disability was  		defined as the longest duration over all disabilities reported.</p>
<p><b><i>Hours of Care </i></b></p>
<p>The NLTCS also collects data on all persons regularly  		providing help to respondents reporting help, whether they were paid or unpaid  		helpers, and the total hours of care each helper provided during the week prior  		to interview. Hours of help with individual activities are not collected. For  		this study we use total hours data from the 1999 survey to focus on how hours  		differed by characteristics in the most recent data. Total hours were missing  		for about 20 percent of paid and unpaid helpers identified as having helped in  		the last week. Hours for these helpers were imputed using the mean number of  		hours per helper of that type (paid or unpaid) for sampled persons with hours  		reported for all helpers, by type of help received (unpaid only/paid only/both)  		and disability level (IADL only/1-2 ADLs/3-4 ADLs/5-6 ADLs). </p>
<h3>Other Measures</h3>
<p>Additional characteristics of users and their situation also are  		examined using the most recent 1999 NLTCS. They are grouped into support  		characteristics describing the potential human and environmental supports  		available to chronically disabled community residents and socioeconomic  		characteristics.</p>
<p>To characterize the human supports available, a variable was constructed  		indicating whether respondents lived alone, lived with a spouse (with or  		without other household members), or lived with other nonspouse household  		members. In addition, a variable was constructed indicating the residential  		setting in three categories: a traditional private residence; a supportive  		setting, such as assisted living or a personal care home; or any other setting  		described by the respondent as being a complex or building for older or  		disabled persons.</p>
<p>All community residing respondents to the NLTCS also were asked first to  		identify all items on a list of potentially accommodative features such as  		handrails or grab bars that they had in their residence and then to identify  		all items on the list that would make things easier or more  		comfortable. Although the term home modifications is often  		used for these items, the phrase is not used in the survey, and there is no  		information on whether the features were added because of disability or already  		existed in the residence, so the terminology accommodative features is used in  		this study. The items listed were extra handrails or grab bars, ramps,  		elevators or stair lifts, extra wide doors or hallways, push bars on doors, and  		raised toilet. All items except extra wide doors or hallways and push bars on  		doors are included in equipment types that respondents could report using for  		one or more ADLs. </p>
<p>Socioeconomic characteristics included are age, gender, race, education,  		and income of the respondent or respondent and spouse, all of which have been  		associated with differences in disability and long-term care use in the  		literature. All are self explanatory except income. Total income data on the  		NLTCS is categorical and is collected in two questions about gross income  		before deductions in the previous 12 months, one for household income and one  		for income of the respondent and spouse, if the household included persons  		other than the respondent and spouse. In 1999, 28.5 percent of respondents were  		missing total income. The survey also used unfolding," a technique for  		eliciting rough ranges (e.g., would it be $25,000 or more, and if  		not, would it be $10,000 or more, etc.) from nonrespondents in  		order to improve imputation. Of the 28.5 percent who were missing income, 12.4  		percent provided some information to bracket their income in the unfolding  		questions, leaving 16.1 percent with no income information reported.</p>
<p>Eight separate hot deck imputations of income category were done to take  		advantage of the bracketing of income through unfolding, plus a residual  		imputation for persons not providing unfolding information. Using the  		information from unfolding, more select donor groups could be chosen--for  		example, income greater than $50,000; income less than $5,000; income between  		$10,000 and $25,000. Classification variables used in the imputation for  		nonrespondents who did not provide unfolding information were marital status,  		age, gender, education, and race, with a general criterion that cells had to  		have at least 20 donor observations with reported data and at least two donors  		per imputed observation. Cells not meeting the 20 observation criterion were  		collapsed, typically by race, because of the small representation of nonWhites  		on the survey, except where the donor to recipient ratio was high, for example  		14 donors to one recipient.</p>
<p>For cases where unfolding information was available, the same  		classification variables as for persons not providing unfolding information  		where possible, except for race. The smaller samples defined by the unfolding  		brackets would not support classification by race. For three imputations  		(&gt;$50,000, $25,000-$50,000, and &lt;$5,000), only classification by age and  		gender could be supported by the small donor pools, and for income  		$5,000-$10,000, only marital status, age and gender could be supported. Because  		of the fairly narrow bracketing of income, the inability to take into account  		all classification variables is less important than in a broader  		imputation.</p>
<p>The imputed categorical income variable then was used to construct an  		approximate measure of income relative to the federal poverty thresholds for  		persons and couples age 65 or older in 1999, up to a top category of four times  		the poverty threshold or greater. The poverty threshold is relevant because it  		adjusts for whether income is individual income or income for a couple but also  		because it is related to potential eligibility for Medicaid and public  		long-term care benefits.</p>
<p>The poverty threshold in 1999 was $10,075 for elderly couples and $7,990  		for single elders. Because the categorical income data include all increments  		of $10,000 through the relevant range, the approximation for couples is very  		close. For singles, survey categories available were less than $8,000, which  		closely approximates the poverty threshold, $8,000-$14,999 for poverty to twice  		poverty ($15,980), $15,000-$24,999 for twice poverty to three times poverty  		($23,970), $25,000-$29,999 for three to four times poverty, and $30,000 or  		greater for the final category of four times poverty ($31,960) or higher. Thus,  		for single persons, the reported poverty thresholds approximated by survey data  		somewhat understate the proportion with income between poverty and twice  		poverty, and the proportion with income between three and four times poverty  		and overstate the proportion with income between two and three times poverty,  		and the proportion with income four times poverty or greater.

<p>Although the prevalence of disability among all persons age 65 or older  		declined between 1984 and 1999, the number of community residents age 65 or  		older with chronic disability rose from 4.7 million in 1984 to 5.1 million in  		1999, and the way in which they managed their disabilities changed dramatically  		(<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table1">Table 1</a>). Both the number and proportion receiving only  		human help with disabilities fell while the use of equipment rose. In 1984,  		nearly 30 percent managed all disabilities solely with human assistance, and  		only about 15 percent were using equipment, with or without help, for all  		disabilities. By 1999, those proportions had essentially reversed, with only 14  		percent managing solely with help and nearly 30 percent using equipment for all  		activities. Almost one million more elders were using equipment with at least  		one activity in 1999 than in 1984.</p>
<p>Most of the increase in equipment use was in independent use. The  		proportion of chronically disabled elders who managed all disabilities with  		only equipment rose from 13 percent in 1984 to nearly one-quarter in 1999, and  		the proportion managing at least one of their disabilities with only equipment  		rose from about 53 percent to about 63 percent. The proportion using a  		combination of equipment and help with at least one disability also rose, from  		about 36 percent in 1984 to about 45 percent in 1999. </p>
<h3>Trends for Individual Activities</h3>
<p><a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table2">Table 2</a> shows the trends in disability and the  		prevalence of help and equipment for the seven disabilities for which equipment  		use can be measured, ordered from most prevalent to least. The prevalence of  		disability in each activity except dressing increased among community residents  		with chronic disability between 1984 and 1999, and the use of equipment  		increased significantly for all seven activities. Increases were largest for  		disability in bathing, transfer, toileting, getting around outside, and getting  		around inside, all of which are related to mobility, ranging from 8.6 to 12  		percentage points. There was only a 3.3 percentage point increase in disability  		in eating.</p>
<p>The four mobility-related ADLs also had the largest increases in  		equipment use, with or without help, ranging from 9.1 percentage points for  		getting around inside to 22.5 percentage points for bathing. All four also saw  		significant increases in independent use of equipment, ranging from 4.3  		percentage points for getting around inside to 10.5 percentage points for  		bathing. The IADL mobility item, getting around outside, is distinguished by  		being the only activity that saw significant increases in <i>both</i> sole use  		of equipment and sole use of help, with a 4.1 percentage point increase in the  		proportion reporting sole use of help and a 4.9 percentage point increase in  		equipment use, nearly all of which was in the proportion using equipment  		independently. The pattern of change for this item does not show a consistent  		trend. Notably, all of the significant change in use of help only occurred  		between 1994 and 1999, and all of the significant increase in independent  		equipment use occurred between 1984 and 1989.</p>
<p>Bathing stands out as the single activity for which there was a strong  		and consistent upward trend in equipment use and a consistent downward trend in  		sole use of help. Between 1984 and 1999, the proportion relying entirely on  		help fell by 10.5 percentage points while independent use of equipment rose by  		a similar amount, and use of a combination of help and equipment for bathing  		also rose by 11.9 percentage points over the period. Nearly one-quarter of  		chronically disabled elders relied entirely on help for bathing and 28 percent  		used equipment, with or without help in 1984. By 1999, only 13.5 percent relied  		entirely on help, more than half used equipment, and 24.4 percent used  		equipment independently.</p>
<p>Toileting, for which there was also a large increase in independent use  		of equipment, was the only other activity which ended the period with a  		significant reduction in sole use of help. In this case, however, the reduction  		was only 2.1 percentage points, and there was no consistent trend over the  		1984-1999 period. Nevertheless, one in three disabled elders were using  		toileting equipment in 1999, compared with one in five in 1984, and the  		proportion using equipment independently (18 percent) was nearly double the  		1984 level.</p>
<p>For getting around inside and transferring, the prevalence of equipment  		use, both independently and with help, also rose substantially but sole use of  		help for these activities was essentially unchanged over the period  		1984-1999.</p>
<h3>Trends in Types of Equipment</h3>
<p>Significant increases occurred in most common types of devices reported  		for individual activities. Consistent with the literature simple mobility  		devices were important in the increases. <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table3">Table 3</a> shows  		devices reported for the five activities for which detail on individual devices  		used is collected, again ordered from the most prevalent disability to the  		least. In most cases where the number of unweighted cases for a device was too  		small or the precision of the estimate too low, devices were combined with the  		unspecified other device category for each activity. The few  		exceptions are noted in the tables.</p>
<p>Walkers, canes and crutches are the most common device reported for  		getting around outside, with all of the 5.5 percentage point growth accruing to  		a doubling of the use of walkers from 9 percent of community residing elders  		with chronic disability in 1984 to 18.1 percent in 1999. Use of wheelchairs and  		scooters also increased steadily, nearly doubling in prevalence, but they still  		were used by only 11.3 percent of chronically disabled elders, compared with  		about half who used walkers, canes or crutches.</p>
<p>For bathing, there were steady increases in use of all named devices,  		most of which at least doubled in prevalence. Seats for tub or shower became  		the most common bathing device over the period and were used by 37.1 percent of  		chronically disabled elders in 1999, compared with only 14.3 percent in 1984.  		They were followed by grab bars and railings, which were used by a third of  		chronically disabled elders in 1999 but only 17.2 in 1984. Rubber mats and  		hand-held showers, devices in common use regardless of disability, also  		contributed to in rising equipment use for bathing among chronically disabled  		elders, with 19.3 percent using rubber mats in 1999, compared with only 6  		percent in 1984. Whereas the growth in use of hand-held showers, from less than  		3 percent in 1984 to 13.6 percent in 1999, may be attributable to the  		dispersion of such devices in the general economy, rubber mats have been  		commonplace for many years, so that it is perhaps surprising that they were so  		uncommonly used by persons with chronic disability in the past. Use of walkers  		and canes for bathing also increased substantially in prevalence, but were  		still used by less than 10 percent of elders with disability in 1999, and there  		was no trend in use of other, unspecified devices, which were used by less than  		3 percent of the chronically disabled in all years.</p>
<p>For getting around inside, as for outdoor mobility, walkers, canes and  		crutches were the most common devices and increased significantly from 35  		percent of chronically disabled elders in 1984 to 43.6 percent in 1999. Also  		similar to outdoor mobility, the increase in the use of walkers, which rose  		from 14.5 percent to 25.8 percent of chronically disabled elders, was larger  		than the modest increase in the use of canes, and use of wheelchairs and  		scooters roughly doubled, from 8 percent in 1984 to 15.6 percent of the  		chronically disabled in 1999. Use of handrails, furniture or walls, and other  		unspecified devices also increased significantly, but remained relatively  		uncommon. The same general pattern of increases was seen for getting in or out  		of bed, although in this case, walkers not only doubled in prevalence, but also  		became slightly more common than canes after 1989, with one in five chronically  		disabled elders using a walker to assist in transfer in 1999, compared with  		17.9 percent using canes. There was no significant change in use of other  		transfer equipment, which includes more advanced devices such as lift chairs  		and adjustable beds.</p>
<p>Simple devices also were most commonly reported for toileting. The  		largest increase was in raised toilet seats, which became the most common  		toileting device in 1999, having tripled in prevalence from less than 6 percent  		of the chronically disabled in 1984 to more than 18 percent in 1999. Handrails  		and grab bars doubled in prevalence to 12.5 percent of chronically disabled  		elders in 1999. The use of portable toilets increased modestly, but they  		declined from being the most common toileting device in 1984 to the third most  		common by 1999, followed closely by canes or walkers, which were used by about  		9 percent of disabled elders in 1999, compared with only about 3 percent in  		1984. Although there also was a large increase in use of special underwear or  		diapers, they still were reported as a toileting aid by only 6.2 percent of  		disabled elders in 1999, and there was no significant trend in reported use of  		bedpans or urinals or other toileting devices, including colostomy bags. </p>
<p><a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table4">Table 4</a> combines individual types of devices  		across activities where they are reported for more than one activity and ranks  		the devices according to overall prevalence. Only devices which have increased  		in prevalence are shown. Not surprisingly, given their prevalence for multiple  		activities, walkers, canes and crutches are by far the most common device, with  		65 percent of chronically disabled elders using them for one or more activities  		in 1999, up from 53.1 percent in 1984. They are followed by railings or grab  		bars and shower or tub seats, each of which increased in prevalence by roughly  		20 percentage points, and were used by nearly two in five chronically disabled  		elders in 1999. In fact, when the use of walkers, canes, crutches, and  		wheelchairs are combined (lower panel), 70 percent of chronically disabled  		community residents were using one or more of these devices in 1999, 50 percent  		along with devices for other activities and 20 percent without other device  		use. Only about 16 percent of chronically disabled elders were using other  		devices but not these dominant mobility-related aides.</p>
<h2><a name="user" id="user">CHARACTERISTICS OF USERS AND NONUSERS OF  		EQUIPMENT</a></h2>
<p>To examine how persons using equipment and help differ with respect to  		disability and other characteristics <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a>,  		<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table 6</a> and <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table7">Table 7</a> focus on 1999  		and group chronically disabled elders by whether they used only equipment, both  		help and equipment, or only help with their <i>chronic</i> disabilities.  		Persons using equipment only for all chronic activities may also report help  		with other activities which are not or not yet chronic. Similarly, those  		reporting only help may report using equipment with activities that are not  		chronic. In fact, as will be seen, almost none of those categorized as  		equipment only for all chronic activities reported any nonchronic activities  		with help, and almost none of those categorized as help only reported any  		equipment use. Persons reporting a combination of help and equipment with  		chronic activities may have reported any combination of help and equipment,  		including performing some activities solely with equipment and others solely  		with help, or performing any activity with both help and equipment. No  		distinction is made between hands-on assistance and supervision.</p>
<h3>Disability Characteristics</h3>
<p>Nearly 1.3 million persons age 65 or older, about one in four  		chronically disabled community residents in 1999, reported using only equipment  		to perform all chronic activities, and three million, or nearly 60 percent  		reported using a combination of help and equipment. Only about 15 percent  		reported using only help with all chronic activities. Disability  		characteristics differed dramatically across the three groups, with persons  		using both help and equipment having the greatest level of disability and those  		relying solely on help the least.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment Only Versus Help and Equipment</i></b></p>
<p>Considering first the distinctions between those who rely solely on  		equipment and those who use equipment but also use assistance the large  		majority of both groups reported lower body limitation, but just over one-third  		of those using only equipment had both upper and lower body limitations,  		compared nearly three-quarters of those who also used help, and half had only  		lower body limitations. Persons using only equipment were also dramatically  		less likely than those also using help to have each of the seven disabilities  		for which equipment can be measured. For example, less than 40 percent reported  		disability in getting around inside, compared with three-quarters of elders who  		also received help, and only small proportions reported disability in either  		dressing (2.8 percent) or eating (less than 1 percent). About one in five  		persons reported disability in only IADLs--specifically getting around outside  		for this group because all other IADLs are measured only by receiving  		help--two-thirds reported one to two ADLs, and only about 14 percent reported  		three or more ADLs. In contrast, less than 5 percent of persons using both  		equipment and help reported only IADL disability, and the rest were divided  		roughly equally across the three levels of ADL disability.</p>
<p>There were no differences in the duration of disability reported by the  		two groups, with roughly 90 percent of each group reporting at least a year of  		disability, but there were large differences in the frequency with which help  		or equipment was used. Less than three in five persons relying entirely on  		equipment reported accommodation most of the time for at least one ADL,  		compared with about 83 percent of those using both equipment and help. Only  		about a quarter reported accommodation most of the time specifically for  		transferring or getting around inside, compared with more than three in five  		persons using both help and equipment. </p>
<p>Almost none of those classified as using equipment only based on their  		chronic disabilities reported receiving any assistance with ADL disabilities  		which were not yet chronic. Thus, the distribution of this group by the number  		of ADLs with equipment differs from their distribution by disability level only  		because of the small group (less than 2 percent) who did report help with any  		nonchronic ADL disability.</p>
<p>Among those using both help and equipment, the pattern of help and  		equipment use indicates that a substantial proportion were using equipment  		independently for some or all of their ADL disabilities. Whereas less than 5  		percent had disability in only IADLs, 28 percent reported receiving help with  		only IADL disabilities, signifying that nearly one-quarter also had ADLs but  		managed all of them exclusively with equipment. Similarly, although 31.4  		percent reported having 3-4 ADL disabilities, only about 15 percent reported  		help with three or four ADLs, indicating that about half with this disability  		level managed at least one or two ADLs independently with equipment.</p>
<p>Only 6 percent of persons using both help and equipment with their  		chronic disabilities did not use equipment with any ADL. By definition of the  		group, this indicates use of equipment only for getting around outside. About  		90 percent used equipment with or without help for one to four ADLs. In fact,  		about half used equipment independently for at least one ADL but all of the 2.2  		percent who reported using equipment with five or six ADLs used it in  		combination with help (not shown).</p>
<p>The final two measures examined are reported need for help. It is  		sometimes hypothesized that sole use of equipment may be an indicator of unmet  		need for help, although Agree and Freedman (2003) reported a lower likelihood  		of desire for help among those using only devices for particular activities.  		Consistent with their finding, a negligible proportion of persons using only  		equipment for all chronic disabilities reported any unmet ADL need, although  		nearly a quarter reported needing help with IADLs which they performed without  		help. In contrast, one in five persons who used both help and equipment  		reported need for help or more help with ADLs, and two in five reported need  		for help with IADLs for which they received no help.</p>
<p><b><i>Personal Assistance Only</i></b></p>
<p>Persons relying entirely on help with all chronic disabilities reported  		substantially less disability than the other two groups. Although nearly 70  		percent reported lower body limitations, only about two in five reported  		disability in getting around outside, and only about one in four reported  		disability in bathing. Roughly similar proportions, ranging from 11 percent to  		17 percent report disability in the remaining ADLs.</p>
<p>For the other two groups, ADLs scaled in the order shown with bathing  		being the most common and eating the least common. For the group relying solely  		on help, however, dressing, transferring and toileting all appear to be more  		common disabilities than indoor mobility, and disability in eating appears to  		be nearly as common, although the differences are not significant. This most  		likely reflects lack of precision because of the small proportion reporting ADL  		disability. In fact, nearly two-thirds of this group reported only IADL  		disability and another 20 percent reported disability in only one or two ADLs,  		essentially the reverse of the proportions for persons relying solely on  		equipment. </p>
<p>One possible explanation for the different disability pattern of the  		group reporting help only and for the lack of assistive device use could be a  		higher rate of cognitive impairment. Cognitive problems, which are often  		associated with IADL impairment, were associated with a greater likelihood of  		help and a lower likelihood of device use in the studies reviewed. Because the  		1999 survey does not include a reliable survey measure of cognitive impairment,  		data from the 1994 survey were used to investigate this possibility. In the  		1994 data, there was indeed a higher rate of cognitive impairment among those  		using only help (28.8 percent), particularly in comparison with the group  		relying solely on equipment (9.7 percent). However, about one-quarter of elders  		using both help and equipment in 1994 was cognitively impaired, so it would  		seem that cognitive state may contribute to the different pattern of disability  		seen for those relying solely on help but does not fully explain it.</p>
<p>Because persons relying solely on help are only slightly more likely to  		have been disabled less than a year than the other two groups, the differences  		in the duration of disability also are unlikely to explain differences in  		disability patterns. This group does appear, however, to have more intermittent  		need for ADL assistance, with only about 14 percent reporting that they need  		help most of the time with any ADL and about 4 percent reporting need for help  		with transferring or mobility most of the time. Nearly 11 percent, however,  		report that they need help additional help with ADLs, and 41.8 percent that  		they need help with IADLs for which they receive none, a proportion similar to  		that for the group using both help and equipment. </p>
<h3>Support Characteristics</h3>
<p><a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a> compares living arrangement, type of  		residence, and type of accommodative features present in their homes or  		perceived to be valuable for the three basic groups from <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table4">Table 4</a>. These measures indicate the types of human and  		environmental supports available, but it is important to remember that these  		measures are related in complex ways to both disability level and use of  		assistance for long-term care needs. That is, for example, persons who are not  		able to manage their disabilities without help are more likely to choose to  		live with others, hire assistants, or live in a supportive setting. </p>
<p>Persons managing all their chronic disabilities with equipment are far  		more likely than other chronically disabled community residents to live alone  		(54.7 percent) and less likely to live with either a spouse or others. They are  		also more likely to live in some type of housing for senior citizens or persons  		with disability, although not more likely to live in a residential care  		setting. Living in housing designed for older persons may contribute to this  		groups high likelihood of reporting accommodative features. Less than  		half report having no such features, about 44 percent report handrails or grab  		bars, and about 16 percent report having a raised toilet. Less than 30 percent  		identify desirable items they feel would make things easier or more  		comfortable, the most common again being handrails or grab bars (17.4 percent)  		and a raised toilet (9.1 percent).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that there are few significant differences  		between those using only equipment and those using both help and equipment in  		the environmental accommodations present or considered desirable, the  		exceptions being the lower percent of persons using equipment only who report  		having or wanting raised toilet seats and ramps, or wanting wide doors or  		halls. A similar proportion of the two groups report having no accommodative  		features in their homes (45 percent and 41.5 percent), but those using both  		help and equipment are more likely to identify at least one feature that they  		feel would be desirable. </p>
<p>Comparing the two groups using help, there is no significant difference  		in the proportions who live alone, but those using both equipment and help are  		somewhat less likely to have a spouse and more likely to live with others.  		Although living in residential care is uncommon for all groups, those using  		both help and equipment also are most likely, at 7.2 percent, to live in such a  		supportive setting, compared with only 3.1 percent of those receiving only  		help. About 8.6 percent of both groups live in some other type of housing for  		seniors.</p>
<p>The most notable difference between the two groups using help is the  		small proportion of persons using only help who identify any environmental  		features they either have or would find desirable. Only 20 percent of this  		group reports having any such features, compared with nearly 60 percent of the  		group using both help and equipment, and about 20 percent identify any  		desirable features, compared with 35 percent of the group using both help and  		equipment. The lack of accommodative features or desire for them presumably is  		related to nature of the items listed, all of which are related to mobility or  		toileting, and the lower disability level of the group using only help. Only 35  		percent of this group reported any ADL disability, compared with nearly all (96  		percent) of persons reporting both help and equipment, about 13 percent  		disability in getting around inside, and 14 percent reported disability in  		toileting. </p>
<h3>Socioeconomic Characteristics</h3>
<p>The demographic and economic characteristics shown in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table 6</a> all have been found in previous research to be  		related to disability and long-term care use, and unlike the support  		characteristics in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a>, they are for the most part  		determined externally. That is, for example, educational attainment is  		determined much earlier in life in nearly all cases, so that the direction of  		causation can be assumed to be from education to the choice of disability  		accommodation. Although income can be affected in a number of ways by need for  		long-term care, particularly over time, it is reasonable to assume that in  		cross-section, it operates primarily as an enabling characteristic affecting  		long-term care choices either through ability to pay for formal services or  		likelihood of qualifying for Medicaid long-term care benefits. Lower economic  		status, however, is also associated with poorer health and higher mortality and  		morbidity (Fuchs 2004). Disability also rises with age and is more common for  		women, who have greater longevity than men and historically have been more  		likely to have chronic diseases associated with mortality (Guralnik et al.  		1997; Verbrugge 1990).</p>
<p>Recalling that the group using both help and equipment has the highest  		level of disability and the group using help only the least, it is interesting  		to note that the two groups using help tend to be more similar with respect to  		education and income, and the two groups using equipment are more similar with  		respect to gender and age. There are no significant differences in race across  		the three samples. </p>
<p>Considering age and gender first, 37.4 percent of persons relying solely  		on help are under age 75, compared with about a quarter of those using  		equipment, with or without help, and they are also far more evenly divided  		between genders, with about 57 percent female, compared with about 70 percent  		for the groups using equipment. It will be recalled that a larger proportion of  		this group--nearly half--were still married and living with a spouse (<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a>). On the other hand, although both groups using  		equipment are more likely to be 75 or older, nearly one-third of the group  		using both help and equipment is age 85 or older, while nearly half of the  		group using only equipment is in the 75-84 age range. This is consistent with  		the hypothesis that advancing age and frailty may increase the need for help  		even among equipment users, although the ordering of adoption of the two types  		of accommodation has not been demonstrated in the literature, and the  		relatively younger age of the group using only help does not support the  		hypothesis.</p>
<p>Although higher education has been associated with greater likelihood of  		equipment use, that appears to be true only for those who manage all chronic  		disabilities with equipment. Only about 36 percent of this group has less than  		a high school education, compared with about half of the two groups who use  		help, and nearly one in three have some college, compared with less than one in  		four of the groups using help. This appears to imply that lower education is  		more strongly related to use of help, but also may be related to the older age  		of the group using both help and equipment because educational attainment has  		increased over time. </p>
<p>Similarly, the group using only equipment appears to have higher income  		than the group using both help and equipment, which also may be related to age.  		They are significantly less likely than those using both help and equipment to  		have income below twice the poverty threshold if married, significantly less  		likely to have this low income level than either of the groups using help if  		unmarried, and significantly more likely than either group to have income above  		three times the poverty threshold, regardless of marital status. It is worth  		noting the proportion of married persons with income below twice the poverty  		threshold is substantial, ranging from about 36 percent for those managing only  		with equipment to just over half of those using both help and equipment.  		Unmarried persons have even lower incomes, with the proportion having income  		below twice poverty ranging from nearly two-thirds of persons managing their  		chronic disability with only equipment to more than three-quarters of those  		receiving only help. </p>
<h2><a name="hour" id="hour">DISABILITY CHARACTERISTICS AND AVERAGE HOURS OF  		HELP</a></h2>
<p>Consistent with previous research, the most important differences in  		characteristics of persons using equipment or help independently and persons  		using a combination of help and equipment were in their level of disability.  		<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a> and <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table 6</a> examine  		differences in total weekly hours of help reported by persons receiving help  		relate to disability characteristics. Hours of help with individual activities  		are not collected.</p>
<p><a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a> shows the average total hours of care in  		the past week associated with each disability measure in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table4">Table 4</a>. In addition, total hours by the <i>number</i> of  		ADLs for which frequent help or equipment use is needed. Persons using only  		equipment for all activities are excluded to focus on how hours are affected by  		differences in the extent of equipment use among those using some help. Hours  		are provided in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a> for the group reporting help only  		for all chronic disabilities, but because of small sample sizes that result in  		poor precision, discussion focuses on the much larger group using both help and  		equipment. <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table 6</a> then focuses on the latter group using  		both help and equipment to examine how hours of care differ at each level of  		disability when some activities are managed solely with equipment. </p>
<p>For the most part, total hours of help rise predictably with disability  		level and are higher for persons with lower prevalence disabilities associated  		with more severe and multiple disabilities, such as eating disability, than for  		persons with other more common disabilities, such as getting around outside (<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table5">Table 5</a>). </p>
<p>Persons using both help and equipment receive 41 hours of care in a  		week--15 hours more than persons who rely solely on help, consistent with their  		higher level of disability. Hours of help rise with both level of physical  		limitation and disability level among persons using both equipment and help.  		For example, the nearly three-quarters of this group with both upper and lower  		body limitations receive an average of about 46 hours of care per week,  		compared with 25 hours for persons with no limitations or only upper body  		limitations and 27 hours for persons with only lower body limitation. Persons  		receiving assistance with eating, typically associated with a larger number of  		disabilities, receive about 75 hours of help per week, compared with 42 hours  		for persons with disability in getting around outside, the highest prevalence  		disability among those for which equipment use is measured. Persons with  		disability only in IADLs receive about 19 hours of help per week--about half  		the average for all persons using help and equipment--and average hours rise  		with the number of ADL disabilities to 70 hours for those with disability in  		five or six ADLs. </p>
<p>Duration of disability does not appear to be related to hours of care,  		but greater frequency of need for help or equipment is associated with  		substantial increases in hours of help. Persons needing help or equipment most  		of the time for any ADL disability receive about 44 hours of help, 20 hours  		more than received by those not reporting this level of need. Frequent need for  		help or equipment for transfer or indoor mobility has a similar impact. The  		number of hours also increases dramatically with the number of ADLs for which  		help or equipment is needed most of the time. Persons using both help and  		equipment who report needing accommodation most of the time for five or six  		ADLs receive an average of 86 hours of help per week, compared with just under  		30 hours for those needing help or equipment most of the time for only one or  		two ADLs.</p>
<p>Hours of care rise also rise steadily with both the number of ADL  		disabilities for which help is received and the number with which any equipment  		is used. In fact, persons using equipment with 1-2 ADLs receive about nine more  		hours of help in a week than persons using help with 1-2 ADLs. This does not  		indicate that use of equipment per se increases hours of care. In  		<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table4">Table 4</a> it was seen that about 32 percent of persons  		using both help and equipment had one or two ADL disabilities, but nearly 48  		percent use equipment with that number of ADLs. Thus, about one-third of this  		group receives help with more than two ADLs but uses equipment with only one or  		two of them. </p>
<p>In contrast, for the 15 percent of elders with chronic disability who  		use only help, hours of help are significantly higher for those with any ADL  		disabilities, but there is little variation in the number of hours of help  		associated with different ADLs. Apparent increases in hours associated with  		greater numbers of ADL disabilities are not significant, reflecting in part the  		lack of precision because small sample sizes. Where significance differences  		are found between the group using only help and the group using both help and  		equipment, they indicate that the group using both help and equipment use  		<i>more</i> hours of care, consistent with their higher average disability  		level. This is true for persons with both upper and lower body limitations,  		disability in dressing or eating, and for all durations of chronic disability.  		For variables explicitly related to the number of disabilities--the number of  		ADLs with help or equipment most of the time and the number of ADLs with  		help--there is some evidence that equipment users may receive fewer hours of  		care, particularly when controlling for the number of activities with which  		frequent ADL help is needed, but the differences are not significant. </p>
<p>Interestingly, for both groups, persons reporting the need for help or  		more help with ADLs are already receiving significantly more hours of care that  		those who report no unmet need for ADL help. The difference is slightly larger  		for person using only help (18 hours) than for persons using both help and  		equipment (14 hours). This may reflect in part the lower likelihood of reported  		unmet need among persons using equipment independently. As noted in the  		discussion of <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table4">Table 4</a>, slightly more than half of persons  		using both help and equipment use equipment independently for at least one ADL  		disability. </p>
<p><a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table 6</a> examines more closely the relationship  		between independent use of equipment and hours of care, limited to persons who  		used a combination of help and equipment. That is, setting aside differences  		that may explain whether <i>any</i> equipment is used, <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table  		6</a> examines how hours of care differ by disability level for groups using  		equipment <i>only with help </i>and those using equipment alone for some  		activities. Statistical significance is indicated for differences in hours for  		persons using equipment alone relative to persons using equipment only with  		help, controlling for number of ADL disabilities and number of activities with  		equipment.</p>
<p>It is obvious that any given level of disability defined by the number  		of disabilities, hours of help would be expected to fall with increased numbers  		of activities performed independently with equipment. However, the estimates in  		<a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table6">Table 6</a> suggest that the most important place to look for  		opportunities to substitute equipment for assistance is for persons with at  		least three ADLs and at the margin between independent performance with  		equipment and the use of both help and equipment.</p>
<p>There is essentially no difference in hours of help between persons  		using equipment with and without help in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table8">Table 8</a> below  		the three ADL level, and moreover, no difference from the group with fewer than  		three ADLs using only help shown in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table7">Table 7</a>. In fact, the  		hours shown in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table7">Table 7</a> for persons using only help with  		three or more ADLs are significantly lower than for those using help  		<i>with</i> equipment and significantly higher than for those using equipment  		<i>independently</i> for any activities. Thus it would appear that the group  		using equipment independently is the source of the apparently (albeit not  		significantly) lower hours for persons using a combination of help and  		equipment in <a href="assistive-device-use-among-elderly-trends-characteristics-users-and-implications-modeling.html#table7">Table 7</a> relative to those relying solely on  		help. This suggests that a key question to be answered is whether unmeasured  		differences in disability severity, illness, general frailty, or attitudes and  		preferences within a given disability level explain the ability to perform some  		activities with only equipment, or whether there are opportunities for  		improving fit between devices used and the user or other ways of increasing the  		likelihood that persons using equipment <i>with</i> help could function more  		independently. </p>
<p>Roughly equal proportions of persons using both equipment and help use  		equipment with help or independently. Persons using equipment with help,  		however, are far more likely to have very high levels of disability, and hours  		of help <i>rise</i> with the number of activities performed with both help and  		equipment, within disability level. </p>
<p>Persons with five or six ADLs who use equipment with help for one or two  		ADLs received 62 hours of help in a week, compared with 20 fewer hours for  		similarly disabled persons performing one or two ADLs with equipment alone.  		Differences are even more dramatic for independent performance with equipment  		of three or four ADLs. (No one at this disability level performed five or six  		ADLs solely with equipment.) Clearly, if an intervention was able to allow even  		a fraction of the roughly 800,000 persons with five or six ADLs using equipment  		with help to use it independently, substantial reductions in hours of care  		could be realized.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>This study has confirmed and updated information about the dramatic  		increases since the mid 1980s in use of disability-related equipment by  		community residing older persons with chronic disability. Between 1984 and  		1999, the proportion of chronically disabled community residents using  		equipment, with or without help, for all seven activities for which equipment  		use can be measured on the NLTCS doubled to nearly 30 percent, and the  		proportion relying solely on help fell to 14 percent. Equipment use is measured  		for six ADLs, bathing, getting around inside, transferring, toileting,  		dressing, and eating, and for one IADL, getting around outside. Almost one  		million more elders were using equipment with at least one of these activities  		in 1999 than in 1984. </p>
<h3>Key Findings for Equipment Use Trends</h3>
<p>Most of the increase in equipment use was in independent use without  		human help. Nearly one-quarter of chronically disabled elders managed all  		chronic disabilities with only equipment in 1999, and almost two in three used  		equipment independently for at least one disability. The proportion using a  		combination of equipment and help with at least one disability also rose, from  		about 36 percent in 1984 to about 45 percent in 1999.</p>
<p>The increases in use of equipment occurred for all seven activities, but  		for only one, bathing, was a strong and consistent upward trend in independent  		use of equipment accompanied by a similarly strong and consistent downward  		trend in sole use of help. Nevertheless, significant increases in independent  		use of equipment occurred over the period for all four mobility-related  		ADLs--bathing, getting around inside, transferring, and toileting--and for  		getting around outside.</p>
<p>Increases in equipment were not the result of proliferation of complex  		assistive technology. Simple devices for mobility, bathing, and  		toileting--walkers, canes and crutches, tub or shower seats, and raised toilet  		seats--continued to be most common and saw the largest increases, although  		wheelchairs and scooters also nearly doubled in prevalence. Nearly two-thirds  		of chronically disabled elders were using walkers, canes, or crutches for at  		least one disability in 1999, one in five used a wheelchair or scooter, half  		used one or more simple devices to assist with bathing, and one-third used one  		or more devices to assist in toileting, most commonly a raised seat. When  		walkers, canes, crutches, wheelchairs and scooters were combined, 70 percent of  		elders in 1999 were using one of these mobility aids, 50 percent with at least  		one other device. Only about 16 percent of chronically disabled elders were  		using only other devices without one of these mobility aids. </p>
<h3>Key Findings for Use and Nonuse of Equipment</h3>
<p>In 1999, 1.3 million persons age 65 or older, about one in four  		chronically disabled community residents, used only equipment for all  		disabilities; three million, or nearly 60 percent used a combination of help  		and equipment; and only about 15 percent reported using only help with all  		chronic disabilities. Both disability characteristics and other characteristics  		indicating human and environmental supports and socioeconomic status differed  		significantly across these groups defined by accommodations used. </p>
<p>Persons managing all chronic disabilities with only equipment were  		significantly less disabled than persons using both help and equipment on all  		measures. Differences relating to mobility and the frequency with which  		accommodation was needed were particularly notable. Although a substantial  		proportion of elders using only equipment (84 percent) had lower body  		limitations and about three in four reported disability in getting around  		outside, less than two in five reported disability in getting around inside the  		home and only one in four reported that equipment was needed most of the time  		for transferring or getting around inside. In contrast, nearly all persons  		using a combination of help and equipment reported disability in getting around  		outside, three-quarters were disabled in getting around inside the home, and  		almost two-thirds required help or equipment most of the time for transfer or  		getting around inside.</p>
<p>The minority of chronically disabled elders who used only help for all  		chronic disabilities were far less disabled than both groups using equipment.  		Nearly two-thirds were disabled only in IADLs, only 12 percent reported needing  		help most of the time with any ADL, and about 4 percent reported needing help  		most of the time for transfer or indoor mobility.</p>
<p>Sole reliance on equipment did not indicate greater unmet need for help.  		Essentially none of the group using only equipment for their chronic  		disabilities reported any unmet need for help with ADLs, compared with about  		one in five persons using a combination of help and equipment, and about one in  		ten persons receiving only help. All groups reported needing help with IADLs  		for which they were receiving none, but only about one in four persons using  		only equipment reported unmet IADL need, compared with about two in five of the  		groups already receiving help. </p>
<p>Consistent with findings in previous research, persons managing all  		disabilities with equipment were most likely to live alone, while persons  		relying solely on help were most likely to live with a spouse. Persons using  		equipment alone also were most likely to live in some type of senior housing,  		but persons using a combination of help and equipment were most likely to live  		in an explicit community residential care setting, such as assisted living or a  		personal care home. The largest distinction between the two groups using  		equipment and the group using only help was that more than 80 percent of the  		group relying entirely on help reported that they neither had nor considered  		desirable any of the list of accommodative features, such as railings or raised  		toilet seats, included in the NLTCS. This may be related to the far smaller  		proportion of this group reporting ADL disabilities to which most of the  		included features would relate. </p>
<p>Comparison of socioeconomic characteristics revealed that the two groups  		using equipment were relatively similar with respect to age and gender  		distribution, although the group using both help and equipment was more likely  		to be age 85 or older. On the other hand, the two groups using help were more  		similar with respect to both education level and income, with the group using  		equipment independently for all disabilities having more education and higher  		income than either group using help. </p>
<h3>Hours, Equipment Use, and Independent Equipment Use</h3>
<p>Total weekly hours of help first were examined for all persons using  		help, to compare hours for persons using only help and persons using some  		combination of help and equipment. Estimates showed the expected pattern that  		hours rise with disability and generally were higher for the more disabled  		group using both help and equipment. The frequency of need for help or  		equipment also was important. For both groups, needing accommodation to perform  		<i>any</i> ADL most of the time more than doubled the hours of help received,  		and hours rose markedly with the number of activities for which help or  		equipment was needed most of the time. Frequency was one of the few disability  		measures where estimates suggested that persons using both help and equipment  		received fewer hours of help, although the large differences for frequent help  		with three or more ADLs were not significant. </p>
<p>When hours estimates were further limited to persons who received some  		combination of help and equipment, however, it was evident that the observed  		lower hours relative to the group using only help were attributable entirely to  		persons who received help but also performed at least one activity with only  		equipment. For disability levels of three or more ADLs, persons using equipment  		<i>with</i> assistance received significantly more hours of help than persons  		receiving only help; persons managing at least one activity with only equipment  		received significantly fewer hours. </p>
<p>Persons using equipment <i>with</i> assistance were more likely to have  		high levels of disabilities and received hours of care approaching three times  		the hours received by persons who managed some activities with only equipment.  		Even controlling for the total number of ADL disabilities and the number of  		activities with which equipment was used, all persons with at least three ADLs  		who used equipment <i>with</i> assistance received significantly more hours of  		help than did persons who managed at least one activity with only equipment,  		and hours also rose within each disability level as the number of activities  		performed with both equipment and help increased. Conversely, as would be  		expected, hours fell with the number of activities performed independently with  		equipment. </p>
<h3>Implications for Conceptual and Empirical Modeling</h3>
<p>Several observations drawn from the descriptive results in this study  		have implications for multivariate models of the relationship between assistive  		device use and use of help and of impacts of device use on hours of care and  		other outcomes. Generally, better understanding of these relationships may  		require longitudinal analyses, more narrowly focused cross-sectional analyses,  		and more information on health status and changes in functional and other  		characteristics than have been typical in the literature to date.</p>
<p>First, persons using either type of accommodation alone differ  		significantly from each other and from persons using both, in the type and  		number of disabilities and the frequency with which accommodation is used.  		Studies to date have not determined whether exclusive use of one type of  		accommodation is most likely to be a transitional situation in a typical  		progression of accommodations used over time as functional status declines, or  		whether substantial heterogeneity exists. Longitudinal analyses may be able to  		provide insights into whether there is a typical ordering of the adoption of  		accommodations and what factors are associated with changes in accommodations  		or different orderings. </p>
<p>Although the five-year survey cycle of the NLTCS does not allow for  		continuous observation of changes in functional status and accommodations,  		functional information from the 1994 survey and information from both rounds of  		the survey on the duration of individual disabilities can be used to construct  		indicators of the course of disability between the two survey rounds, including  		onset or resolution of disability or specific disabilities. Only the maximum  		duration over all disabilities was examined in this study. In addition,  		Medicare claims history from age 65 can be linked with each person in the  		NLTCS. This linkage allows for continuous information about the occurrence and  		timing of events, such as hospitalizations or use of post-acute care, which may  		affect acquisition and use of assistive devices use of assistance as well as  		augmenting limited survey reported information on chronic conditions. </p>
<p>Second, the majority of chronically disabled elders uses both equipment  		and help. They are about evenly divided between persons using equipment  		exclusively with assistance and persons who manage some disabilities with only  		equipment. Hours of care, however, are concentrated among the half of this  		group relying on help with or without equipment for all activities. Although  		persons using equipment <i>with</i> help are far more likely to be severely  		disabled, within each level of disability some persons are able to perform some  		activities with only equipment, with large impacts on the number of hours of  		help received. This suggests that analyses focusing on the majority of disabled  		elders who use some combination of help and equipment, abstracting from the  		probability of being in this group, may yield important insights into the scope  		for potential interventions to promote more independent function and into  		factors associated with greater or lesser hours of care when equipment is used  		with help. Such a focused analysis also reduces--but does not eliminate--the  		importance of endogeneity of living arrangement and choice of accommodations.  		</p>
<p>A key feature in such a focused model would be to build in information  		about recent changes in functional status, living situation, and recent health  		events that may help reveal the extent to which unobserved illness or  		disability severity, rather than other modifiable factors, explain observed use  		of equipment with or without help and differences in hours of care. Again, the  		ability to link Medicare claims history allows observation of recent salient  		events, such as hospitalization for hip fracture or stroke, or use of  		post-acute care, as well as providing additional information on chronic  		conditions. </p>
<p>In either cross-sectional or longitudinal modeling, it also may be  		important to consider the role of particular disabilities, notably mobility  		disability, in the accommodations used. It was seen, for example, that  		mobility-related devices are the most common type of device and that persons  		using mobility devices are more likely to use other devices as well. It was  		also seen that persons using a combination of equipment and help were far more  		likely to use equipment or help most of the time for transfer or indoor  		mobility than persons using equipment only for all disabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, as discussed earlier, other outcomes than hours of care are  		important in studies of the impact of assistive device use, including unmet  		need, impacts on caregiver health, changes in functional status, and health and  		long-term care costs. It was seen that persons using both equipment and help  		were more likely to report unmet need for help than persons relying solely on  		equipment. That may or may not be true within the more disabled group using  		both. The 1999 NLTCS also includes a supplemental interview of primary  		caregivers which may support analysis of caregiver outcomes for different  		patterns of accommodation. Recently, additional years of additional years of  		Medicare claims as well as assessment data also have become available to  		federal contractors. These data offer the opportunity to examine other outcomes  		relating to use of help and/or equipment, such as nursing home admissions, home  		health use, hospitalizations, and Medicare spending, as well as changes in  		functional status for persons who have assessment data as a result of either  		nursing home or home health care. </p>
