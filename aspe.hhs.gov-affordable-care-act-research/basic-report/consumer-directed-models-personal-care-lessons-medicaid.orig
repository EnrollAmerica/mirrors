</dl><p>Historically, professional authority has played a dominant role in the  		social organization of medical care and related human services (Friedson 1970).  		In recent years, however, a countervailing ideology, or ethic, of "consumerism"  		has begun to assert itself in the health and human services domain.</p>
<p>In this article, we compare and contrast alternative approaches to  		administering programs, financed under the Medicaid personal care services  		(PCS) optional benefit, that make attendant services available to low-income  		elderly and disabled persons in need of help with daily living tasks. Our  		analyses address the following issues:</p>
<ul><li>By how much do state Medicaid PCS programs vary in terms of their  		  administrative features that promote greater consumer choice and control or,  		  conversely, in their emphasis on professional oversight and  		  accountability?</li>
<li>To what extent have program administrators actively fostered  		  consumer-directed care models?</li>
<li>What are the decision-making trade-offs in terms of Medicaid PCS  		  costs per hour of attendant service, coverage for high-need clients, perceived  		  risks to quality, or other liability concerns associated with consumer  		  direction versus professional management of attendant services?</li>
<li>To what extent do clients report having greater choice and control  		  over attendant services in some states' Medicaid PCS programs as compared to  		  others?</li>
<li>Does greater client choice and control result in higher client  		  satisfaction with attendant services?</li>
</ul><h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<h3>Philosophical Origins of "Consumer-Directed" Services  		Models</h3>
<p>The concept of "consumer-directed" personal assistance comes out of the  		independent living and disability rights movements (Litvak, Zukas, and Heumann  		1987; Simon-Rusinowitz and Hofland 1993; DeJong, Batavia, and McKnew 1992). The  		term "personal assistance services" (PAS) refers to a range of human and  		mechanical assistance provided to persons with disabilities of any age who  		require help with routine activities of daily life (ADLs). These services, when  		provided in non-institutional settings, are also frequently referred to as  		"home and community-based long-term care." PAS is the term preferred by persons  		with disabilities and professionals in the disability and aging fields who  		advocate consumer-directed models of service provision as a means of maximizing  		the independence and autonomy of persons who need functional assistance from  		others. Although PAS, broadly defined, includes assistive technologies, home  		modifications, phychosocial rehabilitation, and a host of other specialized  		products and services oriented to persons with disabilities, the core service  		is personal assistance provided by an individual who is variously referred to  		as a personal assistant, attendant, or aide. "Consumer-directed" modes of  		financing and delivering attendant services permit service recipients--as  		opposed to medical or social work professionals--comparatively greater choice  		and control over all aspects of service provision: from hiring the attendant,  		to defining the attendant's duties, to deciding when and how specific tasks or  		services are performed. Actual programs may be ranked on a continuum as more or  		less "consumer directed" to the extent that they foster greater choice and  		control along several dimensions such as hiring and firing, training,  		supervising, and paying attendants.</p>
<p>Advocates of consumer-directed models of service provision argue that  		people with disabilities should be afforded as much independence and autonomy  		as possible in decisions about the types, amounts, and sources of the PAS they  		receive--especially regarding attendant services. At the same time, the use of  		public funds raises significant questions of accountability--including  		liability for adverse outcomes--which must be faced. Traditionally, government  		health and human services program administrators have viewed requirements for  		professional standards and supervision as their main method of achieving  		accountability. Moreover, advocacy of formal, publicly funded "home care" has,  		until recently, been mainly the province of groups representing older persons  		and, as Eustis and Fischer (1992) have observed, advocates for the elderly, in  		contrast to the disability rights movement, have tended to be proponents of  		professional case-management and strong quality-of-care regulation.</p>
<h3>The Medicaid Personal Care Services Benefit</h3>
<p>Medicaid is the single largest source of financing for home and  		community-based (HCB) long-term-care services for the disabled of all ages.  		Within Medicaid, the personal care optional benefit remains the major funding  		mechanism for personal attendant services used by the elderly and by younger,  		physically disabled populations. Although, as of 1993, Medicaid expenditures,  		for HCB long-term care provided under the rubric of section 1915(c)<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> waivers surpassed spending under  		the personal care benefit, two-thirds of this funding goes toward services for  		the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled, as distinct from services  		for the elderly and physically disabled under age 65 (Miller 1992). Although  		PCS has existed as an optional benefit in Medicaid since the early days of the  		program, relatively few states elected to provide this coverage prior to the  		1980s. In fiscal year (FY) 1979, only ten states provided PCS. As of FY 1994,  		however, 33 Medicaid programs included PCS. Total national Medicaid PCS  		expenditures for FY 1994 were just under $3 billion.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA SOURCES</a></h2>
<p>Data are presented here on both the administrative features of Medicaid  		PCS and the client perspective on care. Descriptive data on the administrative  		features of Medicaid PCS are from surveys of attendant services programs in all  		50 states conducted in 1984 and 1988 by the World Institute on Disability  		(WID), and subsequent in-depth case studies in six states based on site visits  		carried out during 1990 and 1991. Client perceptions of their role in directing  		services, as well as satisfaction with care, are drawn from a 1990 survey of  		elderly PCS clients in three states designed by staff of the Commonwealth Fund  		Commission on Elderly People Living Alone and carried out by Louis Harris and  		Associates (Commonwealth Fund Commission ... 1991).</p>
<p>The 1984 and 1988 surveys of 50 states were conducted via mail  		questionnaire, followed up by telephone interviews with state program officials  		for purposes of clarification and completion. The surveys sought to obtain  		information about all attendant programs serving the elderly and younger  		physically disabled persons--including those who are funded from sources other  		than the Medicaid PCS benefit. In this article, however, we report descriptive  		information only on Medicaid PCS programs. (For additional information about  		these surveys see Litvak, Zukas, and Heumann[1987] and Litvak and Kennedy  		[1991].)</p>
<p>Descriptive data on Medicaid PCS programs from the 1988 WID 50-state  		survey provided the basis for selecting a limited subset of programs for  		in-depth case study. The sites (Michigan, Maryland, Texas, Massachusetts,  		Oregon, and Montana) were selected, in large part, because they exemplified  		contrasting approaches to services financing and delivery on dimensions  		relevant to consumer choice and control. In Michigan, Maryland, and  		Massachusetts, Medicaid PCS aides were exclusively or predominantly  		"independent providers." In contrast, Texas, Oregon, and Montana required all,  		or almost all, aides to be employees of Medicare or Medicaid certified home  		health agencies (HHAs). The states were also selected to represent variations  		among states in requirements for formal quality assurance (e.g., aide training  		and the nature and frequency of supervision by registered nurses) as well as  		how strictly they chose to interpret federal Medicaid prohibitions against  		hiring family members as PCS aides. The main purpose of the case studies was to  		find out from state PCS program officials why various administrative features  		or regulations had been adopted. In particular, interviews with state officials  		sought to determine the extent to which state decision-making had been  		motivated by philosophical values (for example, a belief that certain program  		elements were desirable because they maximized consumer choice and control, or  		were supportive of family caregivers, or because they represented professional  		standards of quality assurance) or, conversely, whether decisions had been  		driven by practical considerations such as cost control or minimizing states'  		legal liability. (For additional information on the state case studies, see  		Kennedy and Litvak [1991].)</p>
<p>Data on Medicaid PCS client perceptions of choice and control, as well  		as measures of client satisfaction with attendant services, were obtained via a  		questionnaire survey, administered in face-to-face, in-home interviews with  		samples of Medicaid clients in three states. Because the Commonwealth  		Commission's mandate was to explore issues affecting older Americans, the  		survey focused exclusively on Medicaid PCS clients aged 65 and older. By  		design, the states included in the Commonwealth Commission client survey  		(Michigan, Maryland, Texas) were also among the WID case-study states.</p>
<p>Louis Harris and Associates completed a total of 879 face-to-face,  		in-home interviews between May 18 and August 19, 1991 (300 in Maryland, 276 in  		Michigan, 303 in Texas). In each state, about half the interviews were drawn  		from an urban area and half from a rural area. In all, 1,405 people were  		approached for interview, based on names drawn from Medicaid enrollment lists.  		Of these, 28 percent were ineligible: 21 percent because they were  		hospitalized/nursing-home resident/deceased/not at address; 7 percent based on  		a competency screening; 3 percent because they refused to participate; and 6  		percent because they were not contacted within three attempts. If both refusals  		and noncontacts are regarded as nonresponses, the overall response rate was 88  		percent. Because the focus of the survey was on consumer choice, individuals  		with indications of dementia severe enough to raise doubts about their ability  		to exercise choice were screened out at the beginning of the interview, using a  		modified version of Pfeiffer's (1975) Short Portable Mental Status  		Questionnaire (105 individuals in all).</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>Access to Independent Providers in Medicaid PCS  		Programs</h3>
<p>One simple indicator that advocates of consumer direction often use as a  		basic threshold differentiating public programs that tend to foster consumer  		control from those that favor professional dominance, is whether or not a  		program permits personal care attendants to be "independent providers" rather  		than requiring them to be employees of certified home health or home care  		agencies. The rationale is that, without agencies (and the professionals who  		run them) as intermediaries, service recipients would be expected to play a  		much more significant role in hiring and firing, training and supervising, as  		well as paying their aides.</p>
<p>Both the 1984 and 1988 WID surveys found that PCS programs tended to  		require or very strongly emphasize <i>either</i> agency-employed attendants  		<i>or</i> independent providers. Thus, among programs classified as having  		"mixed modalities" (some combination of agency-employed attendants, independent  		providers, and/or government employees), one mode was often dominant, with the  		other(s) being available only rarely. As of 1988, agency-employed attendants  		were the required or dominant service delivery mode in 13 Medicaid PCS  		programs, whereas independent providers were the required or dominant mode in  		nine.</p>
<p>Although access to independent providers would seem a prerequisite for  		consumer control, the 1988 WID survey findings indicate that it does not  		guarantee consumer choice or control with respect to all aspects of managing  		attendant services. Among 12 Medicaid PCS programs that utilized independent  		providers, most (10) allowed consumers to hire and fire their own attendants,  		but only half (6) allowed consumers to train their own attendants, and only  		one-fourth (3) allowed consumers to participate in paying attendants (Litvak  		and Kennedy 1990).</p>
<h3>State Perspectives on the Use of Independent Providers  		versus Agency-Employed Personal Attendants</h3>
<p>The WID case studies documented that some states (e.g., Michigan and  		Massachusetts) had consciously adopted, in at least some respects, an ideology  		of consumer and/or family caregiver empowerment, which was reflected in the use  		of independent providers. The case study interviews also indicated, however,  		that in Maryland this mode of service delivery was perceived primarily as a  		mechanism for controlling costs.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts program was established in 1976 by administrators in  		the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission (MRC), who were strongly influenced  		by the early independent-living movement. Indeed, the MRC helped to create the  		client-directed independent-living centers (ILCs) that administer the program.  		Control of costs per case or per client appeared to have very low priority  		during the first 14 years of the program--probably because the program was  		largely under the control of advocates for persons with disabilities and  		because it was small, serving only 1,775 clients in 1990. (However, the WID  		researchers picked up indications that this freedom from bureaucratically  		imposed cost control measures might soon disappear, owing to the state's budget  		crisis and pressure to expand the program to serve a broader clientele,  		including mentally retarded clients.) Attendants received above-average wages  		($7.85 per hour in 1990--well above the minimum wage, or slightly above the  		minimum-wage level typical for both independent and agency-employed attendants  		in most states). An unusual feature of the Massachusetts program was that it  		encouraged and paid for clients to be trained in how to manage their  		attendants. ILCs received 24 cents per hour of attendant care for  		administration--well below, in percentage terms, what private agencies usually  		receive.</p>
<p>In Michigan, state officials appeared to have both types of motivations.  		That is, Michigan PCS program officials had a long-standing philosophical  		commitment to consumer and family caregiver empowerment, which they also  		perceived to be in harmony with the state's fiscal interest in containing both  		the direct service and administrative costs associated with attendant care.  		Thus, consumers participated in paying their attendants through the device of a  		"two-party check," on which the client's signature was necessary to authorize  		payment to the attendant. This mechanism was designed so that the attendant  		could be considered the employee of the client rather than the state, and it  		gave the attendant a very concrete motive to be concerned with providing  		satisfactory service to the consumer. At the program's inception, the  		two-party, check was also seen as a device that would allow the state to avoid  		becoming legally bound to withhold taxes or to pay workers' and unemployment  		compensation (although since the WID case studies were completed. Michigan has  		been required by the Internal Revenue Service and its own state labor  		department to take on these responsibilities). Finally, in a "rust-belt" state  		like Michigan, with a troubled economy and high demand for publicly funded  		social services, cost control was a high priority. Curbing costs per hour of  		service provided and per client served was seen as a way to stretch limited  		funds to serve larger numbers of clients. Michigan's was one of the largest PCS  		programs in the country in numbers of clients served. As of 1990-91, the  		program had an average monthly caseload of 27,558 clients; but only 1,800 to  		2,000 received attendant services in excess of $333 per month. The low monthly  		payment cap for most clients existed because of federal labor requirements to  		provide workers' compensation and unemployment for employees earning more than  		this amount. One reason why Michigan officials favored the use of family  		members as paid providers was that they believed it was easier to recruit  		reliable minimum wage workers from within the client's family.</p>
<p>Some critics of state home care programs that rely mainly or exclusively  		on independent providers allege that this mode of service provision is more  		cost-effective than models requiring use of home health or home care agencies  		only because attendants working independently have no provider organizations to  		advocate paying them good wages and benefits. On average, across all state  		programs, the 1988 WID survey found that independent providers tended to  		receive somewhat lower wages and fewer benefits (<a href="#table1">table  		1</a>). Although both independent providers and agency-employed attendants in  		most states tended to receive few fringe benefits and wages that were at, or  		only slightly above, minimum wage, the WID surveys and case studies also found  		striking examples of interstate variation. Thus, independent providers in  		Massachusetts were found to earn much higher wages than agency-employed aides  		in Texas, and agency employees' benefits in Montana were far superior to those  		typically offered by agencies elsewhere.</p>
<p>Equally important, the case studies indicated that comparisons of wages  		and benefits paid to direct service workers do not fully capture the unit costs  		to states per hour of service. For a state PCS program, the use of independent  		providers can be less costly per hour of service than use of agency  		providers--irrespective of wages and benefits paid to attendants. This is  		because agency rates per hour of service usually include a not insignificant  		percentage of administrative overhead costs and profit, on top of direct-care  		provider wages and benefits. States can all but eliminate these costs by  		encouraging the use of independent providers, especially when consumers screen,  		train, and supervise their own aides.</p>

</tr></table><p>Some states have realized even further economies in program  		administration by treating independent providers as self-employed contractors  		for tax purposes. In Maryland, for example, as of the period from 1990 to 1991,  		attendants were paid "per visit" rather than by the hour, which meant that the  		workers themselves were responsible for paying their own taxes out of gross  		income (instead of having them withheld from their pay checks) and for paying  		both the employer and employee shares of FICA. The per visit payment rate and  		number of daily visits authorized varied according to several levels of client  		disability; however, as of 1989, the maximum daily payment per client was $25  		per day. This generally translated into an average attendant wage rate of $5  		per hour for a daily maximum of five hours of service per client. After paying  		the 15 percent self-employment tax, the attendant would be allowed to keep  		$4.25 an hour--just a shade above the take-home pay of a minimum wage employee  		who pays only the 7 percent employee's share of FICA. As long as most  		agency-employed PCS aides earn at or near minimum wages and lack pension,  		health insurance, sick leave, and vacation benefits, it is difficult to make a  		case that independent providers earning equivalent or higher after-tax incomes  		are being financially "exploited." The advantage of treating attendants as  		"independent contractors" for tax purposes is that both the state and the  		client are freed from assuming the paperwork and liability obligations of  		"employers." The downside is that "self-employed" workers are held  		responsible.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has estimated that approximately 28  		percent of "independent contractors" (most of whom are not personal attendants  		but carpenters, plumbers, caterers, and others in skilled trade and services)  		never file tax returns (Flanagan 1994). Thus, for the IRS and state PCS program  		administrators to permit independent providers to have the tax status of  		independent contractors is viewed by some as tantamount to encouraging or  		condoning tax evasion. There are lots of anecdotes in circulation about  		personal care attendants who tell their clients that they do not want to work  		as aides unless then can do so "off the books." IRS representatives argue (Dan  		Bryant, October 1995: personal communication) that it is in workers' own best  		interests for government to impose and enforce tax-withholding requirements,  		which may include restrictions on who can claim "self-employment." This is  		because independent contractors who fail to report taxable income may have more  		cash in their pockets in the short term, but, in the longer run, they may  		suffer a significant penalty in lost Social Security benefits. The IRS has  		developed a set of criteria for determining whether or not a given worker is an  		employee or is self-employed. Although there is no hard and fast rule, most  		domestic workers who are not employed by agencies, including personal care  		attendants, are considered to be employees of their clients rather than  		self-employed, independent contractors.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, typically, states do not simply pocket the  		savings achieved from reducing their costs per hour of attendant services: they  		reinvest them in personal care services by providing more hours of service per  		client. The WID survey found that, across all state PCS programs, the use of  		independent providers was associated with more average hours of service use per  		client (<a href="#table2">table 2</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, when states switch from permitting or requiring independent  		providers to requiring aides to be employees of HHAs, this often results in  		lower average service use per client. States have often made the decision to  		switch to agencies when federal agencies like the IRS, Social Security, and  		state labor departments questioned the treatment of independent providers as  		self-employed contractors. Some states are reluctant to take direct  		responsibility for withholding taxes from PCS aides' wages and for providing  		workers' and unemployment compensation. In part, this reluctance is motivated  		by a desire to avoid the administrative burden and associated costs. However,  		in a number of states, the principal concern has been that assumption of these  		responsibilities might provide a basis for lawsuits claiming that PCS aides are  		de facto state employees and should be eligible for unionization and the pay,  		benefit, and job tenure protection associated with civil service employment.  		WID's state surveys documented that the minority of PCS aides who actually were  		government (predominantly county) employees, were more successful in obtaining  		better pay and benefits than both independent and agency-employed providers. In  		1984, government workers' average hourly wages were similar to those of  		independent providers and somewhat lower than those of agency  		employees--although their fringe benefits were much better--but, by 1988,  		average wages for government providers had more than doubled to $8 per hour,  		compared with $4.59 for independent providers and $6.02 for agency employees.  		This may explain why the surveys also found that the percentage of states with  		any government-employed PCS providers declined from 40 percent (n = 8) to 19  		percent (n = 4) between 1984 and 1988.</p>

</tr></table><p>The case study of Montana's PCS program provided an especially vivid  		illustration of the conflicting demands that state officials face and the  		trade-offs that may result. When Montana began its program in 1977, all  		attendants were county employees. Beginning in 1979, to keep up with the  		growing caseload, independent providers recruited by clients were permitted and  		soon became the dominant provider mode. In 1987, Montana decided to require all  		workers to be employees of a single statewide-contract HHA. The decision to  		require all aides to be employed by agencies was made for two reasons. First,  		the caseload had risen dramatically, and state administrators felt that they  		could no longer provide sufficient oversight of independent providers. However,  		the more important factor was a ruling by the State Department of Labor (DOL)  		that some independent providers who applied for unemployment compensation could  		be considered state employees for purposes of unemployment insurance and  		workers' compensation and that the state was responsible for withholding taxes  		and paying the employer's share of FICA. State officials feared that the DOL  		ruling would be used to lobby for provision of full government worker benefits  		to all 1,500 independent PCS providers.</p>
<p>Initially, the hourly amount ($3.85) allocated for direct care workers  		by the state remained the same, but the contract HHA withheld 50 cents for  		taxes and benefits. The state paid the contract HHA an additional $1.40 per  		hour for nurse supervision and administration, including 19 cents to cover the  		employer's share of FICA. Some aides (who may previously have been avoiding  		their tax liability) protested this "pay cut." The year after the new system  		went into effect, the contract agency determined that attendant wages were too  		low to retain attendants and that the amount allocated for administrative  		overhead was insufficient. The agency and the state negotiated a new contract  		that raised attendant wages by 50 cents per hour, and in subsequent years wages  		were increased again. Administrative overhead payments to the HHA also rose. By  		1991, the state was paying the agency $7.75 per hour of service provided, of  		which $5.52 (70 percent) went to attendant wages, taxes, and benefits  		(including overtime), with the remainder allocated to administrative costs,  		nurse supervision, and training. In order to accommodate these higher unit  		costs per hour of service while holding down overall Medicaid PCS expenditure  		increases, the state cut back on the hours of PCS that could be authorized per  		person. During the last year in which independent providers were used, the  		maximum authorization was 70 hours per week; by 1991, the cap had decreased to  		40 hours per week.</p>
<p>In some instances, states that have instituted or are considering a  		requirement that all services be provided through agencies are also concerned  		about their potential legal liability for independent providers who provide  		poor quality of care. Interestingly, these concerns about liability have seldom  		arisen in connection with any actual complaints about poor quality of care;  		rather, they reflect states' growing awareness of potential vulnerability and  		risk aversion. WID's case studies suggested that state officials may be more  		anxious about possible tort liability when the PCS benefit includes coverage of  		paramedical services, and the state's nurse practice act provisions are  		particularly restrictive in requiring that paramedical tasks be performed by,  		or under the direct supervision of, registered nurses. State concerns about  		tort liability were not based on experience; a review of case law by Marshall  		Kapp (1990) found no record of any actual suits ever having been brought  		involving aides who provided paramedical services in violation of professional  		licensure requirements.</p>
<p>A strong philosophical commitment to promoting consumer choice and  		control led some states to develop innovative ways of addressing both  		labor-related legal issues and concerns about quality assurance and tort  		liability. In Massachusetts, for example, the state chose to pay for Medicaid  		PCS through specially created entities termed "personal care agencies" (PCAs),  		which were required to have governing boards or advisory committees composed of  		at least 51 percent PCS recipients, family members of PCS recipients, other  		persons with disabilities, or consumer advocates. The PCAs offered  		administrative services such as tax withholding and instruction for consumers  		in supervising and directing their providers.</p>
<p>In contrast, certain states (e.g., Texas and Maryland) emphasized  		accountability and the importance of meeting professionally determined quality  		standards. These states tended to interpose between the client and the provider  		more elements of professional, third-party care management. In Texas, which, as  		of 1990, had the country's second largest Medicaid PCS program--serving an  		average of 32,500 clients per month--professional supervision was assured by  		requiring all aides to be employees of Medicare-Medicaid-certified HHAs. State  		officials maintained that this rule ensured professional oversight while still  		providing clients with considerable choice because there were from 180 to 200  		certified HHAs in the state and clients could elect to receive services from  		any of these agencies operating in their localities.</p>
<p>Income and functional eligibility determinations for the Texas PCS  		program were carried out by state-employed regional case managers. However,  		agency-employed nurses also did detailed medical assessments and, together with  		the case managers, drew up care plans, which then had to be approved by  		state-employed, regional prior-approval nurses. The state had no specific  		training or certification requirements for attendants; however, agency-employed  		registered nurses were required to make home visits every 60 days. In addition,  		state-employed case managers and prior-approval nurses could decide to "drop  		in" on short notice, both to monitor attendants' performance and to reassess  		clients' needs for care.</p>
<p>In Maryland, attendants were independent providers, but strong  		professional oversight was provided by registered nurse "case monitors," who  		worked under contract for the state or county. The nurse case monitors, who  		typically carried a caseload of 50 clients, performed functional needs  		assessments to determine client eligibility and acted as clients' "case  		managers." The nurse case monitors were also responsible for doing in-home  		training of attendants and were required to make in-home supervisory visits  		every 60 days. In addition, they were required to respond to client complaints  		about problems with their attendant care, and the monitors had to sign  		attendants' invoices before these could be submitted to the state for payment.  		In principle, a client could hire anyone other than a relative to be an  		attendant, but, in practice, according to the WID case studies, most clients  		ended up relying on their nurse case monitors for attendant referrals. Although  		the involvement of registered nurses in Maryland's PCS program was as great, or  		even greater, than might be expected in an agency model, Maryland nevertheless  		avoided paying the 30 to 40 percent in total program costs that would likely  		have gone to agency overhead by contracting directly with nurses. As of  		1990-91, roughly 10 percent of PCS program expenditures went toward payments  		for nurse case monitors, and an additional 2.5 percent went toward financial  		administration--with the remaining 87.5 percent of expenditures going toward  		payments to attendants.</p>
<h3>Clients' Perceptions of the Degree of Consumer Choice  		and Control in Three Medicaid PCS Programs</h3>
<p>In the Commonwealth Commission survey of Medicaid PCS clients aged 65  		and older in Michigan, Maryland, and Texas, the degree of control or direction  		exercised by clients over their own care was measured by several indicators:  		having known their aide prior to employment; being involved in scheduling and  		supervising; signing time sheets or paychecks; and indicating that they or  		their family would be involved in changing aides (see <a href="#table3">table 3  		</a>for question wording). Examining these individual indicators of  		client-directed care, as well as the cumulative number of indicators (from 0 to  		5), by state shows a statistically significant relation between client  		direction and state. Almost three-quarters of those in Michigan indicated they  		had known their aide previously, compared to 26 percent and 36 percent in  		Maryland and Texas, respectively. Similarly, over half of Michigan clients  		indicated that they helped schedule their aide; only 24 percent and 33 percent  		in Maryland and Texas did so. Higher percentages of Michigan clients signed  		time sheets or paychecks, or indicated they would be involved in changing  		aides. Only for supervising aides are percentages similar--about 80 percent of  		both Texas and Michigan clients responded positively, compared to only about 60  		percent of Maryland clients. Furthermore, using number of indicators, with 0  		being no client direction and 5 being maximum client direction, almost 40  		percent of Michigan clients had scores of 4 or 5, in contrast to about 4  		percent of Maryland and Texas clients.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> shows the relation of both individual  		indicators of client choice and number of indicators to various measures of  		client satisfaction. Consumer satisfaction with medical care is now frequently  		assessed in a wide range of contexts, from hospital marketing surveys to  		medical effectiveness research. In a comprehensive review of the literature,  		Hall and Dornan (1988) identified a lengthy list of dimensions of satisfaction  		with care assessed in satisfaction studies; the four most common were  		humaneness, informativeness, overall quality, and competence. Despite the  		proliferation of studies of satisfaction with medical care, there is little  		standardization in methods, and few questionnaires have been subjected to  		reliability and validity testing (one exception is the Patient Satisfaction  		Questionnaire [Ware et al. 1983).</p>
<p>In areas other than physician and hospital-based care, however,  		satisfaction with care is rarely assessed. The measures of client satisfaction  		used in the three-state survey tap three dimensions of satisfaction with care:  		overall quality, technical competence (aide can be counted on to be on time,  		aide does things well), and humaneness (aide is concerned about client's  		well-being, aide improves quality of life). Each item has four response  		categories, ranging from very to not at all "satisfied" (wording varied by  		question, however; see <a href="#table4">table 4</a> for questions and  		responses).</p>
<p>Knowing the aide prior to employment, helping schedule the aide,  		supervising the aide, and client or family responsibility for changing aides  		were significantly associated with high levels of satisfaction with the aide's  		competence and humaneness. The first three also were related to overall  		satisfaction. Of client choice and control indicators, only "signs time sheet  		or paycheck" was not consistently related to client satisfaction. Greater  		client direction also was significantly related to higher satisfaction. Only 67  		percent of clients with a score of 0 felt their aide improved their life a  		great deal, for example, compared with 88 percent of those with a score of 5.  		Similarly, 95 percent or higher of clients with a score of 4 or 5 were very  		satisfied overall with aide performance, in contrast to 59 percent with a score  		of 0 and 78 percent with a score of 1.</p>
<p>The highly significant relation (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) to client  		satisfaction of reporting that an aide was known before employment is  		particularly noteworthy because this variable directly reflects differences in  		program administration across states. Nearly half (49 percent) of survey  		respondents in Michigan reported that their attendants were relatives, and an  		additional 22 percent reported that their attendants were friends, neighbors,  		or persons recommended by friends or relatives. The WID case studies indicated  		this pattern was not only permitted, but encouraged, by Michigan program  		administrators. In Maryland and Texas, 82 percent and 75 percent of survey  		respondents reported that their attendants were strangers. In Maryland, the low  		percentage of aides who were family members or persons previously known to the  		service recipient was undoubtedly due to the state's very strict interpretation  		of federal rules prohibiting family members from being service providers.  		Maryland regulations defined virtually all recognizable degrees of kinship,  		including uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces, nephews, and in-laws as well as  		spouses, parents, stepparents, children and stepchildren--with the sole  		exception of grandparents--as ineligible to be PCS attendants. In contrast,  		Texas, like Michigan, prohibited only "legally responsible" relatives (i.e.,  		spouses or parents, including foster parents of minor children) from being PCS  		attendants. However, the fact that Texas required all PCS attendants to be  		employees of certified HHAs appeared to pose a barrier in practice to the  		recruitment of relatives, friends, and neighbors to serve as aides.</p>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#table6">table 6</a> display  		the results of logistic regression models examining the effects of indicators  		of client-directed care on overall satisfaction with aide services, controlling  		for other variables that might affect or account for the relation of client  		direction to satisfaction. Only one measure of satisfaction was used in this  		analysis: overall satisfaction with aide. Correlations between the indicators  		of client satisfaction were significant and ranged from .32 to .65. Because the  		outcome of interest is dichotomous (very satisfied = 1, other = 0), logistic  		regression was used (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). The odds ratios reported  		indicate whether the odds of a given even (e.g., positive response to an  		indicator of client-directed care) are significantly related to the outcome of  		interest (being very satisfied), controlling for other explanatory  		variables.</p>

</tr></table><p>Two models are shown in <a href="#table5">table 5</a>. One uses  		individual indicators of client-directed care (model 1), and the other uses the  		cumulative number of indicators from 0 to a maximum of 5 and covariates  		reflecting client characteristics. Other client characteristics entered in the  		model are age (65 to 74, 75 to 84, 85+); gender; self-reported health  		(excellent/good vs. fair/poor); presence of any ADL limitation (dressing,  		bathing, feeding oneself, getting in and out of bed or chairs, using the  		toilet, mobility indicated by "in a wheelchair"); presence of any IADL  		limitation (meal preparation, shopping for groceries, money management, using  		telephone, light housework); rural versus urban residence, hours of care a week  		(&lt;10, 10 to 14, 15+, don't know); time aide has worked for client (&lt;6  		months, 6 to 12 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, or more). When all five  		indicators of client-directed care were entered in the model (model 1, stage  		1), only two remained significantly related to being very satisfied overall  		with aide performance: "knew aide prior to employment" and "supervises aide."  		These relations held when client characteristics were entered (model 1, stage  		2). Controlling for other client characteristics, clients who knew their aide  		previously were three times as likely to be highly satisfied, and those  		reporting that they supervised were almost twice as likely to be very satisfied  		as others. Among client characteristics, only rural residence, hours of care  		per week, and length of time that the aide had worked for the client  		significantly affected the odds of satisfaction (more hours and longer time  		with aide led to greater satisfaction).</p>
<p>When cumulative number of indicators is considered, despite the fact  		that only two individual indicators were statistically significant, there is a  		relation between increasing opportunities for client direction and satisfaction  		(model 2, stage 1). Clients who reported positively on four or five indicators  		were significantly more likely to report being "very satisfied" than those who  		reported positively on no indicators. Again, in introducing client  		characteristics to the model does not change the significance of this relation  		(model 2, stage 2).</p>
<p><a href="#table6">Table 6</a> tests the effects of adding "state"  		(Maryland and Texas, with Michigan as the reference category) to the model. The  		bivariate analyses reported in <a href="#table3">table 3</a> showed a relation  		between state and opportunities for client-directed care. State was not found  		to be significantly related to overall aide satisfaction when either individual  		indicators of client-directed care or number of indicators is included in the  		model along with other client characteristics. However, when the indicators of  		client-directed care are excluded, Maryland PCS clients are only two-fifths as  		likely to be highly satisfied as Michigan clients. The difference in likelihood  		of being highly satisfied between Texas and Michigan clients is not  		statistically significant, although the direction of the relation is as  		expected, given the higher prevalence of client-directed care in Michigan (as  		shown in <a href="#table3">table 3</a>).</p>
<p>These analyses were also conducted on the subgroup of individuals who  		did not know their aide previously, because this variable had the greatest  		effect on satisfaction. None of the relations changed, although "signs time  		sheet or paycheck" reached significance among the client-directed care  		indicators in addition to "supervises aide." Whether the client signs paychecks  		and/or time sheets is closely tied to state program design (see  		<a href="#table3">table 3</a>) and also reached significance in  		<a href="#table6">table 6</a> when dummy variables for states were entered in  		the regression. This may indicate that the relation of signing a time sheet  		and/or paycheck to satisfaction varies by state. In Texas, where care is agency  		based, it rarely occurs. In Michigan, it is part of a broader philosophy of  		increasing client-directed care, but, in Maryland, it may be viewed by clients  		as a requirement imposed by the state to monitor behavior of both clients and  		aides. These relations cannot be successfully disentangled from these data. The  		analyses point to the need for greater refinement of indicators of  		client-directed care, however, as well as attention to how program philosophy  		and environment affect interpretation of such indicators.</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>Most Medicaid PCS clients interviewed in the Commonwealth Commission  		survey reported high satisfaction with their aides. Indeed, fewer than 10  		percent of clients surveyed in any state reported being not very satisfied or  		not at all satisfied with their aides. Nonetheless, both bivariate and  		multivariate anlayses of the Commonwealth Fund Commission client survey data  		found strong statistical associations between indicators of consumer choice and  		indicators of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Descriptive data on individual state PCS programs collected via the  		World Institute on Disability's mail questionnaire surveys of all Medicaid PCS  		programs in existence in 1984 and 1988 and from the 1990-91 site visits to six  		programs (including those in Maryland, Michigan, and Texas) make it possible to  		identify administrative features that tend to facilitate or, alternatively, to  		inhibit consumer choice and satisfaction. Consumer choice and satisfaction  		appear to be maximized when a public program not only permits, but also  		actively encourages, clients to hire their own attendants directly (that is,  		when the PCS program attendants are treated as employees of the client--in  		contrast to being employees of a home health or home care agency or to acting  		as independent contractors who obtain their jobs through recommendations from  		registered nurses, who subsequently provide on-the-job training and  		supervision). An important corollary is allowing consumers to hire whomever  		they wish. The data suggest that when consumers are permitted to hire  		attendants directly and face few restrictions on whom they may hire, they tend  		to favor persons already known to them: family members, friends, neighbors, and  		individuals who are known to and come recommended by family, friends, and  		neighbors. The result, for many clients, is an integration of their formal and  		informal support systems.</p>

</tr></table><p>Several policy implications are suggested by the findings. First,  		administrators of home- and community-based long-term-care programs now have  		empirical evidence to cite in support of making consumer and family caregiver  		empowerment the cornerstone of their quality assurance strategies. This same  		evidence suggests that the traditional regulatory emphasis on requirements for  		professional standard-setting and supervision may not only be less effective  		than promoting consumer and family caregiver empowerment; it may actually prove  		counterproductive to the extent that professional management tends to limit or  		inhibit client and family caregiver involvement in such critical areas as  		hiring and firing decisions and the scheduling and day-to-day supervision of  		aides.</p>
<p>During the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the research that forms the  		basis of this article was conducted, federal Medicaid law required PCS services  		to be prescribed by a physician and supervised by registered nurses.  		Disability-rights and independent-living advocates, who felt that these  		requirements caused an unnecessary and unwanted "medicalization" of PAS,  		succeeded in persuading Congress to remove them in the Omnibus Reconciliation  		Act of 1993. However, this legislation does not preclude states that consider  		professional oversight by physicians or nurses to be a necessary quality  		safeguard from imposing such requirements under state law and regulations. (We  		do not know how many states--if any--have dropped requirements for physician  		prescription and/or nurse supervision in response to OBRA 1993. However, as of  		November 1995, the administrative features of the Medicaid PCS programs in  		Texas, Maryland, and Michigan remained essentially the same as described in the  		World Institute on Disability's 1990-91 case studies.)</p>
<p>The argument could be made that public program administrators ought to  		define and enforce some "objective" standards of quality, given that the  		taxpayers are footing the bill. We accept the legitimacy of concerns for public  		accountability. However, because medical expertise is irrelevant to the ability  		to assess the quality of nonmedical services, a medical professional's judgment  		about an attendant's competence in performing typical housekeeping and personal  		care tasks is not a clinical one based on scientific criteria. On the other  		hand, it is possible to define expectations or norms that are so widely  		agreed-upon by the community at large that they can serve as objective measures  		because anyone could apply them. In principle, virtually any adult American  		could be hired by the state and, without much special training, be sent to the  		homes of Medicaid PCS clients to judge the adequacy--based on nothing more than  		ordinary, everyday cultural standards--of aides' housekeeping, cooking, and  		other skills in performing specific tasks as well as their compliance with  		other normative expectations such as punctuality and courteous, respectful  		demeanor toward the client. However, this would be costly and intrusive.  		Moreover, what is the justification for concluding that persons with functional  		disabilities who are not demented or otherwise mentally incompetent are any  		less capable than any nondisabled average citizen of knowing and applying  		standard cultural expectations in judging a personal care attendant's job  		performance? To assume that the state needs to send an inspector to have an  		objective judgment of how well an aide cleans a client's home and the like  		reflects, at best, a patronizing attitude that all consumers with disabilities  		are "childlike" in their need for protection. Alternatively, this could imply  		negative stereotypes about "people on welfare" who depend on Medicaid to pay  		for their personal care attendants.</p>
<p>Evidence of dangerously poor judgment and inability to understand and  		uphold community norms are precisely the kinds of criteria that Adult  		Protective Services workers and the courts use in making determinations about  		whether persons with dementia disorders, serious mental illness, traumatic  		brain injury, mental retardation, or severe substance abuse problems are  		incompetent to manage their own affairs. The real issue, then, is not whether  		there is a need for "objective" standards and measures of quality assurance for  		PAS over and above--or possibly in opposition to--consumer "subjectivity."  		Rather, the central problem is: for the minority of consumers who are incapable  		of making sound judgments and taking appropriate actions, who can government  		rely upon to do so on their behalf?</p>
<p>The literature on abuse, neglect, and mistreatment of disabled older  		persons indicates that victimization is far more common among individuals with  		mental impairments than among persons who are functionally disabled and even  		highly physically dependent but not mentally impaired (Coyne, Reichman, and  		Berlig 1993), although clients who are not mentally impaired are sometimes  		unwilling to report attendant abuse (Ulicny et al. 1990). The conventional  		wisdom in home care for the elderly has been to assign the protective role,  		formally, to home health/home care agency supervisors and/or case managers or  		quality assurance monitors employed by or under contract to the public funding  		agencies, regardless of whether or not elderly clients are mentally impaired.  		There is no way, however, that an agency supervisor or case manager who makes  		an occasional home visit can provide clients with meaningful protection against  		abuse, neglect, and mistreatment by their personal care aides. The reality of  		these situations is that when clients are unable or unwilling to speak up for  		themselves, only members of the disabled persons' informal support  		networks--family, friends, neighbors--are in a position to effectively protect  		the client by detecting an aide's problematic behavior or poor performance and  		taking action. It the aide is an independent provider than the family has hired  		(a very common situation in the private-pay market for eldercare services), the  		family is likely to act unilaterally by firing the aide and hiring another. In  		other circumstances, the family may be required to inform the HHA or the case  		manager, with the expectation that these professionals will take the  		appropriate actions. If the professionals do not do so, some families may be  		passive, but most will insist, complain, change agencies or do whatever else  		may be necessary to get the result they want. Thus, it would not be good public  		policy for public program administrators to suggest to family, friends, and  		neighbors that government regulation, professional supervision, and training  		requirements or the like can substitute for the informal support system's  		watchful involvement. Nor would it be advisable to give professionals in home  		care (i.e., HHA nurses and managers, state and local social services agency  		case managers) the message that they are the only recognized authorities on  		quality and need not be responsive to concerned family or other members of  		clients' informal support networks.</p>
<p>In the field of mental retardation and developmental disability,  		recognition of the importance of informal support systems has reached the point  		that many professionals now expend considerable time and effort attempting to  		create "surrogate" families for individuals who have no family or other natural  		supports (such as long-time institutional residents). Volunteer lay advocates  		are being recruited to monitor and intercede with service providers and case  		managers. Most elderly and younger disabled persons have not lost contact with  		their families and other natural supports and do not need professionals to  		create "family-like" support systems for them. Indeed, some specialists in  		aging are wary because elder abuse research findings suggest that the majority  		of perpetrators of elder abuse are family members, not paid service providers.  		Such studies have found that abusive family caregivers are typically the only  		source of help available to the disabled elder (Pillemer and Finkelhor 1988).  		There is nothing in this research to indicate that when disabled elders are  		able to exercise choice--particularly when they have access to publicly funded  		paid attendant services and permission to hire whomever they please--they would  		favor abusers, whether from in or outside the family.</p>
<p>Thus, another major policy implication of our findings is that they do  		not support a policy of prohibiting the hiring of family members as paid  		providers. The practice of hiring family members as paid service providers has  		become well established and accepted in some state Medicaid PCS programs (e.g.,  		Michigan and California) but continues to be prohibited in others (e.g.,  		Maryland and New York). The issue remains controversial because critics claim  		that paying family caregivers could undermine traditional societal expectations  		that families provide care informally. Despite the controversy, most states  		currently permit--albeit in varying degrees--family members to be paid  		providers in at least one public program. Nathan Linsk and colleagues (Linsk,  		Keigher, and Osterbusch, 1988) surveyed 35 jurisdictions (33 states, the  		District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) in 1985 and found that 70 percent  		permitted payments to family caregivers in one or another public program. This  		pattern was replicated in a slightly larger 1990 survey (Linsk et al.  		1992).</p>
<p>In both the WID case studies and in the research carried out by Linsk  		and colleagues, states that disallowed payments to, or cited restrictions on,  		employment of family members as service providers in some or all of their  		programs frequently cited federal and/or state Medicaid regulations. During the  		mid-1980s, the federal HCFA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)  		that had a dampening effect on some state PCS programs, as it would have  		defined very broadly the "family members" prohibited under federal statute from  		serving as paid PCS providers. Under the proposed rule, the ban would have  		encompassed extended family such as aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins as  		well as close family members. Because this and other elements of the NPRM drew  		more negative than positive responses from states and consumer groups, the NPRM  		was never issued as a final rule, and therefore never took effect. Indeed, in  		1995, HCFA reversed its position and issued a final rule that expressly  		permitted states to limit the restrictions on family members serving as paid  		providers to legally responsible relatives (i.e., spouses and parents of minor  		children).</p>
<p>Over the past five years, advocates for the nonelderly disabled  		associated with the disability-rights and independent-living movements have  		become increasingly active in the politics of home and community-based  		long-term services at both federal and state levels of government. Advocacy  		groups for the elderly interested in helping to forge a broader constituency to  		promote increased public funding for in-home and community-based alternatives  		to nursing homes have begun to adopt and adapt ideas and concepts from the  		disability-rights and independent-living movements--including the notion that  		services should be more "consumer directed."</p>
<p>At the same time, however, states wanting to foster consumer direction  		in public programs are being forced to grapple with and attempt to find  		solutions for a number of knotty administrative problems that, in the past,  		they often ignored. First and foremost is the issue of ensuring Social Security  		coverage and tax payments for personal attendants who are employed directly by  		persons with disabilities but paid from public funds. The so-called "Nannygate"  		scandals, in which several candidates for political appointments in the Clinton  		Administration were found to have failed to pay Social Security taxes on behalf  		of nannies, housekeepers, or other domestics, cast a spotlight whose harsh  		glare illuminated the entire "gray market" of domestic employment, including  		independent providers of personal assistance to the elderly and disabled. Even  		before this issue came to public attention, however, state program  		administrators had been subjected to increasing pressure from the IRS and  		federal and state labor officials to explain, defend--and, ultimately, to  		modify--their methods of paying attendants who work as independent providers to  		ensure compliance with FICA (Social Security tax), FUTA (unemployment tax), and  		workers' compensation requirements. A number of states have now developed  		workable mechanisms that both ensure compliance with tax and labor laws and  		permit consumers to hire and fire, supervise, and train independent providers.  		By using "fiscal agents" to administer payments to independent providers, these  		states have been able to certify the consumer as "employer of record" without  		saddling disabled persons and their family members with complex and onerous  		paperwork chores. (Flanagan 1994). Legal experts are continuing to work with  		states and regulatory agencies to resolve these issues.</p>
<p>In the current political climate, the pressure on state administrators  		of home- and community-based services for the elderly and disabled to cut costs  		is likely to intensify. As our analysis has shown, states have often found  		themselves attracted to "consumer-directed" models of financing and delivering  		attendant care because they seemed to offer a means both to curb costs and to  		achieve positive outcomes--in terms of greater satisfaction, independence, and  		empowerment--for clients. Given the accumulating evidence of the value of  		maximizing consumer-directed care and the impending major changes in U.S.  		health care, development of workable models for promoting increased consumer  		choice and control is critical. These models must incorporate the views of  		clients, consideration of workers, and the concerns of government agencies  		responsible for managing publicly funded programs. The experience of states and  		the research findings reported here provide a firm base on which to  		proceed.</p>
