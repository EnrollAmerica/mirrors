<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This study was conducted in response to a requirement in the Health  		Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) of the  		American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub.L. 111-5). Title IV  		of Division B of ARRA directs the Secretary to conduct several studies  		including the study described in Section 4104(a):</p>
<blockquote><p>(B) DETAILS OF STUDY. -- Such study shall include an examination of  			 --</p>
<ol type="i"><li>the adoption rates of certified EHR technology by such health  				care providers;</li>
<li>the clinical utility of such technology by such health care  				providers;</li>
<li>whether the services furnished by such health care providers are  				appropriate for or would benefit from the use of such technology;</li>
<li>the extent to which such health care providers work in settings  				that might otherwise receive an incentive payment or other funding under this  				Act, under Title XIII of Division A, under Title XVIII or XIX of the Social  				Security Act, or other;</li>
<li>the potential costs and the potential benefits of making payment  				incentives and other funding available to such health care providers; and</li>
<li>any other issues the Secretary deems to be appropriate.  </li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) made available  		ARRA/HITECH funds to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE), in the Office of the Secretary within the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services, to conduct the study required in Section 4104(a).  		The study was directed and managed by ASPE. ASPE awarded a contract to the  		American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) to complete the  		study. The study addresses the questions in Section 4104(a).</p>

<p>Health care providers not eligible for the Medicare and Medicaid  			 Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs (referred to as the EHR  			 Incentive Programs) can be organized into four clusters: Long-Term and  			 Post-Acute Care (LTPAC); Behavioral Health; Safety Net; and Other. Generally,  			 these health care providers provide health care services to some of the most  			 vulnerable and costly individuals in our society, and the care they deliver  			 would often benefit from electronic communication with other providers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The funding made available under ARRA/HITECH (e.g., funding for  			 demonstration grants, cooperative agreements, etc.) to health care providers  			 not eligible to participate in the EHR Incentive Programs is not expected to  			 support widespread adoption and use of EHR technologies (including certified  			 EHR technologies) by these ineligible providers. The one exception to this  			 finding pertains to the $1.5 billion made available under the ARRA to Health  			 Resources Services Administration for health centers that include support for  			 the acquisition of health information technology (health IT) systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of provisions in the Affordable Care Act may support  			 the use health IT by health care providers not eligible for the EHR Incentive  			 Programs and bring new market pressures on these providers to use such  			 technologies and electronically exchange health information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation rates of EHR technologies, including implementation  			 of certified EHR technologies, by providers not eligible to participate in the  			 EHR Incentive Programs are lagging behind that of health care providers who may  			 participate in the EHR Incentive Programs (i.e., eligible professionals and  			 eligible hospitals). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonetheless, many health care providers not eligible to participate  			 in the EHR Incentive Programs are adopting some level of technology to meet  			 their clinical and business needs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providers not eligible to participate in the EHR Incentive Programs  			 generally provide health care to some of the most vulnerable and costly  			 individuals in our society, and the care they deliver would benefit from the  			 use of EHR technology, including the ability to communicate electronically with  			 other providers. The need for health information exchange is particularly  			 important given the multiple providers often involved in caring for these  			 patients, and the number of transitions in care experienced by patients treated  			 by these health care providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A minority of providers not eligible to participate in the EHR  			 Incentive Programs may be affiliated with health care providers/organizations  			 that are eligible to receive incentive payments under the Medicare and Medicaid  			 EHR Incentive Programs. However, these relationships have not supported  			 widespread use of certified EHR technology by providers not eligible to receive  			 incentive payments, in part, because currently available certified EHR  			 technology does not support the clinical and business needs of providers who  			 are not eligible for EHR incentives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activities are underway to fill gaps in health IT standards to  			 support the interoperable exchange of documents at times of transitions in care  			 and care plans during transitions in care as well as when care shared across  			 multiple clinicians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various stakeholders have suggested options that could be considered  			 to support implementation of certified EHR technologies by health care  			 providers who are not eligible to participate in the EHR Incentive Programs.  			 These options include:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p>Direct support such as making available:</p>
<ol type="i"><li>financial assistance (e.g., through incentives, grants  					 (including demonstration grants) or loans) to support the acquisition and use  					 of certified EHR technology; and/or</li>
<li>technical assistance to support the acquisition and use of  					 this technology.  </li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Indirect support such as: </p>
<ol type="i"><li>further development of the nationwide health IT  					 infrastructure to allow for the electronic use and exchange of interoperable  					 information needed to provide services to persons served by these health care  					 providers; and</li>
<li>extending various Medicare and Medicaid authorities to  					 support implementation of health information technologies, including certified  					 EHR technologies, by health care providers who are not eligible to participate  					 in the EHR Incentive Programs.  </li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Strategic planning and coordination across programs is needed to  			 identify the most promising policy options, and support successful  			 implementation and use of certified EHR technologies by health care providers  			 who are not eligible to participate in the EHR Incentive Programs. Some of the  			 factors that should be considered in evaluating the costs and benefits of  			 different options include: </p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><i>Built to last:</i> Interventions should support the  				  technology infrastructure needed for the emerging health care delivery and  				  business models envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, the nationwide health IT  				  infrastructure, and EHR Incentive Programs to allow for the interoperable  				  exchange and reuse of health information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Patient-centered:</i> Interventions should promote a  				  patient-centered approach to care delivery and outcomes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Tailored and targeted</i>: The need for interventions should  				  be evaluated in terms of the clinical utility of the technology by a range of  				  health care providers. It is likely that different technology solutions will be  				  required to achieve policy goals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Smartly clustered</i>: Interventions may need to be clustered  				  to accrue the most benefit from the investment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Spend wisely:</i> Consideration should be given to the costs  				  of technology (which are declining) and providers' margins and ability to cover  				  all or some of these costs.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><h3>Conclusions of the Study</h3>
<p>Many of the health care providers not eligible for the Medicare and  		Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs, such as LTPAC and Behavioral Health providers,  		have a frequent need to exchange health information on behalf of their  		patients, who are among the most vulnerable and costly in our society. One of  		the key benefits of the use of health IT is the ability to exchange information  		to communicate and coordinate services on behalf of patients, and their  		physicians and entire care team who are often located in different geographic  		areas and practice settings. Advancing the adoption of certified EHR technology  		solutions by providers not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs may support  		the realization of the goals associated with implementing a nationwide health  		IT infrastructure, new models of care delivery and coordination, and the  		Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. </p>
<p>Filling critical gaps in standards is important to support the  		interoperable exchange of health information on behalf of vulnerable persons  		who receive services across the care continuum, including (but not limited to)  		health care providers who are not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs. In  		addition, the specification of standards to support interoperable health  		information exchange is necessary but may not be sufficient to support the  		development and implementation of certified EHR technology solutions for these  		providers. Other actions will likely be needed to support and accelerate the  		use of certified EHR technology by health care providers not eligible for the  		EHR Incentive Programs. </p>
<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act  		(HITECH) includes Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the  		American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub.L. 111-5) (ARRA). It is  		estimated that pursuant to HITECH, over $15 billion<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note1">1</a></sup> in incentive payments for the adoption and meaningful  		use of certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT) will be available  		between 2014 and 2019 to help certain health care providers improve the  		quality, safety, and coordination of care while also achieving efficiency gains  		to help control costs. HITECH-designated hospitals, physicians, and others as  		eligible for financial incentives for the adoption and meaningful use of CEHRT.  		Other categories of providers are ineligible. In addition, Title VIII of  		Division A of the ARRA made available $2 billion to the Office of the National  		Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to carry out activities in  		HITECH, including the development of a nationwide health IT infrastructure that  		allows for the electronic use and exchange of health information. Through these  		HITECH provisions, certain providers are eligible for incentive payments and  		other funding to support their adoption and use of electronic health record  		(EHR) technology as a part of the emerging nationwide health IT  		infrastructure.</p>
<p>However, Congress recognized the importance of providers not eligible  		for EHR incentive payments or other funding to support the implementation of  		the nationwide health information technology (health IT) infrastructure.  		Section 4104(a)<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note2">2</a></sup> of the HITECH Act required the  		Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study to determine  		the extent and manner in which payment incentives and other funding for  		implementing and using certified EHRs should be made available to those  		providers who received minimal or no HITECH payments. The study is required to  		address the following factors:</p>
<ul><li>the extent to which ineligible providers work in settings that might  		  otherwise receive an incentive payment or other federal funding under ARRA, the  		  Social Security Act, or otherwise;</li>
<li>adoption rates of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) by ineligible  		  providers;</li>
<li>clinical utility of such technology for ineligible providers;</li>
<li>whether the services ineligible providers furnish are appropriate for  		  or would benefit from such technology;</li>
<li>the potential costs and benefits of making payment incentives and  		  other funding available to ineligible providers; and </li>
<li>any other issues the Secretary deems appropriate. For purposes of  		  this study we identified the extent to which options and incentives had been  		  proposed or implemented to support the use of the technology, including use by  		  ineligibles.  </li>
</ul><p>The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on the findings  		and conclusions of this study.</p>
<p>The use of health IT by all health care providers has become  		increasingly important. Although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  		of 2010 (Pub.L. 111-148) as amended by the Health Care and Education  		Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub.L. 111-152) (collectively known as the  		Affordable Care Act)) does not provide funds to support technology acquisition  		costs, implementing many of its value based purchasing and delivery model  		provisions as well as other provisions depends heavily upon a health IT/EHR  		infrastructure.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note3">3</a></sup> In 2011, the National Quality  		Strategy Report to Congress similarly identified increased use of health IT as  		one of ten principles to adhere to when designing initiatives to bring about  		better care, healthy people and healthy communities, and affordable care. In  		addition, the growing sophistication of health IT applications developed by the  		private sector underscores the importance of the use of technology to support  		the health and health care of every American.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note4">4</a></sup></p>
<h3>Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>We identified health care providers as those listed in Section 3000(3)  		of the Public Health Service Act, as added by Section 13101 of HITECH. Those  		providers identified as ineligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentives and  		the focus of this report were organized into four clusters: Long-Term and  		Post-Acute Care (LTPAC); Behavioral Health; Safety Net; and Other, as shown in  		<a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#table1">Table 1</a> below. As described below, we also considered the  		extent to which these ineligible provider types received other funding to  		support their use of EHR technology.</p>
<p>This study identified over 54,000 ineligible provider organizations and  		344,000 ineligible professionals delivering services to 51 million individuals  		across the United States. This summary statistic excludes those ineligible  		providers clustered in the "Other Provider" category above due to challenges  		with comparability. Although some of the ineligible providers have an ownership  		affiliation with eligible providers (and therefore potential access to EHR  		incentive funds), the majority do not. </p>

</tr></table><p>Services delivered by these LTPAC, behavioral health, and FQHC/RHC  		providers account for $181 billion in combined Medicare and Medicaid  		expenditures -- over 20 percent of the total Medicare and Medicaid expenditures  		in health care.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note5">5</a></sup> Safety net providers deliver  		care to a large number of patients as a primary care provider. Among the LTPAC,  		Behavioral Health, and Safety Net providers, this study found the provider  		types accounting for the largest share of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures  		were: nursing home, home health care, and community mental health providers.  		</p>
<p>We considered whether the ineligible provider types received other  		funding under HITECH for purposes of implementing and using EHR technology.  		With the exception of funds provided to certain safety net providers for their  		use of health IT, the other funding (e.g., demonstration grants) made available  		to certain ineligible provider types is not expected to support widespread  		adoption and use of EHR technology by these ineligible providers. </p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs authorized by HITECH  		(also referred to as the EHR Incentive Programs) have been successful in  		accelerating the use of EHR technology by eligible hospitals and professionals.  		The EHR Incentive Programs increasingly require that providers eligible for  		incentives engage in health information exchange (HIE). Transitions in care  		between providers eligible for incentives and providers who are not eligible  		are common. For example, in 2008, almost 40 percent of all Medicare  		beneficiaries discharged from acute care hospitals received post-acute care;  		and of these beneficiaries, more than 15 percent were readmitted to the acute  		care hospital within 30 days of hospital discharge.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note6">6</a></sup> Instances of shared care are also common between  		eligible and ineligible providers. For example, Medicare requires that both the  		physician and HHA sign a home health plan of care. Thus, the normal course of  		patient care necessitates that eligible providers will exchange health  		information with ineligible providers. Some providers not eligible for EHR  		incentives are also adopting EHR technology, but those EHRs are not necessarily  		compliant with the EHR Incentive Programs criteria used by eligible hospitals  		and physicians, including requirements that would support interoperable HIE and  		health information reuse. Effective communication and information sharing  		across all providers is essential to improving the quality of care, bettering  		health of communities, and lowering per capita costs. Better alignment of the  		health IT solutions used by eligible and ineligible providers could promote  		better HIE and affect health care quality and the ability of eligible providers  		participating in the EHR Incentive Programs to engage in electronic exchange  		and care coordination activities with ineligible providers.</p>
<p>In addition to the EHR Incentive Programs, this study identified  		relationships between ineligible providers and provisions of the Affordable  		Care Act that could support the use of health IT and/or HIE by these ineligible  		provider types. We found 40 provisions of the Affordable Care Act that apply to  		providers not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs and either require or  		support the use of health IT and/or HIE with or by these providers. Many of  		these HIE provisions will advance new care and service delivery models to  		improve care coordination and quality. Most of these provisions will engage one  		or more of the ineligible provider types who may not have the health IT  		infrastructure that could support the reform activity. As these provisions are  		implemented, new market pressures on ineligible providers to use health IT may  		increase.</p>
<h3>EHR Adoption Rates for Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>This study identified a number of important facts about ineligible  		providers and their use of EHR technology. Four are particularly salient: </p>
<ul><li>ineligible providers generally provide health care to individuals who  		  are among the most vulnerable and costly individuals in our society;</li>
<li>the care they deliver would often benefit from electronic  		  communication with other providers, but that remains uncommon;</li>
<li>most are adopting some level of technology to meet clinical and  		  business needs, but are not investing in interoperable technology that supports  		  a patient-centered approach; and </li>
<li>EHR technology products currently used by ineligible providers often  		  are not certified to HHS-adopted standards and criteria, and thus lack  		  interoperability and HIE capabilities, particularly for LTPAC and behavioral  		  health providers.  </li>
</ul><p>Collecting information on health IT adoption by the ineligible providers  		presented significant challenges due to the lack of comparable survey tools,  		inconsistent definitions and peer-reviewed studies. For ineligible providers,  		EHR adoption rates ranged from 4 percent to 65 percent. The adoption rates for  		ineligible providers cannot and should not be compared to adoption rates for  		eligible hospitals and eligible physicians since they do not measure adoption  		rates of comparable EHR technology. To illustrate the lack of comparability,  		the findings from the June 2012 study on health IT adoption for community  		behavioral health organizations reports that 21 percent of these organizations  		have EHRs at all of their sites, and 65 percent of survey respondents reported  		having adopted some form of an EHR at least at some of their sites. Only 2  		percent of responding community behavioral health organizations reported  		adopting technology that could meet the base requirements of the EHR Incentive  		Program.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Addressing this technological lag by ineligible providers could support  		deployment of new models of care delivery and coordination and new payment  		models for the vulnerable populations most likely to benefit from the service  		delivery system improvements. </p>
<h3>Current and Proposed Initiatives</h3>
<p>In this study, more than 30 actions were identified that have been  		proposed for or implemented in federal or state initiatives that could support  		(in various amounts, duration, and scope) the use of health IT/EHR technology  		by ineligible providers.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note8">8</a></sup> The initiatives are  		categorized in terms of programs that provide "Direct Support" or "Indirect  		Support" to ineligible providers. </p>

</tr></table><h3>Evaluating Intervention Options</h3>
<p>The 30-plus initiatives mentioned above for advancing health IT for  		ineligible providers could be coordinated more closely to advance common goals.  		Based on our analysis and consultation with the Technical Advisory Group (TAG)  		convened by the contractor for this study, there are some guiding principles  		that could be considered when evaluating whetheraction is needed for purposes  		of implementing and using EHR technology by the ineligible providers: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Built to last</i>: Interventions should support the development  			 of the emerging health care delivery and business models envisioned in the  			 Affordable Care Act, the nationwide health IT infrastructure, and the EHR  			 Incentive Programs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Patient-centered</i>: Interventions should support improved care  			 delivery and outcomes through the patient-centered approach that technological  			 change is increasingly enabling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Tailored and targeted</i>: Interventions should not be  			 one-size-fits-all, but selected with an understanding of ineligible providers  			 and the technology solution needed to achieve policy goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Smartly clustered</i>: Interventions should be strategically  			 focused and clustered to get the most benefit from the investment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Spend wisely</i>: In today's fiscally constrained environment  			 careful consideration should be given to the need to support widespread  			 implementation and use of health IT/EHRs by ineligible providers. Such  			 considerations should take into account the ineligible provider's profit  			 margins and ability to pay for some of the technology, and the availability of  			 and need for additional funding to support the acquisition and use of health  			 IT/EHR solutions that will support programmatic and policy goals. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Targeting Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>Not all ineligible providers need CEHRT, nor are all categories of  		ineligible providers equally critical in achieving overall health system  		improvements. This study provides guidance and suggested evaluation factors  		that could be used to determine which providers to prioritize. The TAG  		considered the factors and prioritized the ineligible providers into following  		three groupings: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Safety net providers</i>: Ineligible safety net providers have  			 already been prioritized for additional support. Safety net providers deliver  			 primary care services to nearly 26 million individuals<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note9">9</a></sup> in rural and underserved areas. Congress previously  			 addressed this group of ineligible providers, not through an extension of the  			 HITECH incentive program, but through a $1.5 billion appropriation to Health  			 Resources and Services Administration for health IT grantfunding to support the  			 adoption and use of EHR technology for health centers. This funding, which has  			 not been available to the other ineligible providers, has resulted in a  			 relatively high rate of EHR technology adoption for safety net providers.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Long-term and post-acute care and behavioral health  			 providers</i>: Policymakers have directed some attention at advancing the use  			 of health IT/EHRs by the LTPAC providers and behavioral health providers. For  			 example, in 2012 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration  			 (SAMHSA) directed $23 million<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note10">10</a></sup> in grants and  			 contracts towards the health IT infrastructure and the use of health IT/EHRs by  			 behavioral health providers. In addition, ONC directed $7 million in State  			 Health IT Challenge Grants to advance HIE on behalf of LTPAC providers, and is  			 also supporting HIE on behalf of LTPAC providers in some of the Beacon  			 Community Programs. These providers serve some of the nation's most vulnerable  			 individuals on behalf of whom a significant portion of Medicare and Medicaid  			 expenditures are made. These patients experience frequent transitions in care  			 and require care coordination with eligible hospitals and professionals, and  			 other health care providers. Some of these providers will need interoperable  			 EHR technology to support new care delivery and payment models in the  			 Affordable Care Act (as identified in  			 <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendI">Appendix  			 I</a>) and in private sector initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Other ineligible health care providers</i>: The use of certain  			 technology interventions could be targeted, as needed, to other ineligible  			 providers to advance policy priorities such as e-prescribing, medication  			 management or lab reporting. These providers are either ancillary service  			 providers that may interface with an EHR or generally have access to CEHRT  			 through their work in other settings. Supporting the use of interoperable  			 interventions through the development of specialized applications would permit  			 efficient HIE between these ancillary providers and health care providers that  			 require the use of certified EHRs, including those providers who are presently  			 eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Economic Factors for Evaluating Options</h3>
<p>The decision to implement technology by a provider or implement an  		incentive or funding program is dependent on understanding the benefits and  		costs. This section identifies economic factors for evaluating the benefits and  		costs of programs to accelerate adoption of interoperable EHR technology by  		ineligible providers. We do this by addressing:</p>
<ul><li>key principles of cost-benefit analysis;</li>
<li>findings from evidence on the effectiveness of EHRs;</li>
<li>criteria for evaluating the costs and benefits of a program; and</li>
<li>considerations to promote interoperability.  </li>
</ul><p>The criteria developed for this report identify several economic factors  		that could:</p>
<ul><li>inform the need for and impact of incentives and/or other funding to  		  support the use of EHRs by ineligible provider types; and</li>
<li>be used to evaluate the need for, and costs and benefits of different  		  incentives and other options to encourage health IT adoption by ineligible  		  providers.  </li>
</ul><p>This study considers some of these factors in assessing the potential  		impact of extending three incentive/funding options and applies the criteria to  		a private sector study that identifies hypothetical nursing home costs of EHR  		acquisition and use.</p>
<h3>Overall Findings</h3>
<p>LTPAC, Behavioral Health, Safety Net, and other providers are not  		eligible for EHR incentive payments under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  		Incentive Programs. Ineligible providers generally provide health care to  		vulnerable and costly individuals in our society, and the care they deliver  		would often benefit from electronic communication with other providers.  		However, such HIE remains uncommon, and addressing this technological lag could  		support the realization of the goals associated with implementing a nationwide  		health IT infrastructure and the deployment of new models of care delivery and  		coordination, and support the HIE goals of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  		Incentive Programs. </p>
<p>The ability to address this problem is hindered by data on ineligible  		providers' health IT use that are unreliable or unavailable, not comparable  		among ineligible provider types or between any or all of those provider types  		and the eligible providers involved in the EHR Incentive Program. Despite those  		barriers, this study addressed the specific questions asked by Congress. This  		study has:</p>
<ul><li>provided a rationale for defining health care providers and  		  identified those who are not eligible for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  		  Incentive Programs, and grouping them into different categories;</li>
<li>identified other funding made available to these providers who are  		  ineligible for the EHR Incentive Programs and with the exception of certain  		  safety net providers, found that the amount, duration and scope of these other  		  funds will not support widespread use of technology needed to support national  		  policy goals;</li>
<li>described, to the extent possible, the key characteristics and  		  clinical use of health IT by ineligible providers;</li>
<li>considered the extent to which ineligible providers work in settings  		  that might otherwise receive EHR incentive payments;</li>
<li>considered, but could not determine, whether market forces associated  		  with new delivery models such as those encouraged by the Affordable Care Act  		  will be sufficiently widespread to drive adoption of interoperable  		  technologies; and</li>
<li>identified factors for considering the costs and benefits of making  		  available health IT/EHR incentives/funding for ineligible providers who may be  		  determined to need such support to support national policy goals related to  		  improving health and health care.  </li>

<h3>A. The HITECH Act, Its Goals and This Study</h3>
<p>There is now widespread agreement that health information technology  		(health IT) can help providers improve the quality of medical care while also  		achieving efficiency gains that help control costs. Bipartisan sponsorship for  		health IT was demonstrated by the inclusion of the Health Information  		Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) within the American  		Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub.L. 111-5).</p>
<p>HITECH was designed to incentivize Medicare and Medicaid eligible  		hospitals, critical access hospitals (CAHs), and eligible professionals to use  		certified electronic health records (EHRs) to collect, store, transmit and use  		health care information in a meaningful, secure, and timely way. HITECH  		outlined a number of priorities for the "meaningful use" of EHRs, including  		e-prescribing, electronic health information exchange (HIE) to improve quality,  		such as promoting care coordination, and submitting information on clinical  		quality measures. </p>
<p>HITECH also provided funding for developing a nationwide health IT  		infrastructure and a framework of privacy, security and other policies and  		procedures needed to support the electronic use and exchange of health  		information. HITECH established by statute within the U.S. Department of Health  		and Human Services (HHS) the Office of the National Coordinator for Health  		Information Technology (ONC) and tasked it with performing certain duties in a  		manner consistent with the development of the nationwide health IT  		infrastructure.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note11">11</a></sup> The goals of the nationwide  		health IT infrastructure include:</p>
<ul><li>improve care coordination;</li>
<li>improve quality, efficiency and patient safety and reduce health  		  disparities;</li>
<li>promote public and population health; </li>
<li>engage patients and families; and</li>
<li>ensure privacy and security. </li>
</ul><p>HITECH also made the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  		responsible for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. (For specific  		timelines and requirements for Medicaid and Medicare incentives, see  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendA">Appendix  		A</a>.)</p>
<p>The legislative mandate for this study also originates in HITECH. </p>
<p>To achieve Congress' intended goals and maximize the impact of HITECH  		funds, incentives focused on physicians, who drive most decisions on care, and  		on hospitals, where the largest share of health care dollars are spent.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note12">12</a></sup> HITECH-designated specific categories of providers  		as eligible for incentives under certain specified conditions, while other  		categories of providers were ineligible, in part because of concern about  		whether it was possible to establish, in a timely fashion, clear and effective  		meaningful use standards for them.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note13">13</a></sup> However,  		Congress recognized those providers' importance in Section 4104(a)<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note14">14</a></sup> of the HITECH Act, which requires the Secretary of  		HHS to conduct a study to determine the extent to which, and manner in which,  		payment incentives and other funding for implementing and using certified EHR  		technology (CEHRT) should be made available to those providers who received  		minimal or no payment incentives or other funding under HITECH. The Secretary  		is required to submit a report to Congress on the findings, addressing the  		following factors:</p>
<ul><li>the extent to which these providers work in settings that might  		  otherwise receive an incentive payment or other federal funding under ARRA, the  		  Social Security Act or otherwise;</li>
<li>adoption rates of CEHRT;</li>
<li>clinical utility of such technology for these providers;</li>
<li>whether the services these providers furnish are appropriate for or  		  would benefit from such technology;</li>
<li>the potential costs and benefits of making payment incentives and  		  other funding available to these providers; and</li>
<li>any other issues the Secretary deems appropriate.</li>
</ul><h3>B. Increased Importance of This Study</h3>
<p>The use of health IT by all providers has become increasingly important  		since the passage of HITECH in 2009. In particular, the Patient Protection and  		Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Pub.L. 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and  		Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub.L. 111-152) (collectively known as  		the Affordable Care Act)) contained a long list of provisions addressing  		access, quality, and cost. Those Affordable Care Act<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note15">15</a></sup> provisions included:</p>
<ul><li>the creation of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in  		  CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program  		  expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care;</li>
<li>improvements in health care coverage, including actions to encourage  		  and expand coverage, and ensure quality coverage;</li>
<li>improvements in access to Medicaid and enhanced support for the  		  Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP);</li>
<li>improvements in the quality and efficiency of health care;</li>
<li>prevention of chronic disease and improvements in public health;</li>
<li>support for the current and developing health care workforce;</li>
<li>improvements in the transparency and integrity of Medicare, Medicaid,  		  and CHIP; and</li>
<li>improvements in access to innovative medical therapies.  </li>
</ul><p>Implementing some of these provisions will depend heavily upon an EHR  		infrastructure. Those provisions highlight the health and health care  		implications for the nation of the gap in EHR technology adoption between  		providers eligible for EHR incentives and providers who are ineligible for such  		incentives.</p>
<p>For example, health homes are a new model of care intended to link  		Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions and providers in a way that enhances  		coordination and integration of care.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note16">16</a></sup> For  		that model to be successful, provider types as different as physicians, group  		practices, rural health clinics (RHCs), community health centers, mental health  		and substance abuse providers, and home health need to communicate and  		coordinate.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note17">17</a></sup> Some of these providers are  		eligible for incentives while some are not. Research has found that providers  		affiliated with providers eligible for EHR incentives under HITECH may adopt  		this technology more quickly.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>In a similar vein, the increasing importance of health IT is reflected  		in the initial <i>National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care</i>  		(National Quality Strategy), an annual report to Congress mandated by the  		Affordable Care Act. The initial report in 2011 established three broad aims.  		They were:<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note19">19</a></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Better Care:</i> Improve overall quality by making health care  			 more patient-centered, reliable, accessible, and safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Healthy People/Healthy Communities:</i> Improve the health of the  			 United States population by supporting proven interventions to address  			 behavioral, social and environmental determinants of health, in addition to  			 delivering higher-quality care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Affordable Care:</i> Reduce the cost of quality health care for  			 individuals, families, employers, and government.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The National Quality Strategy identifies increased use of health IT as  		one of ten principles to adhere to when designing specific initiatives to  		achieve those three aims. The section "Promoting Effective Communication and  		Coordination of Care" provides specific examples of how "increased adoption of  		EHRs has the power to cut health care costs, reduce paperwork, improve  		outcomes, and give patients more control over their health care."<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note21">21</a></sup></p>
<h3>C. Study Approach</h3>
<p>The questions Congress requested that this study examine can be grouped  		into three categories:</p>
<ol><li>ineligible providers and their practice characteristics; </li>
<li>extent of ineligible provider health IT use, its current clinical  		  impact, and the predicted impact of greater use; and</li>
<li>incentives and other funding options for the use of health IT by  		  these ineligible providers.  </li>
</ol><p>To address these questions, this study developed and applied the  		following approach: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Description of United States health care policy goals and the  			 need for health IT, including EHRs</i>: We described key HITECH programs and  			 activities related to this study, including HITECH programs that support the  			 adoption and use (including meaningful use) of certified EHRs, HIE, and  			 criteria and standards for certified EHRs. Key attributes of HITECH were also  			 described within the context of the Affordable Care Act and the National  			 Quality Strategy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Determination of ineligible providers who are the focus of this  			 study</i>: Using the list of health care providers specified in Section 3000(3)  			 of the PHSA, as added by Section 13101 of HITECH, we identified: (i) those  			 provider types eligible to receive incentive payments under current law for the  			 adoption and meaningful use of CEHRT under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  			 Incentive programs; and (ii) those provider types who are not eligible to  			 receive such incentive payments but could be eligible to participate in the  			 Medicare or Medicaid programs.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note22">22</a></sup> Thus, this  			 report focuses on provider types that: (i) could participate in Medicare or  			 Medicaid; and (ii) are not eligible for EHR incentive payments under the  			 Medicare or Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. In addition, as described in more  			 detail in the report, we also considered whether any of the provider types  			 ineligible for EHR payment incentives received other funding (e.g., in the form  			 of grants) to support their use of EHR technology.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note23">23</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Identified ineligible provider characteristics</i>: The study  			 provides information, to the extent it is available, on the number of providers  			 in each ineligible provider category and the number of individuals to whom they  			 provide services. The report presents Medicare and/or Medicaid expenditures for  			 services provided by the ineligible provider types. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Investigation of the use and utility of health IT, including EHRs  			 implemented by the ineligible providers</i>: To the extent information is  			 available, we examined adoption of EHRs by ineligible providers, their use in  			 practice, and their clinical utility. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Identification of current funding, incentive or administrative  			 options to advance use of EHR technology, including CEHRT</i>: We conducted an  			 environmental scan and identified activities undertaken by HHS and others to  			 advance the use of EHRs by providers through incentives or other funding  			 support. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Discussion of the study's initial findings with a Technical  			 Advisory Group (TAG)</i>: The contractor for this study convened a TAG of  			 experts with expertise in economics, health policy, and Medicare and Medicaid  			 EHR incentive programs and asked them to review the study methodology, initial  			 findings, and other aspects of study design and implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Economic factors for evaluating policy options</i>: We engaged a  			 health care economist to identify factors that could be applied to evaluate the  			 cost and benefits of different incentives and other options to encourage health  			 IT adoption by ineligible providers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionI.D" id="sectionI.D">D. Study Definitions</a></h3>
<p>Congress requested that this study examine adoption, use and clinical  		utility of "certified" EHR technology (CEHRT) by ineligible providers. HITECH  		defines "certified" and "qualified" EHRs. The manner in which those terms were  		defined in the HITECH and applied in this study is set forth below. Other terms  		used in the course of this study are also defined and further described in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendB">Appendix  		B</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>Adoption of "EHR Technology" Versus "Certified EHR Technology"  		</b></i></p>
<p>For purposes of this study, Congress specifically requested information  		on ineligible providers' adoption of "certified EHR technology." The  		certification program in HITECH is currently implemented to support the  		certification of EHR technology used by hospitals and professionals eligible to  		participate in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. Current EHR  		technology certification criteria generally support the clinical workflow for  		eligible providers. While the EHR technology used by ineligible providers can  		be certified through ONC's EHR certification program, some of the certification  		criteria do not apply to the technology needed by ineligible providers and also  		do not include clinical practice and workflow requirements needed by ineligible  		providers. As a result, few EHR products for ineligible providers, particularly  		long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) and behavioral health, are certified.</p>
<p>In September 2012, ONC provided the following guidance on the  		applicability and certification of EHRs for ineligible providers:</p>
<ul><li>Secure electronic exchange between all health care settings makes  		  good policy sense;</li>
<li>EHR technology developers serving ineligible providers are encouraged  		  to certify EHR modules to the transition of care criteria; and </li>
<li>Acknowledged the role of private certification organizations for  		  these providers.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note24">24</a>, <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note25">25</a></sup></li>
</ul><p>HHS has not yet fully assessed the EHR certification criteria needed for  		technology products used by ineligible providers. For that reason, we could not  		assess the adoption of CEHRT as defined by the HITECH Act. Instead, we  		evaluated the adoption of any EHR technology by ineligible providers and looked  		for evidence of adoption of important features that would be a part of a  		qualified EHR<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note26">26</a></sup> as specified in HITECH. (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendB">Appendix  		B</a> Definitions and Certification of EHR Technology.)</p>
<p><i><b>Qualified EHR Technology</b></i></p>
<p>HITECH defined a qualified EHR as: "an electronic record of  		health-related information on an individual that includes patient demographic  		and clinical health information, such as medical history and problem lists, has  		the capacity to provide clinical decision support, support physician order  		entry, capture and query information relevant to health care quality, and  		exchange electronic health information with, and integrate such information  		from other sources."<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note27">27</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Use of EHR Technology</b></i></p>
<p>This study requires consideration of the extent to which EHR technology  		is used by ineligible providers.A definition of "EHR use" was not provided in  		HITECH requirements for this study. For the purposes of this study, we defined  		EHR use as how the technology was used in the ineligible provider's practice to  		support clinical and business operations. To enable comparison among different  		types of providers, we identified a common set of EHR functionality or modules  		used in clinical care and operations.</p>
<p><i><b>Clinical Utility</b></i></p>
<p>A definition of "clinical utility" was not provided in HITECH.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note28">28</a></sup> For the purposes of this study, we defined clinical  		utility as the ability for the EHR technology to support interoperability and  		secure information exchange among health care providers by complying with  		requirements of a "base EHR." To evaluate clinical utility, we considered  		whether the ineligible provider's EHR technology could meet the requirements of  		a "base EHR" (which includes transition of care criteria) that will be  		required, beginning in 2014,for Stage 1 and Stage 2 in the EHR Incentive  		Programs.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs were intended to  		increase the adoption and use of CEHRT by eligible professionals and hospitals.  		However, both the Affordable Care Act and the National Quality Strategy contain  		a number of provisions and strategies that require the use of EHRs and  		interoperable health IT technologies across a broad array of health care  		providers. A new report from the Institute of Medicine, <i>Best Care at Lower  		Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America</i>, stresses  		the need for a digital infrastructure to enable providers to deliver better  		care and generate systems improvement and new knowledge.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note30">30</a></sup> This study will evaluate the providers who are not  		eligible for the incentive program, yet remain important to the national effort  		to reform the health care system to improve care and reduce cost. </p>
<h2><a name="ineligible" id="ineligible">II. INELIGIBLE PROVIDERS AND THEIR PRACTICE  		CHARACTERISTICS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Identifying the Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The seemingly simple task of sorting health care providers into  		different categories (e.g., those eligible and those not eligible for  		incentives, those who have and use EHR technology and those who do not, etc.)  		is made complex by both a convoluted system in which overlapping services are  		provided by different providers and a lack of standardization across provider  		classifications at the federal and state levels. Thus, for purposes of this  		study it is imperative to carefully identify who is an <i>ineligible  		provider</i>. To do that, we applied the following methodology:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Determined whichprovider types are listed in HITECH (i.e., PHSA  			 §3000(3)).<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note31">31</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determined which provider types listed in HITECH (i.e., PHSA  			 §3000(3)) <i>are</i> eligible for incentives under HITECH.  			 <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#table2">Table 2</a> lists those providers who are eligible for either  			 Medicare or Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs, including those whose  			 eligibility for such incentives is dependent upon volume and other thresholds.  			 The providers eligible for either of these payment incentive programs are  			 <i>not</i> the focus of this study (see <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#table2">Table 2</a>).  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determined which of the providers as listed in PHSA §3000(3)  			 are <i>not</i> eligible for incentives and which of these "ineligible" provider  			 types could participate in Medicare and/or Medicaid programs (see  			 <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#table3">Table 3</a>). </p>
<p>(See  			 <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendC">Appendix  			 C</a> for a description of the: Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs,  			 the health care providers listed in §3000(3) of the PHSA, and which of  			 these providers are eligible for or ineligible for incentives under the  			 Medicare or Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also reviewed the other funding made available to the ineligible  			 provider types to support their use of EHR technology (see <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#guidance">Section V</a>). With the exception of funds provided to  			 certain safety net providers for their use of health IT, the activities  			 supported by these additional funds do not support widespread adoption and use  			 of EHR technology by these ineligible provider types. Thus, for purposes of  			 this report, these additional funds were considered to be "minimal."</p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>Extent to Which Ineligible Providers Work in Settings that Receive  		Incentive Funding</b></i></p>
<p>It is important to note that some ineligible providers do have access to  		CEHRT, and Congress requested that this study determine the extent to which  		ineligible providers work in settings that might be receiving health IT  		incentive funding. When data were available, we identified the percentage of  		the ineligible providers affiliated with eligible hospitals or eligible  		professionals in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendD">Appendix  		D</a> (includes data and references by setting) and summarized the findings  		below: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Long-Term and Post-Acute Care</i>: The American Hospital  			 Association (AHA) surveyed 4,800 hospitals<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note32">32</a></sup>  			 of which 24 percent have a skilled nursing unit; 29 percent have a physical  			 rehabilitation unit; 7 percent have a LTCH unit; 27 percent offer home health  			 services; and 20 percent offer hospice services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Behavioral Health</i>: The AHA survey of 4,800 hospitals<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note33">33</a></sup> indicated 33 percent have an inpatient psychiatric  			 unit and almost 10 percent offer substance abuse treatment. Twelve percent of  			 clinical psychologists and 31 percent of clinical social workers work in the  			 hospital setting. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Safety Net</i>: Fifteen percent of RHCs are owned by hospitals  			 and 49 percent of independent clinics are physician owned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Other</i>: The AHA survey<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note34">34</a></sup>  			 reported 24.5 percent of hospitals have an ASC. Sixty-five percent of ASCs are  			 physician owned. Ten percent of renal dialysis facilities are hospital-based.  			 Nine percent of emergency medical service providers are hospital-owned. Ten  			 percent of pharmacies are owned by hospitals and 23 percent of pharmacists work  			 in hospitals. Fifty-five percent of laboratories are hospital-based.  			 Approximately 28 percent of physical and occupational therapists work in  			 hospitals and 13 percent of speech-language therapists work in hospitals.  			 Thirty-two percent of dietician/nutritional professionals work in hospitals.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Reassignment of Incentives</b></i></p>
<p>Eligible professionals may practice in more than one setting or  		exclusively in settings that are ineligible for incentives. Eligible  		professionals may reassign their incentive payments, in accordance with the  		Medicare reassignment rules, to entities that are ineligible for the incentive  		payments. Eligible professionals have a choice of where they reassign their  		incentive payments. For example, professionals working in FQHCs may reassign  		their incentive payment to the FQHC; however there is no guarantee that they  		will reassign their incentive payment if they also have their own practice and  		chose to use the incentive for their own EHR. </p>
<p>Hospital-based eligible professionals cannot receive EHR incentive  		payments. Data was not available on the extent to which professionals such as  		physicians practice exclusively in ineligible provider settings. </p>
<p>Eligible professionals who practice in settings like hospitals, nursing  		homes, FQHCs, CMHCs, etc. may practice in a diverse number of settings. It may  		not be a realistic way of subsidizing the EHR cost for an ineligible provider  		by relying on the reassignment of EHR incentive payments.</p>
<h3>B. Ineligible Provider Characteristics</h3>
<p>To understand the size of the ineligible provider markets, the number of  		patients they serve, and their impact on the Medicare and Medicaid programs,  		this section analyzes the key data below and then summarizes the information  		and additional provider characteristics for three of the ineligible provider  		clusters (LTPAC, Behavioral Health, and Safety Net): </p>
<ul><li>Total number of ineligible provider organizations;</li>
<li>Total number of patients served by ineligible provider type;</li>
<li>Total Medicare expenditures by ineligible providers; and</li>
<li>Total Medicaid expenditures by ineligible providers.  </li>
</ul><p>The following section does not present this type of information for the  		"Other Provider" cluster. These "Other Providers" deliver ancillary services  		(e.g., pharmacy, laboratory, etc.) to the total population in contrast to the  		other ineligible provider clusters (in which services are provided by defined  		provider types or organizations). In addition, the services delivered by many  		of these "Other" ineligible providers are limited to a single clinical domain  		(e.g., laboratory work or medication orders). Thus, some of these "Other  		Providers" may not require the functionality of a complete EHR, but instead may  		use specific health IT applications. Given the variability of providers in the  		"Other" cluster, the following summary excludes these providers. Information  		about these "Other Providers" can be found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendH">Appendix  		H</a>. </p>
<p>The information and sources of data used to complete the analyses for  		the LTPAC, Behavioral Health, and Safety Net clusters described in this section  		are detailed in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendD">Appendix  		D</a>. This appendix also contains the data and sources for the "Other  		Providers" cluster. </p>

<p>The EHR Incentive Programs made available incentives and other funding  		to eligible providers encouraging their adoption and use of CEHRT. The  		structure of the program for eligible providers is incremental -- spurring the  		use of EHRs starting in 2011, increasing access and HIE in 2014, and building  		towards a transformed health care system after 2016. </p>
<p>Adoption of CEHRT, including interoperable technologies, is lagging  		among ineligible providers. However, ineligible providers are beginning to  		adopt health IT that supports their current clinical and business needs. As  		eligible providers prepare for interoperable HIE in 2014, they will likely need  		to exchange information with ineligible providers. It is unclear at this time  		whether market pressures will push ineligible providers and their vendors to  		implement interoperable HIE needed for health care reform and successful  		meaningful use implementation.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.A" id="sectionIII.A">A. EHR Adoption Rates for  		Eligible Providers</a></h3>
<p>It is important to understand EHR adoption rates for ineligible  		providers in the context of EHR adoption rates for eligible providers.</p>
<p>The HITECH Act authorized incentive payments under Medicare and Medicaid  		for eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and CAHs that adopt, implement,  		upgrade, or demonstrate meaningful use of CEHRT, and beginning in 2015, payment  		adjustments under Medicare for failing to demonstrate meaningful use. The EHR  		Incentive Programs are being implemented in stages:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Stage 1: Beginning in 2011, the first stage of the EHR Incentive  			 Programs focuses on adoption of technology with the capability to collect coded  			 and structured information needed for future stages. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 2: Beginning in 2014, the second stage of the EHR Incentive  			 Programs on data exchange, care coordination, and clinical  			 decision-support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third stage of the EHR Incentive Programs, which may begin in  			 2016, is expected to focus on improved outcomes and costs shown through robust  			 clinical quality measures.</p>

<h3>B. Adoption Drivers for Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>Providers not eligible for EHR incentives are also adopting EHR  		technology, but their EHRs are not aligned with the requirements for certified  		EHRs in the stages outlined above for the Medicare and Medicaid Incentive  		Programs, particularly in the areas of interoperability and HIE (discussed in  		more detail in <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#sectionIII.D">Section III.D</a>, Ineligible Providers'  		EHR Use and Clinical Utility). The ONC's 2011-2014 Federal Health Information  		Technology Strategic Plan recognized the disconnect between eligible providers'  		EHRs and ineligible providers, stating that "ensuring health information  		availability at the point of care would require addressing this difference in  		health IT use by ineligible providers."<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note43">43</a></sup> (See  		<a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#figure12">Figure 12</a>.) </p>

"For future stages of meaningful use, the plan  			 is to propose health information exchange and interoperability requirements  			 that are more rigorous, so that patient information follows patients to the  			 point of care and informs critical health decisions. This will require  			 overcoming barriers across geographies and stakeholders (i.e., providers,  			 laboratories, hospitals, pharmacies, behavioral health clinics, and patients)."  			 </td>
</tr></table><p>In general, most ineligible providers are not adopting technologies to  		facilitate electronic communication and information sharing directly with other  		providers or through HIE networks. Many ineligible providers routinely exchange  		clinical information with other health care partners (often through paper and  		fax), but electronic HIE is uncommon except for specific use cases (e.g.,  		laboratories to share results and pharmacies for e-prescribing). Uptake of  		interoperability and HIE has been minimal for ineligible providers for several  		reasons including:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Vendor systems serving the ineligible provider markets generally do  			 not have the functionality to support interoperability and HIE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lack of available CEHRT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nationally recognized standards are not yet available to support  			 functionalities and interoperable exchange of data needed to support key care  			 processes and contexts that are unique to the various types of ineligible  			 providers.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>As previously noted, a number of Affordable Care Act initiatives could  		use a health IT infrastructure to reduce care fragmentation and improve care  		coordination as a means of improving quality and reducing cost. In  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendI">Appendix  		I</a>, we identified 40 provisions of the Affordable Care Act that apply to  		ineligible providers within each of the four clusters that either: (i) require  		or could support the use of health IT; and/or (ii) require or imply the  		exchange of health information. Some of the HIE provisions require electronic  		HIE, while other provisions do not specify the method of exchange (e.g.,  		information exchange could electronic or manual). For example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Some of these provisions reference the use of health IT to implement  			 new care coordination models, including medical homes and health homes, and  			 seek to improve care coordination and case management for high-risk, high-cost  			 beneficiaries. These provisions reference the use of health IT/EHRs to support  			 communication, link services, support care over time and across settings,  			 and/or support the reporting of quality measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of these provisions focus on care coordination and imply the  			 exchange of information to: support coordinating care across Medicare and/or  			 Medicaid providers, improve safe and effective care transitions, support  			 hospital discharge planning to ensure appropriate post-acute care placement,  			 secure feedback from beneficiaries and family members, require quality measure  			 reporting, and focus on clinical collaboration by funding clinical education  			 programs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two provisions included grant programs to support the adoption and  			 use of information technologies or EHRs by long-term care facilities (see  			 Sections 6114 and 6703 of the Affordable Care Act). Funds were not appropriated  			 for either provision and these provisions were not implemented. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is possible new market pressures will be brought to bear on  		ineligible providers to use technology as provisions that focus on HIE are  		implemented. While these provisions are expected to advance the use of  		technology by at least some of the ineligible providers, it is still unknown  		how widespread this impact will be. </p>
<p>To understand the state of adoption and use of EHR technology, including  		interoperable technologies related to the EHR Incentive Programs, the next  		section describes what is known about each ineligible provider.</p>
<h3>C. EHR Adoption Rates for Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>Collecting information on health IT/EHR adoption rates for providers  		ineligible for meaningful use incentive funding presented significant  		challenges. The lack of a common definition of an EHR and its functionality  		severely limits cross-provider comparisons and comparisons with EHR adoption  		rates by providers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive  		Programs (<a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#figure13">Figure 13</a>). Moreover, there are very few  		comprehensive, peer-reviewed, published studies on EHR adoption rates by  		providers not eligible for the EHR Incentive payments. The challenges are  		summarized in a study conducted by the University of Colorado, Denver<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note44">44</a></sup> which evaluated existing surveys on health IT and  		found:</p>
<ul><li>Significant variability in breadth and depth of survey content, data  		  item construction, terminology, and definitions (when definitions are provided  		  at all).</li>
<li>Issues of sample size and representativeness make it difficult to  		  rely on the accuracy of estimates produced by the surveys.</li>
<li>Respondents from a single state survey limit thegeneralizability of  		  findings to the national picture.  </li>
</ul><table border="1" title="FIGURE 13. Lack of Comparability of EHR Adoption Rates"><tr><td><b><font><a name="figure13" id="figure13">FIGURE 13</a>. Lack of Comparability of EHR  			 Adoption Rates</font></b></td>

<ul><li>Certified EHR technology products are not available for many  				  ineligible providers. </li>
<li>Available EHR technology for ineligible providers generally  				  does not support interoperability. </li>
<li>Survey tools measuring adoption have significant  				  variability.</li>

<p>At best, these adoption rates can be used to indicate the need to adopt  		technology to support some clinical and business processes. However, in  		general, the adoption rates for ineligible providers cannot and should not be  		compared to the adoption rates across ineligibles or with adoption rates for  		eligible hospitals and eligible physicians since they do not measure comparable  		EHR technology. To illustrate the lack of comparability, the findings from a  		June 2012 study conducted by the National Council for Community Behavioral  		Healthcare on health IT adoption for community behavioral health organizations  		reports that 21 percent of organizations have EHRs at all of their sites; 65  		percent of the behavioral health organizations surveyed reported having adopted  		some form of an EHR at some of their sites. Only 2 percent of responding  		community behavioral health organizations reported adopting technology that  		could meet the base meaningful use requirements.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>One agency is addressing the need for comparable national EHR adoption  		data for certain ineligible providers. The Bureau of Primary Health Care at the  		HRSA is leveraging the Uniform Data Systems administrative dataset to collect  		information on the EHR adoption rates in FQHCs. Since 2010 FQHCs have reported  		EHR information annually.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note46">46</a></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>In general, the findings for ineligible providers reflect implementation  		of EHR functions that support some business and clinical needs for that  		particular provider type. Even though some providers are fully electronic, most  		have only partially implemented a system and are maintaining hybrid processes  		(both paper and electronic). The majority of providers have limited or no  		capability to electronically exchange information and generally cannot support  		meaningful use functions related to transition of care. One group of ineligible  		providers -- pharmacies, laboratories, ambulance services, and blood centers --  		appear to maintain specialized health information systems that share  		information with EHR technology, but these health information systems do not  		constitute an EHR system themselves. Some of these providers use specific  		health IT applications rather than the complete functionality of CEHRT.  		Further, some of these applications may need to support interoperable exchange  		with certified EHR systems.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.D" id="sectionIII.D">D. Ineligible Providers' EHR Use  		and Clinical Utility</a></h3>
<p>Ineligible providers are adopting technology to support some clinical  		and business processes, but EHR products used by ineligible providers have  		generally not supported interoperability. It is not surprising given limited  		EHR technology to support exchange for eligible providers and almost none that  		supports interoperable exchange by ineligible providers. Requirements for  		interoperable exchange for eligible providers are just now being implemented  		with Stage 2 of the EHR Incentive Programs. To address questions from the  		ineligible providers regarding EHR certification interoperability, the Federal  		Government provided guidance in July 2012 recommending voluntary certification  		to the transitions of care module. It is unclear at this time whether market  		pressures will push ineligible providers and their vendors to implement  		interoperable HIE needed for health care reform and successful implementation  		of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. </p>
<p>To understand ineligible providers' use of an EHR, we looked at adoption  		rates, use in practice, clinical utility as it relates to the base EHR  		requirements that will apply beginning in 2014 for Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the  		EHR Incentive Programs, the need for HIE, and barriers to adoption. Findings  		for each ineligible provider cluster are summarized below with more detailed  		information by each ineligible provider type detailed in Appendices E-H.</p>
<p><i><b>Use of the EHR in Practice</b></i></p>
<p>To understand how the EHR was used in patient care and to support daily  		operations, we evaluated the following categories of EHR functionality:</p>
<ul><li>Admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT)</li>
<li>Appointments</li>
<li>Order entry and management</li>
<li>Clinical notes</li>
<li>Assessments</li>
<li>Care plan</li>
<li>Condition-specific documentation</li>
<li>Medication and treatment records</li>
<li>Pharmacy information system</li>
<li>Lab information system</li>
<li>Therapy information system</li>
<li>Patient portals</li>
<li>Patient eligibility determinations</li>
<li>Billing</li>
<li>Staffing  </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Clinical Utility</b></i></p>
<p>To assess clinical utility and determine the ability of health IT to  		improve care and patient impact, we examined the base EHR functionality as  		described in the September 4, 2012 ONC final rule on health IT standards,  		implementation specifications, and certification criteria for CEHRT that must  		be met for the Stage 1 or Stage 2 meaningful use requirements by eligible  		professionals and eligible hospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  		Incentive Programs. We considered whether these requirements could be  		implemented in information systems used by ineligible providers because there  		was a need for similar functionality in systems used by these providers. This  		should not be construed as saying the ineligible provider's EHR technology  		meets the base EHR requirements. The following functions were evaluated:</p>
<ul><li>Patient demographics, health information, and problem lists </li>
<li>Clinical decision support</li>
<li>Physician order entry</li>
<li>Support clinical quality measures</li>
<li>Exchange health information (send, receive, and integrate to support  		  transition of care)</li>
<li>Privacy, security, and integrity features  </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Barriers to Adoption</b></i></p>
<p>To fully understand limitations to adopting EHR technology, we collected  		information on the barriers that limited or prevented adoption and use of EHR  		technology by the ineligible providers. We categorized the barriers as  		follows:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of capital</li>
<li>Perceived inequity regarding lack of incentives</li>
<li>Lack of awareness of the need to implement an EHR</li>
<li>Lack of demand for an EHR</li>

<p>As was the case in presenting information about the Other Providers  		expenditure and volume information, it is difficult to provide aggregate  		information about this group's EHR adoption and use. Other Health Care  		Providers rely on health IT; however, with the exception of ASCs, the Other  		Providers' need for health IT appears to be limited to a specific ancillary  		service.  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendH">Appendix  		H</a> provides information (to the extent it was available) for each provider  		identified.</p>
<h2><a name="option" id="option">IV. OPTIONS TO ENCOURAGE USE OF EHR TECHNOLOGY BY  		INELIGIBLE PROVIDERS</a></h2>
<p>The previous sections described the ineligible providers, the patients  		they serve and their use of EHR technology. From this analysis, we identified a  		number of important facts about ineligible providers and their use of EHR  		technology. Three are particularly salient: </p>
<ul><li>ineligible providers generally provide health care to some of the  		  most vulnerable and costly individuals in our society;</li>
<li>the care they deliver would often benefit from electronic  		  communication with other providers, but that remains uncommon; and</li>
<li>most ineligible providers are adopting some level of technology to  		  meet clinical and business needs, but are not investing in interoperable  		  technology that supports an integrated, patient-centered approach.  </li>
</ul><p>This technological lag by ineligible providers may have consequences.  		Advancing the use of EHR technology, particularly to support HIE, could support  		new models of care delivery and coordination and new payment models for the  		vulnerable populations most likely to benefit from the goals of Better  		Care/Healthy People/Healthy Communities and Affordable Care.</p>
<p>Stakeholders have identified a variety of direct and indirect actions  		that could be used to encourage adoption of EHR technology by ineligible  		providers. It should be noted that some of these options have been implemented  		while others have only been proposed. This summary simply lists and does not  		endorse any of these options. These actions include:</p>
<ul><li>Proposals to extend the current Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive  		  Program; </li>
<li>Grants, demonstrations, and cooperative agreement programs (federal  		  and state); </li>
<li>Loan programs (federal and state);</li>
<li>Technical assistance programs; </li>
<li>Administrative infrastructure building activities (standards and  		  testing); and</li>
<li>Other actions (rule changes).  </li>
</ul><p>These actions have been advanced by a variety of stakeholders and are  		described below and in more detail in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendA">Appendix  		A</a> and Appendices K-O. </p>
<h3>A. Summary of Options for Incentives, Other Funding, and  		Support</h3>
<p>In this study over 30 actions, plans, proposals, or initiatives were  		identified that make available or propose federal or state actions to support  		ineligible providers' use of EHR technology.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note47">47</a></sup>  		These current or proposed actions focused on advancing the use of health IT;  		including by modernizing the health care infrastructure to facilitate new  		models of care delivery or payment, or targeting the use of technology by a  		particular group of ineligible providers who sometimes are limited to a  		particular geography. Detailed descriptions of these initiatives are available  		in <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendA">Appendix  		A</a> and Appendices K-O. The initiatives described below are summarized and  		categorized into two groups: initiatives that provide direct support to  		ineligible providers and those providing indirect support. </p>
<p><i><b>Direct Support Options </b></i></p>
<p>There are five types of initiatives that offer direct support to  		ineligible providers to acquire and use health IT. The initiatives include both  		current and proposed programs and include providing support through extending  		the current EHR incentive program, grants paid to providers to purchase  		technology, loan programs, and administrative rules. <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#table5">Table  		5</a>, below, summarizes the direct support options.

<td>Current law makes available EHR Incentive  			 payments to eligible health care provider types.Several  			 stakeholders<sup>a,b,c,d,e,f,g</sup> have stated that there is a need to extend  			 the EHR Incentive Programs under HITECH to include many ineligible provider  			 types, such as long-term and post-acute, and behavioral health providers. These  			 stakeholders describe the lack of incentives as a barrier to achieving needed  			 quality, continuity, and coordination of care improvements; as well as a  			 barrier to enabling needed data analytics to measure, improve, and transforming  			 service delivery. Some of these stakeholders propose extending the same  			 incentive structure as is implemented in the EHR Incentive Programs. Others  			 recommend establishing meaningful use metrics that reflect key clinical and  			 non-clinical measures for the vulnerable populations served by ineligible  			 provider types, and aligning the current meaningful use measures for the EHR  			 Incentive Programs with these metrics.</td>

<td>Some states, such as North Dakota,  			 Minnesota and Maine, offer health IT loan programs to both eligible and  			 ineligible providers. For example, North Dakota made $5 million available in a  			 revolving loan fund to directly support eligible and ineligible providers in  			 purchasing health IT. Some stakeholder groups have proposed making  			 available various loan programs to support the acquisition and use of EHR  			 technology.<sup>a,d,e,g</sup>In addition, Title XIII of HITECH  			 permitted the ONC to establish a grant program to states (and Indian tribes)  			 for a loan program for providers to support the purchase and use of certified  			 EHRs, training of personnel, or secure HIE.</td>

CMS anticipates continuing to promote technical assistance to  			 advance health IT across multiple health care settings in the QIO  			 program.Separately, HITECH funded RECs to provide technical assistance  			 to eligible professionals to implement CEHRT.

</tr></table><h3>B. Other Options -- Guidance from Technical Advisory  		Group</h3>
<p>In addition to the initiatives above, the TAG convened by the contractor  		for this study identified other administrative levers that could be used to  		advance the use of CEHRT by ineligible providers who participate in the  		Medicare and Medicaid programs. The TAG was comprised of experts on health care  		policy, economics, financing, and health IT. The descriptions below present  		suggestions identified by the TAG and is not intended to endorse any of these  		options, but simply to convey ideas discussed by the TAG. </p>
<p><i><b>Program Regulations</b></i></p>
<p>The ineligible providers identified in this study participate in the  		Medicare and/or Medicaid program in which there are program/payment rules and  		regulations that govern their participation. The TAG suggested that these  		requirements could reference the use of CEHRT by the ineligible provider. For  		example, current regulations include requirements for maintaining medical  		records and some refer to electronic records. The language could be updated to  		reflect contemporary use of EHR technology aligned with Meaningful Use  		criteria, while balancing the goal to promote widespread EHR adoption and  		resources needed to support such adoption. (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendQ">Appendix  		Q</a> for an example of current regulatory language for medical records.) </p>
<p><i><b>Condition Grants on Use of Interoperable Health IT </b></i></p>
<p>Another option suggested by the TAG to accelerate the use of health  		IT/EHRs by ineligible providers would include in the use of interoperable  		health IT (consistent with requirements with the EHR Incentive Programs) in  		grant program requirements where the use of health IT and HIE is needed. This  		could ensure that government funds are used to support consistent health IT  		policy goals and that grants available to ineligible providers increase the  		adoption and use of CEHRT.</p>
<p><i><b>Program Oversight Through Health IT</b></i></p>
<p>There are on-going concerns about health care fraud involving both  		eligible and ineligible provider types. Technology can play a role in program  		oversight. The 2005 report to ONC on the Use of Health Information Technology  		to Enhance and Expand Health Care Anti Fraud Activities<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note48">48</a></sup> stated that "technology can play a critical role in  		detecting fraud and abuse and it can help to pave the way toward prevention.  		While technology cannot eliminate the fraud problem, it can significantly  		minimize fraud and abuse and ultimately reduce health care fraud losses. The  		use of advanced analytics software built into the nationwide health information  		infrastructure is critical to fraud loss reduction."</p>
<h2><a name="guidance" id="guidance">V. GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING OPTIONS</a></h2>
<h3>A. TAG Guidance for Evaluating Options to Support EHR  		Use by Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The HITECH EHR incentive program not only provided direct support to  		acquire CEHRT, but also a complementary set of programs to ensure eligible  		hospitals and professionals could be successful in using CEHRT in a meaningful  		way. In contrast, the more than 30 actions/plans/initiatives mentioned above to  		advance health IT for ineligible providers have little coordination or common  		strategic purpose behind them. For that reason, the TAG convened by the  		contractor for this study provided the following guidance for evaluating and  		prioritizing different initiatives to support the implementation and use of  		EHRs by ineligible providers: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Built to last</i>: Interventions should support the technology  			 infrastructure needed for development of the emerging health care delivery and  			 business models envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, the development of the  			 nationwide health IT infrastructure, and the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  			 Incentive Programs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Patient-centered</i>: Interventions should support improved care  			 delivery and outcomes through the patient-centered approach to care delivery  			 that technological change is increasingly enabling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Tailored and targeted</i>: Interventions should not be  			 one-size-fits-all, but selected with an understanding of ineligible providers,  			 barriers, costs and benefits for health IT adoption and the costs and benefits  			 to Medicare and Medicaid. Interventions do not need to be directed to an entire  			 provider type, but could be targeted to a subset (e.g., providers of a certain  			 size or in a certain location).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Smartly clustered</i>: Investments to support the acquisition  			 and/or use of CEHRT by ineligible providers should be strategically focused,  			 including considerations about what interventions may need to be clustered to  			 get the most benefit from the investment. For example, interventions that  			 provide financial support to acquire and use technology may also need to be  			 clustered with technical assistance programs to ensure the technology is  			 implemented successfully. </p>
</li>

<p><i>Spend wisely</i>: Determining the need for incentives and/or  			 other funding to support the use of health IT/EHR technology by ineligible  			 providers should include considerations of the following: the ineligible  			 provider's profit margins; the ability to target investments to ineligible  			 providers who need and could benefit from such technologies; the ability to  			 leverage and align the use of such technology to other program requirements;  			 and the ability to use such technologies to support needed program oversight.  			 In addition, when determining the need for incentives and/or other funding to  			 support widespread use of technology solutions by ineligible provider types,  			 consideration should be given to whether funds have been made available, and if  			 so, the amount, duration, and scope of these funds to support the acquisition  			 and use of CEHRT by targeted ineligible provider type(s). The following section  			 includes information on the other sources of funds that were made available  			 through HITECH and other programs to support the use of health IT/EHRs by some  			 of the ineligible provider types.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Targeting Technology and Support for Ineligible  		Providers</h3>
<p>In an era of limited resources, targeting and tailoring interventions  		takes on a particular importance. Not all ineligible providers need CEHRT, nor  		are all categories of ineligible providers equally important in achieving  		overall health system improvement. <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#figure14">Figure 14</a> outlines  		factors that could be used to determine which providers to prioritize for  		implementing and using health IT/EHRs. The TAG considered the ineligible  		providers and suggested three priority groups. Further analysis of the  		individual provider types within each group is needed, but was out of scope for  		this study. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Safety net providers</i>: Ineligible safety net providers have  			 already been prioritized by HHS for additional support. Safety net providers  			 deliver primary care services to "well over 25 million low-income  			 patients"<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note49">49</a></sup> in rural and underserved areas.  			 Congress previously addressed this group of ineligible providers not through an  			 extension of the HITECH incentive program, but through $1.5 billion in health  			 IT grant funding available from HRSA to support the adoption and use of EHR  			 technology. This funding, which has not been available to other ineligible  			 providers, has resulted in a relatively high rate of EHR technology adoption  			 for safety net providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Long-term and post-acute care and behavioral health  			 providers</i>: Policymakers have directed some attention at advancing the use  			 of health IT/EHRs by LTPAC and behavioral health providers. For example, in  			 2012 SAMHSA directed $23 million toward health IT infrastructure and the use of  			 health IT/EHRs by behavioral health providers. In addition, ONC directed $7  			 million in State Health IT Challenge Grants to advance HIE on behalf of LTPAC  			 providers and is also supporting HIE on behalf of LTPAC providers in some of  			 the Beacon Community Programs. In addition, through the CMS QIO, $2.5 million  			 was made available for QIOs in three states (Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and  			 Colorado) to provide technical assistance to Medicare participating SNFs and  			 HHAs to improve the use of health IT by these providers. These efforts aim to  			 improve patient coordination, prioritize transitions of care, reduce medication  			 errors, create key partnerships, and apply effective quality improvement  			 techniques using health IT. </p>
<p>This category of providers serves some of the nation's most  			 vulnerable individuals and use a significant portion of the Medicare and  			 Medicaid budgets. Patients served by these providers experience frequent  			 transitions in care and episodes of care coordination with eligible hospitals  			 and professionals. Some of these providers may need interoperable EHR  			 technology to support new care delivery and payment models in the Affordable  			 Care Act (as identified in  			 <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendI">Appendix  			 I</a>) and in private sector initiatives. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Other ineligible health care providers</i>: The use of certain  			 technology interventions could be targeted, as needed, by other ineligible  			 providers to advance policy priorities such as e-prescribing, medication  			 management, or laboratory results reporting. These providers are either  			 ancillary service providers that may use health IT applications to interface  			 with an EHR or generally have access to CEHRT through their work in other  			 settings. Supporting the use of interoperable interventions through the  			 development of specialized applications would permit efficient HIE between  			 these ancillary providers and health care providers that require the use of  			 certified EHRs, including those providers who are presently eligible for the  			 Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments. </p>

</tr></table><p>If, based on consideration of the preceding factors and questions, a  		conclusion is reached to encourage the use of EHR technology by certain  		ineligible provider types through the use of incentives or other options,  		understanding the benefits and costs of implementing options may be an  		important factor in decision-making. The next section provides an economic  		framework that could be applied to conduct such an analysis.</p>
<h2><a name="economic" id="economic">VI. ECONOMIC FACTORS FOR EVALUATING BENEFITS AND  		COSTS OF NEW INTERVENTIONS</a></h2>
<p>The decision to implement technology by a provider or implement an  		incentive program or other initiative to support the use of such technology  		could be informed by an understanding the benefits and costs. This section  		presents economic factors for estimating the benefits and costs to programs to  		accelerate adoption of interoperable EHR technology by ineligible providers. We  		do this by addressing:</p>
<ul><li>key principles of cost-benefit analysis (CBA);</li>
<li>findings from evidence on the effectiveness of EHRs;</li>
<li>criteria for evaluating the costs and benefits of a program; and</li>
<li>issues associated with promoting interoperability.  </li>
</ul><p>Because of the very limited data available on the extent of ineligible  		providers' use of health IT, and the costs and impact of the use of this  		technology by these ineligible provider types, this section of the report often  		found it necessary to draw inferences from the evidence available on eligible  		providers.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note50">50</a></sup></p>
<h4>A. Key Principles of Cost-Benefit Analysis</h4>
<p><i><b>Incremental Effects</b></i></p>
<p>CBA compares the incremental benefits accruing from a policy to its  		incremental costs. A policy creates incremental benefits or costs only if it  		causes changes in behaviors. Although the adoption of EHRs by ineligible  		providers is expected to grow with or without government intervention, the  		shape of that adoption curve is uncertain. Any program designed to increase  		adoption will produce benefits only if it accelerates adoption above and beyond  		the projected natural growth path. The benefits of a policy intervention accrue  		from incremental adoption above the forecast trend, but since it can be  		difficult to target a subsidy just towards incremental adopters (that is, those  		who a subsidy will influence) the cost of such programs can be high relative to  		the benefits.</p>
<p><i><b>Determining Perspective</b></i></p>
<p>Considering the benefits and costs of an intervention to increase EHR  		adoption is dependent on the stakeholder's perspective (e.g., government/payer,  		provider, patients, EHR vendor). For purposes of this report, we viewed the  		costs of the intervention as accruing to the government. Benefits may include  		improvements in the quality of care and reductions in health care spending,  		including reduced costs of health IT/EHR solutions. Some of these benefits  		accrue to the recipient of the intervention, and some may ultimately be  		realized by the government as the payer and to the patient. The following  		highlights the importance of considering the perspective when describing costs  		and benefits:</p>
<blockquote><p>As previously described, CEHRT includes both fully certified and  		  modularly certified EHR solutions. Incentives could support the acquisition  		  costs of a comprehensive (fully) certified EHR or costs of certified EHR  		  modules (e.g., a module that supports the exchange of information to support  		  transitions in care). The costs to the government of supporting the acquisition  		  costs of certified EHR modules would be less than the costs supporting  		  acquisition of a fully certified EHR. At the same time, the provider, patient,  		  and payer would be expected to realize benefits of reduced costs and improved  		  quality through the effective use of a certified EHR module that supports the  		  exchange of information to support transitions in care. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>B. Assessing Existing Evidence on Effectiveness of EHR  		and Interoperability</h3>
<p>While there have been numerous studies of the benefits and costs of EHR  		adoption by hospitals and physicians, there have been very few studies  		targeting ineligible providers. For the purpose of this report, we assume that  		there are parallels. Research data shows that EHR technology is expensive.  		Based on cost estimates reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office for  		physician and hospital EHR systems,<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note51">51</a></sup> Dranove  		concluded that EHR costs could account for about one percent of total provider  		costs if adoption costs are amortized over 10 years. (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#sectionS.I.C">Appendix  		S.I.C</a> for a discussion on the Evidence of the Benefits and Costs of EHR  		Adoption.) Some research has suggested that EHR technology may not pay for  		itself, let alone generate significant savings. Other research, focusing on  		systems that target the kind of functionality included in the EHR Incentive  		Programs, has been more positive.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note52">52</a>,  		<a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note53">53</a></sup> Overall, the picture of early EHR effectiveness  		has been ambiguous. <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#figure15">Figure 15</a> highlights the findings  		from a recent study<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note54">54</a></sup> that takes a more  		nuanced view of EHR adoption and helps explain the inconsistent findings. </p>

In addition, hospitals with more experience with earlier  			 forms of EHRs from the 1990s enjoyed large cost savings after adoption of an  			 advanced EHR.This is potentially important for ineligible providers,  			 who often do not have information technology-proficient staff or information  			 technology support. Return on investment for EHR technology and reduction in  			 costs may be more difficult to achieve in those circumstances.

</tr></table><p>The full potential of health IT may not be unleashed until providers  		routinely use the technology to share clinical information. At present,  		however, the EHR market is fragmented and exchanging information across  		different vendor platforms can be difficult. The positive news is that eligible  		professionals and eligible hospitals will be incrementally adopting more  		interoperable technology as the latest rules for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR  		Incentive Programs go into effect. </p>
<p>Still, given the early stages of implementing interoperable  		technologies, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of the benefits of  		information exchange or how those benefits may vary across provider types. For  		that reason, this analysis does not attempt to model or quantify any benefits  		from information exchange. This is an important limitation of this analysis  		given the widespread belief, but limited empirical base, that the largest  		benefits of the use of EHRs will accrue as a result of HIE.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note55">55</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Evaluating Evidence on Effects of Incentives on  		Adoption</b></i></p>
<p>In  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendS">Appendix  		S</a>, we present results of original research by Dranove on the effect of the  		HITECH Act incentives on hospital adoption of EHRs using data reported to the  		Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics  		database. The results from the analysis of this database, which provides  		comparable current and historical data on acute care hospital EHR  		adoption,<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note56">56</a></sup> highlights the powerful potential  		for incentives to promote EHR adoption.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><i>Our analysis shows that  			 hospitals and affiliated ineligible providers increased adoption of EHRs after  			 the passage of the HITECH Act.

<p>In the Final Rule for Stage 2 of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive  		Programs, CMS estimates that approximately 91 percent of acute care hospitals  		(and 52 percent of eligible professionals) will qualify as meaningful users of  		CEHRT by 2018.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note57">57</a></sup> Dranove's analysis shows that  		hospitals and affiliated ineligible providers increased adoption of EHRs after  		the passage of the HITECH Act.

<p>The increase in the adoption rate that occurred at the time that HITECH  		was enacted is predicted to lead to a 13.4 percentage point increase in the  		number of hospitals that adopt an EHR by 2016.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note59">59</a></sup> Similarly, physician adoption rates have also been  		reported to increase since the introduction of the EHR Incentive  		Programs.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note60">60</a></sup> As discussed in  		<a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#sectionIII.A">Section III.A</a> of this report, a 2013 analysis of  		two data sources evaluated EHR adoption by physicians and found that rates  		doubled from 2005 to 2011 reaching 67.8 percent for family physicians in 2011  		(and that family physicians had the highest rate among office-based  		physicians). Researchers estimated that by the end of 2013, the EHR adoption  		rate among family physicians will exceed 80 percent.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note61">61</a></sup> The authors of this study attribute increases in  		EHR adoption rates, in part, due to the availability of incentive payments.  		</p>
<h3>C. Factors for Evaluating the Costs and Benefits of a  		Program</h3>
<p>The goal of government incentive programs is to reduce the costs and/or  		increase the benefits of EHR adoption. In this section we describe these  		program costs and benefits in more detail. An effective program needs to change  		the behavior of the ineligible provider.  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendS">Appendix  		S</a> provides a simple example to illustrate the many factors involved in  		predicting the extent to which providers will adopt EHR technology regardless  		of incentives, and, more importantly, how incentives may accelerate adoption.  		</p>
<p>Dranove suggests that the following factors should be considered in  		estimating EHR adoption rates, benefits, and estimating the incremental impact  		of incentives:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Factors affecting adoption costs</i> in the absence of  			 incentives:</p>
<ul><li><b>Provider size</b>: Adoption costs tend to increase with the  				size of the provider due to the need for greater system capacity and  				complexity, as well as the need to train additional staff. However, fixed  				adoption costs increase less than proportionately with size for two reasons.  				First, there is a substantial fixed component to health IT costs. Second,  				larger providers will likely have lower financing costs. </li>
<li><b>Access to capital independent of size</b>: Providers with  				superior access to capital can more easily finance the substantial costs of  				adoption. Thus, for-profit providers, non-profits that enjoy favorable  				financial performance, and providers that are part of large systems may enjoy  				greater access to capital. </li>
<li><b>Presence of complementary labor inputs</b>: EHR technology is  				a business process innovation, and successful implementation requires access to  				labor that is skilled at working with information technology.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i>Factors affecting adoption benefits:</i></p>
<ul><li><b>Size</b>: Adoption benefits are likely to increase  				proportionately with size.</li>
<li><b>System membership</b>: To the extent that information exchange  				creates spillover benefits, providers in systems (e.g., affiliated with  				eligible hospitals) will internalize these benefits.</li>
<li><b>Patient severity</b>: EHR technology may be more likely to  				improve outcomes for patients with complex conditions.</li>
<li><b>Market competitiveness</b>: To the extent that EHR technology  				improves quality and this leads to higher demand, then a competitive provider  				may value EHR technology more than a provider that faces little or no  				competition. </li>
<li><b>Provider objectives</b>: Providers that value quality of care  				independent of profits may value EHR more highly than a purely profit-driven  				provider.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i>Factors affecting incremental adoption: </i>Size, ownership, and  			 system membership may predict EHR adoption, but do not necessarily predict  			 incremental adoption from the incentive program. The model suggests that  			 incremental adoption depends on the following:</p>
<ul><li><b>The size of the incentives</b>: This will depend upon the  				specific incentives under consideration. In the example in  				<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendS">Appendix  				S</a> and presented below, the size of the incentive is evaluated in proportion  				to the provider's total Medicare and Medicaid revenues.</li>
<li><b>The size of the provider</b>: Larger providers are likely to  				perceive larger gaps between benefits and costs, whether positively or  				negatively, simply because the stakes are higher. Thus, it will take bigger  				incentives to motivate them. </li>
<li><b>Number of fence-sitters</b>: The number of providers for whom  				the costs of adoption exceed the benefits in the absence of incentives but for  				whom the benefits exceed the costs with incentives. </li>
<li><b>Financial versus clinical</b>: The extent to which the  				provider's decision to adopt EHR is based on financial rather than clinical  				considerations.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Most of these factors are supported by an empirical analysis of HITECH  		(<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendS">Appendix  		S</a>). Dranove's analysis of adoption data based on the HIMSS Analytics  		database shows that smaller hospitals responded more strongly to HITECH  		incentives, which could indicate that smaller hospitals were more likely to be  		fence-sitters. For-profits also responded more strongly to incentives, likely  		because they placed more weight on financial considerations. </p>
<p>The biggest unknown when forecasting incremental adoption is identifying  		the fence-sitters. Without reliable empirical data, a simple statistical theory  		about incremental adoption rates could be used to predict an adoption curve. A  		situation where very few providers have adopted health IT suggests that most  		are far away from choosing to adopt, and an incentive program may not change  		many minds. When most have adopted, there are few providers left who need to be  		influenced. The biggest impact of any incentive program will come when some,  		but not all, providers have adopted.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note62">62</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendJ">Appendix  		J</a> lists adoption rates of EHR technology by ineligible providers. There are  		a few classes of ineligible providers (e.g., rehabilitation hospitals, LTCHs,  		and psychiatric hospitals), where less than 10 percent have adopted an EHR. On  		the other hand, about half of providers in other categories (e.g., nursing  		homes and home health care) have adopted some components of an EHR. The  		analysis compared by Dranove suggests that in considering the need for and size  		of incentives to advance EHR adoption it is important to take into account the  		percentage of providers who have (and have not) adopted this technology.</p>
<p><i><b>Comparing Different Approaches to Encouraging Incremental Adoption  		</b></i></p>
<p>When evaluating a specific program to encourage EHR adoption, there are  		many considerations for the government including: </p>
<ul><li><i>Size</i>: How large are the incentives? </li>
<li><i>Variability</i>: Are incentives "one-size-fits-all" or tailored  		  (e.g., are incentives larger for some providers than for others)? Which  		  providers get the largest benefits from adoption? Which enjoy the largest cost  		  reductions? </li>
<li><i>Benefit size:</i> How large are the benefits to the government  		  relative to the incentives?</li>
<li><i>Interventions for fence-sitters: </i>Does the program target  		  fence-sitters?</li>
<li><i>Adopters versus non-adopters: </i>Will the program pay for  		  adoption by providers that have already adopted and/or would have adopted in  		  the absence of incentives?  </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Program Approach Examples</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>EHR Incentives</i>: HITECH creates financial incentives under  			 Medicare and Medicaid for eligible hospitals and other eligible providers that  			 meet a range of criteria for their use of CEHRT. Incentive payments have  			 several advantages. Under the current program, the government can stipulate  			 precisely the certification criteria that EHRs must meet in order to be  			 certified, and how providers must use the CEHRT to qualify for incentive  			 payments. These requirements enable providers to easily understand and compute  			 the financial benefits of compliance. On the other hand, incentives tend to be  			 broad based, so the government may incent providers that would have adopted  			 EHRs and complied with the stipulations even if no incentive payments were  			 forthcoming. Our research suggests that HITECH's incentives have had a powerful  			 effect on EHR adoption. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Financing programs</i>: Low-interest loan programs to finance EHR  			 adoption tend to be low-cost programs. In the long run, the cost of these  			 programs to the government is equal to the discount on the interest rate  			 afforded to the providers, plus modest costs for program administration, though  			 they can have a high return because they could target certain types of  			 providers (i.e., those who are small and unaffiliated with larger systems). We  			 are aware of a few states with loan programs to support EHR adoption, including  			 programs that include ineligible providers. We are unaware of any studies  			 documenting whether this program has been effective. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Technical Assistance (EHR/Health IT Consulting)</i>: Research has  			 shown that the EHR is more effective when adopting providers are in a community  			 rich with information technology expertise. Programs that provide health IT  			 training to ineligible providers that lack a workforce with the expertise to  			 implement interoperable EHR technology might be considered. Such assistance  			 could be usefully coupled with a program to provide financial incentives or  			 other funding. These programs can target health IT-poor communities, both by  			 reducing the costs and increasing the benefits of EHR implementation and use.  			 These programs should be of sufficient duration to ensure that the EHR systems  			 are fully implemented and integrated into the workflow, and that the staff are  			 fully trained. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>D. EHR Cost-Benefit Considerations for Ineligible  		Providers -- An Example</h3>
<p>The following is an example of the application of the EHR cost and  		benefits considerations (as described by Dranove) to a for-profit nursing home  		chain provider. Dranoveindicates that a health care provider would consider  		financial factors, such as the cost of acquiring, installing, and maintaining  		the EHR as well as any potential impact on efficiency. The provider may also  		consider the impact on quality, both because higher-quality could translate  		into more demand and higher revenues, and because it might directly care about  		quality independent of financial considerations. </p>

<p><i><b>Analysis of Economic Factors Applied to Nursing Home Case  		Study</b></i></p>
<p><i>Discussion -- Provider Revenues</i></p>
<p>The example presented above does not include revenues from other lines  		of business. For example, a review of a few annual reports submitted by  		organizations that deliver LTPAC services (including nursing facility services)  		to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) for the fiscal year ending in 2011  		describes that some of these organizations derive revenues from other sources  		(i.e., sources of revenue in addition to Medicare Part A SNF payment, Medicaid  		nursing facility payment, and other sources of payment for nursing home  		services). For example, the SEC filings indicate that some chain nursing home  		organizations also receive Medicare Part B payments for: (i) therapy services  		delivered to their non-Part A covered nursing facility residents and in some  		cases delivered to non-institutionalized persons; and/or (ii) physician  		services delivered to Medicare and Medicaid-paid nursing home residents. </p>
<p>In considering the need for financial incentives to support the  		acquisition and use of health IT, including EHRs, it is important to consider  		all revenue sources available to the ineligible provider type(s). </p>
<p><i>Discussion -- EMR Costs</i></p>
<p>The CIOC study is based on technology solutions and costs for these  		solutions in 2010. Technology costs are reportedly decreasing. In addition, the  		range of technology options is also changing, including the introduction of  		lower cost solutions. For example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>ONC has implemented:</p>
<ul><li>EHR certification programs (as discussed in <a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#sectionI.D">Section I.D</a> Study Definitions and  				<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPIap.shtml#appendB">Appendix  				B</a>) that make it more effective and efficient to electronically exchange  				health information between providers. The EHR certification program permits  				certification of both comprehensive EHRs and EHR modules;<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note66">66</a></sup> and </li>
<li>The ONC Direct Project provides a low-cost approach to support  				electronic HIE by enabling simple, secure transport of health information  				between authorized care providers. On average, Direct is available at a cost of  				$10-$20 per address. In some cases, grant funds allow Direct to be offered at  				no cost to providers. Technology solutions (such as certified EHRs or certified  				EHR modules) could use Direct as the mechanism to send documents.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note67">67</a></sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>The Geisinger/Keystone Beacon Community in Danville, Pennsylvania  			 has developed a tool that will be available nationally to enable low-cost HIE  			 by nursing homes and HHAs.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note68">68</a></sup> This tool is  			 built on work that ASPE sponsored that transforms the nursing home and HHA  			 assessments (Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Outcome and Assessment Information Set  			 (OASIS)) into interoperable, clinically-relevant LTPAC summary documents. The  			 LTPAC summary document is represented using interoperability standards and is  			 aligned with the standard used to exchange documents in the EHR Incentive  			 Programs. The Geisinger tool will transform the MDS and OASIS assessments upon  			 request from any nursing home or HHA provider and will make the resultant LTPAC  			 Summary available to authorized clinicians and/or HIE organizations. The fee  			 schedule for using the tool is based on the number of resident/patients per  			 provider and is expected to cost less than $1,000 per year. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Massachusetts LTPAC Health Information Exchange Challenge Grant  			 (the IMPACT Project) is developing technology tools know as "LAND"<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note69">69</a></sup> and "SEE"<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note70">70</a></sup> to  			 facilitate HIE by LTPAC organizations to enable health care providers who do  			 not have EHRs to incrementally and progressively send and receive health  			 information. LAND and SEE will be made publicly available in the summer of  			 2013. LAND will be purchasable through Orion Health under the name "Rhapsody"  			 at an estimated cost of $2,000-$10,000 per year per organization depending on  			 volume of purchases and size of the organization. The software for SEE will be  			 made available for free, but will likely cost a community or state  			 approximately $20,000-$50,000 per year to install and maintain.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note71">71</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As previously described, some EHR vendors of products for ineligible  			 providers (e.g., LTPAC providers) have had their products certified by  			 ONC-Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies under the temporary  			 certification program established by ONC to support meaningful use Stage 1.  			 Under this program those products were required to demonstrate that they  			 conformed to interoperability standards and certification criteria adopted by  			 HHS through regulation. In addition to or instead of seeking certification  			 through ONC's certification process, some vendors have had their products  			 certified by other entities or to other standards that have not been adopted by  			 HHS (e.g., the CCHIT's proprietary "CCHIT Certified" LTPAC program, which  			 includes an additional certification criteria specific to home health and  			 skilled nursing). Also, as noted, in the ONC 2014 Edition Standards and  			 Certification Criteria final rule issued to support the Medicare and Medicaid  			 EHR Incentive Programs, ONC encouraged vendors of EHR products for ineligible  			 providers to, at a minimum, seek certification of their products as meeting EHR  			 module requirements to support the exchange of information at times of  			 transition in care. It is not yet known what the impact will be on EHR vendors  			 and whether they will seek certification of their products for ineligible  			 providers, nor what the cost impact of such certification will be. While use of  			 interoperability standards, implementation specifications, and certification  			 criteria may reduce some costs of developing products (including reducing the  			 need for a number of customized interfaces), there will still be product  			 development and acquisition costs associated with developing and using  			 technology solutions that support interoperable HIE. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>Discussion -- EHR Costs Relative to Profit Margins</i></p>
<p>Assuming that Medicare margins for SNFs are 18.5 percent (as estimated  		by MedPAC) and that margins for Medicaid and other revenue sources are zero,  		annual EMR costs of less than 1 percent for any one of the three technology  		solutions described in the example above would seem to be affordable to  		providers that have a similar patient and payer mix. Further, assuming these  		EMR costs and provider profit margins: </p>
<ul><li>for those providers that are motivated by quality/clinical  		  considerations in addition to financial considerations, investing in EMR  		  acquisition and use would seem to be a rational business and clinical decision;  		  and </li>
<li>to the extent that use of the technology improves quality and this  		  leads to higher demand, then a competitive provider may value the EHR  		  technology more than a provider that faces little or no competition.  </li>
</ul><p>Understanding the provider's profit margins (across all revenue sources)  		relative to the costs of needed technology solutions is one important factor  		when considering the need for incentive payments. </p>
<p><i>Discussion -- Cost Savings of Using an EHR</i></p>
<p>To estimate the cost savings that these hypothetical nursing homes might  		realize as a result of using an EHR, we used Dranove'sestimate of 3 percent  		cost savings (which includes costs savings of 2 percent of total revenues and 1  		percent of monetized quality of care improvements).<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note72">72</a></sup> Thus, in our example, the annual cost savings  		(relative to aggregate annual revenues) for each of the hypothetical nursing  		homes are, on average, approximately $260,000 per year per facility. </p>
<p>In this example, because estimated annual savings ($260,000) exceed the  		estimated annual EMR costs (average annual costs -- $57,953), we would expect  		the nursing home to adopt an EMR. However, as Dranovenotes, "a rational  		decision maker might not follow this simple go/no-go adoption decision if the  		benefits appear to outweigh the costs but there is uncertainty about benefits  		or costs that will be resolved over time. The decision maker may prefer to wait  		for the uncertainty to be resolved before adopting."<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note73">73</a></sup></p>
<p>In circumstances where technology costs are relatively modest and/or  		cost savings are expected to exceed the technology costs, and health IT  		adoption by the ineligible providers is believed to be too low or slow,  		implementation of any one or more incentive/funding options (e.g., financial  		incentives, technical assistance, etc.) could remove/reduce uncertainty about  		the benefits of acquiring and using certain technology solutions. </p>
<p><i>Discussion -- Other Considerations</i></p>
<p>The above example embeds many assumptions that may not be applicable to  		the wide array of ineligible provider types and/or to the various types of  		health IT/EHR technology solutions that may be needed to improve quality and  		continuity of care. In addition, the example is silent with respect to certain  		factors that may influence decisions to invest in technology. The following  		discusses some of these assumptions and factors, their implications, and the  		applicability to other types of ineligible providers. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The preceding hypothetical describes a mid-size, for-profit nursing  			 home chain provider operating in two states; and makes several assumptions  			 including assumptions about the:</p>
<ul><li>participating providers' annual revenue and profit margins; </li>
<li>availability of IT leadership and technical support (pre and  				post-acquisition); and</li>
<li>hardware and software costs, and costs of initial and on-going  				maintenance/training (pre and post-acquisition).  </li>
</ul><p>It is unlikely that these same assumptions will be applicable across  			 ineligible provider categories. For example, independent and smaller providers  			 (e.g., independent clinical social workers, psychologists, or therapists) will  			 likely not have the same payer mix, revenue streams and amounts, and levels of  			 information technology leadership and technical support as was assumed for this  			 mid-size nursing home chain organization and their provider members.</p>
<p>The cost of EHR implementation may be higher for these providers if  			 information technology leadership and technical support are not available  			 in-house. In addition, Dranoveindicates that providers with favorable financial  			 performance (e.g., for-profit providers) may be able to more easily access  			 financing to support the costs of technology adoption, and that smaller  			 providers may have less access to capital at favorable rates. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preceding example was silent on whether the hypothetical  			 organization was:</p>
<ul><li>affiliated with other providers in the health system (e.g.,  				hospital-based nursing homes, nursing homes that are a part of an integrated  				delivery system or participate in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs));  				and</li>
<li>motivated to acquire and use technology solutions to support and  				improve clinical care.  </li>
</ul><p>The transformation underway in the health care system is expected to  			 increase collaborations and affiliations across health care providers. Emerging  			 health care reform models (e.g., ACOs, Patient-Centered Medical Homes, etc.)  			 are creating new relationships between health care providers eligible for EHR  			 incentive payments and providers who are ineligible for such payments.  			 Dranove'sanalysis suggests that EHR adoption rates by ineligible providers  			 affiliated with acute care hospitals increased after the passage of the HITECH  			 Act. In addition, Dranove indicates that providers that participate in health  			 systems will realize benefits as a result of such participation, and that such  			 benefits may influence the provider's decision to adopt needed technology.</p>
<p>However, at present, there is limited information about types of  			 providers engaged in the various integrated models, and no evidence concerning  			 the impact of such partnerships on technology adoption. Further, how widespread  			 the trend of increasing provider collaborations will be across the health care  			 delivery system, and the impact of such collaborations on technology adoption  			 by ineligible providers, is unknown. </p>
<p>Dranovenotes that non-profit providers may be more motivated to  			 acquire and use technology solutions if they are more focused on clinical  			 considerations (in contrast to providers that are more focused on financial  			 considerations). However, because of the lack of data on ineligible non-profit  			 providers' revenue sources and amounts, and technology costs; we were unable to  			 analyze the cost savings that different classes of non-profit ineligible  			 providers might realize through the use of different technology  			 solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>E. Summary of Cost/Benefit Considerations for Making  		Incentives and/or Other Funding Available to Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>There is considerable uncertainty regarding future trends of EHR  		adoption by ineligible providers. This uncertainty is due in part to changes in  		the health delivery system that are driving increasing collaborations and  		partnerships across the health care continuum, increasing emphasis on improving  		quality of care while reducing health care costs, and declining technology  		costs. These factors may result in ineligible providers choosing to adopt  		technology solutions at higher frequencies even without the use of financial  		incentives. </p>
<p>Considering the need for financial incentives and/or other funding to  		support the costs of acquisition and/or use of technology solutions (to support  		and/or accelerate adoption) is complex and should take into account the:</p>
<ul><li>provider's revenues (across all sources); </li>
<li>availability, including the amount, duration and scope, of other  		  funding to support the use of technology for the targeted provider type(s);  		  </li>
<li>the type of technology that needs to be encouraged and the costs of  		  such technology; and</li>
<li>availability of certified technology solutions to support policy  		  objectives.  </li>
</ul><p>Technology solutions that support HIE are the types of technology that  		will most likely focus on the goals of health system transformation to improve  		the quality and continuity of care. </p>
<p>In addition to considering the ineligible provider's ability to afford  		technology solutions, the provider's access to and need for specific technology  		support (e.g., technical assistance) for the initial acquisition and on-going  		implementation will also require consideration. Making available such  		assistance could signal support for the use of the technology solution, reduce  		uncertainty about the benefits of the solution, and thus, accelerate the  		acquisition and use of the technology. </p>
<h3>F. Cost/Benefit Considerations for Making Incentives  		and/or Other Funding Available to Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>If the assumptions described in the example above are accurate, the  		hypothetical may suggest that payment incentives are not warranted for this  		specific class of ineligible provider. If the policy goal is widespread  		adoption of EHRs, consideration could be given to designing an incentive  		structure that would target those ineligible providers that lack the financial  		capacity and/or system relationships that would support the acquisition and use  		of such technology.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Dranove suggests that smaller and unaffiliated providers may face  			 challenges in supporting the acquisition and use of EHR technology. For  			 example, it may be possible to structure a low-cost loan programs and/or other  			 options in such a way to support EHR acquisition and use and target these  			 smaller and unaffiliated providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not financial support is needed to support the  			 acquisition and use of health IT hardware and software, EHR users will require  			 on-going information technology support. Again, if the goal is widespread EHR  			 adoption, it may be possible to design interventions (such as technical  			 assistance) that would target those ineligible providers that do not have  			 access to such assistance (either due to the lack financial capacity and/or  			 system relationships).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As implied in the examples above and the discussion of additional  		factors, the benefits and costs of any incentive or funding option will be a  		function of the targeted health IT/EHR intervention, and the type, amount,  		duration, and scope of any incentive/funding option.</p>
<h3>G. Considerations to Promote Interoperability</h3>
<p>In 2005, two key studies were published providing an analysis of the  		potential impact and business case for advancing interoperable EHRs in health  		care. These studies identified the value of interoperable EHRs and predicted  		cost savings with widespread adoption. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The Center for Information Technology Leadership's study<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note74">74</a></sup>  			 summarized the business case for national implementation of standardized HIE  			 and stated that fully standardized health information exchange and  			 interoperability (HIEI) could yield a net value of $77.8 billion per year once  			 fully implemented. Non-standardized HIEI offers smaller positive financial  			 returns. The clinical impact of HIEI for which quantitative estimates could not  			 be produced would likely add further value. </p>

<p>The RAND's study<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note75">75</a></sup> concluded that  			 effective EHR implementation and networking could eventually save more than $81  			 billion annually -- by improving health care efficiency and safety -- and that  			 health IT-enabled prevention and management of chronic disease could eventually  			 double those savings while increasing health and other social benefits. They  			 noted that these savings may not be fully realized without changes to the  			 health care system.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These studies highlighted two reasons for policymakers to consider  		widespread adoption of interoperable health IT through the use of incentives  		and other funding: (1) providers must absorb the costs of EMR systems, but  		consumers and payers are the most likely to reap the savings;<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note76">76</a></sup> and (2) even if EMR systems were widely adopted,  		the market might fail to develop interoperability and robust information  		exchange networks.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note77">77</a></sup> The RAND study estimated  		potential efficiency and safety savings of more than $81 billion per year with  		widespread adoption (90 percent) of interoperable EHR systems.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2013, RAND published an update to their study noting that the  		projected savings and adoption rates are significantly less than what had been  		projected in 2005 for the following reasons:<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note79">79</a></sup></p>
<ul><li>There has been sluggish adoption of health IT systems significantly  		  below the 90 percent threshold specified by the RAND team in 2005 needed to  		  achieve efficiency and savings; </li>
<li>The choice of systems are neither interoperable nor easy to use;  		  and</li>
<li>Health care providers and institutions have failed to reengineer care  		  processes to reap the full benefits of health IT.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note80">80</a></sup></li>
</ul><p>The "staged design" of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs  		for eligible providers merits attention in terms of the current state of  		interoperable HIE. The stages of the EHR Incentive Programs envisioned a  		"building block" approach for implementation -- first acquiring health data,  		then using standards to exchange data to support care coordination, and reusing  		data to support health system transformation:</p>
<ul><li>Stage 1 starting in 2011 focused largely on the use of EHR technology  		  that stores structured health information; </li>
<li>Stage 2 (to be implemented beginning in 2014) will focus on accessing  		  health information to support care coordination, patient engagement and  		  clinical decision support; and </li>
<li>Stage 3 (may be implemented beginning in 2016) will focus on health  		  system transformation including the use of health data to improve population  		  health, quality and outcome of care, and case management. </li>
</ul><p>As described earlier in the report, many of the ineligible provider  		types could benefit from, but are not adopting, interoperable EHR technology  		solutions that support HIE on behalf of their patients, many of whom experience  		frequent transitions between care settings and instances where care is shared  		across unaffiliated care providers. The lack of standards that support  		interoperable exchange of health information to support the care needs of  		populations served by providers not eligible for incentive payments has been  		identified as one barrier to the adoption and use of EHR technology that  		supports this functionality. Work is underway to partially address this gap  		through the ONC-sponsored Standards and Interoperability Framework-Longitudinal  		Coordination of Care Workgroup. This community-led Workgroup is developing  		standards for the interoperable exchange of more robust of Summary Documents  		and Care Plans at times of transitions in care and to support instances of  		shared care.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note81">81</a></sup> It remains to be seen whether  		these standards, once finalized, will be integrated into technology solutions  		used by eligible and ineligible providers.</p>
<p>While there are a number of initiatives targeting ineligible providers  		to advance their use of health IT, only a few programs provide direct support  		to ineligible providers to acquire EHRs and those programs are focused on  		narrow group of providers. Further, there are only a few initiatives that are  		advancing interoperable HIE with and by ineligible providers. As discussed by  		the TAG, none of the programs for ineligible providers are sufficient to  		promote widespread adoption of CEHRT, including technology that supports  		interoperability in the same manner as the EHR incentive program for eligible  		hospitals and professionals. This should not come as a surprise given the  		difference in funding for direct support -- the HITECH EHR Incentive Programs  		is estimated to make available over $15 billion<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note82">82</a></sup> in incentive payments available to help eligible  		hospitals and eligible professionals improve the quality, safety, and  		coordination of care while also achieving efficiency gains to help control  		costs. </p>
<p>Given the on-going rise in EHR adoption, policymakers may find it cost  		effective to focus on promoting adoption and use on interoperable technologies  		by ineligible providers, which would support the goals of the Affordable Care  		Act, the National Quality Strategy, and HITECH.</p>
<p>Further, the on-going changes in the provider landscape, specifically  		the growth of formally integrated provider systems as well as the growth of  		delivery models such as ACOs, create opportunities to accelerate HIE with  		ineligible provider types, including interoperable HIE. These new delivery  		systems may be able to internalize the benefits of HIE in ways that could not  		be accomplished by individual providers. On-going system growth is likely to  		further promote EHR adoption and the possibility of interoperability among  		eligible and ineligible providers; however, it is impossible to predict the  		impact of market forces.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">VII. CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>This study provided a rationale for identifying provider types not  		eligible for EHR incentive payments. The study identified the provider types  		who may participate in Medicare and Medicaid but are not eligible for the EHR  		Incentive Programs implemented under HITECH, and identified other funding  		sources directed to some of these ineligible provider types to support their  		implementation and use of health IT/EHRs. Providers ineligible for the Medicare  		and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs were clustered into four categories:  		long-term/post-acute care, behavioral health, safety net, and other provider  		types. </p>
<p>The ineligible provider types described in this report have a frequent  		need to exchange health information on behalf of their patient populations,  		many of whom represent the most vulnerable and costly in our society. One of  		the key benefits of the use of health IT for ineligible providers is the  		ability to exchange information to communicate and coordinate services with a  		patient, their physician, and the entire care team who are often located in  		different geographic areas and practice settings.<sup><a href="ehr-payment-incentives-providers-ineligible-payment-incentives-and-other-funding-study.html#note83">83</a></sup> However, such HIE remains uncommon. Closing this  		technological gap by ineligible providers could support the realization of the  		goals associated with implementing a nationwide health IT infrastructure, new  		models of care delivery and coordination, and promote the HIE goals of the EHR  		Incentive Programs. Policies to address this challenge are hindered by data on  		ineligible providers' health IT use that are unreliable or unavailable, not  		comparable among ineligible provider types or between any or all of those  		provider types and the eligible providers involved in the EHR Incentive  		Programs. A critical part of enabling the secure flow of information across the  		system is advancing the adoption of health IT standards through voluntary  		certification of health IT and HIE products and services. In addition,  		empirical data demonstrating the business case for investing in interoperable  		EHRs to improve quality of care and reduce costs is lagging for ineligible  		providers.</p>
<p>This study described key characteristics of provider types identified as  		not eligible for EHR incentive payments, and their affiliation with eligible  		providers and clinical use of health IT to the extent possible. </p>
<p>The study identified (but did not endorse) several actions, programs and  		initiatives that have been leveraged or proposed to provide "direct support" or  		"indirect support" to ineligible providers for their acquisition and/or use of  		health IT/EHRs, including: extending the EHR Incentive Programs, grant and loan  		programs, technical assistance, developing and implementing a health IT  		infrastructure to support interoperable HIE with and by ineligible providers,  		and using other administrative tools (e.g., rulemaking) to support or require  		the use of health IT by ineligible provider types. </p>
<p>The study also identified several:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Economic factors that could inform the need for and impact of  			 incentives and/or other funding to support the use of EHRs by ineligible  			 provider types, including: </p>
<ul><li>provider size, affiliation with providers eligible for EHR  				incentives and/or with integrated delivery systems, and financial/quality  				objectives, and</li>
<li>overall competiveness of particular markets.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Factors that could be considered to evaluate the need for, and costs  			 and benefits of different incentives and other options to encourage health IT  			 adoption by ineligible providers, including consideration of: </p>
<ul><li>all sources of revenue by ineligible provider type,</li>
<li>acquisition and implementation costs of needed health IT/EHR  				solutions (including access to and costs of on-going technical assistance), and  				</li>
<li>profit margins for ineligible provider types.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The study noted that there is a lack of strategic planning or  		coordination with respect to programs and activities that include a focus on  		the use of health IT/EHRs by some of the ineligible provider types. Such  		strategic planning could assist in identifying gaps in current activities to  		advance the use of EHR technology by ineligible providers and support  		investments that maximally leverage and are aligned with current policy  		priorities, and are efficiently targeted. This study described the importance  		of having good, reliable and nationally representative data regarding health  		IT/EHR adoption rates by ineligible providers in order to assesses the need for  		and effectiveness of investments that seek to advance the acquisition and/or  		use of health IT/EHRs by ineligible providers. This study also identified  		several factors that could be considered in estimating EHR adoption rates. </p>
<p>With the exception of the $1.5 billion in other funding directed to the  		use of health IT by certain safety net providers, the other funding that has  		been directed to some of the other ineligible provider types for purposes of  		implementing and using EHR technology was not considered to be sufficient in  		amount, duration, and scope to support widespread adoption and use of this  		technology by these ineligible provider types. However, this observation begs  		the question as to whether incentives or other funding is needed to support or  		accelerate the implementation and use of EHRs by the ineligible provider types.  		There are keyconsiderations that will help inform discussion on the need for  		incentives and/or other funding to support the use of EHR technology by  		ineligible providers. These considerations include the extent to which market  		forces that have emerged in response to the EHR Incentive Programs and new  		delivery models such as those encouraged by the Affordable Care Act will drive  		adoption of interoperable EHR technologies across the health care continuum,  		including use of such technology by ineligible providers.</p>
<p>Should policymakers determine the need for interventions to accelerate  		or advance the use of CEHRT solutions for certain ineligible provider groups,  		the following additional factors could be considered. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Built to last</i>: Interventions should support the technology  			 infrastructure needed for the emerging health care delivery and business models  			 envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, the nationwide health IT infrastructure,  			 and EHR Incentive Programs to allow for the interoperable exchange and reuse of  			 health information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Patient-centered</i>: Interventions should promote a  			 patient-centered approach to care delivery and outcomes empowering patients and  			 their care support network. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Tailored and targeted</i>: Interventions should not be  			 "one-size-fits-all" but must consider the cost of adoption and the provider's  			 need for clinical utility and availability of the technology. It is likely that  			 different technology solutions will be required to achieve policy goals for  			 different ineligible provider types. Finally, the costs and benefits to  			 Medicare and Medicaid should be a factor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Smartly clustered</i>: Interventions may need to be clustered to  			 accrue the most benefit from the investment. Strategically considering and  			 supporting the type of heath IT functionality (including certified EHRs) needed  			 to realize policy goals may help remove some uncertainty in the market. Such  			 support could accelerate adoption by some providers not eligible for EHR  			 incentive payments, and could serve to reduce the amount, duration, and/or  			 scope of incentives/other funding. In addition, direct support to implement  			 health IT/CEHRT may need to include technical assistance and workforce  			 initiatives to ensure implementation of technology is appropriate to achieve  			 quality and cost goals by the targeted ineligible provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Spend wisely</i>: In today's fiscally constrained environment  			 careful consideration should be given to the ineligible providers' margins and  			 ability to cover all or some of the cost of technology. In addition,  			 consideration should be given to the availability (i.e., amount, duration, and  			 scope) of other funding to support the acquisition and use of CEHRT by the  			 targeted ineligible provider type(s). </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In considering the need for incentives and other funding to support EHR  		use by ineligible providers, policymakers may wish to consider the feasibility  		of designing programs targeting ineligible providers that lack the financial  		capacity or system relationships to support the acquisition of CEHRT.  		Policymakers may also wish to consider technical assistance interventions  		targeting those ineligible providers who do not have a health IT-proficient  		workforce or access to health IT support to advance the acquisition and use of  		EHR technology, and extend to these providers key lessons learned based on an  		evaluation of the adoption and use experiences of providers who were eligible  		for incentives.</p>
