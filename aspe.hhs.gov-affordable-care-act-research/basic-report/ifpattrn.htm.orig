<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>The demand for long-term healthcare services is rising rapidly in direct  		proportion to the growing population of Americans who require help with  		personal care and other daily functional tasks. Long-term care (LTC)  		expenditures now account for almost 12 percent of total personal health  		expenditures -- a threefold increase since 1960 -- leaving large numbers of  		elderly Americans vulnerable to catastrophic expenditures that can rapidly  		deplete their income and life savings.</p>
<p>At the same time, a series of government actions signal the federal  		government's continuing desire for individuals to accept personal  		responsibility for planning and paying for their long-term care needs. Limited  		public funding for long-term care expenses, coupled with tax incentives for  		individuals and companies to obtain private LTC policies, has once again heated  		up sales in the burgeoning private long-term care insurance market. </p>
<p>But does private LTC insurance represent a "good buy?" While there is a  		growing body of knowledge about who buys LTC policies and why, there has been  		no systematic study of the effectiveness of such policies. On an industry-wide  		basis, no one knows how benefits are being used, whether claimants feel they  		are getting good value for the premiums they pay, and whether the patterns of  		formal (paid) and informal (unpaid) service use differ for LTC insurance  		claimants compared to similarly disabled persons without LTC policies.</p>
<p>This research was designed to answer these questions. It was also  		designed to provide basic socio-demographic and service utilization profiles  		for disabled private LTC insurance policyholders, and to compare such data and  		findings to the experiences of non-insured disabled community-dwelling elders.  		Finally, we set out to discuss the implications of such findings on the service  		delivery system as well as on the design of private and public LTC programs and  		policies. </p>
<p>We did this by interviewing about 700 community-dwelling long-term care  		insurance claimants receiving benefits under their policies. We also  		interviewed their informal caregivers. Key findings of the study are presented  		below.</p>
<p><b><i>The Profile of Community-Dwelling Long-Term Care Insurance  		Claimants</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Privately insured disabled policyholders are more likely to be  			 older, widowed, and less likely to have children living nearby than are elders  			 in the general population. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term care insurance benefits are well targeted. The vast  			 majority of recipients (79%) has significant dependencies in activities of  			 daily living (ADLs) -- on average 3.3 dependencies -- or is cognitively  			 impaired (32% of the sample). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who at the time of the interview did not meet HIPAA benefit  			 eligibility triggers -- about 15% of the sample -- were either eligible at the  			 time that they applied for benefits or were likely to become eligible in the  			 very near future. This group is very frail and has few informal supports.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Use of Formal and Informal Care Services Among Privately Insured  		Claimants</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>About one-in-four claimants relies solely on formal (paid) services  			 for their care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home health aides provide most of the formal care given to  			 claimants. Two-in-three claimants receive care from this type of service  			 provider. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On average, claimants receive 59 hours of care a week. Insurance  			 pays for an average of 36 hours per week, which is equal to about 60% of the  			 total care received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal caregivers split their time fairly evenly between ADL and  			 instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) whereas informal caregivers are  			 more likely to be providing greater amounts of IADL and less ADL  			 assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal service providers spent 44 hours in the homes of claimants of  			 which 36 hours were spent on ADL and IADL assistance. About 18% of the time was  			 spent on non-ADL/IADL activities. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Benefits paid under Insurance Contracts and Insurance Policy  		Designs</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>For more than 70% of claimants, insurance pays all of the costs of  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average monthly insurance benefit paid to claimants is $1,527.  			 This compares to an average public insurance benefit (i.e. Medicaid waiver) for  			 home care of $450.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of the interview date, the average claimant had been in claim for  			 about 13 months and had received $18,000 in benefits. This amount represents  			 less than 20% of total available insurance benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The typical coverage for home care reimburses up to $80 in daily  			 costs for a period of about four years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-third of claimants has some form of inflation  			 protection.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Claimant Satisfaction with Insurance Policy and Insurance  		Company</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The vast majority of claimants (86%) is satisfied with their policy  			 and most (75%) had no difficulty understanding what their policy covered. Most  			 (70%) found it easy to file a claim. About 19% felt that the company could have  			 provided additional customer support and more information about how to use  			 benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claimants with a disability policy design were the most likely to be  			 very satisfied with their insurance policy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 90% of all individuals filing claims had no disagreements with  			 their insurance companies or had a disagreement that was resolved  			 satisfactorily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While most claimants felt they had purchased enough home care  			 coverage (75%), the rest (25%) wished they had purchased more.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Impact of Private Long-Term Care Insurance on Claimants and  		Informal Caregivers</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>About 60% of claimants indicated that without their policy they  			 would not be able to afford their current level of services and would have to  			 consume fewer hours of paid care. Many also indicated that without their policy  			 benefits, they would have to rely more on informal supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About half of all claimants and informal caregivers indicated that  			 without private insurance, they would have to seek institutional alternatives  			 -- nursing home care or assisted living facilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The presence of insurance benefits has not significantly reduced the  			 level of informal care received by claimants. Roughly two-in-three informal  			 caregivers have not reduced the level of care that they provide with half  			 maintaining the same level of care. This finding suggests that for most  			 informal caregivers, insurance financed formal care is not a perfect substitute  			 for informal care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where formal care does substitute for informal care, the  			 substitution is selective; that is, the formal care financed by insurance  			 benefits may substitute for the care provided by adult children but not  			 necessarily for the care provided by a spouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About two in three informal caregivers indicate that the presence of  			 private insurance benefits has reduced their level of stress.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Levels of Met and Unmet Need</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The majority of claimants do not report unmet (82%) or undermet  			 (77%) needs. Yet for those who do, the principle contributing factors are  			 service availability, scheduling, continuity and coordination of caregivers,  			 claimant preference and the quality of caregivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While long-term care insurance is succeeding in bringing formal  			 caregivers into the homes of disabled elders, in some cases the services of  			 these providers are either not being utilized by claimants or are not being  			 supplied to the claimant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claimants with multiple caregivers report greater levels of undermet  			 need. This suggests that clearly delineated lines of responsibility may be  			 particularly important in assuring that needs are adequately met.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Comparing Privately Insured and Non-Privately Insured  		Community-Dwelling Disabled Elders</i></b><sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Compared to those without private insurance, disabled elders with  			 private insurance are more likely to live alone and less likely to have  			 children living nearby. They are also four times more likely to have some  			 college education, eight times more likely to have incomes greater than $30,000  			 and are overwhelmingly white. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prevalence of physical impairments (i.e. ADL limitations) is  			 much greater among the privately insured than among the non-privately insured;  			 on the other hand, cognitive impairment is much more prevalent among  			 non-insured disabled elders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 90% of the non-privately insured rely on some level of  			 informal care compared with 77% of the privately insured. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The privately insured are roughly five times more likely to rely  			 exclusively on formal care than are those without private insurance. This  			 finding supports the hypothesis that private insurance may be used to  			 compensate for a lack of available informal support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The majority (70%) of individuals with private LTC insurance  			 primarily uses unskilled services such as home health aides and homemaker  			 services, whereas among the non-insured disabled, nursing care remains the most  			 prevalent Medicare funded home care service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The privately insured receive 14 hours more per week of assistance  			 than do the non-privately insured. Much of this is attributable to the receipt  			 of formal services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very few of the privately insured use Medicare as a payment source  			 for home care services. By contrast, roughly 30% of non-privately insured  			 disabled elders use Medicare as a payment source.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Clearly, LTC insurance benefits are well targeted; they serve those  		truly dependent on on-going care. The vast majority of claimants is satisfied  		with their policies, understand their coverage and find it easy to file claims.  		Because of their LTC benefits, substantial numbers of disabled elderly  		individuals can remain at home instead of being forced to seek institutional  		care. Moreover, the availability of LTC benefits reduces stress among informal  		caregivers and decreases usage of Medicare to fund home health care expenses.  		Finally, for insured individuals, formal care may substitute for some, but not  		most informal care, and the two systems appear to be working together to better  		meet the needs of claimants. Expansion in the private market is likely to lead  		to reductions in public expenditures on long-term care and the insurance is  		likely to continue to help disabled individuals remain in their homes at the  		same time as it maintains and enhances the resiliency of informal support  		networks. </p>
<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>The population of Americans who require or are at risk of requiring help  		with personal care and other daily functional tasks is growing rapidly. This is  		primarily due to the growth rate of the elderly population -- especially those  		aged 85 and older. The proportion of the elderly requiring personal assistance  		ranges from 9 percent of those aged 65 to 69 to well over 50 percent of those  		age 85 and over (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). Projections are that between 1990  		and 2000 alone, the U.S. population aged 65 and older will grow by 12 percent,  		and the population aged 85 and older by 50 percent. This population growth  		among persons at high risk of disability cannot help but create a rising demand  		for long-term care (LTC) services. </p>
<p>Long-term care expenditures (i.e. expenditures on nursing homes and  		related facilities, in-home registered nurse and home health aide visits, and  		other home and community based services) now account for almost twelve percent  		of total personal health expenditures -- a three-fold increase since 1960.  		Among people aged 65 and older, long-term care expenditures account for 28  		percent of personal health expenditures (21 percent for nursing home services  		and 7 percent for home and community-based care). This percentage is especially  		noteworthy given that only one-in-four older Americans with functional  		disabilities reside in nursing homes and related facilities. Among disabled  		elders who continue to reside in the community, two-thirds use no (paid) formal  		long-term care services at all, relying exclusively on the informal help  		provided by family, friends, and neighbors.</p>
<p>Those elders who do require formal long-term care are likely to have to  		rely on out-of-pocket payments. While Medicare finances 55 percent of the acute  		medical expenditures of older Americans, its LTC coverage is limited, covering  		just 18 percent of their long-term care expenditures. By contrast,  		out-of-pocket spending, which represents only 14 percent of medical care  		expenditures for the elderly, accounts for 42 percent of their long-term care  		expenditures. Medicaid finances a much greater share of long-term care services  		than acute care expenditures for persons aged 65 and older (35 percent as  		compared to 4 percent). But elders with long-term care needs who are not cash  		assistance (SSI) eligible can only access Medicaid by "spending-down" -- that  		is, by first using up nearly all of their income and assets to pay for  		care.</p>
<p>As of 1997, the average private pay daily rate for nursing home care was  		$125 and the average nursing home cost approximately $50,000 per year (AARP,  		1998). The average charge for a skilled nursing visit from a registered nurse  		employed by a Medicare certified home health agency was $88 and the average  		charge for a home health aide visit was $58. (AARP, 1997). The high cost of  		formal long-term care services coupled with the continued reliance on  		out-of-pocket payments to cover these costs leaves those elderly needing  		long-term care potentially vulnerable to catastrophic expenditures that can  		rapidly deplete their income and life savings.</p>
<p>Historically, exposure to catastrophic cost risks of this nature has  		stimulated demand for private insurance, expanded public financing -- or both.  		Over the past decade, the potential of private long-term care insurance to  		become a significant source of financing for formal long-term care services has  		been much debated (See: Cohen et al, 1987; Rivlin and Wiener, 1988; Friedland,  		1990; Families USA, 1993; Crown, Capitman, and Leutz, 1992). Many experts in  		long-term care have recommended expansion of public financing for both nursing  		home care and home and community-based services or, at a minimum, the latter.  		(Rivlin and Wiener, 1988; Wiener, Illston, Hanley, 1994). </p>
<p>President Clinton's 1993-94 health reform proposals attempted to expand  		public financing for long-term care. They included a joint federal/state  		sponsored program that would have funded home and community-based long-term  		care services for both middle-income and low-income elderly with severe  		disabilities. For the foreseeable future, however, there appears to be little  		prospect of Congress enacting legislation along these lines. Indeed, during  		1995 and 1996, it seemed highly possible that even the availability of  		Medicaid's means-tested financing for long-term care might soon be cut  		back.</p>
<p>Recent actions suggest that the federal government has now shifted much  		of its focus to private insurance to help address the long-term care problem.  		Despite the partisan discord that has characterized congressional debate about  		Medicare/ Medicaid financing in recent years, agreement was finally reached on  		steps to increase access to private insurance for long-term care. The Health  		Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA a.k.a. the  		"Kennedy-Kassebaum" legislation) that President Clinton signed into law in  		August 1996 included tax incentives for the purchase of long-term care  		insurance for both individual and employer-sponsored groups. </p>
<p>The granting of tax-favored treatment-- whether for charitable  		contributions, mortgage interest deduction, retirement savings, health  		insurance -- and, now, long-term care insurance -- is one way that the federal  		government encourages and rewards taxpayers for voluntarily engaging in  		behaviors that are socially responsible; i.e., that benefit not just  		individuals but society as a whole. Accordingly, financial columnist Jane  		Bryant Quinn counseled babyboomers to "...prick up your ears at the message  		behind the new LTC laws. The government wants you to plan on paying more toward  		your own late-age expenses. If you don't, you'll have to pay more taxes to keep  		the public programs afloat." (Aging: The End Game, <b>Newsweek</b>, September  		30, 1996:53)</p>
<p>Among other things, the "Kennedy-Kassebaum" legislation grants private  		long-term care insurance tax status on par with acute medical insurance. This  		means that individuals with tax-qualified private long-term care insurance  		policies will be able to include private long-term care insurance premiums with  		other deductible medical expenses and will not be subject to income tax on  		benefits paid out under qualified long-term care policies. Most observers  		believe that this legislation is likely to stimulate sales of private long-term  		care insurance policies in coming years.</p>
<p>Finally, in his 1999 state of the union message, the President  		recommended that a new long-term care insurance program be established for  		federal employees. Moreover, in recognition of the financial burden imposed by  		informal caregiving, the President also recommended that a tax credit of up to  		$1,000 per year be available to those caring for disabled relatives. With these  		actions, the federal government is continuing to signal its desire that  		individuals accept personal responsibility for planning and paying for their  		long-term care needs. </p>
<p>Prior to 1985, the private long-term care insurance market barely  		existed. Indeed, the insurance industry was slow to respond because many  		industry experts questioned whether the need for long-term care could be  		considered an "insurable event." By the end of 1998, however, more than 5  		million LTC policies had been sold (HIAA,1998). In the late 1980s and early  		1990s, private long-term care insurance sales grew by more than 20 percent per  		year. These slowed temporarily during 1993-1994, when legislation based on  		President Clinton's health reform plan was under consideration by Congress and  		seemed to have a serious chance of being enacted. Since the demise of the  		health reform effort, however, private long-term care insurance sales have  		rebounded. The individual market is now growing rapidly, as is the employer  		group market. This suggests that more and more elderly and middle-aged  		Americans are becoming aware of their future risk of requiring long-term care  		services as a result of conditions and disabilities that become more prevalent  		at older ages. These "persons at risk" and their families are also realizing  		that coverage of these services by Medicare and other public programs is quite  		limited -- and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Questions remain, however, about whether private long-term care  		insurance represents a "good buy." Proponents of private long-term care  		insurance argue that purchase is the only viable alternative to out-of-pocket  		spending or reliance on informal family caregiving for elders with incomes and  		assets above the means-tested eligibility levels for most publicly-funded  		long-term care service coverage. Critics question both the affordability of  		private long-term care insurance to the target market of middle-aged and  		"young-old" individuals and the value of the product to those who do purchase  		it.</p>
<p>Given anticipated changes in Federal policy with respect to Medicare and  		Medicaid,<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> as well as  		recent tax clarifications for long-term care insurance, it is likely that the  		market will continue to expand. Yet, while there is a growing body of knowledge  		about who buys policies and what motivates them to do so (HIAA, 1992 &amp;  		1995), there has been no systematic study of individuals who are receiving  		benefits under their long-term care insurance policies. On an industry-wide  		basis, no one knows how benefits are being used, whether claimants feel they  		are getting good value for their premiums, and whether patterns of formal and  		informal service use differ for long-term care insurance claimants compared to  		similarly disabled persons without insurance. </p>
<p>As the market for LTC insurance continues to grow, a number of key  		questions about claimants emerge. These include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ol><li>
<p>In what ways do patterns of formal and informal caregiving differ in  			 the presence of long-term care insurance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are claimants satisfied with their insurance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are long-term care insurance benefits affecting claimants' lives  			 as well as those of their primary informal caregivers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a relationship between the types of policies that claimants  			 have and their use of formal and informal care, their level of satisfaction,  			 and the presence of any reported unmet or undermet need? </p>
</li>
</ol><p>Obtaining answers to these questions is important from a public policy  		and regulatory standpoint. Because the vast majority of LTC policies now cover  		significant amounts of home and community-based care, their proliferation in  		the market will have financial and service delivery implications for both the  		formal and informal care networks. This necessarily will affect the level and  		mix of publicly funded long-term care services. In the absence of "hard data"  		about the experience of claimants, it is difficult to develop targeted  		regulatory and consumer protection strategies related to claims issues.  		Finally, if state and Federal governments wish to encourage development of this  		market, it is important that there be adequate information about how the  		product is performing from the perspective of claimants and their families.  		This will assist the government in assessing the future potential of this type  		of insurance.</p>
<p>Such information is also of interest to private insurers, who are trying  		to increase the market for long-term care insurance, and actuaries who are  		responsible for pricing long-term care insurance products. An important  		assumption used in the premium pricing decision relates to the mix of formal  		and informal care that will occur when an individual goes into claim status.  		Often, the only information available to actuaries on a national basis is  		derived from uninsured experience among the general population of disabled  		elders (e.g. 1982, 1984 and 1989 National Long-Term Care Surveys). Information  		from these surveys may not accurately represent experience in an insured  		context. Thus, it is important to determine whether, and in what ways, patterns  		of formal and informal care delivery differ in the presence of long-term care  		insurance. This has implications for the way policies are designed, priced, and  		marketed.</p>
<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this research is to provide basic descriptive statistics  		on disabled private LTC insurance policyholders, who have accessed long-term  		care benefits in the community and to compare such data and findings to  		non-insured disabled community-dwelling elders.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> We intend to:</p>
<ul><li>provide detailed descriptive information on the socio-demographic and  		  service utilization profile of disabled claimants receiving home and  		  community-based care benefits under their LTC insurance policies;</li>
<li>characterize the level and mix of informal and formal support among  		  disabled claimants and compare this to a nationally representative sample of  		  non-privately insured disabled elders living in the community;</li>
<li>identify factors associated with observed differences between the  		  insured and non-insured groups in relation to the utilization of home  		  care;</li>
<li>measure caregiver effort on behalf of home care claimants and compare  		  this to caregiver effort for disabled non-privately insured elders living in  		  the community;</li>
<li>evaluate claimant and caregiver perceptions regarding the value of  		  their LTC policy and estimate the extent of unmet and undermet need; and</li>
<li>discuss the implications of findings on the service delivery system  		  as well as on the design of private and public LTC policies and programs.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. METHOD</a></h2>
<h3>A. Sample</h3>
<p>The project relied on the development of four analytic samples. These  		included: </p>
<ol><li>insured community dwelling disabled elders who are accessing benefits  		  under their LTC insurance policy (Home Care Claimants);</li>
<li>the informal caregivers of privately insured claimants (Informal  		  Caregivers);</li>
<li>a subset of LTC policyholders living in the community who are  		  disabled, but not accessing benefits under their LTC insurance policy  		  (Policyholders); and</li>
<li>a subset of moderately disabled Medicare beneficiaries living in the  		  community who do not have private insurance for long-term care (1994 NLTCS  		  sample).</li>
</ol><p><i><b>Home Care Claimants</b></i></p>
<p>To be included in the claimant sample, individual claimants had to meet  		the following criteria: </p>
<ol><li>They had to be age 65 and over;</li>
<li>They had to be classified as an active claim with at least one  		  payment for home/community-based services; </li>
<li>They had to have a policy that covered both nursing home care and  		  home and community-based services; and, </li>
<li>They had to be living in the community and not in an  		  institution.</li>
</ol><p>We asked each company to provide its total universe of claimants who met  		these criteria. We focused on individuals with "dual-coverage" policies, rather  		than on those with policies covering only institutional care, because roughly  		80% of all policies currently selling in the market cover services in at least  		these two modalities. By doing so, we could assure that study findings would be  		applicable in the future as well as in the present. </p>
<p>Together, these eight companies provided a home care claimant block of  		1,599 eligible individuals. Of these, 750 were removed from the study, leaving  		a "qualified" sample totaling 849 claimants, of whom 82% or 697 participated in  		the study. Most of those removed were either no longer receiving services at  		the time of the interview, were deceased, no longer had their policy, did not  		meet the age criteria, or could not be reached after repeated call  		attempts.</p>
<p><i><b>Informal Caregivers</b></i></p>
<p>We asked home care claimants to identify their primary informal  		caregiver. This was done by asking the claimant to indicate who helped them the  		most with their everyday activities but did not receive monetary payment for  		doing so. The proportion of the claimant population with at least one informal  		caregiver was 77% or 538 claimants. Of the 461 that we reached by telephone,  		424 or 91% participated in the study.</p>
<p><i><b>Long-Term Care Insurance Policyholders</b></i></p>
<p>We interviewed by telephone 670 policyholders (randomly selected from  		non-claimants) to identify the proportion of individual policyholders who may  		be disabled (i.e. have two or more limitations in activities of daily living  		(ADLs) or are cognitively impaired) and yet are not accessing their insurance  		benefits. We achieved a 95% response rate for this sample. Because the  		proportion of disabled non-claiming policyholders was so small, (4 cases) we  		did not draw a sample from every company but rather, from only four of the  		eight participating companies.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>The 1994 National Long-Term Care Sample</b></i></p>
<p>The 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) was designed to collect  		data about the health and function of the Medicare beneficiary population age  		65 and older. The questions were meant to identify persons who had certain  		disabilities or health problems lasting three months or longer. In general,  		individuals who completed a comprehensive community survey were those who had  		at least one chronic limitation in either an instrumental activity of daily  		living (IADL) or in an activity of daily living (ADL). The total 1994 NLTCS  		sample consisted of 4,167 individuals. </p>
<p>Only sub-sets of the claimant sample and the NLTCS sample are used when  		we make comparisons between the privately insured (claimant sample) and the  		non-privately insured (NLTCS sample). In fact, only those individuals who had  		at least two ADL limitations out of six ADLs<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup><b>or</b> who were cognitively impaired  		<b>or</b> who had a primary cognitive diagnosis like Dementia or Alzheimer's  		disease were included in comparative analyses. These are criteria that mirror  		the benefit eligibility criteria commonly used in private LTC insurance  		policies.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> By holding  		the minimum disability threshold constant and limiting our analysis to this  		sub-sample of disabled individuals, we can then make direct comparisons between  		the privately insured sample (i.e. insurance claimants) and the non-privately  		insured sample (i.e. modified 1994 NLTCS sample). After applying these  		criteria, the total sample size of the 1994 NLTCS sub-sample was 1,357. </p>
<h3>B. Data</h3>
<p><i><b>Sources of Information</b></i></p>
<p>Eight of the largest long-term care insurance companies in the U.S.  		participated in the study and contributed a sample of claimants residing in the  		community. These companies also provided data from their administrative and  		claim systems to supplement information collected directly from claimants.  		Finally, claimants identified their primary informal (unpaid) caregiver so that  		they too could be interviewed.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The participating companies included: (1) Aegon; (2) American  		Travellers; (3) Bankers Life and Casualty; (4) CNA Insurance; (5) Fortis  		Long-Term Care; (6) G.E. Capital Assurance; (7) John Hancock; and (8) UNUM.  		Together their claimant blocks represent more than 80% of all open home health  		care claims and nursing home claims.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> These companies also represent diverse market  		segments and policy designs, and employ differing underwriting and claims  		management strategies. </p>
<p>In addition to the information provided by the LTC insurance industry,  		we analyzed information from the 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey (1994  		NLTCS).<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> These data  		allowed us to make comparisons between privately insured and non-privately  		insured disabled elders living in the community. Questions on the claimant  		survey were designed to mirror those on the 1994 NLTCS; this assured that  		accurate comparisons between the privately insured and non-privately insured  		samples could be made.</p>
<p><b><i>Data Collection</i></b></p>
<p>Data from all privately insured home care claimants was gathered via  		in-person interviews conducted by trained nurses and social workers with at  		least two years of geriatric experience. Each interviewer underwent  		comprehensive training to assure inter-rater reliability. Information garnered  		from these interviews was then linked to policy design and claim information  		generated from the administrative systems of the participating insurance  		companies. In 15% of the cases, we conducted phone interviews with claimants  		who either could not or were not willing to be interviewed in their homes. We  		collected information from informal caregivers and from policyholders who were  		not making claims on their policy via telephone interviews. All fieldwork was  		completed between November 1997 and February 1999. It is important to note that  		each completed survey underwent a detailed quality review by home-office staff.  		In some cases, surveys had to be returned to the field either because certain  		data elements were not complete or because of the presence of clinical  		discrepancies. </p>
<h3>C. Response Rates and Ultimate Analytic Samples</h3>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> displays the response rates for the  		claimant and informal caregiver samples who were located and contacted. As  		shown, we achieved high response rates for these analytic samples. The lowest  		response rate for a particular company was 78%, the highest was 92%. There was  		little variation across companies in the response rates of informal caregivers.  		Finally, (although not shown in the table), roughly 95% of all policyholders  		located and contacted agreed to participate in the very short phone screen  		survey. </p>

<p>The next three figures illustrate the extent of disability among  		privately insured claimants. Disability is measured in three ways: (1) the  		number of limitations in activities of daily living; (2) whether or not someone  		is cognitively impaired as measured by their score on the Short Portable Mental  		Status Questionnaire, and (3) whether or not an individual has a cognitive  		diagnosis such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. </p>
<p>Most currently available LTC policies require an individual have at  		least two ADL limitations or be cognitively impaired in order to qualify for  		benefits. All tax-qualified policies have such a requirement. Older and non-tax  		qualified policies do, however, enable an individual to access benefits if LTC  		services were deemed by a physician to be "<i>medically necessary"</i>. As  		shown in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, 79% of current claimants have two or  		more ADL limitations. The average number of ADL limitations is 3.3. Not shown  		in the diagram is the fact that among the eight participating companies, the  		average number of ADL limitations ranged from 2.8 to 3.9.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>

<p>Because companies use different underwriting techniques to identify  		individuals who may be at high risk for becoming cognitively impaired, there is  		a great deal of variation between companies in the cognitive status of  		claimants.

</tr></table><h3>B. Examining the Relationship between Claimant Profiles  		and HIPAA Benefit Eligibility Triggers</h3>
<p>In the HIPAA (i.e. Kennedy-Kassebaum) legislation, long-term care  		insurance policies are tax qualified if access to benefits is limited to (1)  		individuals with at least 2 ADL limitations or (2) individuals who are  		moderately or severely cognitive impaired. Figure 5 shows that 85% of claimants  		met this definition of eligibility at the time of the in-person interview.  		Fifteen percent of claimants were neither impaired in at least two ADLs nor  		were cognitively impaired.</p>
<p>Not shown is the fact that there is significant variation across  		insurance companies: from a low of 5% to a high of 28% who, at the time of the  		in-person interview, did not meet HIPAA benefit-eligibility triggers.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<table title="FIGURE 5: Proportion of Claimants Meeting HIPAA Benefit Triggers at Time of Interview"><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure5" id="figure5">FIGURE 5</a>: Proportion  			 of Claimants Meeting HIPAA Benefit Triggers at Time of  			 Interview</b></font></td>

</tr><tr><td><font><b>SOURCE</b>: 1999 National Claimant  			 Study (n=695). <b>NOTE</b>: To meet HIPAA triggers, one must be disabled in  			 at least 2 ADLs or be cognitively impaired. An ADL disability results when an  			 individual requires either stand-by, cueing or hands-on assistance to perform  			 an activity. Cognitive impairment is measured by the SPMSQ (i.e. 4+ errors) or  			 by the presence of a cognitive diagnosis. </font></td>
</tr></table><p>Given that about one-in-seven claimants were neither functionally nor  		cognitively impaired as defined by HIPAA, an important question arises: Who are  		these people and why are they receiving insurance benefits? As shown in  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, compared to the 85% of claimants who did meet  		HIPAA triggers these 15% were older, more likely to live alone, less likely to  		be married and less likely to have available informal supports. Moreover, the  		majority had one ADL impairment and most also had multiple IADL impairments.  		Finally, 32% required assistance managing medications. An examination of claims  		payment data reveals that the average claims dollars spent per month on those  		not meeting HIPAA benefit eligibility triggers was $1,100 compared to $1,760  		for those who did meet the triggers. </p>
<p>The data clearly indicate that these claimants are frail, disabled and  		in need of long-term care services. Either they met the HIPAA triggers at the  		time that they applied for insurance benefits or are fast on their way to  		becoming eligible. Given that insurers typically reassess home health care  		claimants at two to three month intervals, it is not surprising that some  		individuals improved and were therefore not HIPAA eligible at the time of our  		interview. </p>

<p>It is well known that most long-term care is provided informally by  		family members, typically spouses, daughters and daughters-in-laws. Data  		presented thus far suggests that many privately insured claimants live alone  		and do not have children living nearby. Thus, many may view their LTC policy as  		compensating for the lack of informal (unpaid) support, especially single  		policyholders. Even for those with informal supports, the policy may be  		enabling them to decrease reliance on such support -- an important motivator  		for initial purchase (Cohen and Kumar, 1996).</p>
<p>As <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a> below shows, 23% of claimants rely  		solely on formal (paid) services for their care. In fact, as will be shown  		subsequently, privately insured claimants are about six times more likely to  		rely exclusively on formal care than are non-privately insured disabled elders  		living in the community.</p>
<table title="FIGURE 6: Availability of Informal Support Among Claimants"><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure6" id="figure6">FIGURE 6</a>:  			 Availability of Informal Support Among Claimants</b></font></td>

</tr></table><p>Unlike the acute care population, the long-term care population is  		characterized by its use of and dependence on personal care services provided  		by paraprofessionals. These include home health aide services, homemaker and  		companion services, and personal care aides. <a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>  		shows that home health aides provide most of the formal care given to  		claimants; two-in-three claimants receive care from this type of service  		provider. Noteworthy is the fact that relatively few claimants are receiving  		services provided by nurses. This suggests that, for the most part, long-term  		care insurance is not paying for skilled nursing services.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>

</tr><tr><td><font><b>SOURCE</b>: 1999 National Claimant  			 Study (n=695). </font></td>
</tr></table><p>Given the functional and cognitive profile of these claimants, it is  		clear that they require a great deal of stand-by or hands-on assistance to  		perform the ADLs. Moreover, to continue living independently in the community,  		they also need assistance with more complicated tasks like shopping for  		groceries, preparing meals, doing light housework, and more (IADLs).  		<a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a> shows that on average, these individuals  		receive 59 hours of such care a week -- roughly 8 hours a day of assistance.  		Insurance pays for about 35 hours per week or 5 hours per day of care, about  		60% of the total care received by claimants.</p>
<p>An analysis of the data reveals that formal caregivers split their  		assistance fairly evenly between ADL and IADL activities. On the other hand,  		informal caregivers generally provide greater amounts of IADL assistance and  		less ADL assistance; 1.3 hours per day are devoted to ADL assistance compared  		to 2 hours per day for IADL activities. Not shown is the fact that roughly 10%  		of the sample receives round the clock care -- 24 hours per day seven days a  		week -- most of it stand-by assistance.</p>
<p>By obtaining the service schedules of formal providers, we determined  		how many hours per week they were spending in the homes of claimants.  		<a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a> focused on the number of hours of ADL and IADL  		assistance that was provided to claimants. The claimant provided this  		information. <a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a> shows the relationship between the  		number of care hours provided and the number of hours available (i.e. the  		number of hours that formal service providers were in the homes of claimants).  		As shown on the page that follows, over the course of a week, formal service  		providers spent an average of 44 hours in the homes of claimants of which 36  		hours were spent on ADL and IADL assistance. This suggests that about 8 hours a  		week, or about 18% of the time, were spent on non-ADL/IADL activities. </p>

</tr></table><p>This is an important finding. As will be shown in a subsequent section,  		a sizeable minority of claimants indicates that they have unmet or undermet ADL  		and IADL needs. In other words, some claimants believe that they are not  		getting enough of the care that they think they need. This data suggests that  		the problem might not be that caregivers don't spend enough time with these  		claimants, but rather that they don't spend the right kind of time with  		them.</p>

</tr></table><h3>D. Benefits paid under Insurance Contracts and Insurance  		Policy Designs</h3>
<p>Clearly, claimants are receiving a substantial number of hours of  		assistance from formal caregivers. Much of this care is paid for by insurance  		benefits. In fact, for more than 70% of claimants, insurance pays all of the  		costs of care. <a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a> shows that the average monthly  		insurance benefit paid to claimants is $1,527. How does this compare to the  		primary public payer of home and community-based care for disabled elders --  		the Medicaid waiver program? As shown, the Medicaid waiver program pays an  		average of about $450 per month for care.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> This suggests that for every dollar spent on  		disabled elders in the waiver program, about three and one-half dollars are  		spent on disabled long-term care insurance claimants.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Not shown in the diagram is the fact that as of the interview date, this  		sample of claimants had already used an average of $18,000 in insurance  		benefits per person. Given that most of these individuals have policies  		covering up to about four years of care at around $80 per day -- about $112,000  		in available benefits -- these individuals have thus far used up less than 20%  		of their benefits. (See <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>). The range in  		<b>monthly</b> benefit payments across the companies is from a low of $768 to a  		high of $2,200.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> summarizes the typical home care policy  		design features of this study's claimants. In general, there are three types of  		benefit designs:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Indemnity model</b>, which pays a fixed level benefit when an  			 individual becomes disabled and long-term care expenses are incurred. The  			 payment may be larger or smaller than the actual cost of services and bears no  			 direct relationship to such expenses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reimbursement model</b>, which reimburses costs of covered  			 services for eligible individuals <b>up to</b> a maximum daily amount. In this  			 model, insurance benefits are directly related to the incurred long-term care  			 costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Disability model</b>, which pays benefits directly to the insured  			 when the individual becomes disabled, whether or not long-term care expenses  			 are incurred. The insured has the freedom to spend the disability payment on  			 whatever services he/she deems appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The most conservative -- although from a claims standpoint less  		predictable -- of these policy designs is the reimbursement model. Almost all  		of the home care benefits in the policies held by these claimants are paid on a  		reimbursement basis (86%). About 10% of claimants access benefits through a  		disability policy design.</p>
<p>The average daily benefit for home care coverage in the sample is $80.  		Given that most of the visits are home health aides, which typically cost less  		than $60 per visit, this represents a more than adequate daily reimbursement.  		It is also noteworthy that 34% of the claimants have policies that include some  		level of inflation protection. About 40% are eligible to receive over $100 per  		day in benefits for reimbursed home care benefits. </p>
<p>Finally, more than half of the claimants have policies that cover the  		equivalent of daily care for a three-year period. Among the Medicare home  		health population, fewer than 20% actually spend more than two years receiving  		home health care services.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> Thus, the duration of care covered by these  		policies will likely capture the duration of use for most of these  		individuals.</p>

</tr></table><p>Although about half of the policies held by this sample of claimants  		have very low elimination periods (i.e. less than 20 days), most policies now  		selling on the market have longer elimination periods. Through policy design  		changes, insurers are trying to target benefits to individuals with chronic,  		rather than post-acute and short-term, care needs. </p>
<h3>E. Claimant Satisfaction with Insurance Policy and  		Insurance Company</h3>
<p>The average age of individuals who purchase private long-term care  		insurance is 68 years. Yet, the average age of claimants is closer to age 80.  		This means that most current long-term care insurance policyholders can expect  		to hold their policy for 10 or more years before they might actually need to  		access benefits.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup>  		During this premium payment period, the primary <i>"benefit"</i> of a policy is  		psychic in nature: individuals derive utility from knowing that the certain  		premium they pay reduces the uncertainty and ultimate financial risk they might  		face in the absence of a policy. The extent to which policyholders are  		satisfied with this <i>"psychic benefit"</i> is difficult to gauge. A way to  		more concretely evaluate consumer satisfaction is to interview individuals who  		require benefits under their policy. In the sections that follow, we focus on  		satisfaction from two perspectives: (1) that of the claimant and (2) that of  		the primary informal caregiver. </p>
<p>We asked claimants a series of questions related to general satisfaction  		with their insurance policy as well as with various insurer claims management  		practices. The results are summarized in <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>. The  		vast majority of claimants (86%) is satisfied with their policy; slightly less  		than two-in-three are very satisfied with their policy. Individuals with  		disability payment policies tended to be more satisfied than were those with  		other policy designs.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup>  		The level of daily benefit or duration of coverage did not affect levels of  		satisfaction.</p>
<table title="FIGURE 12: Level of Satisfaction with Long-Term Care Insurance Policy"><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure12" id="figure12">FIGURE 12</a>: Level of  			 Satisfaction with Long-Term Care Insurance Policy</b></font></td>

</tr></table><p>Given the relatively complex nature of long-term care insurance  		contracts, an issue of concern to consumer groups and the industry alike is  		whether or not claimants actually understand what they are buying. Claimants  		were asked whether they had any problems understanding what was and was not  		covered by their policy. The vast majority (75%) had no difficulty  		understanding what their policy covered; the other 25% had some difficulty.  		Those with disability policy designs were less likely to indicate a problem  		understanding their coverage. It follows that insurers must continue to work  		with agents and policyholders to minimize and confusion and false expectations  		that could arise at claim time.</p>
<p>Most long-term care insurance policies reimburse expenses incurred for  		direct service costs, or pay a flat benefit when service costs are incurred.  		This means that bills must be sent to the insurer in order to process a  		claim.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> One might  		imagine that such a process could be cumbersome, especially for policyholders  		suffering from dementia or other cognitive ailments. </p>
<p>We asked claimants whether it was difficult for them to file their claim  		and obtain benefits. <a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a> shows that most  		individuals (70%) found the process to be easy. On the other hand, close to  		one-in-three claimants did find the process to be somewhat difficult. Across  		the companies, between 55% and 80% found the claims filing process to be  		easy.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup> Again, this  		finding suggests that insurers should continue to refine and simplify their  		claims handling procedures.</p>

About 10% of claimants felt their disagreement was not resolved satisfactorily.  		</p>
<p>Again, the findings varied greatly from company to company. The  		proportion of claimants who indicated that they had a disagreement with the  		insurer at claim time ranged by company from a low of 8% to a high of  		30%.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Finally, claimants responded to a question about actions that their  		insurance company might have taken but didn't, to help them when they needed  		benefits. This was an open-ended question. As shown on the next page, about  		three in four respondents felt there was nothing else that the insurance  		company should have done. Nineteen percent felt that the company could have  		provided additional customer support, claims processing, and more advice about  		the policy itself.</p>
<p>An important issue is whether or not, at the time of initial policy  		purchase, individuals buy enough benefits to cover their costs of care. We  		asked claimants whether they believed they purchased enough home care coverage,  		and whether there were additional services they thought they needed but that  		were not covered by their policy. <a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a> indicates  		that about three in four claimants felt that they had purchased enough home  		care coverage. In terms of the additional services that they wanted, slightly  		less than 10% indicated they wished their policy covered transportation and  		certain equipment and supplies. Another 12% provided a general answer of "more  		coverage". Many of these respondents also wished that their policy covered a  		greater proportion of care costs.</p>

<p>We asked claimants and informal caregivers a series of questions to  		gauge their perceptions about how having a long-term care insurance policy has  		influenced both the level and type of care received (for claimants) and  		provided (by informal caregivers). <a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a> displays  		the responses of claimants to three questions:</p>

</li>
<li>

</tr><tr><td><font><b>SOURCE</b>: 1999 National Claimant  			 Study (n=675).</font></td>
</tr></table><p>For claimants, the greatest impact of receiving insurance benefits is on  		their level of paid care; only 40% indicate that in the absence of their policy  		they would be able to afford their current level of services. About 57% thought  		that they would have to consume fewer hours of paid care. Thus, from their  		perspective, the lack of insurance would result in greater levels of unmet or  		undermet need. About half of the claimants indicated that they would have to  		rely more on informal supports. It is unclear from these data alone whether  		such informal supports would be able to compensate for the loss associated with  		lower levels of formal (paid) care.</p>
<p>We asked a similar, although more detailed, set of questions to informal  		caregivers.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> We  		inquired as to whether:</p>
<ol><li>they provide more, less or the same amount of care given that  		  insurance benefits are being paid to the claimant;</li>
<li>in the absence of the claimant's policy would they provide more, less  		  or the same amount of care as they currently provide; and</li>
<li>in the presence of policy benefits, the nature of the care they  		  provide has changed, and if so, how.</li>
</ol><p><a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a> shows that in the presence of  		insurance benefits, roughly two-in-three informal caregivers have not reduced  		the level of care that they provide. In fact, half of the caregivers have not  		changed the amount of care they provide at all. This finding suggests that for  		most informal caregivers, formal care does not substitute for informal care.  		With that said, however, the picture is not crystal clear: about one-in three  		did indicate that they now provide less informal care. Among all caregivers, a  		slight majority (52%) indicated that if the policy were not paying benefits  		they would increase the level of informal care that they provide.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is also noteworthy that 15% informal caregivers suggested that they  		provide more informal care now that insurance benefits are being received and  		more formal care provided. This may reflect the fact that the situation of the  		claimant may have deteriorated since the onset of benefit payments so that the  		informal caregiver has had to increase the amount of care they provide. It may  		also be the case that the presence of insurance to finance formal care has  		enabled them to provide more care rather than less. This suggests that in some  		instances, formal care may be a complementary rather than substitute service  		for informal caregiving.</p>
<p>We asked informal caregivers whether the presence of insurance benefits  		has changed the nature of the care that they provide. Most (72%), indicated  		that it had not. For those informal caregivers who indicated that they had  		changed the type of care that they provide, most show a reduction in ADL and  		IADL assistance and an increase in companionship services (See  		<a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a>).</p>

<p>One would have thought that the need to monitor formal caregivers or to  		interact with the insurer as well as with providers might have led to increased  		stress among many informal caregivers. Such is not the case. Only 4% of  		informal caregivers indicate that the presence of insurance actually increased  		stress levels. Finally, one-quarter of informal caregivers indicate that the  		insurance had no effect on their stress level.

</tr></table><p>A great deal of research has focused on whether the use of formal home  		care services delays or prevents the use of costly institutional care like  		nursing home care (See: Weissert, 1985; Weissert et al, 1988; Garber &amp;  		MaCurdy, 1989; Shapiro and Tate, 1989 Green et al, 1993; Wolf, 1997; Kane  		1998.) Most of this research suggests that, unless very carefully targeted,  		home care rarely prevents someone from using nursing home care. Instead, there  		is a growing consensus that home care serves a distinct population that differs  		in relevant respects from the nursing home population. Yet, the decision to  		seek institutional care is a complicated one involving a myriad of factors,  		many of which cannot be adequately captured even by the most sophisticated  		multivariate modeling. </p>
<p>Because this is such an important issue, we decided to approach it from  		a somewhat different perspective. Rather than model the characteristics of  		individuals to determine potential overlap with the nursing home population, we  		focus on <b><i>potential service-seeking behaviors</i></b>. In other words, in  		our survey of home care claimants, we asked both the claimant and the informal  		caregiver whether or not, in the absence of the insurance policy, the disabled  		claimant would be able to remain living at home. This provides an indication of  		whether or not the individual would be able to continue living independently in  		the community. <a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a> shows that among both  		claimants and informal caregivers, about half indicated that in the absence of  		the private insurance, they would have to seek institutional alternatives.</p>
<p>An important question is whether or not there is agreement between the  		claimant and his/her informal caregiver. Our analysis suggests that in 31% of  		the cases, both the claimant and their informal caregiver agreed that  		institutional alternatives would be needed in the absence of a policy. In 18%  		of the cases the informal caregiver felt that the claimant would need  		institutional care and the claimant disagreed, whereas in 9% the claimant felt  		they would need institutional care and the informal caregiver disagreed. Thus,  		it appears that at a minimum somewhere between 30% and 50% of claimants would  		likely need to seriously examine institutional alternatives in the absence of  		their insurance benefits.</p>

</tr></table><h3>G. Levels of Met and Unmet Need</h3>
<p>Much of the current research on long-term care is focused on  		characterizing the disabled population, identifying the type and level of  		services needed and used, and estimating public and private expenditures on  		care. Given the development of both longitudinal and cross-sectional databases,  		researchers have also tracked trends in disability rates and service use over  		time. Yet, there has been almost no examination of how well disabled  		individuals actually function in the community. With the recent increase in  		home care providers and both public and private spending on home care, one  		might assume that the current structure of the health care finance and delivery  		system is adequately responding to the care needs of disabled elders living at  		home. However, this may not be the case. In the section that follows, we  		examine whether or not claimants perceive their needs to be met by the formal  		and informal service system. We focus on whether needs are <b>Unmet</b> or  		<b>Underme</b>t. These are defined as follows:</p>
<ol><li>An <b>Unmet Need</b> is present when a claimant receives no ADL or  		  IADL assistance but feels that they could use help; </li>
<li>An <b>Undermet Need</b> is present when a claimant receives  		  assistance performing a particular activity but indicates that they could use  		  more help or believes that they had to wait too long to receive the help. </li>
</ol><p>The presence of a reported <b>Unmet Need</b> may reflect individuals'  		lack of comfort performing a particular ADL, their unwillingness to use  		available care, or their inability to access the type of care that they want or  		need. It may also reflect the lack of responsiveness of the formal service  		system to client needs. </p>
<p>In contrast, the presence of an <b>Undermet need</b> may reflect the  		fact that caregivers are not available in a timely manner. This can result from  		scheduling difficulties or because, once in the home, caregivers are not  		providing the care when it is needed. Additionally, it may be that caregivers  		do not provide an adequate level of care either because of quality or  		coordination issues. </p>
<p><a href="#figure23">Figure 23</a> shows that for the vast majority of  		claimants, their needs are being met by the service system. In total, 35% of  		claimants report an unmet or undermet need in at least one ADL or IADL  		activity. Many of these same individuals also report that their policy is not  		meeting their current care needs.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#figure24">Figure 24</a> shows the relationship between the  		number of ADL limitations and the proportion reporting unmet and undermet  		needs. As the number of ADL limitations increases, the probability of reporting  		an unmet need declines. Put another way, the more disabled are getting their  		needs met. Regarding undermet needs, the exact opposite pattern emerges: those  		with greater disability also report more undermet need. This may reflect the  		difficulty of scheduling multiple caregivers who also have to provide service  		to individuals with multiple needs.</p>
<p>The presence of unmet and undermet need gives rise to a key question:  		Are caregivers present in the homes of claimants long enough to meet their  		needs? A review of service schedules reveals that, on average, those reporting  		unmet ADL needs receive 12 hours a week of formal ADL care in spite of the fact  		that caregivers are present in their homes for up to 30 hours a week. Put  		simply, care is available but not being fully utilized or provided. </p>
<p>A somewhat different picture emerges for those reporting undermet ADL  		needs. Here individuals who receive more hours of ADL assistance are also more  		likely to report greater undermet need. This is particularly true for  		individuals who rely more on informal rather than formal caregivers.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> This suggests that when  		multiple caregivers are involved in the care of an individual, clearly  		delineated lines of responsibility may be particularly important in assuring  		that needs are met. One implication of these findings is that training informal  		caregivers may better prepare them to respond to the multiple needs of their  		disabled care receivers. </p>
<p>Finally, policy design parameters such as daily benefit amount, duration  		of coverage, or inflation protection did not influence whether or not an  		individual reported unmet or undermet needs. The disability policy design was,  		however, associated with lower levels of reported unmet and undermet  		need.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Clearly, long-term care insurance is succeeding in bringing formal  		caregivers into the homes of disabled elders, allowing many to remain in the  		community. Many rely solely on the insurance to provide access to care. The  		majority of claimants do not report unmet or undermet needs. Yet problems with  		service availability, scheduling, continuity and coordination of caregivers,  		claimant preference and the quality of caregivers all contribute to a sizeable  		minority reporting unmet and undermet needs.</p>
<h3>H. Comparing Privately Insured and Non-Privately Insured  		Community-Dwelling Disabled Elders</h3>
<p><i><b>Socio-Demographic Characteristics</b></i></p>
<p>A primary purpose of this study is to compare privately insured disabled  		elders, most of whom receive benefits under their LTC policies, to disabled  		elders who do not have private insurance protection. Information on this latter  		group is available from the 1994 NLTCS. But the criterion for inclusion in the  		1994 NLTCS, a limitation in one or more IADLs or ADLs, is more liberal than the  		criteria for inclusion in the privately insured claimant sample -- service use  		among individuals with two or more ADL limitations or cognitive impairment. To  		enable meaningful, direct comparisons of the two populations, we need to make  		the two samples roughly comparable. We do this by applying the same minimum  		disability threshold to both the 1994 NLTCS and the 1998 privately insured  		sample and by including in the claimant sample policyholders who may be  		disabled in two or more ADLs or may be cognitively impaired but not yet making  		a claim on their policy. </p>
<p>The criteria that are applied to individuals in both samples include  		being:</p>
<ol><li>disabled in at least two out of six activities of daily living that  		  require some level of human assistance;<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup><b>or</b></li>
<li>cognitively impaired as measured by the Short Portable Mental Status  		  Questionnaire (SPMSQ);<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup><b>or</b></li>
<li>diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.</li>

</tr></table><p>Once these minimum disability selection criteria are applied, the  		samples can then be compared one to the other on all dimensions related to  		formal and informal service use. All subsequent analyses are based on  		sub-samples that reflect this underlying minimum disability threshold. The  		NLTCS sub-sample is comprised of 1357 individuals (out of 4,167) and the  		claimant sub-sample is comprised of 581 individuals (out of 691).  		<a href="#figure25">Figure 25</a> shows the major <b>differences</b> between  		the socio-demographic profile of privately insured and non-privately insured  		disabled elders. </p>
<p>Clearly, there are stark differences between the two groups on some  		variables but there are also similarities on others. For example, both groups  		are primarily female (66%), are roughly the same age (mean of 79 years) and  		currently not married -- 52% of the privately insured and 56% of the  		non-privately insured. Disabled elders with private insurance are more likely  		to live alone and not have children living nearby. They are also four times  		more likely to have some college education, eight times more likely to have  		incomes greater than $30,000, and are overwhelmingly white. Because the  		privately insured are less likely to have children or potential caregivers  		living with them or nearby, it is likely that they may view future LTC policy  		benefits as compensation for the unavailability of informal supports. </p>
<p><i><b>Disability Status</b></i></p>
<p>The common measures of functional status -- ADLs and IADLs -- are used  		to compare the functional status of the two samples (See <a href="#figure26">Figure 26</a> below). As shown, the privately insured sample  		has more functional limitations than does the non-privately insured sample: 3.8  		ADL and 7.3 IADL limitations compared to an average of 2.8 ADL and 5.8 IADL  		limitations. Not shown in the figure is the fact that these privately insured  		individuals have been ADL dependent for an average of about 2 years, whereas  		the non-insured individuals have been ADL dependent for closer to 3 years.</p>

</tr></table><p>Although not shown in the figure, the privately insured not only have a  		greater number of ADL dependencies, but also require more intensive care. In  		general there are two types of care to compensate for ADL dependency: (1)  		cueing or stand-by assistance and (2) hands-on assistance. Our analysis showed  		that for the most common ADL losses (e.g. bathing and dressing), the privately  		insured sample needs much greater hands-on assistance than does the  		non-privately insured sample. This suggests a higher level of need among the  		privately insured.</p>
<p>The biggest difference in disability between the two populations relates  		to cognitive impairment. As shown in <a href="#figure27">Figure 27</a>,  		disabled individuals without private insurance are about 1.4 times more likely  		to be cognitively impaired than are those with private insurance. In fact, the  		median number of SPMSQ errors for the privately insured sample is 2.0, whereas  		for the non-privately insured sample, the figure is 4.0.</p>

<p>The differences are striking. The privately insured are much more likely  		to be physically impaired, while the non-insured are much more likely to suffer  		cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that either:</p>
<ol><li>Those with private insurance who are cognitively impaired are less  		  likely to be observed in the community because they have fewer available  		  supports to care for them; or, </li>

Still, spouses  		represent the single largest category of informal caregiver for both groups.  		This finding suggests that where formal care does substitute for informal care,  		the substitution is selective; that is, it appears as if the formal care  		financed by insurance benefits may substitute for the care provided by adult  		children but not necessarily for the care provided by a spouse. This accords  		with previous research indicating that a primary motivation for the purchase of  		private LTC insurance is to "avoid being a burden on family members" (Cohen and  		Kumar, 1995). Data here suggests that the family members focused on are adult  		children, typically daughters and daughters-in-law.</p>
<p>Both public and private insurance programs are designed to pay for a  		variety of services in the community, including home health aide services,  		nursing care, personal care attendants, and homemakers. While most private LTC  		insurance covers all these services, public programs may be somewhat more  		restrictive. It is important to note that for the non-privately insured, the  		only specific home care utilization information available in the 1994 NLTCS is  		for Medicare-reimbursed services. We do not have information about specific  		services that are funded by Medicaid or are purchased privately. We do know,  		however, the payment sources for all formal care service.

<p><a href="#figure31">Figure 31</a> shows that the majority (70%) of  		individuals with private LTC insurance uses unskilled services, such as home  		health aides and homemaker services.

<p>While we cannot discern payment sources for each particular home care  		service for the two samples, we can identify the payment source for formal care  		as a whole and thereby compare the distribution of payment sources for home  		care services. As a starting point, it is important to remember that virtually  		all individuals in the privately insured sample have LTC policies, and the  		majority (more than 70%) do not pay anything out-of-pocket for formal care  		services. We found that Medicare is not a particularly important payment source  		for the privately insured, in contrast to the non-privately insured where  		roughly 30% of disabled elders use Medicare as a payment source for home care  		services (<a href="#figure33">Figure 33</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Medicaid payments play no role in financing the long-term care needs of  		the privately insured population. This is not surprising given the income  		profile of this population. A small percentage of the insured population does  		use additional insurance -- primarily Medicare Supplement policies -- to pay  		for certain types of home care services. In particular, it appears that such  		insurance is used to pay for the costs of nursing services.</p>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>Without question, the presence of long-term care insurance has increased  		the amount of hands-on and stand-by ADL and IADL assistance to disabled  		claimants. For many, the ability to access formal care services through their  		long-term care policies is what enables them to remain at home. This is because  		a disproportionate number of claimants have no available informal support  		services. Even among claimants with informal supports, the availability of  		insurance benefits has not led to a <i>"breakdown"</i> in informal caregiving  		by primary caregivers. On the contrary, most primary informal caregivers have  		not decreased the amount of care that they provide to their disabled relatives.  		For those who have, they indicate that they are now able to spend time "just  		being together" rather than providing direct services. This most likely  		reflects the type of relationship that existed prior to the claimant becoming  		disabled. Not surprisingly, informal caregivers overwhelmingly supported the  		proposition that having long-term care insurance pay for formal care has  		reduced the stress associated with informal caregiving. Taken together, these  		findings suggest that in the private insurance context, formal care may  		substitute for some, but not most informal care, and that the two systems  		appear to be working in tandem to meet the needs of claimants. </p>
<p>About half of claimants and informal caregivers indicated that in the  		absence of insurance benefits, institutional alternatives would likely be  		sought. Typically, claimants felt that they would have to enter an assisted  		living facility or a nursing home if they could no longer access their  		benefits. This is a particularly important finding and suggests that as more  		individuals purchase policies, the demand for institutional care may be delayed  		or actually diminished. From the point of view of companies marketing these  		products, the policies are doing what they are supposed to: enabling people to  		live independently in their homes for as long as possible. The challenge is to  		assure that the formal service system is able to respond to the growing demand  		for services. </p>
<p>Findings also suggest that while having private insurance has enabled  		claimants to receive care in their homes, problems exist with the way that it  		is being delivered and used. Put simply, it appears that, even with insurance,  		disabled claimants are reluctant to ask for help with specific -- and often  		more personal -- activities of daily living. Thus, formal caregivers may be in  		the homes of disabled claimants who refuse to ask for help, even when they feel  		it is needed. Alternatively, it is important to note that it is extremely  		difficult to monitor what actually happens when these caregivers, most of whom  		are paraprofessionals, work with disabled elders. Data suggests that some of  		these caregivers are not providing services to respond to specific types of  		claimant needs, even as other needs are being met.</p>
<p>When multiple formal and informal caregivers are involved in the care of  		a claimant, issues related to undermet need are more likely to arise. This can  		occur because of a lack of coordination of service schedules or because of  		unclear lines of responsibility between caregivers. Moreover, in some cases it  		is difficult to coordinate the service schedules of providers with the care  		expectations of claimants. Finally, in some cases, the actual care provided by  		formal and informal providers may not be perceived to be adequate by the  		claimant.</p>
<p>These issues all suggest that claimants could benefit from care  		coordination or care management services. Over the past few years, more  		policies do cover such services. In some cases, the insurance company pays for  		them as an administrative expense. In other cases, the cost of these services  		is charged to the policyholder's benefit account. Either way, there is a  		growing recognition that working with and navigating the formal service  		delivery system presents unique challenges to disabled claimants and their  		families. As insurers begin to differentiate themselves on a customer-service  		rather than product basis, it will become increasingly important to work with  		families to coordinate and manage the formal and informal service delivery  		system.</p>
<p>Another implication relates to actual policy design. Most policies have  		maximum daily limits on benefits. However, given the nature of service  		schedules, it is possible that an individual incurs no or low expenses on  		certain days and relatively high expenses on other days. In some cases, these  		expenses may exceed the established daily benefit cap. To accommodate the  		reality of variable service schedules, insurers may want to move away from  		daily benefit caps or budgets, toward weekly or monthly benefit budgets. A  		number of insurers are already experimenting with this promising approach.  		Results from this study suggest that as more companies begin to move in this  		direction, the reported amount of undermet need should decline.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of claimants are satisfied with their policy  		and with their interaction with the insurance company. Given that most  		companies are only beginning to gain experience in managing claims, this is a  		particularly positive finding. Still, there was a sizeable minority of  		claimants who felt that the insurance companies could be doing more on their  		behalf. In particular there was a sense among some that companies needed to  		improve customer service, provide more advice about how to use policy  		benefits,<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> and process  		claims more efficiently. Also, companies need to continue to invest in their  		technological capacities to assure that claims processing can occur rapidly and  		accurately. </p>
<p>Roughly one-third of claimants felt that they had not purchased enough  		home care benefits. Given that most policies cover three to four years of care,  		and the average claimant has been receiving benefits for slightly more than a  		year, this deficiency is related to the daily benefit amount chosen at the time  		of purchase. While this does not represent an inherent flaw in insurance policy  		design, it does suggest that these claimants may not have had enough  		information on the actual costs of care that they might incur. (The issue is  		not related to affordability. Income level was not related to whether or not  		claimants' felt that they had purchased enough home care coverage.) This  		finding may also be a response to the actual effect of voluntary coinsurance.  		The implication is that additional consumer education is needed to assure that  		at the time of purchase, individuals have an understanding of the relationship  		between benefit amounts and costs of care. </p>
<p>Long-term care insurance benefits are well targeted. The vast majority  		of individuals has significant ADL dependencies or is cognitively impaired.  		More than half has over four ADL limitations. Even those, who at the time of  		the interview, did not meet HIPAA benefit eligibility triggers were either  		eligible at the time that they applied for benefits or were likely to become  		eligible in the very near future. Compared to other claimants, those not  		meeting HIPAA triggers are older and much less likely to have informal supports  		available. Most also have at least one ADL limitation and multiple IADL  		limitations including an inability to manage medications. Their profile  		characterizes what most professionals would consider to be a <i>"long-term care  		eligible"</i> population. </p>
<p>Given the fact that even among chronically disabled elders there is a  		great deal of change in functioning over time, it is not surprising that a  		"snapshot" reveals some individuals who are not HIPAA eligible. Insurers  		conduct reassessments of home care claimants only intermittently. Moreover, few  		if any of these individuals appeared to be perpetrating fraud; the need for  		assistance was present in almost all cases. Finally, some of the claimants may  		be benefit eligible from "grandfathered" policies that include medical  		necessity as a benefit trigger. Thus, it appears that while not perfect, the  		HIPAA triggers are indeed targeting benefits to the appropriate individuals.  		From a consumer protection standpoint, the standardization of benefit triggers  		and resultant reduction in consumer confusion must be weighed against the fact  		that any trigger will, at the margin, exclude some small number of individuals  		who need services. </p>
<p>The population of claimants differs in many important respects from the  		non-privately insured disabled population. Even so, there are a number of  		observations about patterns of formal and informal support among claimants that  		do have public policy implications. First, there is a very low rate of Medicare  		home health usage among the privately insured. Second, individuals with  		disability policy designs were more satisfied with their insurance and had  		fewer reported unmet and undermet needs. At the very least this suggests that  		programs designed to enhance consumer autonomy may be particularly effective in  		meeting client need. Finally, the lack of consumer fraud suggests that it is  		possible to establish measurable benefit triggers that most individuals can  		understand and adhere to. The notion that privately insured disabled elders are  		eager to access their insurance benefits and use them as quickly as possible is  		not borne out by the data; most claimants are not using their maximum daily  		benefit amount on home care. Together the combination of benefit design  		parameters (e.g. benefit caps and limits) and consumer preferences (i.e. desire  		to use both informal and formal care for personal care activities) assures that  		in the privately insured context moral hazard is minimized. </p>
<p>As the market continues to grow and mature, a new wave of claimants will  		begin to access benefits. Given the changes in the service delivery system as  		well as the innovations in policy designs, new patterns of service utilization  		will likely emerge. Still, some facets of these patterns will remain the same.  		Expansion in the private market is likely to lead to reductions in public  		expenditures on long-term care and the insurance is likely to continue to help  		disabled individuals remain in their homes at the same time as it maintains and  		enhances the resiliency of informal support networks.</p>

<h2><a name="App1" id="App1">APPENDIX 1: QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF FOUR FAMILIES  		USING THEIR LTC BENEFITS</a></h2>
<h3>Case #1: Mr. and Mrs. Adams</h3>
<p>Before Mr. Adams, age 77, had a stroke and developed severe knee  		problems, he and his wife were living comfortably in retirement. Due to his  		deteriorating health, the family quickly sold their business and decided to  		drastically change their living situation. The couple now lives in a small  		first floor apartment in a suburb of Boston.</p>
<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Adams were present for the in-person interview. Though  		Mr. Adams passed the mental status questionnaire, he did become quite confused  		during the interview. His ADL limitations were bathing, dressing, transferring,  		toileting and continence. He also needed assistance in all IADLs.</p>
<p>Paid help is in the home each night for nine hours so that Mrs. Adams,  		age 74, can get some sleep. Mr. Adams is a fairly large man and his wife, who  		is quite small, takes care of the majority of his needs during the day. A  		cleaning person also comes in weekly to do housework and laundry.</p>
<p>Both husband and wife state they are satisfied with the policy but need  		additional help. They can't afford help during the day and state they  		desperately need it. It appears that long-term care insurance benefits make the  		difference in Mr. Adams' ability to remain at home. It is a much needed  		supplement to, rather than a replacement for, informal care-giving. Mrs. Adams  		stated that they would not be able to afford the amount of paid care they are  		currently receiving and Mr. Adams would need to seek assisted living care if  		they did not have the long-term care insurance benefit.</p>
<p>I then spoke privately with Mrs. Adams about how she is coping with the  		situation. Though they have six children, five of which are close by, she  		refuses to accept help from them stating they have their own lives and children  		to take care of. Mrs. Adams stated that she is doing "all right, but I'm very  		tired". Even with the help during the night she estimated that her sleep is  		interrupted five times each night. Mrs. Adams stated that it doesn't really  		matter how she feels because he is her husband and needs the help. She actually  		stated it is better this way than if it was her that was ill because she  		doesn't think he would be able to take care of both of them. Mrs. Adams did say  		that privacy is an issue, as the only time Mrs. Adams gets to herself is when  		she does weekly grocery shopping.</p>
<p>While discussing the role of the long-term care insurance benefits, Mrs.  		Adams said that having it in place definitely decreases the amount of stress  		and emotional difficulty she has with providing care for her husband. Though  		she stated that the amount of care she provides has increased since the  		benefits began, Mrs. Adams explained that while the paid help remains the same,  		over time her husband's health continues to worsen and she must compensate with  		more assistance.</p>
<p>In summary, Mr. and Mrs. Adams are very glad to have their long-term  		care benefits. Though Mrs. Adams still does a large amount of the care giving,  		the paid help is the supplement needed to keep the couple living in their own  		home.</p>
<h3>Case #2: Mrs. Collins and her daughter-in-law, Jane</h3>
<p>Mrs. Collins is an 81-year-old widow with one son and daughter-in-law  		who live fifty miles away. Mrs. Collins suffers from dementia and was,  		therefore, unable to participate in the interview. This interview was conducted  		over the phone with her daughter-in-law, Jane. </p>
<p>Jane describes her mother-in-law as a person who refuses to acknowledge  		any physical limitations. Because of this, Mrs. Collins refuses to use a  		much-needed walker as well as physical assistance with most ADLs. For example,  		Mrs. Collins insists on dressing herself. She usually puts on soiled clothes  		that are inappropriate for the time of year. The only activity of daily living  		with which she allows help is bathing. She does require and accepts help with  		all IADLs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Collins receives the majority of her help from a personal care  		attendant, five hours per day, seven days per week. Jane helps mostly with  		outdoor mobility, going places outside walking distance and money management.  		</p>
<p>Jane explains that the family is satisfied with the policy and found the  		claim process very easy. The concern is that Mrs. Collins needs twenty-four  		hour supervision and the family can't afford it. She states when the family  		bought the policy (on Mrs. Collins' behalf) they were looking for what they  		could afford to pay in monthly premiums rather than investigating the potential  		price of home care.</p>
<p>Currently benefits pay for 35 hours of care per week. Though Jane is  		concerned about the need for more care she states Mrs. Collins would not be  		able to afford the amount of care she is currently receiving if she did not  		have her long-term care benefits. If this care was not in place, Jane states  		she is certain her mother-in-law would be placed in an assisted living  		facility.</p>
<p>I then spoke with Jane about the impact this situation is having on her  		life. Jane is a fifty-five year old woman who works as an office manager. She  		has had to miss work without pay in the past in order to care for her  		mother-in-law. Just recently, she was out for two weeks. Though Jane states  		caring for her mother-in-law is hard on her emotionally, she doesn't feel that  		it impacts her health or time with her family. In fact, she states that having  		the insurance benefits in place allows her to spend less time on daily  		activities for Mrs. Collins and allows for more time just to visit with her.  		</p>
<p>As we concluded our interview, Jane stated that if they hadn't invested  		in the long-term care insurance her mother-in-law would probably have to move  		into their home while they looked for an appropriate placement. She explains  		that at this point she is grateful that they don't have to do that, but is  		concerned for the future as Mrs. Collins' health continues to deteriorate.</p>
<h3>Case #3: Mr. and Mrs. Baker and their son, Edward</h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Baker (ages 81 and 73) are husband and wife, both receiving  		home care benefits. Mr. Baker has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and  		Mrs. Baker has cancer. Their son, Edward (age 37) was present for both  		interviews and moved in with his parents in 1996 to oversee their care. Both  		Mr. and Mrs. Baker need assistance in most ADLs and all IADLs. The husband  		receives six hours of help five days per week from a home health aid, while his  		wife receives eight hours of help six days per week.</p>
<p>Edward was able to separate his two parents' experiences in regards to  		both the care he provides for each of them as well as interactions with the  		insurance company. Though he has experienced some difficulty with his mother's  		policy, Edward reports an easier time with his father's.</p>
<p>The son first talked about his father. Edward estimated that he spends  		about twenty-eight hours each week caring for his father. The interaction with  		the insurance company on his father's behalf has been a positive experience.  		Though he stated it was somewhat difficult to obtain benefits, there had been  		no disagreements or difficulties with his father's coverage. It is clear from  		his son's responses, that Mr. Baker needs more care and supervision in  		comparison to his wife. Edward states that his father would receive less hours  		of paid care and would have to seek institutional living if not for the  		insurance benefits.</p>
<p>Edward then spoke of his mother. He estimated helping her 25 hours per  		week. When asked about his dealings with the long-term care insurance company  		on her behalf, Edward explained that though it was very easy to file a claim,  		it was somewhat difficult to obtain benefits. He stated he has had difficulty  		with customer service and there are previous disagreements that have yet to be  		resolved to his satisfaction. Edward voiced that even without long-term care  		benefits he would be able to attend to his mother's needs in the home, with the  		acknowledgement that he would need more help from family, friends and  		volunteers.</p>
<p>Edward and I then talked about how caring for both of his parents  		impacted his life. It was clear that Edward's job had been impacted  		significantly by his parents' illness. As an insurance broker, he usually works  		forty hours per week. Edward explained that he would very much like to work  		more hours but he can't due to his parents' needs. He also reports missing  		hours of work at a time, without pay, when emergencies arise. Edward constantly  		has to rearrange his schedule and reported even having to quit and turn down  		jobs because of his responsibility for his parents. His care-giving schedule  		has also kept him from looking for employment. </p>
<p>With all of these responsibilities, Edward reported that helping his  		parents did not bother him, nor was it hard on him emotionally. He did not feel  		that these added responsibilities effected his personal life, free time or  		privacy, though he does have to give them almost his constant attention, even  		when he, himself, is ill.</p>
<h3>Case #4: Mrs. Goldman (Non-HIPAA disabled claimant)</h3>
<p>Mrs. Goldman is an eighty-four year-old woman living on her own with no  		informal caregivers available. Her main reason for needing long-term care is  		cardiac problems, but she is also recovering from a stroke. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goldman stated that she is in fair health. She reported being  		independent with all ADLs but has an unmet need for help with bathing. Mrs.  		Goldman receives help with housework, laundry, meal preparation, grocery  		shopping and outdoor mobility but states she needs more help. She talked about  		only one care giver, a paid personal care attendant. This person helps with  		IADLs in the home three days per week for four hours each day. </p>
<p>We then talked about the role of long-term care insurance in Mrs.  		Goldman's situation. She reported that long-term care insurance benefits pay  		for all of the care she is currently receiving. Mrs. Goldman stated she was  		certain that she would not be able to afford the care she receives if not for  		her insurance benefits. Though unsure of where she would go, Mrs. Goldman  		explained she would have to move out of her own home and seek the assistance of  		family, friends or volunteers if she did not have the long-term care policy.  		</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Goldman explained that she was somewhat satisfied with her  		policy, but suggested she would have liked the insurance company to help her  		when she had to fill out the initial claims paperwork. Overall, this claimant  		reported to be satisfied with the claims process and the amount of coverage she  		chose.</p>
