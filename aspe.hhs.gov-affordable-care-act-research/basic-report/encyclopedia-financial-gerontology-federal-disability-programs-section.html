<p>Federal Disability Programs</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>Federal disability programs, which provide services such as cash  		support, health care coverage, and direct supportive services to eligible  		people with disabilities, are typically limited to people under the age of  		65.</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This entry contains information about the Americans with Disabilities  		Act and nine major Federal programs targeted on disability which serve sizable  		proportions of the non-elderly population aged 50 or over.</p>
<h2>ENTRY</h2>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Federal disability programs serve people of all ages, but most  		disability programs tend to be targeted either on children or on adults in  		their working years, typically defined as from 18 through 64 years of age.  		Because the risk of having a disability increases with age, many programs  		serving the working-age population include large proportions of people in their  		later working years of 50 through 64. </p>
<p>Billions of dollars are spent on Federal programs targeted on persons  		with disabilities. In fiscal year 1989, $85 billion or 8 percent of all Federal  		outlays was spent on disability programs targeted primarily on people under the  		age of 65. (Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p>Nine major Federal disability programs which include sizable proportions  		of people aged 50 to 64 are: (1) Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI),  		(2) Supplemental Security Income (SSI), (3) Medicare, (4) Medicaid, (5)  		Workers' Compensation, (6) Black Lung, (7) the VA Disability Compensation  		Program, (8) the VA Pension Program, and (9) the VA Health Services Program.  		</p>
<p>People may receive benefits from more than one program if they meet  		eligibility requirements. Specific eligibility requirements typically vary,  		depending on the purpose of the program. Eligibility requirements may change  		over time, as the result of amendments to the law, new regulations, or court  		decisions which affect eligibility criteria. Eligibility requirements consist  		of factors related to disability and to other factors, such as age, income,  		veterans' status, or work experience. It is suggested that the federal offices  		administering specific disability programs be contacted directly for the most  		up-to-date eligibility requirements. </p>
<h3>UNDERLYING RESEARCH</h3>
<p>The concept of disability in recent years has generally shifted from  		diseases, conditions, and impairments to a focus on functional deficits caused  		by these factors. Disability measures used in clinical settings or research  		often underlie or are incorporated into how programs determine eligibility.  		Disability is generally defined in research as significant difficulty with or  		the inability to perform certain day-to-day functions, as a result of a health  		condition or impairment. For adults, these functions often involve working or  		keeping house for those aged 18 through 64 and carrying out daily tasks for  		those aged 65 or over. (Weiner) Some commonly used factors in assessing  		disability in research are:</p>
<ul><li>Sensory Impairments--Difficulty with or the inability to see, hear,  		  or speak.</li>
<li>Cognitive/Mental Impairments--The presence of or resulting  		  disabilities from cognitive/mental impairments (e.g. Alzheimer's disease,  		  mental illness, mental retardation).</li>
<li>Functioning of Specific Body Systems--Capacity of specific body  		  systems (e.g. climbing stairs, walking 3 blocks, lifting 10 lbs).</li>
<li>ADLs/IADLs--Difficulty with or the inability to perform without the  		  help of another person or a device the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs); which  		  typically include bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, getting in or out of a  		  bed or chair, and walking; and/or the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living  		  (IADLs), which generally include using the telephone, shopping, preparing  		  meals, keeping house, doing laundry, doing yard work, managing personal  		  finances, and managing medications.</li>
<li>Working--Inability to work, limitations in the amount or kind of  		  work, and/or ability to work only occasionally, irregularly, or part-time.  		  </li>
</ul><h3>THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT</h3>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  		of 1990 is to protect the civil rights of persons with disabilities. Equal  		opportunity provisions pertain to employment, public accommodation,  		transportation, State and local government services, and telecommunications.  		</p>
<p><b>DEFINITION OF DISABILITY</b>: Disability is present for purposes of  		the ADA if an individual meets one of the following three tests: (a) there is a  		physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the  		major life activities; (b) there is a record of such an impairment; or (c) the  		individual is regarded as having an impairment. The ADA definition is identical  		to the one used in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and in the  		Fair Housing Amendments of 1988. (Adler) </p>
<h3>MAJOR FEDERAL DISABILITY PROGRAMS</h3>
<p><i><b>1. SOCIAL SECRUTIY DISABILITY INSURANCE</b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is the  		primary social insurance program which protects workers from loss of income due  		to disability. SSDI provides monthly cash benefits to disabled workers under  		age 65 and to certain of their dependents. SSDI is intended for workers who  		retire early, that is before age 65, because of a disability. (Committee on  		Ways and Means) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: The 1935 Social Security Act established the federal  		social security system to provide old-age benefits for retired workers. The  		SSDI program was enacted in 1956 to provide benefits to workers aged 50 through  		64 years who retired early because of a disability. Subsequent amendments  		widened SSDI coverage to include certain dependents and workers younger than  		age 50. (Social Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: SSDI is federally administered by the Social  		Security Administration (SSA). </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: In November 1993, 4.5 million disabled Americans received  		SSDI benefits: 3.7 million disabled workers under age 65, 143 thousand disabled  		widows/widowers aged 50 to 59, and 655 thousand adults under age 65 who were  		disabled in childhood. Half of disabled workers were between the ages of 50 and  		64. In November 1993, the average monthly benefit was $625 for disabled  		workers, $423 for disabled widows/widowers, and $397 for adults disabled in  		childhood. SSDI benefits end at age 65 when workers who retired early due to  		their disability are administratively converted to regular retirement benefits.  		(Social Security Administration, August 1993; Social Security Administration  		Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Funding is provided through the Disability Insurance  		(SSDI) portion of the Social Security payroll tax on earnings. The payroll tax  		is 7.65 percent of earnings, of which 5.6 percent is for the Old-Age and  		Survivors Insurance (OASI) portion of Social Security, 0.6 percent for the SSDI  		portion, and 1.45 percent for the Hospital Insurance (HI) portion of Medicare.  		A matching 7.65 percent tax is borne by employers. Self-employed people have a  		payroll tax of 15.3 percent, because they pay both the employer and employee  		shares. As of 1994, the OASI and DI parts of the payroll tax are collected for  		the first $60,000 of earnings, but there is no earnings limit for the HI  		payroll tax. (Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: In order to become eligible for SSDI, an individual  		must first have enough Social Security covered work-quarters and secondly have  		a severe impairment which makes him or her unable to do his or her previous  		work or any other kind of substantial gainful activity which exists in the  		national economy. There is no means-test. </p>
<p>Insured work quarters are credited annually for those years during which  		an individual works, is covered by Social Security, and earns a specified  		amount, which is adjusted upward each year. No more than four quarters can be  		credited each year. In 1994, one quarter of coverage was credited for $620 of  		earnings. </p>
<p>Workers must be fully insured and (except for persons who are blind or  		who are younger than age 31) must have at least 20-quarters of coverage during  		the 40-quarter period up to time of disability in order to receive SSDI.  		Persons who are fully insured under Social Security have at least one quarter  		of coverage for every four quarters up to the time of disability. Those who  		have forty quarters are fully insured for life. Workers younger than age 31 and  		individuals who are blind need fewer quarters, but a minimum of six quarters is  		needed. (Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p>Disability for SSDI is defined as the inability to do any substantial  		gainful activity (earn more than $500 per month for disabled and $810 for blind  		persons) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment  		which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected  		to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. (Adler) </p>
<p>After it is established that the applicant has enough quarters and is  		not earning more than the substantial gainful activity amount, a State  		Disability Determination unit examines medical evidence to determine if the  		applicant's mental or physical impairment is severe enough to have more than a  		minimal effect on the applicant's ability to work. If so, the applicant's  		medical condition is compared to the SSA Listing of over 100 Impairments (e.g.  		loss of two limbs; fracture of vertebra with cord involvement, substantiated by  		appropriate sensory and motor loss; vision of 20/200 or less after correction).  		(Mather) </p>
<p>Applicants whose medical conditions are at least as severe as those in  		the Listing are considered disabled. Applicants who are not found disabled at  		this point are evaluated at two additional steps. First, a determination is  		made as to whether or not the applicant could do his or her past work. This  		decision is based on assessments of factors such as physical abilities (e.g.  		strength, walking, standing) and/or mental abilities (e.g. the ability to carry  		out and remember instructions, to respond appropriately in work settings). </p>
<p>For applicants who cannot perform past work, an assessment is done to  		ascertain their ability to perform other work that exists in the national  		economy. This assessment is based on the individual's functional capacity, age,  		education, and work experience. In general, persons under age 50 are considered  		to be able to adapt to new work situations. Jobs are said to exist in the  		national economy if there are significant numbers with requirements that are  		within the functional abilities and vocational qualifications of applicants.  		Isolated jobs which exist only in very limited numbers in relatively few  		locations outside of where the applicant lives are not regarded as "work that  		exists in the national economy". (Social Security Administration 1986) </p>
<p>Dependent coverage and survivor benefits are offered through SSDI to  		certain persons. Disabled individuals can receive SSDI in three ways: on their  		own as disabled workers (described above), as widows or widowers (who are aged  		50-59) of insured individuals, and as adults aged 18 through 64 who became  		disabled in childhood whose parent(s) either receive SSDI, are Social Security  		retirees, or who are deceased (but had been insured under Social Security).  		</p>
<p>The determination of disability for disabled widows/widowers is  		identical to the one used for disabled workers and adults disabled in  		childhood, although a somewhat different standard existed prior to 1991.  		(Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p>Dependent coverage is also provided to certain non-disabled family  		members (spouses who are either aged 60 or over or who care for one or more  		entitled children under the age of 16). Survivor benefits are paid to  		widow/widowers aged 60 or over, to widow/widowers of any age if he or she are  		caring for a dependent child who is either under age 16 or disabled, to  		unmarried children under age 18 (or 19 if in elementary or secondary school),  		or to dependent parents aged 62 or more. (Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p><i><b>2. SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides  		monthly cash payments to low-income aged, blind, and disabled persons.  		(Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: The SSI program was established by the 1972 amendments  		to the Social Security Act, which replaced earlier federal grants to the states  		for old-age assistance, aid to the blind, and aid to the permanently disabled.  		(Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The SSI program is administered by the Social  		Security Administration. </p>
<p><b><i>SCOPE</i></b>: In November 1993, 4.5 million blind or disabled  		persons received SSI with monthly payments averaging about $390. Approximately  		39 percent of those receiving SSI because of blindness or disability are aged  		50 or over. (Burwell, Social Security Administration, August 1993; Social  		Security Administration Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Funding comes from federal general revenues. Many states  		have chosen the option to supplement federal SSI payments with their own funds.  		(Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: Unlike SSDI, people receiving SSI because of  		blindness or disability have no work requirements, but must meet a financial  		means-test. Persons under age 65 must meet both disability and financial  		criteria, whereas those aged 65 or over need only meet the financial  		means-test. Persons may receive SSI payments either as individuals or as  		couples. Both members of a couple must be aged, blind, or disabled and must  		meet the financial means-test in order to collect payments. Besides these  		provisions for couples, there are no dependent or survivor benefits in SSI.  		(Adler) </p>
<p>The determination of disability for adults is identical to the one used  		in the SSDI program. For children under age 18, the determination of disability  		is based on a standard of comparable severity. </p>
<p>The SSI means-test depends on income and resources. There are  		complicated ways of counting various types of income and resources; but, in  		general, the maximum monthly income in 1994 for individuals applying for SSI  		was $454 and $672 for couples if they receive only Social Security and $953 for  		individuals and $1,389 for couples if their income is only from wages.  		Countable resources are limited to $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for  		couples. (Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p><i><b>3. MEDICARE </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: Medicare, enacted in 1965, provides health insurance  		coverage to aged (aged 65 or over) and disabled persons insured under Social  		Security. Medicare coverage has two parts. Part A, or Hospital Insurance (HI),  		is subject to deductibles and limits, covers inpatient hospital care, provides  		skilled nursing and/or rehabilitative post-hospital care in a skilled-nursing  		facility, home health care, and hospice care. Part B or Supplementary Medical  		Insurance (SMI), which has monthly premiums and deductibles, covers physician  		services, outpatient services from certain other medical providers, approved  		medical equipment and supplies, and drugs which cannot be self-administered.  		Because HI is financed through the Social security payroll tax, HI is  		automatically extended to eligible individuals. SMI is a voluntary program  		available only by paying monthly premiums. (Burwell, 1990; Committee on Ways  		and Means) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: Medicare and Medicaid were established by the Social  		Security Amendments of 1965. Medicare was enacted to provide health insurance  		to the population aged 65 or over. As part of the 1972 amendments to the Social  		Security Act, Medicare was extended, under certain circumstances, to persons  		receiving SSDI and to those with kidney disease. (Social Security  		Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The Medicare program is federally administered by  		the Health Care Financing Administration in the Department of Health and Human  		Services. </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: In 1991, 31.5 million aged, 3.4 million disabled persons  		under age 65, and 72 thousand persons with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) were  		eligible for Medicare. There were $110.9 billion in Medicare payments in 1991,  		of which $12.5 billion were for those under 65 receiving SSDI. (Social Security  		Administration, Winter 1993) In July 1993, approximately 2.5 million disabled  		individuals between the ages of 45 and 64 were enrolled in Medicare. (Lazenby)  		</p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Funding for the HI portion of Medicare comes from the  		Hospital Insurance (HI) portion of the Social Security payroll tax and is  		automatically deposited in the Medicare Trust Fund. In 1994, the HI payroll tax  		is was 1.45 percent of earnings for employees and 1.45 percent for employers.  		Self-employed persons were taxed 2.9 percent of payroll for HI. The SMI part of  		Medicare is financed by a combination of monthly premiums, which cover about 25  		percent of program expenditures, and federal general revenues, which cover the  		remaining 75 percent. In 1994, the monthly SMI premium was $41.10. (Committee  		on Ways and Means) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: Persons aged 65 or over who are entitled to Social  		Security are also enrolled in Medicare. There are two ways that persons under  		age 65 can be eligible for Medicare: (1) SSDI beneficiaries are enrolled in  		Medicare 24 months after receiving SSDI benefits and (2) persons in the  		End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program are enrolled in Medicare after 3 months.  		Persons in the ESRD portion of Medicare must be medically determined to have  		end-stage renal disease (that stage of kidney impairment that appears  		irreversible and permanent and requires a regular course of dialysis or kidney  		transplantation to maintain life) and either be insured themselves through  		Social Security or be the spouse or dependent child of an insured  		worker/retiree. Persons on Medicare who are eligible because of SSDI range in  		age from 20 through 64, while those eligible because of ESRD patients can be  		any age from infancy through age 64. (Adler) </p>
<p><i><b>4. MEDICAID </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that pays  		for the health care of low-income, as well as medically indigent individuals.  		</p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: Medicaid was established, along with Medicare, by the  		Social Security Amendments of 1965. Medicaid was enacted to pay for the medical  		care of certain needy persons. Medicaid combined and replaced earlier programs,  		which provided medical payments for needy individuals. (Committee on National  		Statistics; Social Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: Medicaid is jointly administered by the  		individual states and territories along with the federal Health Care Financing  		Administration, located in the Department of Health and Human Services.  		(Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: During fiscal year 1992, $91.3 billion in Medicaid  		payments were made on behalf of 30.2 million persons. Nearly 4.4 million  		disabled or blind persons accounted for $34 billion of total Medicaid payments.  		That is, the nearly 15 percent of Medicaid recipients who were blind or  		disabled accounted for 37 percent of payments. Approximately 3.3 million of the  		4.4 million persons received SSI and 500 thousand did not. They accounted for  		$20.2 billion and $13.8 billion in Medicaid payments, respectively. Payments  		for nursing facility services (nursing homes) totaled $21.7 billion or 24  		percent of all Medicaid payments, although only 1.4 million persons received  		these services. (Burwell, 1994) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state  		governments. Federal dollars come from federal general revenues. The federal  		match rate is derived annually for each state by comparing the states's average  		per capita income to national figures. The federal share of total Medicaid  		spending was 57.4 percent in 1992. By law, this share can range from 50 percent  		to 83 percent. During 1992, the federal match rate was 50 percent for twelve  		states and the District of Columbia. Mississippi had the highest federal match  		rate at 79.99 percent. (Congressional Research Service; Social Security  		Administration, Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>SERVICES</b>: Medicaid covers both required and optional services.  		Some required services include inpatient hospital services and physician  		services. Optional services include intermediate care facilities for the  		mentally retarded, prescription drugs and personal care. In addition, services  		provided under the Home and Community-based Care waivers may include personal  		care services, chore services, respite care services, and adult day care.  		States may also set limits on the amount, duration, and/or scope of mandated  		and optional services (e.g. a limit on the number of hospital days) within  		broad federal guidelines. (Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p>Three Medicaid services which are important for people with disabilities  		are: (1) nursing facilities (i.e. nursing homes); (2) home health services;  		and, (3) personal care services. Nursing facilities are mandatory for people  		aged 21 or over who receive cash payments from SSI or AFDC, but are optional  		services for everyone else. Home health services are, in effect, mandatory for  		the same Medicaid recipients for whom nursing facility services are provided.  		Personal care services are provided in a person's home by a qualified person  		under the guidance of a registered nurse. These services can include bathing,  		dressing, ambulation, feeding, grooming, and meal preparation, cleaning,  		laundry, and shopping. Personal care services may be provided under the Home  		and Community-based Care waivers or as an other optional medical services.  		(Health Care Financing Administration, Congressional Research Service) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: Medicaid coverage is automatically extended to  		persons receiving cash assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent  		Children (AFDC) and generally to those who receive SSI. Medicaid coverage is  		also mandatory for many pregnant women and children near the poverty level.  		Many of those eligible for Medicaid for reasons of disability (or blindness)  		also receive SSI cash assistance. However, there are a number of optional state  		programs through which ill or disabled persons who do not get SSI can receive  		Medicaid. (Burwell, 1990; Congressional Research Service) </p>
<p>Eligibility for Medicaid is complex and varies from state to state.  		People with comparable illnesses, disabilities, and incomes may be eligible for  		Medicaid in one state, but not in another. </p>
<p>Receipt of SSI guarantees eligibility for Medicaid in most states.  		(Burwell, 1990) As of December 1992, twelve states had exercised an authority  		to impose more restrictive eligibility criteria for Medicaid than SSI uses.  		These twelve states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota,  		Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and  		Virginia. (Congressional Research Service) </p>
<p>These twelve states had to permit individuals to deduct their medical  		expenses from their incomes in determining eligibility. Under this system,  		known as "spend down", if an otherwise eligible applicant's income exceeded the  		state's income standard for Medicaid eligibility, the applicant would become  		eligible after incurring sufficient medical expenses to reduce his or her  		income to below the standard. States must extend Medicaid eligibility to  		certain groups of disabled people who may not actually receive SSI, but who are  		deemed to meet SSI income and resource standards. (Congressional Research  		Service, Committee on Ways and Means) </p>
<p>States have a variety of other means by which they can extend Medicaid  		to persons with disabilities who do not receive SSI. First, states have the  		option to provide Medicaid coverage to poor disabled persons. As of January  		1992, eight states (Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New  		Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina) and the District of Columbia took the  		option of providing Medicaid coverage to elderly or disabled poor individuals  		whose incomes are below the federal poverty standard and whose resources are  		below the SSI standard. (Congressional Research Service) For example, in 1992,  		individuals who lived alone were under the federal poverty standard if their  		annual incomes were under $6,810, while the maximum SSI standard (for those  		receiving income only from Social Security) was $5,448 per year. </p>
<p>Secondly, among other options, states can elect to establish a medically  		needy program, under which disabled individuals whose income exceeds SSI  		standards but who need assistance with medical expenses can obtain eligibility  		by "spending down". By April 1992, the medically needy option was exercised by  		Arkansas, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii,  		Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,  		Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,  		North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,  		South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West  		Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Congressional Research Service) </p>
<p>In addition, the home and community-based care waiver program has been  		elected in every state, except Arizona whose entire Medicaid program operates  		under a demonstration waiver. The intent of this program is to keep disabled  		persons in the community rather than in institutions when possible.  		Specifically, states can provide home and community-based services not  		otherwise included in their State Medicaid plans to disabled persons living in  		the community who would otherwise reside in institutions. (Congressional  		Research Service) </p>
<p><i><b>5. WORKERS' COMPENSATION </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: Workers' Compensation provides cash payments and medical  		and rehabilitation services to workers (or their survivors) who have  		disabilities or who have died, because of accidents on the job or occupational  		diseases. (Hagen) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: The first workers' compensation law was enacted in 1908.  		Most states had Workers' Compensation programs in 1920. By 1949, all states had  		Workers' Compensation programs. (Social Security Administration, August 1993)  		</p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: There are 53 separate Workers' Compensation  		programs administered by the states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin  		Islands, and Puerto Rico. The Departments of Labor within each state typically  		administer Workers' Compensation. In addition, the Department of Labor in the  		federal government administers Workers' Compensation programs for Federal Civil  		Servants, Longshore and Harbor Workers, and the Black Lung program. (Social  		Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: In 1991, $42.2 billion in benefits were paid.  		Approximately 60 percent of benefits provided cash payments and 40 percent of  		benefits paid for medical and rehabilitation services. Weekly cash payments for  		workers vary by state, but are typically limited to no more than two-thirds of  		a state's average weekly wage. There are no national figures on the number of  		people receiving Workers' Compensation benefits. (Social Security  		Administration, Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Premiums from employers account for nearly all Workers'  		Compensation funds. These premiums average about 2 percent of payroll. Many  		employers have private insurance, some large employers are self-insured, and  		others operate in states which have state funds allotted for Workers'  		Compensation. In some instances, modest amounts are paid by employees for  		medical benefits. Workers' Compensation coverage for most jobs in private  		industry is compulsory. Nationwide, about 88 percent of the labor force is  		covered by Workers' Compensation. (Social Security Administration, August 1993)  		</p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: Disabilities or death can be due to either  		workrelated injuries or occupational diseases, the latter of which are often  		difficult to establish. Employer negligence is not an issue. In general,  		Workers Compensation benefits are not paid if the cause of the injury was  		intoxication of the worker, willful misconduct, or gross negligence. </p>
<p>Unlike the SSDI and SSI programs, where eligibility is limited to those  		with permanent total disabilities, worker's compensation can provide for three  		types of disability: permanent total disability, temporary total disability,  		and permanent partial disability. Temporary total disabilities are those in  		which a worker is unable to work, but is expected to fully recover. Most cases  		involve temporary total disability. </p>
<p>Benefits in these instances are typically paid until the person is  		recovered, but there are limits in some States. In most cases, permanent  		partial disabilities are limited to injuries in which disabilities are due  		either due to the loss of a part of the body (e.g. limb, eye) or to a  		generalized part of the body (e.g. head, back, nervous system). (Hagen, Social  		Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><i><b>6. BLACK LUNG </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: Black Lung benefits are paid to coal miners who are  		totally disabled as a result of pneumoconiosis (a disease of the lungs caused  		by the habitual inhalation of irritant mineral or metallic particles), to  		widows of miners who died from Black Lung disease, and to their dependents.  		(Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: The Black Lung program was established by the Federal  		Coal Mine Health Safety Act of 1969. (Social Security Administration, August  		1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The Black Lung program is administered by the  		Department of Labor. </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: About 182 thousand persons were paid Black Lung benefits  		in December 1992. Only 36 thousand were coal miners, the remainder were widows  		(109 thousand) or dependents (37 thousand). Over 99 percent of people receiving  		Black Lung benefits are aged 45 or over. (Burwell, 1990; Social Security  		Administration, Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: The Black Lung program is funded by an excise tax on  		coal, which is the lesser of $1 per ton of coal from underground mines (50  		cents from surface mines) or 4 percent of the coal's selling price. (Social  		Security Administration, Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: A miner must meet three general conditions: (1) must  		have (or, if deceased, have had) pneumoconiosis; (2) must be totally disabled  		by the disease (or have been totally disabled at the time of death); and (3)  		the pneumoconiosis must have arisen out of coal mine employment. (Burwell,  		1990) </p>
<p><i><b>7. VA DISABILITY COMPENSATION PROGRAM </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The VA Disability Compensation program provides cash  		assistance to veterans with service-connected disabilities, that is, they  		incurred illness or injury while in service. Employment is not a factor:  		veterans can be employed and still receive benefits. (Seavey) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: Veterans' health, disability, and pension programs have  		grown out of a long history of benefits provided to veterans. Disability  		pensions were provided to veterans of the Revolutionary War by the Continental  		Congress. In 1789, Congress enacted a veterans' pension program. (Social  		Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The VA Disability Compensation program is  		administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: In fiscal year 1992, 2.2 million veterans with  		serviceconnected disabilities and survivors of 314 thousand deceased veterans  		received $12.6 billion through this program. (Committee on Ways and Means) The  		largest share of veterans receiving benefits for service-connected disabilities  		served in World War II (36.9 percent). Another 30.8 percent served during the  		Vietnam Era. Altogether, approximately 43 percent of veterans with a  		service-connected disability were aged 65 or over in fiscal year 1992.  		(Department of Veterans' Affairs, Social Security Administration, Winter 1993)  		</p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Funding is provided from federal general revenues.  		(Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: An individual must have a partial or total  		impairment by injury or disease incurred or aggravated during military service.  		A Veterans' Affairs (VA) Rating Board employs criteria developed by the DVA to  		rate the extent of a disability. Specifically, the illness, injury, or disease  		manifestations must arise during service, but time can elapse. Dishonorably  		discharged veterans are not eligible. While the SSDI, SSI, and Black Lung  		programs have an "all or nothing disability determination process" wherein a  		person either is or is not determined to receive benefits, a range or band of  		eligibility exists in the VA Disability Compensation program. This range is the  		disability ratings system, which goes from 0 to 100 percent and is based on the  		presumed reduction in income caused by the disability. </p>
<p>Dependent allowances and survivor benefits are paid under certain  		circumstances. In general, dependent allowances are paid to veterans with at  		least a 30 percent service-connected disability. Survivor benefits are paid if  		the veteran was receiving or was entitled to receive benefits at the time of  		death and the service-connected disability was continuously rated totally  		disabling for at least 10 years or 5 years after discharge. Survivors are  		limited to spouses (who have been married to the veteran for at least one year  		or who have had a child with the veteran), children under age 18, disabled, or  		students, and parents in certain cases. (Seavey; Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><i><b>8. VA DISABILITY PENSION PROGRAM </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The VA Disability Pension programs pays cash benefits to  		elderly low-income war veterans who have become permanently and totally  		disabled from non-service-connected causes. This program is similar to SSDI in  		that there are employability standards. (Seavey) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: Veterans' health, disability, and pension programs have  		grown out of a long history of benefits provided to veterans. Disability  		pensions were provided to veterans of the Revolutionary War by the Continental  		Congress. In 1789, Congress enacted a veterans' pension program. (Social  		Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The VA Disability Compensation program is  		administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: In fiscal year 1989, this program served 1.1 million  		living and deceased veterans (with survivors) at a cost of $3.9 billion.  		(Committee on Ways and Means) About 72 percent of veterans in this program were  		aged 65 or over in 1992. (Social Security Administration, Winter 1993) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Funding is provided from federal general revenues.  		(Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY</b>: An individual must have an injury or disease  		sustained outside of military service rendering a veteran permanently and  		totally impaired. Impairment is determined based on the veteran's ability to  		function at work and at home. Persons with dishonorable discharges are not  		eligible. Low-income criteria are based on income and family size. During  		December 1991, income limits were $7,397 for a veteran living alone and $9,689  		for a veteran living with one other person. (Committee on Ways and Means)  		Benefits are paid to surviving spouses and children if the veteran served in  		specified wartime periods. Survivors must meet the same conditions as for the  		DVA Disability Compensation program. (Seavey; Burwell, 1990) </p>
<p><i><b>9. VETERANS' HEALTH SERVICES </b></i></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: The Veterans' Health Services programs, administered by  		the DVA, consists of a nationwide health care network which provides medical  		care to eligible veterans. Services must be provided to veterans with a  		service-connected disability, former prisoners of war, and those with  		low-incomes. Other veterans are served on a space available basis. Services  		provided include hospital care, nursing home care, and outpatient care,  		including rehabilitation. Care is provided through DVA facilities. However,  		nursing home care can be provided for a limited time in a non-DVA facility  		under certain circumstances. (Social Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b>: Veterans' health, disability, and pension programs have  		grown out of a long history of benefits provided to veterans. Disability  		pensions were provided to veterans of the Revolutionary War by the Continental  		Congress. In 1789, Congress enacted a veterans' pension program. (Social  		Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The Veterans' Health Services programs are  		administered federally by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. (Social Security  		Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>SCOPE</b>: During fiscal year 1993, net outlays for the entire  		Veterans' Health Services program was $14.8 billion. Approximately 910 thousand  		patients were discharged from DVA hospitals, of whom 31 percent were under age  		50, 27 percent were between 50 and 64 years of age, and the remaining 42  		percent were aged 65 or older. (Department of Veterans' Affairs) </p>
<p><b>FUNDING</b>: Funding is provided from Federal general revenues.  		(Social Security Administration, August 1993) </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBLITY</b>: VA hospitals and nursing homes must serve certain  		groups and serve others if space is available. The mandatory groups served  		include persons: rated as "service-connected; retired from active duty for a  		disability incurred or aggravated while in military service; receiving a VA  		pension; eligible for Medicaid; who were former prisoners of war; who need care  		for a condition possibly related to exposure to dioxin or other toxic  		substances; who need care for a condition possibly related to exposure to  		radiation from nuclear tests or in the American occupation of Japan; or who are  		veterans of the Spanish-American War, the Mexican Border Period, or World War  		I. Care on a space-available basis is provided to low income veterans, whose  		disabilities are not service-connected. Outpatient care is also contingent on a  		number of factors. Outpatient care for any condition is available to veterans  		who have a service-connected disability rating of 50 percent or more, former  		prisoners of war, or veterans of World War I. Such care is also available for  		the treatment of service-connected disabilities or for care which would prevent  		a hospital stay. (Seavey, Social Security Administration, August 1993)</p>
