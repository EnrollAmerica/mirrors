<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> This collection of brief issue papers describes 15 major problem areas  		facing American children and families and summarizes the state of knowledge  		about the scope of the problems, trends, current government program  		expenditures, costs per case, the effectiveness of current intervention  		strategies and public attitudes about the problem areas. These papers are not  		intended to be comprehensive reviews of the current knowledge about the  		problems (which could fill volumes for some of the areas), but are broad brush  		attempts to encapsulate policy-useful information about problems and solutions  		in a consistent and integrative fashion. In some cases, vast areas of knowledge  		have been greatly summarized and, in others, there is little readily available  		data. One useful product of this effort is to highlight key information  		gaps.</p>
<p> This review focuses primarily on social and health service needs and  		programs affecting children and their families. Topics include:</p>
<ul><li>Child health (including infant mortality, children without health  		  care coverage, pediatric/adolescent AIDS and mental health problems);</li>
<li>Adolescents in trouble (including adolescent pregnancy, substance  		  abuse, runaway youth, and educational/employment deficits);</li>
<li>Child welfare services (including child abuse/neglect; adequacy of  		  foster care services; and adequacy of adoption services);</li>
<li>Lack of child care;</li>
<li>Lack of early childhood education;</li>
<li>Lack of child support; and</li>
<li>Homelessness.</li>
</ul><p> ASPE contracted with SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill to develop these issue  		papers. ASPE staff determined the problems areas which would be included in the  		review and approved the outline to be followed for each issue paper. It was  		beyond the scope of the review to focus on the enormous problem areas of  		child/family poverty and general education. There are other sound reviews of  		these areas available (e.g., Ellwood, 1988; Committee on Ways and Means, 1985;  		Committee for Economic Development, 1985). Nonetheless, it is clearly apparent  		that the boundaries of problems and solutions described here are profoundly  		shaped by the income and educational resources and opportunities available to  		the nation's children and families.</p>
<h3>Classes of Problems and Solutions</h3>
<p> At an abstract level, the problems which children and families face can  		be divided into three basic categories:</p>
<ul><li>Problems which threaten lives,</li>
<li>Problems which create severe social harm, which, while not  		  necessarily life-threatening, hurt children and endanger their health or  		  welfare in serious and unacceptable ways, and</li>
<li>Problems which endanger economic productivity, which impair the  		  ability of children to become productive members of society or which cause  		  current unnecessary social costs.</li>
</ul><p>These are all important types of problems, but they vary in terms of the  		immediacy and severity of their impacts. While categories were not mutually  		exclusive, most problems tended to fit primarily in one category, as shown in  		<a href="../node/68491.html#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>. The major areas of overlap occurred for  		problems causing mental or psychological stress for children which, on the  		basis of research, appear to carry over into adult years with related social  		problems (e.g., lower incomes, family distress, etc.). As emphasized in the  		Adolescents in Trouble paper, these problems are not independent. Many are  		interrelated and often cluster among certain groups, such as low-income  		minority children living in inner cities.</p>

</ul></td>
</tr></table><p> Solutions have two general categories:</p>
<ul><li>Preventive interventions, which try to identify and resolve problems  		  at an early stage before they have more serious consequences, and</li>
<li>Treatment services, which try to resolve or treat problems which have  		  already occurred.</li>
</ul><p> Again, there is no clear line between these two in some cases. For  		example, while child welfare services may find children who have already been  		abused or neglected, they seek to provide counseling to help tie current  		circumstances and also strive to prevent future incidents. It would be better  		to prevent problems before they occur, if possible. It is socially desirable to  		avoid the pain or harm inherent in these problems, and prevention efforts are  		often less expensive than remedial actions. However, often prevention is not  		possible because we lack effective preventive strategies, because we lack the  		ability to identify potential problems, or because prevention may cause other  		problems, such as high societal intrusion into family life and privacy. Thus,  		treatment services are the primary tools of most public programs. Clearly,  		future efforts must focus more on developing and implementing better problem  		identification and prevention programs.</p>
<h3>Size of Problems, Current Service Rendered and  		Costs</h3>
<p><a href="../node/68491.html#exhibit2"> Exhibit 2</a> summarizes selected data from each of  		the issue papers regarding number of people needing services; the number of  		people currently receiving services; current government expenditures per year;  		and cost per case. The definitions and data sources differ a little for each  		problem and are discussed in more depth in each of the attached issue papers.  		The numbers and costs are not completely comparable because of definitional  		discrepancies which are not readily resolved. However, they indicate the  		approximate size of the problem and costs which are involved in each type of  		problem. Data presented are usually based on statistics for relatively recent  		years (e.g., 1986 to 1988). When older data are used, these are noted. The  		issue papers also provide, where data are available, rough estimates of the  		cost to close the gap, i.e., to provide services to those currently unserved.  		These estimates are quite rough, since in many cases data are lacking or weak.  		Further, no specific attempt was made to outline specific proposals for serving  		the unserved. The estimates show the rough magnitude of costs for new services,  		but should not be considered definitive estimates of specific proposals.</p>
<p> Ranked on the basis of the size of the population potentially needing  		services, the largest problems are adolescent pregnancy and substance abuse,  		since virtually all children or adolescents are appropriate targets for  		prevention efforts. Compensatory education needs are next, based on size. A few  		million children lack adequate child support, early childhood education, health  		insurance and mental health services. However, size is certainly not the only  		indicator of need. Although relatively few children or adolescents have AIDS,  		the fatal nature of HIV infection makes it a major problem. Similarly, the  		number of women lacking any or adequate prenatal care is not extremely high,  		but the seriousness of infant mortality is obvious.</p>

</tr></table><p> It is difficult to assess the economic consequences of these childhood  		problems fairly, but our rough impression is that problems most endangering the  		future productivity of our children are adolescent pregnancy,  		educational/employment deficits and substance abuse. These create current  		societal costs, such as welfare payments or the costs of crimes which may be  		promoted by drug abuse or idleness, as well as deterring education or  		employment opportunities needed to get good jobs and lifestyles in adult years.  		Given the demographic trends associated with the maturing of the Baby Boomers  		and future labor shortages, it is more necessary than ever that we have a  		well-trained and able cohort of future workers and leaders for the nation.</p>
<p> The review of public attitudes was incomplete since only a few of the  		areas have been brought up in recent public opinion surveys, but there is  		strong evidence that in 1989 Americans view drugs as the biggest domestic  		problem (Morin, 1989). Efforts to reduce drug use appear to have strong public  		support. However, there also appears to be substantial support for enhanced  		government roles to help American children and families.</p>
<h3>Current Knowledge About Potential Solutions</h3>
<p> From a policy perspective, the most important question is what can we  		do to better address these problems? Billions of dollars are being spent and  		many thousands of people are working in programs to help children.  		Unfortunately, for most of these areas, there is inadequate evaluation of  		program interventions. In some cases, there is no clear agreement on what  		constitutes a successful intervention. The issue papers attempt to digest the  		most relevant information on the effectiveness of intervention strategies,  		where it exists. The gaps in the knowledge and the diversity of intervention  		approaches necessitate subjective assessments of the apparent effectiveness of  		potential interventions. Generally, the papers present what would be a  		consensus view within the given discipline.</p>
<p> In four problem areas, there seem to be highly effective strategies  		which already exist which could be implemented or enlarged across the nation.  		However, implementation of some efforts would be so expensive that they could  		only be considered in the light of significant trade-offs with other areas of  		public spending policy. These areas include infant mortality, children without  		health care coverage, child care and early childhood education:</p>
<ul><li>Prenatal and postnatal medical care and nutrition are considered  		  relatively effective methods of preventing low birthweight, decreasing infant  		  mortality and avoiding high neonatal intensive care costs.</li>
<li>The Head Start Program has been demonstrated to have substantial  		  short-term effects on children's mental performance and health. Other high  		  quality pre-school programs have resulted in long-term improved outcomes for  		  low-income children.</li>
<li>There is little doubt that, in principle, the nation has the  		  capability to provide good quality health insurance and child care for those  		  currently lacking services, especially the low-income. However, the costs for  		  such services would be quite high and it is less clear how much these  		  interventions would reduce underlying problems of poor child health, low family  		  income or welfare dependency.</li>
</ul><p> In six areas, there appears to be evidence of moderate effectiveness of  		strategies currently available. The grave nature of the problems and the lack  		of more effective interventions indicates the need for reinvigorated  		demonstration projects and social research to develop better tools. These six  		areas are pediatric/adolescent AIDS, adolescent pregnancy,  		educational/employment deficits, child abuse/neglect, child support and  		homelessness:</p>
<ul><li>There is some encouraging evidence of increasing condom use and  		  acceptance of other strategies to prevent AIDS, but it is unclear how well  		  prevention is reaching hard-core groups, such as mothers using IV drugs or  		  whose partners are using them, who are prime causes of pediatric AIDS.</li>
<li>Educational services appear to improve rates of contraception use,  		  which should deter adolescent pregnancy. Some programs providing health and  		  social support services to pregnant and parenting teens appear to reduce bad  		  consequences of adolescent pregnancy.</li>
<li>Evaluations of child abuse treatment programs have generally  		  indicated serious limitations, such as high reincidence rates. However,  		  prevention programs, especially those aimed at new parents, show promising  		  results in improved outcomes.</li>
<li>Studies indicate that compensatory education is associated with  		  improved school achievement. Some youth employment programs appear to improve  		  employability and wage rates for the enrollees.</li>
<li>Research indicates that strong child support programs are associated  		  with enhanced child support payment patterns. Some evidence suggests that  		  guidelines on setting child support awards increases the award levels. The  		  Family Support Act of 1988 made changes to improve child support  		  enforcement.</li>
<li>In principle, most areas have the capability to provide shelter for  		  homeless families and children. However, the mixed quality of the shelter  		  provided and the inability to prevent homelessness indicates the need to  		  develop better programs.</li>
</ul><p> In some areas, there is little evidence of interventions generally  		viewed as successful. It is not completely clear whether this indicates that  		programs are not efficacious, whether evaluation research has not been  		conducted or whether desired outcomes are not well-defined. These areas may  		require development of better solutions, more evaluation research or both.  		These include mental health, substance abuse, runaway youth, and foster  		care:</p>
<ul><li>Many children appear to receive inappropriate mental health care. The  		  efficacy of general mental health services is not clear, although it probably  		  varies by diagnostic category.</li>
<li>There has been minimal evaluation of adolescent drug treatment  		  programs. Evaluations of prevention programs have generally been disappointing,  		  although some comprehensive social influence programs appear to have modest  		  positive effects on drug use behaviors. Data from the survey of high school  		  seniors suggests that adolescent drug use may be declining, except for  		  cocaine.</li>
<li>Strong evaluations related to runaway youth and foster care programs  		  were not identified.</li>
</ul><h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> The overall assessment of this report is that the nation faces a wide  		array of serious problems involving American families and children. While  		substantial efforts and expenditures are already being made to address these  		problems, there are still very large gaps in services. Public opinion polls  		tend to indicate that, not only is the American public concerned about social  		problems like these, the public is generally supportive of increased spending  		to reduce these problems.</p>
<p> In a number of areas current approaches to prevention or treatment are  		not as effective as might be hoped, given the scope of the problems. In  		conjunction with the maintenance of current program efforts, interventions in  		these areas need further development and research, such as well-conceived and  		executed demonstration projects. In general, the government can play an  		important role in developing and fostering better prevention programs in most  		of these problem areas. Prevention is usually both more humane and more  		economical.</p>
<p> There is a growing consensus, however, that current interventions for  		other problems are relatively effective (Schorr, 1988). In these areas, the  		Federal government, in concert with State and local governments and the private  		and non-profit sectors, has the ability to improve the lives of American  		children, youth and families.</p>

<h4>1. Definition of the Problem Area</h4>
<p> While there are many areas of concern with regard to the health care  		needs of children, this summary will focus on four problem areas: infant and  		child mortality, lack of child health care coverage, pediatric/adolescent AIDS  		and the mental health problems of children. Three areas relevant to child  		health are discussed in other sections: child abuse and neglect, adolescent  		pregnancy, and substance abuse.</p>
<h3>Infant and Child Mortality</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> In 1988, the U.S. reported an infant mortality rate of 9.9 infants per  		1,000 live births, or about 40,000 infants. As a point of comparison, Japan's  		infant mortality rate was 5.5 for 1985. Also of importance, the black infant  		mortality rate in 1986 was 18.0, compared to 8.9 for whites. Although the U.S.  		infant mortality rate has generally been decreasing (the infant mortality rate  		was 12.6 in 1980), the rate of decline has slowed (Office of Technology  		Assessment, 1988). The U.S. Surgeon General has established as a public health  		goal the reduction of the rate to 9.0 infant deaths per 1,000 live births by  		1990; however, it is not clear whether this objective will be met.</p>
<p> The slowing decline in infant mortality rates is primarily attributable  		to two factors: changes in birth reporting (increased reporting of births as  		live that in the past would have been reported as fetal deaths or would have  		been unreported), and an increased ability to resuscitate very tiny newborns  		(although these newborns die very shortly) (Office of Technology Assessment,  		1988). The leading causes of infant death are congenital anomalies, sudden  		infant death syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome and disorders relating  		toshort gestation and low birthweight (Hughes, Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu,  		1989).</p>
<p> Generally, mortality rates have been decreasing for children of all  		ages. However, several patterns are of concern. First, except for ages 15-19,  		mortality rates are greater among black children than white children. Second,  		mortality rates are still quite high for all children ages 15-19. Low income is  		also associated with higher mortality rates for children (Office of Technology  		Assessment, 1988).</p>
<p> Injury is the leading cause of death among children above 9 months of  		age. Injuries cause about 44% of all deaths in children age 1-4, 51% for ages  		5-9, and 58% for ages 10-14. Motor vehicle accidents account for the largest  		proportion of death (including bicycles and pedestrians), followed by drowning  		and house fires. Injury death rates for children generally declined from 1980  		to 1985, with two exceptions--homicide and juvenile suicide. Between 1980 and  		1985, the rate of teen suicide doubled (Waller, Baker and Szocka, 1989).</p>
<p> It is also important to note that the U.S. falls behind other developed  		countries in child mortality rates, in addition to the infant mortality rate. A  		higher rate of injuries and violence accounts for this, not death from natural  		causes. In 1985, the U.S. child death rates for injuries were one and one half  		to two times as high as in 5 European countries and about one and one half  		times greater than those in Canada, Japan and Australia (American Public Health  		Association, 1989).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> The most important preventive service to combat infant mortality is  		adequate prenatal care for mothers. Children born to mothers who do not receive  		prenatal care are three times more likely to die in infancy. In 1986, about  		220,000 infants were born to mothers who received late prenatal care or no  		prenatal care at all. This represented about 6% of births. Among all age groups  		of mothers, teenagers are the least likely to receive adequate prenatal care.  		The majority of women not receiving prenatal care are low-income and uninsured  		(Hughes, Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu, 1989).</p>
<p> The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 mandated that all States  		extend Medicaid coverage to pregnant women with income up to 75% of the poverty  		level by July 1, 1989 and 100% by July 1, 1990. In addition, States have the  		option of going to 185% of the poverty level for Medicaid coverage of pregnant  		women. To date, only 9 States have opted to extend their coverage of pregnant  		women to the maximum allowable, with another 4 States between 100-185%. Data  		are not available to confirm whether Medicaid's expanded coverage provisions  		are making a significant difference in increasing the number of women receiving  		adequate prenatal care (Hughes, Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu, 1989). In FY1986,  		about 5.1 million AFDC-related adults received Medicaid services, but data are  		not available on the number of women receiving obstetrical care under Medicaid  		(Congressional Research Service, 1988).</p>
<p> The leading cause of child mortality after the first few months of life  		is accidental injuries. In 1984, 7,850 children under age 15,died of such  		injuries. Rivara lists 12 preventive interventions which could significantly  		reduce childhood injury-related deaths:</p>
<ul><li>infant seat restraints in cars,</li>
<li>air bags for front seat car occupants,</li>
<li>helmets for motorcycles,</li>
<li>helmets for bicycles,</li>
<li>expansion and enforcement of the Poison Prevention Package Act,</li>
<li>barriers around swimming pools,</li>
<li>self-extinguishing cigarettes,</li>
<li>smoke detectors,</li>
<li>elimination of handguns,</li>
<li>knowledge of the Heimlich maneuver,</li>
<li>adherence to Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations, and</li>
<li>window bars in windows above first floor (Office of Technology  		  Assessment, 1988).</li>
</ul><h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> Medicaid is the major source of Federal funding for prenatal care and  		delivery. In 1985, Medicaid provided an estimated $1.5 billion for these  		services, $2 billion when neonatal intensive care is included. Federal funding  		for Maternal and Child Health programs in 1987 was $497 million. However,  		combined Federal and State funding for MCH services declined in constant  		dollars by 23.5% between 1981 and 1984 (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988).  		The recent Medicaid expansions may be able to compensate for some of this  		decline in funding in health care for low-income pregnant women.</p>
<p> Data are not readily available on Federal/State expenditures targeted  		to combating child deaths.</p>
<h4>5. Costs per Child</h4>
<p> The costs of prenatal care to Medicaid were estimated in 1983 to be  		about $500 per mother, including both physician and ancillary services.  		Delivery charges were an additional $2100 to $2700 (Howell, 1989). The Office  		of Technology Assessment estimated the costs per mother for prenatal care at  		$380 in 1986. However, this estimate only covered physician services and did  		not include laboratory, x-ray and other services often involved in prenatal  		care (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988).</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> We have estimated that 220,000 women are in need of prenatal care. At  		an average cost of $500 (Medicaid data) per mother to cover prenatal care, the  		cost of extending prenatal services to all uncovered women would be about $110  		million annually, if implemented immediately. Numerous studies have shown the  		cost-effectiveness of prenatal care. The Institute of Medicine has estimated  		that each $1 spent on prenatal care will save up to $11 over a child's lifetime  		(Hughes, Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu, 1989). Similarly, the Office of Technology  		Assessment has indicated that the costs to Medicaid of expanding coverage of  		pregnant women would be totally offset by the savings which would result  		(Office of Technology Assessment, 1988). Conservatively assuming a 50% cost  		savings in the same year, a $55 million cost is estimated.</p>
<p> The Children's Defense Fund has estimated that expanding Medicaid to  		cover all pregnant women with family incomes less than 200% of poverty would  		run about $1 billion a year, when fully implemented. However, this estimate  		appears to take into account the costs of delivery and post-natal care.  		Presumably, the delivery charges (probably at least half this total) would not  		be additional costs to the health care system, since these costs are already  		being absorbed as bad debt, uncompensated care or Medicaid charges (Hughes,  		Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu). Assuming that half the costs are already being  		met, new funding of roughly $500 million would close the gap.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> The literature on reducing infant mortality cites numerous studies on  		the effectiveness of prenatal services in improving birth outcomes (Office of  		Technology Assessment, 1988; and Hughes, Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu, 1989).</p>
<p> Interventions for reducing child mortality rates due to accidental  		injuries are more difficult to assess, particularly in terms of  		cost-effectiveness. Where feasible, automatic protection is the most effective  		intervention. This strategy includes measures such as automatic seatbelts and  		airbags in automobiles and barriers over windows. Interventions which require  		people to change their behaviors are considered less effective. These  		interventions include educating children (and their parents) about the  		importance of wearing safety belts in automobiles and wearing helmets when  		bicycling. Some programs which actually require behavioral change may be more  		effective. These strategies include such regulatory approaches as requiring  		child restraints in automobiles, the installation of smoke detectors in homes,  		and fences around swimming pools (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988).</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> See discussion under Children without Health Care coverage.</p>
<h3>Children Without Health Care Coverage</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> In 1986 about 12.2 million children, or 20% of all children, were  		reported to be without any health insurance coverage. This number does not  		include children on Medicaid. Among children in low-income families, 36% or 5.0  		million children, were without health care coverage. Children in low-income  		working families were the group hardest hit, since many of them are ineligible  		for Medicaid, and employers in low-wage jobs are less likely to provide health  		insurance coverage. Children in poor, single-parent families were the most  		likely to be uninsured, especially if that parent was a full-year worker. About  		53% of children in this group were uninsured in 1986. For children in poor  		two-parent families with a full-time worker, 43% of children were uninsured  		(Chollet, 1986). This pattern is exacerbated for black children. About 70% of  		white children in employed families had health insurance coverage, compared to  		only 49% of black children (Hughes, Johnson, Rosenbaum and Liu, 1989).</p>
<p> There are also problems with underinsurance, even for those children  		who are supposedly covered. Many private employer plans do not cover routine  		preventive services for children. Many plans have high deductibles and  		coinsurance which restrict access. Finally, many plans have service or dollar  		limits.</p>
<p> CPS data suggest that the health insurance coverage of children is  		getting worse instead of better. In 1986, the CPS reported that 19% of children  		under age 13 were uninsured, compared to 17% in 1980 (Office of Technology  		Assessment, 1988). Most analysts attribute this increase to shifting employment  		patterns (more jobs in small businesses without health coverage) and the higher  		cost of insurance (causing many employers to drop coverage or pass more of the  		cost on to employees, making it unaffordable for some) (Butler, 1988).</p>
<p> A final trend of importance relates to Medicaid coverage of poor  		children. In 1978, there were about 984 Medicaid recipients under age 18 per  		1,000 children in poverty. By 1985, this ratio had decreased to 813 per 1,000  		children. Two factors account for Medicaid's eroding coverage of children.  		First, AFDC income eligibility levels have declined in real terms, thus making  		it more difficult many poor children to qualify for Medicaid. Second, an  		increasing proportion of poor children are in two-parent families, a group for  		which Medicaid eligibility is optional and therefore not uniform across States  		(Rymer and Burwell, 1987). However, Federally-mandated expansions in Medicaid  		coverage of low-income children since 1984 may work to reverse this trend.</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> In 1986, 12.2 million children were estimated to be without health  		insurance coverage. This number includes some 300,000 disabled children. About  		5 million of these children live in low-income families. The Medicaid program  		has been the primary strategy for extending health care coverage to poor  		children. In the last five years, numerous mandatory and optional coverage  		provisions have been legislated to expand Medicaid's coverage of children,  		especially infants and very young children. All States are required to extend  		Medicaid coverage to infants whose family income is less than 75% of the  		poverty level by July 1, 1989, with an increase to 100% by July 1, 1990.  		Thirteen States have opted to go up to 185% of the poverty level for infant  		coverage. About 30 States cover children up to age 8 with family incomes below  		the poverty level, while another 6 States cover children of all ages below the  		poverty level.</p>
<p> In FY1986, about 10.2 children received services under Medicaid  		(Congressional Research Service, 1988). As with the Medicaid expansions related  		to pregnant women, data are not yet available to assess whether the number of  		low-income children covered by Medicaid has significantly increased as a result  		of recent Congressional initiatives.</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> In 1987, the Medicaid program spent $6.6 billion on children (excluding  		disabled children). Medicaid is the main source of Federal/State financing for  		low-income children without health care coverage. Data are not available on  		Medicaid expenditures for disabled children.</p>
<h4>5. Costs per Case</h4>
<p> The Medicaid program provides the best numbers for estimating the cost  		of providing health care financing to uncovered children. In 1986, Medicaid  		spent about $521 annually for each AFDC child who utilized any services during  		the year. For children not receiving cash assistance (medically needy  		children), this amount was $707 per child recipient (Congressional Research  		Service, 1988). These averages would be lower if the children who were  		enrolled, but did not use any services during the year, were included.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> We have estimated that 12.2 million children are without health  		insurance coverage. If we use the Medicaid annual cost of $521 per AFDC child  		recipient and assume that about 80% of children would use some services during  		the year, the per child annual cost would be about $415. This yields an  		estimate of just over $5 billion for expanding Medicaid to all children without  		health insurance coverage. If only the 5 million children living below the  		poverty level who do not have health care coverage were included, the expansion  		costs would be just over $2 billion. These numbers may overstate the costs,  		however, since Medicaid in recent years has significantly expanded its coverage  		of children. Recently the Children's Defense Fund estimated the cost of  		expanding Medicaid to cover all children under 200% of the poverty level to be  		only $750 million to $1 billion when fully implemented.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Discussion not necessary for this problem.</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> Numerous polls have shown widespread public support for child health  		programs. A June 1988 poll by Peter Hart Associates reported that 78% of  		American voters felt that "early childhood health programs need more attention  		and resources under the next President" (Hart, 1988). In a Gallup poll, taken  		about the same time, 51% of U.S. adults favored government action to "provide  		adequate-medical care for all who need it but can't afford it <b>even</b> if  		new taxes are needed" to pay for the program (Gallup, 1998). More recently, 61%  		of respondents to a Washington Post-ABC poll conducted in August 1989 favored  		increased federal spending for Medicaid, which provides free health care to the  		poor" (Morin, 1989).</p>
<h3>Pediatric and Adolescent AIDS</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines children with pediatric  		AIDS as children with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS Related  		Complex (ARC) from birth to 13 years of age. Through July 1989, 1,736 children  		with pediatric AIDS had been reported to CDC (CDC, 1989). The vast majority of  		these children were (82%) under 5 years of age at diagnosis. Most contracted  		AIDS before or during birth from HIV-infected parents. The parents who transmit  		AIDS to their children are predominantly IV drug users or partners of IV drug  		users. About 53% of pediatric AIDS cases were black, 24% Hispanic and 23%  		white. Most were reported to live in poor, inner-city areas .</p>
<p> It is important to note that the CDC estimates do not include all  		children with HIV-infection. Some children who test positive for HIV infection  		and who have symptoms of the illness do not meet CDC criteria for AIDS. Data  		from localities with large numbers of children with AIDS report from 2 to 4  		times more children with HIV infection than the number of children meeting CDC  		AIDS criteria (Margolis, Baughman, Flynt and Kotler, 1988).</p>
<p> CDC estimates that there will be 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children  		under 13 years of age by 1991, with about 3,000 meeting the official CDC  		definition. In 1987, the prevalence of HIV infection among newborns was 0.2% in  		Massachusetts and 0.8% in New York. Some sections of New York City reported a  		prevalence rate of 3% for newborns in 1987.</p>
<p> By September 1988, about 850 cases of AIDS among adolescents aged 13-21  		were reported to CDC. Regional and local studies suggest this number is  		doubling every year (Select Committee for Children, Youth and Families, 1988  		(b)). Among these cases, about 50% were reported to be homosexual or bisexual  		males, 12% intravenous drug users, 9% heterosexuals, with the balance including  		those infected by blood products or other modes of transmission. However,  		merely reporting the number of adolescents with full-blown AIDS understates the  		problem of AIDS for adolescents. Because of the long delay from infection to  		diagnosis of AIDS (7-8 years on average), many persons with AIDS reported among  		the age group over age 21 were infected during their teenage years.</p>
<p> (Unless otherwise cited, data in this section were taken from Hughes,  		Johnson, Rosenbaum, and Liu, 1989.)</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> There are two groups in need of services related to pediatric and  		adolescent AIDS: children with the disease who need treatment and children and  		adults who need to be educated about the disease to prevent its spread. The  		number of children requiring treatment is escalating daily, as reported  		earlier. The CDC estimates there will be 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children  		under age 13 by 1991. As of July 1989, about 1,736 children with AIDS had been  		reported to CDC. The most recent data on adolescents with AIDS is for September  		1988, at which time 85.0 cases had been reported to CDC. Presumably, all these  		children received services.</p>
<p> Until recently, hospital-based care has been the only placement  		available for some infants--so-called "boarder babies." In many instances, the  		parents cannot help because they also are infected, they are drug-addicted,  		they lack necessary supportive services, or they have abandoned their children.  		A New Jersey program has reported that 40% of the children with AIDS are under  		State protective services. Efforts are underway in many States to develop  		specialized foster care programs, respite care or other community-based  		services for children with AIDS (Select Committee on Children, Youth and  		Families, 1988(b)).</p>
<p> Many target groups are in need of preventive services. Drug abusers are  		expected to account for the largest increase in AIDS infection. This group  		accounts for 70% of perinatally transmitted AIDS cases. Currently, treatment  		reaches only about 12% of the estimated 1.2-1.3 million intravenous drug  		abusers in the United States (Select Committee on Children, Youth and Fami ies,  		1988(b)). Services can range from methadone maintenance to preventive education  		to residential treatment programs.</p>
<p> Education is a critical preventive service. AIDS education in public  		schools has been mandated in only about half of the States. The President's  		Advisory Commission on HIV Infection recommended "age appropriate,  		comprehensive health education programs in our nation's schools, in  		kindergarten through grade twelve."</p>
<p> A target group for education involves sexually active adolescents. In  		1982, about 64% of boys and 44% of girls were reported to be sexually active by  		age 18. The proportion of sexually active teenagers is higher among low-income  		and minority groups (Hayes, 1987).</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> $16 million of the Administration's FY1988 request for AIDS research at  		NIH was targeted specifically for children. For FY1987, $6.5 million was made  		available by CDC for school health prevention efforts (Select Committee on  		Children, Youth and Families, 1988(a)).</p>
<p> HCFA estimates that Medicaid expenditures for AIDS will reach $2.4  		billion by 1992, compared to an estimated $940 million for FY 1989. HCFA  		estimates that nationally 40% of all patients with AIDS are served under  		Medicaid (Roper, 1987). No separate estimates on Medicaid expenditures for  		children with AIDS are available.</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Child</h4>
<p> California officials reported in 1988 the costs of treating pediatric  		AIDS children to be about $6,375 monthly in a hospital setting (under Medicaid  		reimbursement, compared to $1,700-$2,000 monthly for specialized foster care  		per child (Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988 (b)). The  		Presidential Commission on AIDS estimated that the lifetime hospital costs for  		a person with AIDS was about $100,000, with annual treatment costs at  		approximately $40,000 (Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency  		Virus Epidemic, 1988). The California data suggest that the costs of treating  		children with AIDS may be higher.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Based on estimates reported in an earlier section, it seems reasonable  		to assume that 3,000 children under age 13 with a positive diagnosis of AIDS or  		ARC (not just HIV-positive), will require services by 1991. At $100,000 per  		case, pediatric AIDS costs will then reach $300 million cumulatively, with most  		of these children expected to be dependent on Medicaid. However, this estimate  		does not include the cost of services to children with HIV-infection who do not  		meet CDC's definition. Data are not available on the cost per case for this  		latter group of children.</p>
<p> If the number of adolescents with AIDS doubles annually, by 1991, the  		total will have reached almost 7,000. This would imply cumulative expenditures  		of about $700 million to provide lifetime health care services for them.</p>
<p> Data were not available to estimate the costs of providing adequate  		services to educate children and adults about AIDS prevention.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> The Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Sciences recently  		reported that the expansion of drug treatment programs is a cost effective  		strategy for reducing IV drug use and thus reducing the spread of AIDS. The  		Office of Technology Assessment reported that "although education on AIDS and  		sexuality appears to increase adolescent knowledge, there is little evidence  		that youth translate such knowledge into changes in their risk behaviors"  		(Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988 (b)).</p>
<h3>Mental Health Problems of Children</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> From 12-15% of children under 18 years of age (7.5 to 9.5 million  		children) are reported to have mental health problems severe enough to require  		treatment (Office of Technology Assessment, 1986). The most commonly cited  		disorders are depression, conduct disorders, eating disorders, attention  		deficit disorders/hyperactivity, autism, psychosis and suicide (Select  		Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988(a)).</p>
<p> The number of suicides among teenagers has been increasing. The suicide  		rate of teenagers has doubled since 1960. This increase has mainly occurred  		among white males. In 1984, about 1,900 teenagers committed suicide, for a rate  		of 10.9 per 100,000 teenagers (National Association of Children's Hospitals and  		Related Institutions, 1989).</p>
<p> An estimated 70-80% of emotionally disturbed children get inappropriate  		mental health services or no services at all (Office of Technology Assessment,  		1986).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children in Need/Service Population</h4>
<p> The Office of Technology Assessment estimated that the majority of the  		7.5 to 9.5 million children in 1986 who had <b>mental health problems</b>  		either got inappropriate mental health services or no services at all. Often,  		the lack of services is a coverage problem since most private and public health  		insurance plans (including Medicaid) offer very limited mental health services  		or none at all. In addition, shortages exist in all forms of child mental  		health care, particularly community-based care, case management and  		coordination across educational, judicial and other child serving agencies  		(Office of Technology Assessment, 1986).</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> In FY 1987, about $248 million went to mental health services under the  		Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Block Grant to States. It is not known  		what portion of these monies go to mental health services for children.  		However, in 1985 GAO survey found that some States chose not to fund children's  		services at all with the block grant money. In FY 1985, about $50 million was  		spent on children and youth-related services by NIMH. This represents about 21%  		of total NIMH expenditures. The federal Child and Adolescent Service System  		Program spent $4.7 million in FY 1986 to help states and localities develop  		better systems of care for emotionally disturbed children and adolescents  		(Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988(a)). Data are not  		available on Medicaid expenditures for child mental health problems.</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Child</h4>
<p> Data were not available on the cost per child of providing mental  		health services.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Data were not available to calculate the overall costs of providing  		services to children not receiving mental health services or those receiving  		inappropriate mental health services.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Data were not readily available on the effectiveness of mental health  		services for children, although as cited above, the Office of Technology  		Assessment has reported that many children in need of services often receive  		inappropriate care.</p>

<h2><a name="adolescenttrouble" id="adolescenttrouble">ADOLESCENTS IN TROUBLE</a></h2>
<h4>1. Definition of the Problem Area</h4>
<p> This summary focuses on four problem areas that affect U.S. teenagers:  		Adolescent Pregnancy, Substance Abuse, Runaway Youth and Educational/Employment  		Deficits. Although each of these problems is discussed separately, these  		problems are actually highly correlated. As a result, the newest recommended  		prevention strategies are early intervention programs that comprehensively  		attempt to prevent what is now seen as a syndrome of problems. Although  		treatment programs for these problems once they occur remain highly  		specialized, programs oriented to preventing these problems among adolescents  		often combine multiple interventions like health education and promotion,  		academic skills building, job training and career/life planning to intervene  		simultaneously on all problem fronts.</p>
<p> While the number of teenagers grew during the 1960's and early 1970's,  		peaking in 1976, they have steadily declined since then. In 1986, there were  		approximately 22 million youth between the ages of 14-19 years, and they made  		up 9 percent of the total population (U.S. Department of Education, 1988). The  		decline in the youth population is expected to continue into the 1990's. The  		demographic shift has important implications for our future society and  		economy. Labor shortages may be a problem in the near future.</p>
<h3>Adolescent Pregnancy</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> Teenage pregnancy is now recognized as one of the most widespread and  		costly problems plaguing American youth today. Each year approximately one  		million young women in the U.S. become pregnant and just over half a million  		bear children. These figures mean that approximately 11 percent of women  		between the ages of 15-19 annually experience a pregnancy, close to half (44%)  		become pregnant at least once during their teens, and one-fifth become mothers.  		Among black women the rates of pregnancy are 50 percent higher and the rates of  		childbearing are double. The United States has twice the adolescent pregnancy  		rate of other developed nations like Canada, Great Britain, France, Sweden or  		the Netherlands.</p>
<p> Bearing a child during adolescence is extremely costly for the young  		woman and her child. Young mothers and their babies disproportionately  		experience life threatening and expensive health problems. Educational  		attainment and job prospects suffer. Poverty and welfare dependency are likely,  		and even more likely, if the birth occurs out-of-wedlock (Hayes, 1987).  		One-third of all teenage mothers receive AFDC (Weder, n.d.) and it has been  		estimated that two-thirds of teenage mothers receive AFDC at some time during  		the 10 years following the birth (Wertheimer and Moore, 1982). In 1985,  		families started by teenage mothers cost the nation an estimated $16.5 billion  		in AFDC, Food Stamps and Medicaid benefits; over half of these expenses were  		borne by the Federal government (Burt, 1986), with the balance paid by State  		and local governments.</p>
<p> Over the 1970's the number of adolescent pregnancies increased and the  		pregnancy rate rose from 9.4 percent in 1972 to 10.5 percent in 1978. Since the  		late 1970's the declining adolescent population resulted in a fall in the  		number of teen pregnancies, but the teen pregnancy rate continued to climb to a  		high of 11.1 percent among young women in 1980 and 1981. Since then the rates  		have stabilized between 10.9 and 11.0 percent. The most recent calculate  		pregnancy rate is 10.98 percent of women ages 15-19 in 1985 (Child Trends,  		1989).</p>
<p> The abortion rate among teenagers increased over the 1970's and has  		remained level in the 1980's. The abortion rate among young women ages 15-19  		was an estimated 4.4 percent in 1985 and the number of abortions was 399,200  		(Child Trends, 1989).</p>
<p> The birthrate among teenagers declined in the 1970's and has fluctuated  		around 5 percent in the 19801s; it was 5.1 percent among 15-19 year old women  		in 1985. In 1986 472,000 births occurred to young women under the age of 20  		(Child Trends, 1989).</p>
<p> Rates of pregnancy, birth and abortion are all substantially higher for  		non-white than for white teens. Child bearing among <b>unmarried</b> teens has  		risen. The proportion of teen births occurring outside of marriage has  		quadrupled since 1960, from 15 percent to 61 percent with most of this rise  		occurring among white teen births (Child Trends, 1989).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> Teenagers in need of assistance can be divided into those who need  		prevention programs and those who need supportive services once they are  		pregnant and parenting.</p>
<p> All teenagers are potentially at risk of initiating sexual activity  		which may result in unintended pregnancies. In 1988, the following proportions  		of U.S. teenagers were estimated to be sexually experienced:</p>

</tr></table><p> Prevention programs aimed at promoting the postponement of sexual  		activity and the promotion of safe sex need to reach children and adolescents  		before they initiate sexual intercourse. The above data indicate programs  		should certainly start in the early teen years, before age 15 and provide  		reinforcement afterwards. Population projections indicate that in 1990 there  		will be 16.8 million 10-14 year old adolescents in the U.S. (Hayes, 1987).</p>
<p> Once teenagers become sexually active, effective contraception is the  		most efficacious means to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy. In 1990 an  		estimated 5.2 million males 15-19 and an estimated 4.2 million females ages  		15-19 will be sexually active. Some teens will be effective contraceptors, but  		the majority will not and will therefore be in need of prevention services.</p>
<p> In 1986, there were approximately 472,000 births to teenage females  		under age 20. Approximately 293,000 were births to 18 and 19 year old women,  		169,000 were to 15-17 year olds, and 10,000 were to girls under the age of 15.  		While some of the women over the age of 18 may need supportive services, the  		179,000 young mothers under the age of 18 are appropriate to target as a  		population in need of services.</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> The last decade has seen the emergence of public recognition that  		adolescent pregnancy is a social problem needing remedy. Programs have been  		developed to assist teens once they are pregnant to avoid the many negative  		consequences of an early birth. A second focus has been on preventing these  		pregnancies in the first place.</p>
<p> Around the country programs that provide a range of health, education,  		and employment services to pregnant and parenting teenagers have been developed  		under the aegis of schools, hospitals, health departments, and even welfare  		departments. Funding has been provided by States, national and local  		foundations, United Ways and the Federal government. In these programs the most  		prominent Federal role has probably come through Medicaid reimbursement for  		necessary health services.</p>
<p> The Federal Office of Adolescent Pregnancy was established to  		coordinate the Federal role and to provide funding for comprehensive service  		models for pregnant and parenting teens. It provides grant funds to  		demonstration programs all over the country under the auspices of the  		Adolescent Family Life legislation. (The Family Support Administration of DHHS  		and the Department of Labor have also recently funded demonstration programs  		for pregnant and parenting teens.)</p>
<p> The Federal role in prevention programs has been primarily through the  		Office of Adolescent Pregnancy which funds prevention programs aimed at  		reducing levels of sexual activity among teens and the Office of Family  		Planning which funds for contraceptive services for teens as well as older  		women under Title X ($140 million in FY 88). Other popular local prevention  		programs include school-based health clinics (funded by foundations, health and  		education departments) and sex education/AIDS programs in schools which have  		increased dramatically since 1982 (funded by education and health  		departments).</p>
<h4>5. Costs Per Child</h4>
<p> The cost for sex and family life education to prevent adolescent  		pregnancies is estimated at about $10 annually per child (based on data from  		the State of Illinois). The cost for contraceptive services is estimated at $75  		annually per patient at a family planning clinic and at $125 annually per  		student in a school-based clinic (includes a range of other health services).  		The cost for comprehensive care programs for pregnant and parenting teens is  		estimated to range from $2,650 - $4,000 (in 1983 dollars) per program  		participant (Hayes, 1987).</p>
<h4>6. Costs to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> The overall cost of providing sex/family life education for 10-14 year  		old adolescents is estimated at $168 million ($10 x 16.8 million). About $315  		million is estimated as the cost required to provide contraceptive services for  		sexually active 15-19 year old girls ($75 x 4.2 million). Meeting the need for  		comprehensive care programs for pregnant and parenting mothers (under 18) and  		their babies is estimated at $716 million ($4,000 x 179,000).</p>
<p> The gross cost of $1.2 billion presupposes that none of these services  		are currently covered. The estimate needs to factor out the numbers of  		teenagers who are already in sex education programs, contraceptive services and  		comprehensive care programs. Roughly assuming that about half of the need is  		already met through existing programs, private health insurance, etc., a net  		cost of $600 million is estimated.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> The evidence about primary prevention programs oriented to postponing  		sexual activity among teenagers has been very poor because of weak evaluation  		designs. The only program that has shown some impact on teens delaying sexual  		activity is a Baltimore program which set up a storefront clinic nearby a  		junior and senior high school to provide contraception in the clinic in  		addition to providing educational programs in the schools.</p>
<p> The evidence about the effects of sex education are mixed. Teens who  		have had sex education report higher rates of contraception than other teens;  		however, it is unclear whether sex education has any impact on sexual activity  		rates. The National Academy of Sciences, after reviewing all the available  		research evidence, concluded that the "most effective intervention for reducing  		early unintended pregnancy in sexually active teenagers is diligent  		contraceptive use (Hayes, 1987)." A number of communities have developed "life  		option" prevention programs that combine sex education and contraceptive  		services with job training, career preparation, dropout prevention and  		educational enrichment. Evaluation results are not yet available.</p>
<p> Programs providing comprehensive health and social support services to  		pregnant and parenting teens report lower incidence of costly health problems  		at the time of the baby's birth. The evidence from 2 year followups on program  		participants has not been as conclusive about the impact of these programs on  		mother's educational status, welfare dependency and subsequent pregnancies.  		However, new evidence from one such demonstration program, Project Redirection,  		suggests that 5 years after program participation the mothers were working more  		hours, had higher average weekly earnings, and lower rates of AFDC  		participation than a comparison group of mothers. The children of former  		Project Redirection participants scored better on vocabulary tests, problem  		behavior scales and had more stimulating home environments (Polit, 1988).</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> When adolescents are asked to name the "biggest problem facing  		teenagers", teen pregnancy is the third most frequent problem cited (after drug  		and alcohol abuse). In 1987 over 10 percent said it was a leading problem.  		Among young women this rose to almost one in five and among black teens to  		almost one in four. In contrast, a 1985 survey only found 3 percent of teens  		thought it was a major problem. In this same survey, a quarter of teens  		reported at least some peer pressure to have sex (Bezilla, 1988).</p>
<p> Youth are aware of the seriousness of teen pregnancy and motherhood. In  		the 1987 wave of the National Survey of Children, 70 to 85 percent of 18 to 22  		year olds agreed that "becoming an unmarried mother is one of the worst things  		that could happen to a 16 year old girl." Almost as many agreed that being an  		unmarried father was "one of the worst things that could happen to a 16 year  		old boy." (Moore and Stief, 1989).</p>
<h3>Substance Abuse</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> The most prevalent drugs used by young people are, in decreasing order,  		alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, stimulants, sedatives and tranquilizers, cocaine,  		hallucinogens and inhalants, and heroin. According to a 1986 national survey of  		high school seniors, nearly 60 percent reported that they had tried an illicit  		drug; more than two-thirds had used cigarettes, and 91 percent had used alcohol  		(Falco, 1988).</p>
<p> From the mid-1960's until 1980 adolescent drug use rose sharply. Since  		1980 the reported use of controlled substances, except cocaine, among  		adolescents has declined; but the levels of use are still very high. The 1986  		survey of high school seniors found the reported incidence of drug use <b>in  		the previous 30 days</b> to be as follows:</p>
<table><tr><td>Alcohol</td>
<td>64%</td>
<td>Marijuana</td>
<td>18%</td>
</tr><tr><td>Stimulants</td>
<td>5%</td>
<td>Cocaine</td>
<td>3%</td>
</tr><tr><td>LSD</td>
<td>2%</td>
<td>PCP/Psychedelic</td>
<td>0.3%</td>
</tr><tr><td>Heroin</td>
<td>0.2%</td>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
</tr><tr><td colspan="4">(Source: Child Trends, 1989)</td>
</tr></table><p> A further source of concern is that since 1980, first-time drug use  		appears to be occurring at younger ages. The percentage of students using drugs  		by the 6th grade has tripled in the last 10 years (Falco, 1988). A 1987  		nationwide survey of eighth grade students found that three-quarters had used  		alcohol--with more than one-quarter saying that they had had 5 or more drinks  		at one sitting during the preceding two-week period. Five percent of the eighth  		graders reported using marijuana in the preceding month (Otten, 1989).</p>
<p> Cocaine and crack use among teenagers is increasingly problematic. The  		use of cocaine among high school seniors rose to 7 percent in 1985 and appears  		to have dropped to 3 percent in 1988. But the daily use of cocaine has doubled  		and more seniors report difficulties in stopping cocaine use. The recent  		emergence of crack, a powerful form of smokeable cocaine, is a major health  		threat among adolescents because it is packaged and sold in units that are  		affordable for most teenagers. Because of lag time in data collection, national  		surveys do not yet provide an accurate picture of crack use, but most recent  		surveys show a substantial increase in the proportion of adolescents who have  		smoked cocaine (Falco, 1988). Recently, there has been awareness of a new  		problem--infants born to drug users. Drug-exposed infants exhibit a wide range  		of physical and developmental difficulties.</p>
<p> Federal efforts to deal with the drug problem consist of supply control  		efforts--law enforcement and legal restrictions on availability--and demand  		side reduction efforts involving prevention, education and treatment. Between  		1980 and 1986 the major emphasis of Federal drug policy has been on restricting  		the supply of drugs. Funding for drug law enforcement has increased by more  		than $700 million while Federal support for drug abuse services declined  		approximately 40 percent (Falco, 1988; U.S. House of Representatives, Select  		Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988). Despite the law enforcement  		efforts, supplies of illicit drugs have continued to grow, while treatment  		programs have not.</p>
<p> The Anti-Drug Abuse Act passed in October, 1986 provides $1.7 billion  		in new money for law enforcement, treatment, prevention, education, and  		international narcotic control efforts. The Act broke down previous  		bureaucratic barriers which separated alcohol, tobacco and drug prevention  		efforts. The newly created Office of Substance Abuse Prevention within the  		Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration will focus on substances  		regardless of their legal status, particularly those which pose the greatest  		risk to young people--alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and cocaine (Falco,  		1988).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> Treatment for compulsive drug/alcohol use is needed by approximately 5  		to 15 percent of the teenagers who experiment with drugs and alcohol. In 1986  		the Drug Abuse Warning Network which reports hospital emergency room admissions  		reported that there were 13,343 drug abuse episodes involving adolescents ages  		10-17 and 7,393 episodes involving young people ages 18 and 19.</p>
<p> Very little is known about the population of young people in treatment.  		The last available nationwide figures are for 1981 when 12 percent of the total  		treatment population was under 18.</p>
<p> Very little work has been done on developing treatment programs  		specifically designed for adolescent drug and alcohol abusers. In 1982 only 5  		percent of the 3,000 substance abuse facilities surveyed by the National  		Institutes of Drug Abuse (NIDA) and Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) served  		predominantly adolescent populations. The majority of adolescents in treatment  		are in programs like drop-in centers, clinics which provide psychotherapy and  		family therapy, and activity programs like stress challenge experiences and  		camping. The next largest group of adolescents receive treatment in residential  		programs. In recent years there has been a rapid growth of private residential  		adolescent treatment programs operated by for-profit corporations which are not  		supported by public funds (Falco, 1988).</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> In 1985 annual appropriations of Federal funds for drug law enforcement  		were $1.65 billion. Drug prevention and treatment programs received $400  		million in Federal dollars. Although current information is not available about  		non-Federal expenditures in treatment programs, in 1982 Federal expenditures  		made up 24 percent of the total expenditures and the remaining 76 percent came  		from State governments (31 percent), local governments (8 percent), health  		insurance (20 percent), client fees (10 percent) and other sources (8 percent)  		(Polich, Ellickson, Reuter and Kahan, 1984).</p>
<p> The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act provides $3 billion for law enforcement  		and $930 million for treatment, education and prevention (Falco, 1988).</p>
<h4>5. Costs Per Child</h4>
<p> In 1982, $533.6 million was spent serving 173,479 clients at an average  		cost of $3,075 per client (Polich et al., 1984).</p>
<h4>6. Costs to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Estimates not available.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> There is little systematic data on the effectiveness of adolescent drug  		treatment programs. The few studies that have been done suffer from the absence  		of comparison groups. These studies have found that adolescent clinics do  		little to reduce marijuana and alcohol use although other positive outcomes  		occur like reduction in criminal activities and opiate use. Evaluation research  		on residential programs had shown a high correlation between length of  		treatment and reduced alcohol and drug use (Falco, 1988).</p>
<p> Evaluations of drug education programs which have focused on increasing  		knowledge levels or fostering stronger self images have found little evidence  		of impact on drug taking behaviors. The most recent approach to prevention, and  		the most promising, are "social influence" programs which increase students'  		awareness of social and peer pressures to experiment with substances and which  		teach them specific techniques to resist these pressures. Some preliminary  		evaluations of smoking prevention programs based on this model show significant  		impacts (Falco, 1988). A recent comprehensive school/community drug prevention  		project has been considered relatively successful and was associated with  		decreased alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use (Pentz, et al., 1989).</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> Drugs and efforts to combat drug use are among the most visible news  		stories in recent months. Newspapers have given front page coverage to shocking  		stories of female crack users trading sex for drugs, giving birth to addict  		babies, and abusing their children. In 1987, two thirds of New York child abuse  		fatalities were drug-related (Besharov, 1989). The public sees drug use at the  		nexus of related problems of violent crime, health and mental health problems,  		child abuse, and AIDS.</p>
<p> National polls indicate that public concern about combatting drug abuse  		exceeds worry about nuclear war (Falco, 1988). Public concern about the drug  		problem has reached record levels: in August 1989, 44 percent felt drugs were  		the nation's biggest problem. As of two years ago, less than 10 percent would  		have ranked drugs as the number one problem (Morin, 1989). Even adolescents are  		aware of the problem: a 1988 poll found 60 percent of adolescents ranking drugs  		as the number one problem, with alcohol abuse ranking number two (Bezilla,  		1988).</p>
<p> The public is willing to spend money to fight drugs. As of 1989, 76  		percent of those polled favored increased federal spending on the "Federal  		anti-drug program" and half wanted funding for drug programs increased (Morin,  		1989). Other surveys have repeatedly shown public support for increased  		government efforts to combat drug abuse, even if this meant more spending  		(Gallup Poll, 1988).</p>
<h3>Runaway Youth</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> There are indications that runaways are increasingly young people with  		serious problems. The National Network of Runaway and Youth Services, an  		organization of approximately 1,000 community based youth-serving agencies,  		reported that in 1985 60 percent of the 300 shelter programs served had seen  		higher proportions of youth with multiple problems than before. Almost half the  		youths had experienced abuse or neglect, needed specialized treatment, or had  		been involved with the juvenile justice system. Federally funded shelters  		report that between 1978 and 1985, the number of youth with serious problems  		(serious emotional disturbances, drug abuse, school dropouts) rose as well as  		the number of youths who had been in the care of other human service systems  		like foster care, mental health or juvenile justice facilities (Children's  		Defense Fund, 1988).</p>
<p> While many runaway youth return home within a short period of time, a  		growing proportion cannot. In FY 1987 approximately 53 percent of the youths in  		Federally funded shelters returned home, 37 percent went into other stable  		situations--relatives, friends, foster care, group homes or independent living  		programs, and 10 percent had no designated destination. These youth are  		especially vulnerable to crime, prostitution, drug abuse and HIV  		transmission.</p>
<p> The Runaway Youth Act was enacted in 1974 as Title III of the Juvenile  		Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. In 1980 the Act was expanded to address  		the needs of homeless youth as well. Funding has increased from $11 million in  		FY 1982 to $26 million in FY 1987. This funding provides assistance to local  		communities for centers which provide shelter and counseling to runaway youth.  		In addition, it funds the National Runaway Switchboard, which has operated for  		the last 10 years (Children's Defense Fund, 1988).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> Approximately 1.2 million to 1.5 million children and adolescents ages  		10-17 run away from home each year in the United States, not including the many  		others who run away from foster care or residential placements (Children's  		Defense Fund 1988). Statistics are not available about the numbers of these  		children and adolescents who are provided assistance. In FY 1987 Federally  		funded centers reported serving 340,000 youth; 85,000 received shelter and  		ongoing services, and 255,000 more were served on a drop-in basis. Shelters are  		reported to turn way many youth because no space is available. Many other youth  		have no place to go when they leave shelters. It has been estimated that  		shelters nationwide serve only about one-fifth of those needing services. Most  		shelters have limited beds and can house youths for no longer than 2 weeks  		(Children's Defense Fund, 1988).</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> In FY 1987 the Federal government appropriated $23.2 million for  		runaway youth; in FY 1988 the appropriation was $26.1 million. In addition to  		Federal funds, an unknown amount of State, local and private funds supported  		programs for runaway youth (Children's Defense Fund, 1988).</p>
<h4>5. Costs Per Child</h4>
<p> In FY 1987 $23.2 million was used to serve 340,000 youths at an average  		cost of $68 per person. Costs to provide services beyond simple shelter would  		be substantially more.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> For various reasons, it seems likely that a large number of runaway  		youth would not enter shelter programs even if they were available. Assuming  		that about half of runaway youth might use shelters and that 20 percent are now  		using them, a net $39 million in increased shelter funding would provide  		additional services needed at the current cost per year. Some of these costs  		might be absorbed into other programs, such as those for homelessness or child  		abuse.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Evaluations of runaway youth programs do not appear to have been  		conducted.</p>
<h3>Educational/Employment Deficits</h3>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> Over the past three decades, teenagers in the U.S. have experienced  		remarkable educational gains. In 1960, 39 percent of 25-29 year olds had not  		completed high school; but by 1986 the proportion had fallen to 14 percent. The  		gains have been even more remarkable for the non-white population. While 61  		percent of 25-29 year old non-whites in 1960 had not completed high school, the  		proportion was 16 percent in 1986 (U.S. Department of Education, 1988).</p>
<p> Young adults are completing more years of education; however, the  		proportion completing college has not changed significantly since 1975. Also,  		while school drop-out rates have fallen, the rates remain high in concentrated  		areas with large poverty populations. In the city of Boston, for example, the  		odds that a sophomore in public schools will complete high school are 50  		percent.</p>
<p> As education levels have risen, so has the importance of education in  		ensuring earnings capacity. Overall, the real incomes of young male workers  		have fallen between 1973 and 1986, but young men with the least education have  		experienced the greatest drops. Between 1973 and 1986 the mean annual income of  		a male high school dropout age 20-24 fell 26 percent from $11,939 to $8,859 (in  		1985 dollars). The mean annual income of male college graduates only fell by 6  		percent from $14,357 to $13,502 (in 1985 dollars) and the mean annual income of  		black college graduates actually rose by 16 percent (Sum and Fogg cited in  		William T. Grant Foundation Commission on Work, Family and Citizenship,  		1988).</p>
<p> In this same period 1973 to 1984 the proportion of young men,  		especially black young men, without incomes and earnings has grown  		significantly. In 1973 only 7.3 percent of young men ages 20-24 reported no  		earnings, and by 1984 the proportion had risen to 12 percent. This rise is not  		the result of college students failing to seek employment, it is the failure of  		young men with limited education to obtain any employment. Among black dropouts  		14 percent had no earnings in 1973 compared to 43 percent in 1984 (Berlin and  		Sum, 1988). Across racial groups, 1 in 4 high school dropouts is  		unemployed.</p>
<p> On virtually every major standardized test, minorities and the poor are  		concentrated in the bottom fifth of the test score distribution. On average,  		black and Hispanic scores are 70 percent of white scores. Although the gap has  		closed markedly over the past few years, it remains large. Children with basic  		skill deficiencies are 9 times more likely to drop out of school, 8 times more  		likely to have an out-of-wedlock birth, and 4 times more likely to become  		welfare dependent--holding constant the effects of sex, race and family income  		(Berlin and Sum, 1988).</p>
<p> Although State and local government are the primary payors for  		education, the Federal government has provided leadership in funding  		compensatory education. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  		of 1965 was the Federal government's first major effort to provide compensatory  		education services to educationally disadvantaged and low income students to  		keep them from falling behind their more advantaged peers. In 1981 the program  		was substantially revised and became Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation  		and Improvement Act, under which the program is currently authorized (U.S.  		House of Representatives, Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families,  		1988). Federal funding for compensatory education under Chapter 1 fell by $200  		million in inflation adjusted dollars between 1981 and 1988. In 1980 Chapter 1  		served 75 percent of all poor children; by 1985 this proportion had fallen to  		54 percent (Children's Defense Fund, 1988).</p>
<p> During the past two decades the Federal government has made several  		efforts to increase employment and earnings prospects for youth. Between the  		1960's and the early 1980's Federal outlays on youth employment services were  		mostly for work experience programs. The Comprehensive Employment and Training  		Act of 1974 (CETA) provided funds to State and local governments for employment  		and training services. Under CETA the largest youth programs were the Youth  		Employment and Training Program (YETP), the Summer Youth Employment Program,  		and the Youth Community Conservation Improvement Program. The Job Training  		Partnership Act of 1983 replaced CETA as the Federal government's major  		employment and training program for disadvantaged youth. Two Federal  		programs--the Job Corps and the Summer Youth Employment Program--have remained  		intact since the 1960's. In recent years, the policy thrust of the Federal  		government has been to provide leadership in calling for excellence in  		education.</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> In 1988, between 750,000-950,000 or 25 percent of U.S. high school  		students left public school without graduating. In 1987, 700,000 students  		graduated but were as deficient in basic skills and work habits as most  		dropouts (U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on Children, Youth  		and Families, 1988).</p>
<p> In 1985, 4.9 million students--about 50 percent of those estimated to  		be in need--received compensatory education services. Approximately 14 percent  		of all students from kindergarten to the 8th grade are enrolled in Chapter 1  		compensatory education programs (U.S. House of Representatives, Select  		Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988).</p>
<p> In 1986, 2.1 million youth ages 16-21 were unemployed. Approximately  		1.1 million youth participated in the Job Corps, JTPA Title IIA programs or  		Summer Youth Programs (U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on  		Children, Youth and Families, 1988).</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> In FY 1988 the Federal government spent $4.4 billion on compensatory  		education programs, $147 million on bilingual education, $5.5 billion on  		student financial assistance (college and university), $2.6 billion on  		guaranteed student loans (college and university) and $206 million on services  		for disadvantaged first generation college students (the TRIO program).</p>
<p> In the same year the JTPA program was funded at $3.4 billion with $718  		million for the Summer Youth program and $716 for the Jobs Corps.</p>
<h4>5. Costs Per Child</h4>
<p> Compensatory education costs average about $750 per year per child. Job  		Corps costs average about $5,100 per participant (1977).</p>
<h4>6. Costs to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Not estimated.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Studies of the effects of compensatory education show statistically  		significant gains in reading and mathematics over a year, narrowing of  		achievement gap between black and other elementary students and improvement in  		achievement as a result of substantial parent involvement (U.S. House of  		Representatives, Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1988).</p>
<p> Evaluations of youth employment and training programs show that when  		the programs combine remedial education, training and well-structured work  		experience, improvements in employability and wages result. Interventions have  		been successful in helping students to remain in school and have reduced  		slimmer learning loss.</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> President Bush struck a responsive chord with the public when he  		announced that he wanted to be the "Education President." Americans are very  		concerned about the quality of education and the importance of building good  		skills and opportunities for American youth. These are perceived as vital and  		necessary investments in our future. In recent years, the importance of this  		has penetrated even the business community. The corporate sector has begun to  		show interest in upgrading the skills of its future work force. Faced with a  		shrinking number of youth entering the labor pool, many companies have joined a  		campaign to improve education (preschool through post-secondary) opportunities  		for children and adolescents at risk of educational and employment deficits  		(Committee for Economic Development, 1985).</p>

<p> When parents are having difficulties which jeopardize the health and  		well-being of their children, the child welfare system is supposed to provide  		substitutes for family functions if necessary, provide services to improve  		family functioning, and insure that the children are protected. This summary  		divides problems of child welfare services into three areas. The first area is  		Child Abuse and Neglect, since most children enter the child welfare system as  		a result of allegations of child maltreatment. Because many children require  		temporary placement outside the home for their protection and well-being, the  		Adequacy of Foster Care Services is the second problem area. For those children  		in need of permanent placement outside their birth families, the Adequacy of  		Adoption Services is the third problem area.</p>
<h3>Child Abuse and Neglect</h3>
<h4>1. Definition of Problem Area</h4>
<p> No standarized definition of child abuse exists. However, child  		maltreatment may be categorized into four classifications: physical abuse,  		neglect, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment.</p>
<ul><li>Physical abuse--nonaccidental injury which may include severe  		  beatings, burns, strangulation or human bites.</li>
<li>Neglect--the failure to provide a child with the basic necessities of  		  life: food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education.</li>
<li>Sexual abuse--the exploitation of a child for the sexual  		  gratification of an adult, as in rape, incest, fondling of the genitals,  		  exhibitionism, or pornography.</li>
<li>Emotional maltreatment--a pattern of behavior that attacks a child's  		  emotional development and sense of self worth. Examples include constant  		  criticizing, belittling, insulting, rejecting, and providing no love, support  		  or guidance.</li>
</ul><p> Child abuse is not typically just one attack or one instance of a  		failure to meet a child's needs. Usually child abuse involves a pattern of  		behavior which continues over a period of time. The longer the duration, the  		more difficult it is to stop and the more serious become the consequences to  		the child.</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> The exact scope of child maltreatment in this country is subject to  		wide debate. Interviews with random samples of households or individuals  		consistently project higher incidence and prevalence rates than indicated by  		formal reporting data. Household surveys on the level of intimate violence in  		America confirm that a minimum of 1.0 million children ages 3-17 residing in  		two parent families are subject to serious physical abuse each year (Straus,  		Gelles and Steinmetz, 1980; Straus and Gelles, 1986). However, these numbers  		focus on only a portion of all maltreatment. They provide few, if any, insights  		into the number of children who experience chronic emotional maltreatment or  		fall victim to sexual abuse. A 1978 survey of 930 randomly selected women in  		San Francisco revealed that 28% of the respondents had experienced unwanted  		sexual touching and other forms of abuse before the age of 14 and that the  		percentage of victims increased to 38% if one included all episodes occurring  		before the women turned 18 (Russell, 1984). Finkelhor (1984) reported that 6%  		of all males and 15% of all females in his random sample of 521 Boston parents  		had experienced sexual abuse before age 16 by a person at least five years  		older.</p>
<p> These and similar studies have been used by child advocates to define  		the broad parameters of the maltreatment problem. Federal and local public  		officials, however, must rely upon more formal estimates of the problem. The  		American Association for Protecting Children (AAPC, 1988) notes that over two  		million children were reported as suspected victims of maltreatment in 1986, a  		200% increase over the number reported in 1976, the first year national data on  		child abuse reporting were collected. While the increase in the reporting rates  		has tapered off in the past two years, increasing at an annual rate of only 3%  		in both 1987 and 1988, the number of maltreatment victims continues to outpace  		available resources.</p>
<p> While the rate of increase in reporting levels is on the decline,  		caseloads in a majority of States reflect increases in the percentage of  		multi-problem families. Caseworkers are often faced with the complex issues of  		homelessness, substance abuse and physical or mental disabilities within a  		single case. Abuse of drugs such as crack and cocaine are increasingly more  		prevalent, intensifying the severity of cases and resulting in an increased  		need for out-of-home placements. At least 1 in 10 babies born in the United  		States, or 375,000 infants annually, has been exposed to illegal drugs taken by  		their mothers during pregnancy (Chasnoff, 1989).</p>
<p> Following a trend noted in 1980's, child abuse and neglect related  		fatalities are continuing to increase. Although relatively small in absolute  		numbers, reported child maltreatment related fatalities rose 5% in 1988,  		totaling over 1,200. Since 1985 the number of reported child abuse fatalities  		has increased over 36%. Whether these figures simply represent a more accurate  		count of a consistent problem or an actual increase in the number of  		fatalities, they are still disturbing. Over the past three years, a minimum of  		three children a day have been reported as fatal victims of child abuse.</p>
<p> Support for the persistence, if not growth of the child abuse problem,  		also is found in the most recently completed federally funded National  		Incidence Study (Westat, 1988). This study confirmed that over one million  		children, 16 out of every 1,000, were identified by child service professionals  		as abused or neglected in 1985. This figure represents a 66% increase over the  		number identified during a similar study conducted in 1980. The largest  		increases were noted in cases involving moderate physical abuse and all forms  		of child sexual abuse. While not significant, increases also were noted in the  		rates of fatal and serious physical abuse; all forms of emotional abuse;  		abandonment and the refusal to provide a child necessary health care or  		education. Most forms of emotional neglect also increased.</p>
<p> Further, despite extensive efforts to train professionals in their  		reporting responsibilities, the 1985 study determined little change had  		occurred in the percentage of cases known to professionals which were formally  		reported. Less than one-third of the child abuse cases identified by law  		enforcement officials, medical personnel, educators, and social service  		providers are reported to child protective service agencies and substantiated  		(Westat, 1988). This percentage ranges from a low of 16% for day care providers  		and 24% for teachers to a high of 66% for hospital personnel and 61% for local  		police.</p>
<p> Given the reporting problems, there is great debate over the actual  		level of child maltreatment. Critics argue that relying solely upon official  		reports of maltreatment or the National Incidence Study for accurate  		assessments of the level of child maltreatment is faulty because the actual  		incidence levels most likely exceed either of these projections.</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children in Need/Service Population</h4>
<p> Among the 1.9 million children reported by AAPC as maltreated in 1985,  		about 42% or 795,000 children were substantiated as abused or neglected (Select  		Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1987). However, reliable data are  		not available from States on the number of abused and neglected children  		actually receiving services.</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> Where available, State and Federal expenditure data generally do not  		distinguish between expenditures for child abuse, foster care and adoption.  		Instead these problem or service areas are reported together under the heading  		of Child Welfare services. Thus, this discussion covers overall Child Welfare  		expenditures, not just expenditures for services related to child abuse.</p>
<p> Title XX, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), is the largest source  		of Federal funds available to States for child protective services. Overall,  		Title XX appropriations in 1985 were $2.7 billion. GAO has estimated that  		approximately $500 million of this goes to Child Welfare.</p>
<p> Title IV-B of the Social Security Act provides States with matching  		funds for the provision of Child Welfare services. Each State is reimbursed for  		75% of its expenses up to its alloted proportionate share of appropriations. In  		FY 1987, $222.5 million was spent on services supporting child protection,  		foster care an adoption under Title IV-B.</p>
<p> The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) is the only  		Federal program solely designed to prevent, identify and treat child abuse and  		neglect. It created the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN)  		which has been appropriated approximately $25 million a year by Congress. The  		majority of the funds available through CAPTA are distributed to States through  		formula grants for use with any child abuse and neglect related activities.</p>
<p> With the creation on the first State Children's Trust Fund in 1980, a  		special pool of money was made available solely for the development and  		dissemination of child abuse prevention services. Children's Trust or  		Prevention Funds are now in place in 45 States and genereated revenues in  		excess of $27 million in 1988 (Select Committee on Children, Youth and  		Families, 1987).</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Case</h4>
<p> The types of intensive treatment services offered by federal  		demonstration programs suggest that thoughtful interventions with those  		families reported for maltreatment can run between $2,860 per family per year  		for lay therapy and supportive services to over $28,000 per family per year for  		comprehensive therapeutic services, including remedial services for  		children.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> The costs associated with remediating the consequences of maltreatment  		are staggering, as reported in a detailed benefit-cost analysis developed by  		Daro for child maltreatment in 1983 (1988). According to AAPC data for 1983,  		serious physicial abuse cases, a category which represented only 3% of all  		reports, cost society annually at least $20 million in hospitalizations, and $7  		million in rehabilitation costs to address the victim's immediate physical  		injuries and developmental problems. The Office of Technology Assessment has  		concluded that Daro's estimates of the foster care costs of maltreated children  		in 1983 were too high. However, their adjusted numbers are still staggering.  		OTA estimated that the foster care costs of children maltreated in 1983 were  		$475 million in the first year and $6.7 billion long-term.</p>
<p> If only the severely abused children reported in 1983 (3% of all  		reports) received intensive therapeutic services for one year, the costs would  		have exceeded $662 million. Offering quality therapeutic care to <b>all</b>  		families experiencing child maltreatment problems would likely run into the  		billions of dollars. Even prevention efforts--which of necessity would be  		directed at whole segments of the population--have significant, although  		substantially lower, costs associated with them.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Evaluations of child abuse treatment programs over the past ten years  		have consistently underscored their limitations. Among protective service  		caseloads, reincidence rates of 30 to 40% are common. Federal and State funded  		evaluations of sophisticated clinical demonstration projects, consisting of  		weekly contact for 12 to 18 months, report reincidence among one-third to  		one-half of all clients. Further, at termination, more than half of the clients  		served by these programs are considered by their service providers to remain at  		risk of abusing their children in the future.</p>
<p> Prevention services have been found much more effective. The richest  		body of empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of prevention services  		is found among educational and support services targeted to new parents. Both  		home-based programs and center-based programs have demonstrated a wide range of  		positive client outcomes. Specific gains have included improved mother-infant  		bonding and maternal capacity to respond to the child's emotional needs;  		developmental needs; fewer subsequent pregnancies; more consistent use of  		health care services and job training opportunities; and lower welfare use,  		higher school completion rates and higher employment rates. In identifying the  		types of parents most likely to benefit from these educational and supportive  		services, several have noted particular success with young, relatively poor  		mothers and with mothers who felt confident in their lives prior to enrolling  		in the program.</p>

<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> The public believes such behavior as physical punishment and yelling  		and swearing at children is harmful. One-third of the public participating in a  		Survey of randomly selected adults across the country believe that physical  		punishment "very often or often" results in injury to a child and nearly  		three-quarters share this opinion regarding repeated yelling and swearing at a  		child (Schulman, Ronca and Bucavales, 1989).</p>
<p> According to a 1988 public opinion poll, six in ten Americans are  		against corporal punishment in the schools in principle and without exception.  		A majority of Americans (61%) say they cannot even imagine a hypothetical  		situation when they would approve of a public school teacher hitting a student.  		This percentage is a marked increase over the 51% who conveyed this view in a  		survey including the exact same question in 1968.</p>
<p> Public support is also strongly in favor of key prevention efforts  		currently in place in many States. Over 90% agree that all elementary schools  		should offer instruction which teachers children to protect themselves from  		child abuse, especially sexual abuse. In addition, over 80% of the public agree  		that educational and support services, including health professionals who visit  		parents in their homes, should be available for all parents from the time their  		first child is born.</p>
<h3>Adequacy of Foster Care Services</h3>
<h4>1. Definition of Program Area</h4>
<p> Foster Care is placement of a child on a 24-hour basis outside the home  		under the jurisdiction of a primary State child welfare agency or a child  		placing agency under contract with the State. There is considerable variation  		among States as to what services comprise foster care. It can include family  		foster homes, group residential treatment centers, emergency shelters, certain  		secure and independent living arrangements, and placement with family or  		relative, if under the supervision of the primary child welfare agency.</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> Unfortunately, there is no national reporting system which captures the  		number of children receiving foster care services. Data which are available are  		estimates collected on a voluntary basis from States (and not all States  		participate). These voluntary data suggest that while the foster care  		population has been relatively stable since 1961, there is evidence that  		increases have occurred in recent years. The voluntary data report 262,000  		children at a point in time in 1982, increasing to 276,000 children at a point  		in time in 1985 (Voluntary Cooperative Information System (VCIS), 1988 cited in  		Committee on Ways and Means, 1989). However, ACYF has estimated that 375,000  		children were in foster care in June, 1986 (ACYF, 1988 cited in Select  		Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1989). The median length of time  		spent in care has become shorter, decreasing from 27 months in 1977 to 18  		months in 1985, although since 1982 the median length of stay has remained at  		18 months (Committee on Ways and Means, 1989).</p>
<p> The children entering foster care tend to be older, more troubled, and  		have more serious and complex problems than they had in past years. An  		estimated 18% of all reported cases of abuse and neglect result in a foster  		care placement decision (AAPC, cited by Office of Technology Assessment, 1988).  		In addition, an estimated 70% of the children entering substitute care have  		family problems related to substance abuse. Finally, there are growing special  		problems associated with drug addicted and AIDS infected infants entering the  		foster care system (Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families,  		1989).</p>
<p> Nationally, the trend has been to increase permanency planning and to  		reunify the child with his or her biological parent(s) whenever possible.  		Supported by the passage of State and Federal laws such as the Child Welfare  		and Adoption Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-272), the goal of reunification with  		parent or placing with relative has increased from 39.2% in 1982 to 51.7% in  		1985. Over that same period the goal of adoption for foster care children has  		decreased from 16.5% to 13.1% (VCIS, 1988 cited by Committee on Ways and Means,  		1989). Further, the number of children placed in institutions has declined from  		70,280 in 1977 to 27,500 in 1982 (Select Committee on Children, Youth and  		Families, 1989).</p>
<p> The rise in the number of foster care placements is even more  		pronounced in areas where there is a larger incidence of homelessness, drugs,  		and abuse and neglect--all factors placing children at greater risk of  		out-of-home placement. For example, in New York City, 20,302 children were in  		foster care in February 1988, almost 500 more than were in care the month  		before and 20% more than in 1983 (NYC Human Resources Administration, 1988,  		cited by Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families, 1989). Also, in Los  		Angeles County the number of dependency judicial reviews increased 229% between  		1981 and 1987 (Little Hoover Commission, 1987 cited by Select Committee on  		Children, Youth, and Families, 1989).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children in Need/Service Population</h4>
<p> At the end of 1985, the VCIS system reported an estimated 276,000  		children in foster care, with 270,000 children reported to be in care at the  		beginning of the year and 460,000 children reported as being served during the  		year. (Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, 1989).</p>
<p> Of all children in foster care in 1985, 40% were in care for under one  		year, 61% were in care for under two years, and 38% were in care for greater  		than two years. Of this group, 12% has been in care two to three years, 11% had  		been in care three to five years, and 14% had been in care for five years or  		more (VCIS, 1988 cited by Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families,  		1989).</p>
<p> The most common placement is family foster care (includes group homes  		in most States), which comprised about 60% of all placements reported in 1985.  		The next most common placement is group residential care, which comprised 18%  		of all placements. The remaining placements were in emergency shelters, 1.3%;  		independent living programs, 1%; secure facilities, 7%; and living with parents  		or relatives, 11%. Children with handicaps represented almost 16% of the total  		in care (Hill, Lakin et al., 1987).</p>
<p> Of those entering foster care, the vast majority were new entrants  		(75%), while 25% were reentrants. Of the reentrants, 20% had experienced two to  		four placements and 6% had been in five or more placements. A majority of new  		entrants entered due to abuse and neglect. Parental conditions or absence  		accounted for another 16% and child-related reasons accounted for almost 12%.  		Of the children in care, 45% were thirteen years old or older, 29% were ages  		six through twelve, and 22% were ages one through five (VCIS, 1988 cited in  		Committee on Ways and Means, 1989).</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> (See discussion under Child Abuse of overall child welfare  		expenditures)</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Child</h4>
<p> Data are not available on how much States or the Federal government  		spend on foster care, making it difficult to calculate a cost per child. A  		study was conducted which determined that the average cost per child paid to  		foster families in 1982 was $178 per-month or $2,136 annually (calculated from  		Select Committee for Children, Youth, and Families, 1989). However, it is  		important to note that there are different costs associated with the different  		types of foster care. Family foster care is the least expensive type of care.  		Group residential care is substantially more expensive because its costs  		include the cost of space, 24-hour staffing, and education.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Data are not available to determine what it would cost to fill the  		unmet need for foster care services. However, it is known that existing funds  		are not adequate to address service needs. In almost every State, more Foster  		Care parents are needed, as well as additional child welfare staff. Burnout for  		child welfare workers is also a problem. Turnover among protective services  		staff in New York City was 67% in 1986, according to the Children's Defense  		Fund (National Health Policy Forum, 1989).</p>
<h3>Adequacy of Adoption Services</h3>
<h4>1. Definition of Problem Area</h4>
<p> Adoption is defined as the judicial act of creating the legal  		relationship between parent and child where it previously did not exist  		(Committee on Ways and Means, 1987). State laws governing adoption require  		certain legal processes and the provision of child welfare services intended to  		protect the child and others who are involved in the adoption. The process of  		adoption may be coordinated by private or public agencies. Since there are no  		nationwide data available on private adoptions, this discussion will focus on  		public adoptions. In particular, this discussion will examine the unmet need  		for adoption among children who are already in foster care placements.</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> The profile of the child in need of adoption has changed over the past  		two decades. The availability of healthy infants has decreased dramatically due  		to the legalization of abortion and the increasing number of unmarried  		teenagers choosing to keep their children. However, there has been an increase  		in the number of older children awaiting adoption, due to social problems such  		as child abuse, drug dependency and Aids. Further, these children are often  		quite troubled. Efforts to put these older children in permanent placements  		have served to increase the level of special needs in the population of  		children awaiting adoption. This is evidenced by the fact that in 1982 an  		estimated 28% of all public adoptions were special needs adoptions. In 1985,  		this percentage increased to 62% (Committee on Ways and Means, 1987). In  		addition, people are adopting special needs children at a higher rate (62%)  		than the percentage of those children available for adoption (51%) (Committee  		on Ways and Means, 1989).</p>
<p> To provide incentive and support to those individuals adopting special  		needs children State and federal laws have been enacted to help remove  		financial and other barriers to adoption. The Adoption Assistance and Child  		Welfare Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-272) authorized a new entitlement program  		of matching funds for State programs which determine that a child has special  		needs and would not be able to be adopted without some form of assistance  		provided to him or his adoptive parents on his behalf. This program entitles  		AFDC and SSI eligible children to a monthly adoption assistance payment,  		Medicaid eligibility, and partial payment to the State for administrative and  		training expenses related to the adoption process (Committee on Ways and Means,  		1989). In 1987, the law was further amended to allow all children with special  		needs to receive some form of adoption assistance whether they are AFDC  		eligible or not (1986 Tax Reform Legislation P.L. 99-514, cited by Committee on  		Ways and Means, 1987).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children in Need/Service Population</h4>
<p> There are no official estimates of the number of children awaiting  		adoption and being adopted in this country each year. The only national data  		available are collected by the American Public Welfare Association through the  		Voluntary Cooperative Information System (VCIS) and are based on voluntary  		reporting from States on adoptions which result from substitute care.  		Recognizing there was a problem with insufficient data on adoption, the 1986  		Budget Reconciliation Act mandated the establishment of an advisory group to  		identify the type of information necessary for developing national adoption and  		foster care policies. Final regulations for this new data base were due in  		December 1988 and the system is to be implemented by 1991 (Committee on Ways  		and Means, 1989).</p>
<p> One methodology for determining the level of unmet need for adoption is  		to compare the number of children targeted for adoption at the beginning of the  		year with the number of children whose adoptions were finalized, and the number  		available for adoption at the end of the year. At the start of fiscal 1985, an  		estimated 38,000 to 40,000 children nation-wide had a permanency planning goal  		of adoption. By the end of the year approximately 50% or 17,000 to 20,000  		children were adopted and 37,000 to 39,000 were legally free for adoption  		(VCIS, 1987 cited by Committee on Ways and Means, 1989). Thus approximately  		20,000 children were still awaiting adoption at the end of the year, assuming  		the rate of adoption and the number of children eligible for adoption remained  		constant.</p>
<p> The characteristics of children awaiting adoption differ from those  		whose adoptions have been finalized:</p>
<ul><li>On the basis of race, black children have the greatest unmet need for  		  adoption. In 1985, a greater percentage of white, hispanic, and other racial  		  groups were adopted than the percentage available for adoption. (white  		  children--58% adopted to 52% available; hispanic children--9% adopted to 7%  		  available; and other groups--10% adopted to 3% available). Conversely, the  		  percentage of black children adopted (23%) was lower than the percentage of  		  children available for adoption (38%) (VCIS, 1987 cited by Committee on Ways  		  and Means, 1989).</li>
<li>On the basis of age, adoption rates for children decrease  		  dramatically with increasing age and the demand is clearly for younger  		  children. For a child 0 to 5 years of age there was a 50% adoption rate. By the  		  time a child was between 13 and 18 years of age the adoption rate decreased to  		  11%. In addition, nearly 20% more children between the ages of 0 and 5 years  		  were adopted (50%) than those awaiting for adoption (31%). Of children ages 6  		  through 12, more were awaiting adoption (44%) than adopted (30%). In the 13 to  		  18 age bracket more than twice as many children were awaiting adoption (25%)  		  than adopted (11%) (VCIS, 1987 cited by Committee on Ways and Means,  		  1989).</li>
</ul><p> The median length of time children waited to be adopted was 14 months.  		However, it was found that 25% of the children had been awaiting adoption for  		more than 3.1 years (VCIS, 1985). There was no information correlating length  		of time waiting to be adopted with racial group or age.</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> (See discussion under Child Abuse of overall child welfare  		expenditures)</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Child</h4>
<p> Data are not available to estimate the cost per child for public  		adoption. However, the Federal government estimates it will be spending an  		average of $2908 per child annually on the adoption subsidy program for special  		needs children in 1989 (calculated from Department of Health and Human  		Services, 1987, cited by Committee on Ways and Means, 1989). This cost only  		reflects the reimbursement to States for monthly maintenance payments to  		AFDC/SSI eligible children, State administrative and training costs associated  		with these adoptions, and the one-time reimbursement for costs of non-AFDC/SSI  		special needs children. It does not reflect the associated costs of non-special  		needs and special needs adoptions which may be paid for out of Title IVB, Title  		XX, and Title XIX Medicaid funds or those costs which are totally State  		funded.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Again, data are not available to estimate what the costs would be to  		close the gap for the estimated 20,000 children waiting to be adopted. If 62%  		of those children were special needs children, it is estimated that the  		adoption subsidy program would increase by approximately $36 million, assuming  		that all 20,000 were adopted in one year. This, however, does not take into  		account the other special and non-special needs adoption costs which may be  		paid for out of Title IV-B, Title XIX, and Title XX funds or the costs that  		States fund themselves. Also to be considered are the offsetting savings in  		foster care expenditures because many of these children are already served  		under foster care programs.</p>

<h2><a name="childcare" id="childcare">LACK OF CHILD CARE</a></h2>
<h4>1. Definition of Problem Area</h4>
<p> Child care is non-parental care of children while parents are employed,  		in school or job training, or looking for work. It can include care by  		relatives, friends and neighbors (paid and unpaid) as well as care in child  		care centers, preschool programs, licensed family day care, and before and  		after school programs. Children from infancy through age 13 are customarily  		defined as needing child care.<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p> While families at all income levels need child care when parents work,  		this summary focuses on the child care needs of low income families. Lack of  		affordable child care is a greater barrier to employment for mothers in low  		income families, especially mother-headed families, than among higher income  		mothers (O'Connell and Bloom, 1987). Consistent with our targeted focus, the  		need for child care which remains unmet will be measured by the proportion of  		low income mothers who would seek employment if child care were available.</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> The labor force participation rates of mothers with children under age  		14 has increased steadily since 1946. In 1985, 49 percent of <b>children</b>  		under age 6 and 60 percent of <b>children</b> 6-13 had mothers in the work  		force. In the last decade the most remarkable change has been the astonishing  		57 percent rise in the proportion of children under age 1 with employed  		mothers. More than one-half of mothers with infants are now in the labor force.  		If current trends continue by 1995 over two-thirds of preschool children and  		three-quarters of schoolage children will have their mothers in the work force  		(Hofferth and Phillips, 1987).</p>
<p> The employment rates of low income women have not kept pace with the  		participation rates of other women. The rate of labor force participation among  		mothers of poor children is one-fifth (7%) that of non-poor children (36%),  		based on the 1988 Current Population Survey. Lack of child care is believed to  		be one of the reasons for this difference. In 1982 it was estimated that the  		labor force participation rates for women in families with incomes less than  		$15,000 annually would increase from 45 percent to 65 percent if affordable  		child care were available (U.S. Census Bureau, 1982 cited by O'Connell and  		Bloom, 1987). This was, however, based on weak data.</p>
<p> Another trend worth noting is that the type of care used by parents  		when they are employed has changed over the last two decades. The most striking  		change is that the use of group care programs (centers, preschool programs and  		other group-based programs) <b>tripled</b> for children under the age of 3 as  		well as for preschoolers ages 3 and 4. While 6 percent of children under 2 were  		in full time group care in 1965, the proportion was 16 percent in 1982. For 3  		and 4 year olds the proportions in full time group care rose from 13 percent to  		40 percent. The use of family day care homes has also shown a steady rise from  		24 percent to 36 percent for children under 3; the use of relatives and in-home  		babysitters has declined over the same time period. However, relatives remain  		the major providers of child care for preschool age children, providing just  		over 40 percent of the full time care of children ages 3 and 4 (Hofferth and  		Phillips, 1987).</p>
<p> A final trend to note Is the rate of federal spending for child care.  		Between 1977 and 1986 federal spending for child care increased from $3.8  		billion to $5.5 billion.<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> However, there has been a decided shift in the  		distribution of child care benefits. Virtually all the increased benefits since  		1977 have gone to middle and upper income families through the child and  		dependent care tax credit. Independent of the tax credit, federal spending for  		child care declined 25 percent between 1977 to 1986, from $2.8 billion to $2.1  		billion (1986 dollars) (Robbins, 1988).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need</h4>
<p> Criteria for determining the extent of the need for child care services  		can vary. The Department of Labor (DOL) recently estimated that there are 16.3  		million families with children under age 14 and working parents (12.8 million  		married couples with two working parents and 3.5 million mother headed families  		with one working parent) all of whom need child care.<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> In addition, DOL estimated there are 3.7  		million welfare mothers with 3.1 million children under the age of 6 and 2.9  		million children between the ages of 6 and 13 who might , use child care to  		seek employment. DOL also targeted an estimated 600,000 teen mothers (200,000  		of whom are also on AFDC) who might use child care to further their education  		and training (U.S. Department of Labor, 1988).</p>
<p> Rather than focus on the current users of child care to define the need  		for the services, we have chosen to target what we believe is a measure of the  		unmet need: families who do not currently use child care but who would if it  		were affordable and available. In particular we target low income families for  		whom child care problems may pose substantial barriers to work force  		participation and economic self sufficiency.<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p> In 1982 1.7 million mothers of preschoolers in low income families  		(less than $15,000 income) were in the labor force, but it is estimated that  		2.3 million low income mothers would have been in the labor force if affordable  		child care were available. These data suggest that 600,000 low income mothers  		of preschool age children would have entered the work force in 1982 if  		subsidized child care were available. This prediction is based on non-employed  		mothers' responses to a question about whether they would look for work if  		child care were available to them at a reasonable cost (O'Connell and Bloom,  		1987). More recent data do not appear to be available, although the Survey of  		Income and Program Participation might provide information to update this  		estimate.</p>
<p> Another group with unmet child care needs are families in which  		children are placed in self care. This appears to be a rare although  		potentially disastrous occurrence among preschool children and so reliable  		estimates of incidence are not available. Among school age children (6-13) self  		care is more common. In 1984, 2.1 million school age children (out of a  		possible 28.8 million) regularly spent time during the nonschool hours with no  		adult supervision. There were 400,000 5-8 year-olds in self care, 800,000 9-11  		year olds, and 863,000 12-13 year-olds. Children in self care from low income  		families (less than $20,000 annually) numbered 895,000 (U.S. Bureau of the  		Census, 1987).</p>
<p> Because recent information about the child care arrangements of low  		income mothers is not available, information about the child care arrangements  		of mothers with low levels of educational attainment is provided as a proximate  		measure of income. In 1984-85 employed mothers who were not high school  		graduates used the following types of primary child care for their children  		under age 5:</p>

<p> The primary funding source for child care in the U.S. is the fees that  		parents pay to purchase child care. In 1985 parents spent $12.7 billion on care  		(Data Resources, 1989). Federal spending on child care was estimated at $5.5  		billion in 1986 and at $6.9 billion in Fiscal Year 1988. Federal expenditures  		in FY 1988 included the following:</p>
<table><tr><td>Tax Credits &amp; Deductions</td>

<h4>5. Cost Per Family</h4>
<p> In 1985 families with pre-school age children paid an average of $1,652  		per year ($138 per month of $32 per week) for child care. This amount equalled  		6-7 percent of their total family spending. However, among low income single  		parent families, expenditures for child care averaged 14 percent of total  		family spending (Data Resources, 1989). Spending for both full time and part  		time child care are included in these statistics.</p>
<p> The costs of full time child care are substantially higher. In 4 major  		cities in 1985 full time care in centers for children under age 2 cost between  		$50-$150 per week; in a family day care home the cost was between $45-$160; and  		in an in-home babysitting arrangement the cost was $165-$340.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> We have estimated that 600,000 low income families have an unmet need  		for child care. At an average annual cost of $1,652 per family, the cost of  		closing this gap would be about $1 billion. Of course the net cost would be  		less because of anticipated savings in the AFDC program and additions to income  		tax revenues.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> By its definition, providing child care services will fill the need for  		child care. This paper does not seek to examine alternative methods for  		financing child care, e.g., direct subsidies, tax credits, modified  		regulations, etc. While the relation of child care to the work status of  		welfare and poor mothers (or fathers) is clear, the extent to which increasing  		availability of child care increases work effort and decreases poverty or  		welfare dependency is less clear.</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> Numerous polls indicate the strong public concern about the lack of  		availability of child care services and support for increased government  		spending for day care. A Washington Post-ABC News survey found that 61 percent  		favored increased federal spending on "day care programs which take care of the  		children of working parents who can't afford it." (Morin, 1989) A June 1988  		Gallup Poll found 45 percent of those surveyed felt the government should do  		more about the availability and affordability of child care services (Gallup  		Poll, 1988). A 1988 poll about child care services indicated that about  		three-quarters of voters lean in favor of government support of child care, as  		opposed to believing that government support might discourage parents from  		staying home with their children (Martilla and Kiley, 1988). Thus, while some  		Americans may still be concerned that child care may interfere with normal  		family roles, the great majority believe a government role is appropriate.</p>

<h2><a name="earlyeducation" id="earlyeducation">LACK OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION</a></h2>
<h4>1. Definition of Problem Area</h4>
<p> Low-income children often have problems of poor nutrition, poor health  		care and social and educational performance which prevent them from achieving  		their full potential from the beginning of their entry into the public school  		system. These problems at the start of their school experience significantly  		reduce the probability that education can help break the cycle of poverty. In  		response, a range of Federal and State early childhood education programs have  		been developed to assist disadvantaged children in becoming better prepared for  		school entry. Head Start is the major preschool program for low-income children  		under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services. Thus, this  		discussion focuses on the performance of the Head Start program in meeting the  		preschool needs of poor children.</p>
<p> Head Start is a comprehensive child care program serving primarily  		families whose income is below the poverty level. Services primarily for 3- to  		5-year-old children include an education component, in which children attend  		classes in a center or in which staff conduct regular home visits to children  		and parents; a health component, ensuring that children are up-to-date in  		immunizations and have been screened and treated for health and dental  		problems; and a nutrition component, in which children learn appropriate eating  		habits and are served nutritious meals and snacks. Services for families  		include a social services component with a family needs assessment and  		referrals for services, and a parent involvement component, in which parents  		are encouraged to become more involved in the process of their child's  		development. Parents are also encouraged to participate in the direction of  		their Head Start program.</p>
<p> Head Start began in 1965 as a part of the War on Poverty. Its early  		programs were usually 6 to 8 weeks long, occurring in the summer before  		children began school. Today most Head Start programs operate for 8 or 9 months  		of the year, allowing for more extensive contact between the program staff and  		families. In center-based options, classes generally operate part-day, from 3  		to 6 hours. Head Start is not meant to satisfy day care needs for working  		parents, and most mothers of Head Start children are not employed.</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> In the 1987-88 program year, Head Start served a total of 454,000  		children. Under the Bush Administration, they have been granted additional  		expansion monies for 1989-90 which will allow up to 95,000 additional children  		to be served.</p>
<p> One of the issues faced by the program in its current expansion is the  		potential competition with other services aimed at the poverty population. For  		instance, most States use monies from the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) to  		support child care for low-income families with employed parents. In some cases  		these families have incomes below the poverty level and are eligible for Head  		Start. But since the Head Start program is usually part-day, some parents  		forego the extensive services of Head Start in favor of full-time care.</p>
<p> Many States are organizing extensive work-welfare programs in which  		mothers of preschool children may be asked to join training programs for  		eventual employment or to begin working. Such programs recognize the need for  		child care and include some provision for such care. They might encourage  		parents to use care funded under the SSBG, pay for slots in existing child care  		facilities, or fund Head Start centers to remain open for additional hours of  		care.</p>
<p> The Departments of Education in many States or cities are also  		beginning preschool programs in many elementary schools. In some instances  		these programs are in low-income neighborhoods and may include children  		eligible for Head Start. It is relatively rare for schools to coordinate their  		programs with social service agencies or with Head Start, so a sort of  		competition for children, teachers, and space may well occur.</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> The 1987 Census estimate of the number of 3- to 5-year-old children in  		the United States living below the poverty level if 2,700,000. Of that number  		425,000 or 16% are currently served by Head Start. Using these figures alone,  		then, it would appear that a very large number of children and families are  		eligible for, but not receiving Head Start services. (Note that about 35,000  		children aged 0-2 and 6 are also served by Head Start.)</p>
<p> In any discussion of "universal" Head Start, however, two caveats are  		important, each of which reduces the number of children "in need." First, the  		total number of 3- to-5-year-old children in poverty includes three age  		cohorts. Most Head Start grantees concentrate their services on children who  		will enter school next year, rather than spreading their services across all  		three years of eligible children. They prefer providing services to more  		children to providing more extensive services to fewer children. If "universal"  		service were defined as one year of Head Start for as many children as  		possible, then Head Start would currently be seen to serve about 30% of the  		eligible children.</p>
<p> Second, as suggested above, there are other educational or child care  		programs serving this population. Preschools operated by the local school  		system, SSBG child care centers, or work-welfare child care facilities may not  		provide all of the services of Head Start, but they do "intervene" in the  		process of child development for many low-income families. To avoid duplication  		of services, many Head Start grantees currently supplement the services offered  		by these groups. This, perhaps, is the optimal approach. We need not count  		families served by these other programs as "in need of Head Start," but may  		perhaps consider them in need of "case management." Unfortunately, no one keeps  		track on a national level of the number of Head Start-eligible children  		enrolled in any of the above programs.</p>
<p> Thus, it may not be necessary to aim at serving <b>100 percent</b> of  		Head Start-eligible families. If services were to be provided (in most cases)  		for one year to families who elected to participate, then it may be that simply  		doubling the size of Head Start would be appropriate.</p>
<h4>4. Expenditures</h4>
<p> Head Start operates as a Federally funded program with an annual budget  		in FY 1989 of $1,235,000,000. Approximately $30,100,000 is retained at the  		national level for training and technical assistance, research and evaluation,  		and the remaining $1,204,900,000 is granted to operate programs. With 452,314  		children estimated to be enrolled in FY 1989, a cost per slot of $2,664 from  		Federal funds.</p>
<p> One requirement of most Head Start grantees is that 20% of the total  		budget of the program should be non-Federal share (waivers are sometimes given  		of this requirement). For some grantees, this contribution is made through  		State, county or local cash given to the program. For most grantees, free or  		subsidized space accounts for a portion of the non-Federal share and an imputed  		value is attached to the hours parents spend in the classroom as teacher  		aides.</p>
<p> Some States, e.g., Maine and New Jersey, have Head Start-like monies  		which purchase slots in a program or purchase additional hours of service. No  		central agency keeps track of these monies; rather, grantees find out about  		them from their State and apply for them.</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Case</h4>
<p> The average Federal cost for Head Start is $2,664, but this number  		varies widely across grantees. According to the head Start Cost Management  		System which contains information on the approved budgets of grantees, the  		grantee with the smallest Federal cost per child receives about $800 per child  		(supplemented by considerable local resources). The highest cost grantee  		receives approximately $5,000 per child. The "total" cost per child, including  		non-Federal share and in some cases a State's contribution, may average over  		$3,200 per child. Data on this cost are only beginning to be gathered at this  		time.</p>
<p> In general, center-based programs are more expensive per child per year  		than are home-based programs (an average of $3,200 vs. $2,400) since home-based  		programs do not pay as much for space and need not pay for the transportation  		of children. In terms of costs per hour of service, though, home-based programs  		are considerably more expensive than center-based programs (about $20.00 in  		comparison to $5.00), because of the lower number of contact hours in a  		home-based model.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> In deciding to double the size of the program (to serve an additional  		450,000 children) we may take the average Federal cost per child of $2,664 and  		calculate a need for $1.2 billion. This assumes, of course, that the cost to  		serve an additional child is the same as the cost to serve presently enrolled  		children. This may not be the case.</p>
<p> First, where current grantees can expand services, the cost per  		additional child may be less. A care of staff already exist. New classes may be  		added at a marginal cost that is less than the full $2,664. Second, where other  		programs are providing child care and Head Start may opt to supplement  		services, the cost per child should be considerably less than the cost for the  		full complement of services. On the other hand, in counties which are currently  		unserved by the program, it may be considerably more costly than this average  		to begin and operate a grantee because of sizeable transportation costs or the  		need to renovate space completely. It is difficult to balance these estimates  		in any precise manner.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Research on Head Start has shown that the program has powerful  		short-term effects on children and some positive effects on families.  		Comparisons of Head Start children with their non-Head Start counterparts show  		that </p>
<ul><li>In the year after graduation, Head Start children almost always  		  perform significantly better on intelligence tests than non-Head Start children  		  of a similar age and socioeconomic status;</li>
<li>In early elementary school, Head Start graduates usually perform  		  better on measures such as teacher ratings, retention in grade and assignment  		  to special education classes;</li>
<li>Head Start appears to improve the language development of preschool  		  children, though they perform below middle-class controls; and</li>
<li>Head Start children are healthier than non-Head Start children as a  		  result of the health and nutrition services provided.</li>
</ul><p>Comparisons between Head Start families and others show that</p>
<ul><li>Head Start programs do assist families in locating needed social  		  services;</li>
<li>Head Start provides a range of opportunities for parents to become  		  involved with the program and their child's learning and development; and</li>
<li>Head Start parents report increased feelings of control over their  		  lives, general life satisfaction and increased self-confidence. These feelings  		  increase as their level of involvement in the program increases (CSR,  		  1983.)</li>
</ul><h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> Education, including early childhood education, has consistently been  		cited as a major concern of Americans today. A June 1988 Gallup poll found that  		53 percent of adults were "very concerned" about "a decline in the quality of  		education in the United States" (Gallup Poll, 1988).</p>
<p> More specifically, another poll conducted prior to the 1988 elections  		found that 79 percent of American voters felt that "early childhood education  		programs need more attention and resources under the next president." When  		asked whether they favored fully funding programs for early childhood education  		and health, despite budget deficits, versus not increasing spending to reduce  		the deficit, 60 percent favored increased spending, 20 percent favored reducing  		the deficit, and 20 percent were not sure. (Peter D. Hart Research Associates,  		1988).</p>

<h2><a name="childsupport" id="childsupport">LACK OF CHILD SUPPORT</a></h2>
<h4>1. Definition of the Problem Area</h4>
<p> Child support is the economic contribution made by a parent to the  		living expenses of a child who does not live with the parent, ordinarily  		because of divorce, separation or out-of-wedlock birth. Either mothers or  		fathers may be noncustodial parents and pay child support, but nearly all--an  		estimated 90 percent--noncustodial parents are fathers (Nichols-Casebolt,  		Garfinkel and Wong, 1988). Both married and unmarried biological fathers may be  		required to provide child support for their children. Beginning in 1968 the  		U.S. Supreme Court decided a series of cases which established that  		illegitimate children are entitled to legal equality with legitimate children  		under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. These cases established  		the legal rights of children born out of wedlock to parental support.</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> The issue of child support is becoming more significant over time  		because of the increasing number of female-headed families. Since 1960 the  		number of female-headed families has risen in both absolute terms and as a  		percent of total families because divorce rates and the proportion of  		out-of-wedlock births have risen. Since 1960 the number of female-headed  		families has tripled from 1.9 million to 6 million in 1985 and female-headed  		families now compose 19 percent of all families with children (U.S. Department  		of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement, 1988; U.S.  		Department of Bureau of the Census, 1986). In addition to the 6.0 million  		female headed-families about 2 million women, currently living with a spouse,  		have children from a prior marriage or relationship who are legally or  		potentially due child support from an absent farther. Nearly 45 percent of  		white children and 86 percent of black children are now expected to spend a  		portion of their childhoods in families headed by women (Bumpass, 1986).  		Approximately one out of every two female-headed families has an income below  		poverty, and a significant factor in this impoverishment is the failure of  		noncustodial parents to provide child support.</p>
<p> In 1975 Congress added Title IV-D to the Social Security Act because of  		national concern about the increase in single parent families, their lack of  		income, and their reliance on public assistance for support. Basic elements of  		Title IV-D were (1) provision of funds to States to enforce support  		obligations, to locate absent parents, to establish legal paternity and to  		obtain support orders, and (2) the creation of the federal Office of Child  		Support Enforcement (OCSE) to establish standards and to assist States and  		monitor their performance. The Act also required that, as a condition of AFDC  		eligibility, all recipients sign over their rights to support to the State and  		cooperate with the State to establish paternity and secure child support.  		Non-AFDC families could also receive child support services, but federal  		incentives were not provided to States for these services.</p>
<p> Title IV-D was amended and strengthened in 1984 to require States to  		provide child support services to both AFDC and non-AFDC families, to require  		wage withholding when support payments are in arrears, to establish guidelines  		for the setting of child support award levels, to expedite processing and the  		enforcement of interstate claims, and to authorize the use other enforcement  		methods like the withholding of State and federal income tax refunds, liens on  		property, posting of bonds and the notification of credit bureaus about child  		support arrears.</p>
<p> The Family Support Act of 1988 further strengthened child support  		programs by requiring judges to use State child support award guidelines, by  		requiring periodic review of these guidelines and periodic review and updating  		of awards to raise the value of initial awards and to maintain their value over  		time. In addition States must provide for immediate wage withholding starting  		in 1994. To enhance paternity establishment and child support enforcement  		States are also required to collect social security numbers of parents on birth  		certificate registration forms.</p>
<p> In spite of these programmatic developments, the value of child support  		awards has decreased over time and compliance rates have remained stagnant. In  		1985 the average child support award was $2,495 in contrast to $2,005 in 1978.  		This represents a 24 percent decline when inflation is factored in (Besharov  		and Tramontozzi, 1989). Payments on awards have also declined. In 1985 the  		average amount of child support paid was $2,220 for all women who received some  		payment; two years earlier the figure was $2,528. Over the two year period  		payments eroded by 12.4 percent (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,  		Office of Child Support Enforcement, 1988).<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> Compliance with child support awards has been  		relatively stable over the last decade. In 1978, 49 percent of noncustodial  		fathers paid all of what they owed compared to 48 percent in 1985.</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need</h4>
<p> In 1986 there were 8.8 million mothers with over 14.8 million children  		(under age 21) whose fathers were not present in the household. Forty percent  		of these children (6 million) had no child support awards and the remainder  		(8.8 million) did. However, in the previous year 1.5 million of children with  		awards were not due to receive any child support; 1.9 million were due to  		receive support but received nothing. Only 5.4 million children in  		mother-headed households (36 percent) received any child support payments in  		1985 (calculated using Table 1, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989). Of this 5.4  		million children, 3.5 million received full payment and 1.9 million children  		received partial payment (calculated using Table 7, U.S. Department of  		Commerce, 1989).</p>
<p> Not all the 8.8 million women with children under age 21 who were  		potentially eligible for child support in 1986 needed or wanted assistance in  		obtaining or collecting that support. The Bureau of the Census estimated that  		56% of women potentially eligible for full amount of child support (4.9  		million) either were receiving the full amount of child support (1.0 million)  		or had awards pending or had made other arrangements, such as joint custody (.5  		million). The remaining 3.9 million women either had an award that had not been  		fully paid (2.2 million) or had wanted, but had not obtained, an award (1.7  		million). In 1985, child support due, but not paid amounted to $3.7  		billion.</p>
<p> In addition to these mothers, there are those whose child support  		awards, although fully paid, are insufficient and inappropriate relative to the  		resources of the noncustodial parent. A recent study using child support award  		guidelines for three different States (Wisconsin, Colorado, and Delaware) has  		estimated that noncustodial parents would have paid between $24 and $30 million  		in aggregate child support payments in 1983 if these guidelines were in force.  		In contrast, in 1983 noncustodial fathers had child support obligations of $9.7  		billion and they actually paid $6.8 billion (Garfinkel and Oellerich, 1989). We  		are unable to estimate the number of mothers who would fit this category of  		need because linked data are not available about the financial resources of  		noncustodial parents.</p>
<h4>4. Child Support Expenditures</h4>
<p> Between 1976 and 1987, federal spending on child support enforcement  		went from $139 million to about $745 million. Each year the Office for Child  		Support Enforcement shows record increases in collections. In fiscal year 1987,  		the program collected $3.9 billion, a 20 percent increase over the previous  		year. Total program expenditures (federal and State) in the same year were  		$1.06 billion resulting in $3.68 collected for every $1.00 spent  		nationwide.</p>
<p> The fiscal incentives for States in the child support program have  		meant that the federal costs of the program exceed the federal share of  		collections realized. In FY 1987 the federal government spent $327 million more  		than it realized in collections applied to offset its AFDC costs. In other  		words, the federal government recouped 56 percent of its expenditures on child  		support through collections. The status of child support enforcement financing  		is considerable more favorable for the States than for the federal government.  		When the States share of child support collections on behalf of AFDC recipients  		is combined with federal reimbursement for child support administrative  		expenditures and incentive payments, States received in 1987 $349 million more  		than they spend on child support enforcement program activities. When all  		levels of government are considered together, the program breaks even when  		program expenditures ($1.06 billion) are compared to collections that return to  		the federal and State coffers ($1.08 billion). Beyond these government returns,  		AFDC families received an additional $279 million through a $50 per month  		pass-through supplement when child support is collected, and non-AFDC families  		received $2.5 billion.</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Family</h4>
<p> In 1987 the Title IV-D caseload was 10.6 million. Cases are not  		equivalent to either families or children, but to non-custodial  		parent/child(ren) units. The caseload figures overestimate the number of  		families currently in need of support, but data on the number of families is  		unavailable.<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note6">6</a></font></sup>  		Administrative expenditures for the Office of Child Support Enforcement were  		$100 per case in 1987. When costs are calculated based on the 1.8 million cases  		for which a collection was made, the cost per case was considerably  		higher--$588 per case. The Federal per case cost was $70 for all cases and $414  		for cases with collections.</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> There are two aspects of unmet need within the Child Support  		Enforcement program. The first is the additional cost of increasing the  		proportion of cases for which a collection is made. Currently collections are  		made on only 17% of the total child support enforcement caseload. This means  		that there are no collections for 83% of child support cases because paternity  		has not yet been established, a support award has not been ordered, or an award  		is not being enforced. Substantially more resources would have to be spend to  		increase the proportion of the current case load with collections. At a federal  		cost of $414 per case with collection, it would take about $1.5 billion more  		federal dollars to increase the proportion of cases with collections to 50  		percent.<sup><font><a href="../node/68491.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The second area of unmet need is women who do not have an award or are  		not receiving support payment and have not applied for child support  		enforcement services. Of the 3.9 million mother's who wanted a child support  		award or were not receiving full payment as the baseline, about 1.3 million  		were receiving AFDC and, therefore, are included in the child support  		enforcement caseload of 10.6 million. Additionally, some proportion of the  		remaining 2.6 million women already have applied for child support enforcement  		services. This proportion could be tabulated from the 1986 CPS, but is not  		available in the analysis published by the Bureau of the Census.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> Research to date suggests that child support program practices are  		related to child support payment patterns. Participation in the Child Support  		Enforcement Program has been found to have a significantly positive effect on  		the receipt of child support (Robbins, 1986; Sonenstein and Calhoun, 1988) and  		residents of States using strong enforcement irremediableness, expedited  		administrative procedures, and wage-withholding--receive higher payments  		holding constant the effect of custodial mother characteristics (Beller and  		Graham, 1984; O'Neill, 1985). There is also some evidence that the use of  		guidelines to set child support awards increases their levels (Sonenstein and  		Calhoun, 1988). Currently the Office of Child Support Enforcement is evaluating  		the impact of the 1984 Amendments.</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> In 1975 when the originating federal child support legislation was  		passed there was a substantial controversy over the appropriate role of the  		federal government. Concern was expressed both about federal usurpation of the  		States' traditional jurisdiction in family law and about the families right to  		privacy. While all issues regarding privacy and state jurisdiction have not  		been resolved, the general public, the Congress, and federal and State  		governments continue to support ongoing efforts to improve the financial  		security of children through the payment of child support. While the goal of  		providing child support for all children with a parent absent from the home is  		almost universally accepted, there is not unanimity about how to best achieve  		this goal. Major areas of concern include the relationship between child  		support and custody and visitation agreements, equity in the treatment of  		custodial and non-custodial parents in establishing and updating awards, the  		impact of second families on the establishment of awards and the expansion of  		targeted child support services to a universal entitlement.</p>

<h2><a name="homelessness" id="homelessness">HOMELESSNESS</a></h2>
<h4>1. Definition of the Problem Area</h4>
<p> This paper adopts the definition of a homeless person that is used in  		P.L. 100-77, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, enacted in July  		1987. Individuals are considered homeless if they lack a fixed, regular, and  		adequate nighttime residence or if their primary nighttime residence is a  		shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations, an institution  		providing temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized,  		or a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular  		sleeping accommodation for human beings.</p>
<p> Homelessness takes several forms. The Institute of Medicine  		distinguishes between temporary homelessness, episodic homelessness and chronic  		homelessness. Temporary homelessness occurs when people are displaced by  		calamities such as fires or evictions. If local employment and housing  		conditions are favorable, individuals may be rehoused relatively quickly.  		However, reintegration is sometimes difficult and may be compounded by  		secondary factors like loss of a car, family breakup or depression.  		Episodically homeless people go in and out of homelessness. Individuals or  		families move along with relatives or friends may experience homelessness in  		between. Other individuals living on fixed incomes may rent housing on a weekly  		basis, may be out of money and out of shelter before the month is over. The  		majority of the homeless fall into the temporary or episodic categories  		(Institute of Medicine, 1988). In 1988, about one-half of the sheltered  		population on a single night were estimated to have been homeless for less than  		3 months (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1989; Urban  		Institute, 1987). On the other hand, one-quarter were estimated to have been  		homeless for more than 3 years (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  		Development).</p>
<h4>2. Trends</h4>
<p> By many accounts, the number of homeless people has grown appreciably  		in recent years. Surveys conducted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 25  		representative cities in each of the past 2 years show that most cities  		reported annual increases of 15 to 50 percent. However, more rigorous research  		efforts suggest that the growth rate is lower, probably about 10%. A  		substantial majority of the cities report that families are the fastest growing  		segment of the homeless population (U.S. Conference of Mayors, 1987 cited in  		Institute of Medicine, 1988).</p>
<p> The following factors are believed to have contributed to the growth in  		homelessness: (1) a shortage of low-income housing, (2) changing economic  		trends and inadequate income supports, and (3) the prevalence of mental illness  		among the homeless (estimated by NIMH to be about 33% of the homeless  		population).</p>
<p> Since 1980 the aggregate supply of low-income housing has declined by  		2.5 million units. Concurrently, half the national total of SRO housing (Single  		Room Occupancy) has been lost to conversion or demolition since 1970. The GAO  		estimates that 900,000 subsidized low-income housing units will disappear from  		the low-income housing market and return to the open market by 1995. The  		housing shortage has been accompanied by a rise in the relative price of  		remaining units and a rise in the proportion of income which must be devoted to  		the purchase of shelter (U.S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey, 1985). In  		1974 median rent paid by poor families made up 35 percent of their income; in  		1985 it was 65 percent of income. The situation is worse for single parent  		households; in 1983 one-third of these families were paying more than 75  		percent of their income on rent (Brown and Yinger).</p>
<p> Between 1973 and 1984 the number of people in poverty in the U.S. rose  		from 23 million to 34 million. Welfare programs such as AFDC and general  		assistance programs have not kept pace with inflation. Between 1970 and 1985,  		median AFDC benefits nationwide declined by about one-third in real dollars.  		General assistance benefits declined by one-third during the 1970's (Institute  		of Medicine, 1988).</p>
<p> The populations of public mental hospitals fell from a high of 559,000  		in 1955 to a low of 130,000 in 1980. But the mental health system is not the  		only one to transfer clients to community-based services, nor is it clear how  		many of those leaving State hospitals became homeless. The criminal justice  		system, the mental retardation system and the foster care system all discharge  		young people when they age out of the system even when there is nowhere to live  		(Institute of Medicine, 1988).</p>
<h4>3. Number of Children and Families in Need/Service  		Population</h4>
<p> Based on State-reported data, a recent GAO report estimates that, at a  		given time, about 68,000 children 16 years old or younger are homeless and  		186,000 are precariously sheltered in shared housing. Of these, roughly 25,000  		are housed in shelters or hotels and 4,000 in churches. Perhaps the most  		disturbing statistic is that about 9,000 children are estimated to stay in  		public places, such as cars, abandoned buildings, bus terminals, etc. Roughly  		8,000 are housed in other facilities, such as spousal abuse centers,  		detoxification cells or jails. Over the course of a year, about 300,000 youth  		are estimated to receive services from shelters or voucher providers (General  		Accounting Office, 1989). The GAO estimates were relatively consistent with  		other data sources.</p>
<p> In late 1987 based on a national sample, the Urban Institute estimated  		that families with children made up 23 percent of all homeless people among the  		service-using homeless population in cities of 100,000 or more. Most homeless  		families are headed by women with two or three children (Bassuk et al., 1986).  		Most of the children are under the age of 5 and are spending their critical  		developmental years without the stability and security of a permanent home.  		Homeless children have been found to have poor school attendance, more health  		problems, and lower rates of immunization (Institute of Medicine, 1988).</p>
<p> While the majority of homeless families are headed by women, the  		proportions vary by geographic region of the country. In the West there are  		more 2-parent homeless families. The number of homeless families that are  		recipients of AFDC is unclear. The 1987 Urban Institute study estimated that  		33% of service-using homeless families were AFDC recipients. A Massachusetts  		study indicated that long-term recipients are over-represented among homeless  		families (Bassuk et al., 1986). Researchers have reported that homeless mothers  		typically are quite isolated and have few supportive relationships. Many  		homeless mothers are victims of family violence. In Massachusetts 45 percent of  		a sample of women in family shelters had a history of an abusive relationship  		with a spouse or mate; 22 percent of the sample were involved in an  		investigation of follow-up of child abuse and neglect (Bassuk et al., 1986). A  		national sample of family shelter managers in 1988 reported that about half  		their adult clients had been involved in domestic violence, about 12 percent  		were mentally ill and 20 percent had alcohol problems (U.S. Department of  		Housing and Urban Development, 1989). A substantial proportion of homeless  		families using the sheltering system can be characterized as multiproblem  		families. These families have chronic economic, educational, vocational, and  		social problems, have fragmented support networks; and have difficulty  		accessing the traditional service system (Institute of Medicine, 1988).</p>
<h4>4. Program Expenditures</h4>
<p> A 1988 National Survey of Shelters for the Homeless (U.S. Department of  		Housing and Urban Development, 1989) shows that the number of homeless shelters  		in the U.S. has tripled since 1984, and that the money spent annually to  		provide shelter has increased fivefold over this period. In 1988, it was  		estimated that there were 5,400 shelters with a 275,000 bed capacity in the  		U.S. compared to 1,900 in 1984 with a 100,000 bed capacity. Two out of every 3  		beds was occupied on an average night in 1988, an occupancy rate similar to the  		1984 rate. However, occupancy rates are seasonal with high occupancy during  		adverse weather and low occupancy in milder conditions.</p>
<p> In 1988 more than one-third of all shelter served families with  		children with a 58,300 bed capacity. Another 25 percent of the shelters served  		unaccompanied men with an estimated 89,100 beds and 39 percent of the shelters  		served other populations with an estimated 124,254 beds. In the past the  		country's shelter system has been criticized for being organized exclusively to  		serve adult individuals. This is less true in recent years. Families are  		rapidly becoming major users of homeless shelters. In 1988, 40 percent of the  		sheltered homeless were family members compared to 21 percent in 1984.  		Three-quarters of sheltered families are composed of single parents with  		children, with the remainder almost equally divided between couples with and  		without children.</p>
<p> A large proportion of shelter services relies on the efforts of  		volunteers (Institute of Medicine, 1988). Ninety percent of shelters are  		operated by private, non-profit groups aided by volunteers. Two-thirds of the  		funding comes from local, State and federal governments.</p>
<p> In 1988 the nation's shelter managers estimated that $1.5 billion was  		spent on shelters nationwide, compared to $300 million in 1984. Approximately  		two-thirds of the 1988 shelter revenues came from a variety of federal, State  		and local government sources including the Federal Emergency Management  		Agency's Food and Shelter Program, HUD's Emergency Shelter Grant and Community  		Development Block Grant programs, and HHS's Community Services Block Grant  		program. In contrast, one one-third of shelter revenues came from public  		sources in 1984. Private contributions, although proportionately less of the  		total, more than doubled since 1984.</p>
<p> Federal legislation has provided a program of emergency assistance to  		families receiving AFDC who are temporarily displaced from their usual living  		arrangements. AFDC special needs and AFDC emergency assistance have become the  		primary mechanisms for financing family shelters and supportive services in  		many communities, largely through payments for hotel and motel rooms or similar  		accommodations. These funds can only be used for relatively short-term crises  		and not for permanent housing. Thirty states have elected to have emergency  		assistance programs with an average monthly caseload of 46,185 and Fiscal Year  		1988 expenditures of $21 million (Committee on Ways and Means, 1989).</p>
<p> The major homeless aid bill of the 100th Congress, the Stewart McKinney  		Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, was signed into law on July 23, 1987. IN FY88  		$362.5 million was appropriated under this act: including $114 million for  		FEMA's (Federal Emergency Management Agency) emergency food and shelter  		program, $8 million for HUD's State grants for emergency shelter, $49 million  		for a supportive housing demonstration program, $15 million for HUD's permanent  		housing for the handicapped, $14 million for outpatient health care for the  		homeless through HHS, $19 million for HHS's Community Service Grants for the  		homeless, $11.5 million for HHS mental health demonstration grants, $7 million  		for the Department of Education for literacy programs for the homeless, $5  		million for education programs for homeless school children, $2 million for  		veteran's job training, $7.7 million for job training demonstrations, $59  		million for food stamps, and $50 million for temporary emergency food  		assistance programs (National Coalition for the Homeless, 1988). The FY 1990  		Bush budget request was close to $1 billion.</p>
<h4>5. Cost Per Family</h4>
<p> The average cost per person, per night, for shelter services for family  		members was $29 in 1988 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,  		1989). However, the costs vary dramatically depending on services provided by  		the shelter and supportive services. For example, the GAO reported the cost per  		person for transitional shelter in New York City was $69 per night.</p>
<p> In 1986 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts paid between $1,350 and  		$1,600 per month per family for emergency assistance housing (Institute of  		Medicine, 1988).</p>
<h4>6. Cost to Address Unmet Service Need</h4>
<p> Assuming, conservatively, that only the 9,000 children sleeping in  		public places need shelter facilities (along with their parents or guardians)  		and that there are 2 children per family, it is estimated that $48 million per  		year is needed to shelter those currently without facilities. Providing  		services to those in suboptimal shelter, such as those living doubled up with  		relatives, would multiply these costs. However, shelters would be hard pressed  		to open slots only to children and their families and to reject single adults.  		Thus, a higher level of funding would be needed to increase capacities  		adequately for children. More comprehensive services and/or efforts to make  		rental housing more affordable could have costs into the billions of  		dollars.</p>
<p> It should be noted that a recent HUD survey indicated some excess  		shelter capacity on some nights for shelters accepting families. Also, there is  		seasonal variation in shelter need.</p>
<h4>7. Effectiveness of Intervention</h4>
<p> No evaluations were identified. Since the primary goal is short-term  		shelter, current interventions probably meet this need. However, media reports  		indicate that shelters are often substandard, especially from the perspective  		of the needs of young families.</p>
<h4>8. Public Opinion</h4>
<p> In the past few years, homelessness, along with the related issues of  		poverty and hunger, have appeared on pollsters' lists of the social problems  		most frequently mentioned as a serious domestic problem. Homelesness, along  		with poverty and hunger, frequently appears as second to drugs as a leading  		concern of Americans. In recent Gallup and Washington Post/ABC polls, about 10  		percent of the public cited homelessness, poverty and hunger as the nation's  		biggest problem, twice as high as a few years ago (Morin, 1989). Further, the  		public appears to believe that conditions have not improved or is uncertain  		that the government knows how to solve the problems of poverty ("Poverty is  		Perceived as Increasing," 1989).</p>
<p> Nonetheless, the public believes that government should play a role. A  		majority (54 percent) of voters surveyed in June 1988 said they would be "much  		more likely" to support a Presidential candidate who supports "more financial  		assistance for the homeless and those truly needy who cannot afford basic  		necessities, like food, clothing and shelter." Seventy-nine percent said they  		would "probably support" higher taxes to pay for such assistance, but slightly  		under half (42 percent) said they would "definitely support" higher taxes for  		these purposes (Gallup Poll, 1988).</p>
