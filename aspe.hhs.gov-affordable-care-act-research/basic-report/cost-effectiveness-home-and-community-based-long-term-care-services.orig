<h3>How Much Does Medicaid Spend on Long-Term Care? How Much  		is for Home and Community-Based Services as Compared to Institutional  		Care?</h3>
<p> Medicaid is the major source of public funding for long-term care  		services. Medicaid spending on long-term care services in FY 1999 totaled $62.4  		billion. Of this amount, $36.4 billion was spent on nursing home care.  		Approximately $9.6 billion was spent on institutional services for people with  		mental retardation (intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded or  		ICFs/MR). $16.4 billion was spent on services provided in home and  		community-based settings. </p>
<p> Medicaid expenditures for home and community-based services include  		spending on Medicaid-funded home health services, personal care services, and  		home and community-based waiver services.</p>
<p> Thus, in FY 1999, expenditures for home and community-based services  		accounted for 26.2 percent of all Medicaid long-term care expenditures.</p>
<p>Although a majority of Medicaid expenditures on long-term care are for  		nursing homes and ICFs/MR, the picture is quite different if the focus is  		shifted to the number of clients served. The most recent comparative data  		available on numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving various types of  		long-term care are from 1995: Medicaid home and community-based services  		programs for the elderly and disabled (Medicaid home health, personal care  		services and home and community-based services waiver programs) served a total  		of 1,847,369 recipients--as contrasted with 1,036,833 in nursing homes. Thus,  		64 percent of Medicaid recipients who are elderly and disabled long-term care  		clients received some type of home and community-based services. (Ladd et al.,  		1999) Similarly, about the same percentage of individuals with mental  		retardation/developmental disabilities (MR/DD) receiving Medicaid long-term  		care services receive these services in home and community-based settings  		rather than ICFs/MR. (Lakin, personal communication, 1999).</p>
<h3>What Options do States Have in Medicaid for Covering  		Home and Community-Based Services?</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Coverage of home health services is mandatory</b>. Home health  			 services encompass registered nurse, licensed rehabilitation therapist and home  			 health aide services delivered through certified home health agencies. In FY  			 1999, Medicaid expenditures for home health services totaled $2.2  			 billion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In contrast, state coverage of other home and community-based  			 waiver and personal care services is at the discretion of the  			 states.</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <b>home and community-based waivers</b>, states may request  			 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) approval to cover non-professional  			 services such as personal care, homemaker/chore services, home-delivered meals,  			 adult day care, habilitation services, or any other services the state believes  			 are alternatives to institutional care for a specified number of recipients who  			 are considered to be "at risk" of requiring institutional care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services provided under home and community-based services waivers  			 need not be offered state-wide and they may be targeted only to certain  			 populations (e.g., elderly and physically disabled adults, persons with MR/DD,  			 ventilator-dependent children, persons with severe mental illness, persons with  			 HIV/AIDs). States may have one or more waiver programs targeted at different  			 populations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medicaid personal care services</b> may be provided as a optional  			 benefit under the state plan. This benefit covers only personal care. When  			 personal care services are provided under the plan as an optional service, as  			 contrasted with a waiver, they must be made available state-wide and they must  			 be provided to all Medicaid eligibles who meet need criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States may elect to use either or both of these coverage  			 options.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>How Many States Offer Home and Community-Based Care and  		How Much do They Spend?</h3>
<p> All states have one or more programs that finance home and  		community-based services for individuals with chronic functional disabilities  		(Ladd et al., 1995; Ladd et al., 1999). The major source of financing for these  		programs is Medicaid. Other funding sources include Title III of the Older  		Americans Act, the Social Services Block Grant, and state appropriations.</p>
<p> There are, however, dramatic differences across states and by target  		population (aged/disabled or mentally retarded/developmentally disabled). For  		example, Oregon spends 45 percent of its total long-term care expenditures for  		the elderly and disabled on home and community-based services, whereas  		Tennessee spends 97 percent of its elderly and disabled long-term care  		expenditures on nursing homes.</p>
<p>Among state Medicaid long-term care programs for persons with MR/DD, 17  		states spent more than two-thirds of expenditures on individuals residing in  		ICFs/MR, whereas in eight states more than two-thirds of Medicaid long-term  		care expenditures are spent on services in home and community-based  		settings.</p>
<p>Nationally, 18.2 percent of long-term care spending for the elderly and  		disabled is for home and community services, while 37.5 percent of long-term  		care expenditures for people with MR/DD services is in home and community-based  		settings rather than in institutions. (John Drabek, ASPE/DHHS, tabulation of  		HCFA data for 1997.)</p>
<h3>Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Waiver  		Services</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the previous paragraph, all states have at least one  		Medicaid funded home and community-based services program. In FY 1999, home and  		community-based services waiver spending across the states totaled $10.6  		billion.</p>
<p>Nationally, three-quarters of all home and community-based waiver  		spending is for services for individuals with MR/DD. However, a number of  		states have chosen the Medicaid 1915(c) waiver option as their primary  		mechanism for funding home and community-based services for aged/disabled,  		including Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Minnesota.</p>
<p>Three services account for nearly four-fifths of all 1915(c) waiver  		expenditures: habilitation, personal care, and homemaker services. Case  		management is a covered service in more than two-thirds of waiver programs, but  		accounts for only about 6 percent of waiver expenditures. Similarly, respite  		care is available in 60 percent of waiver programs but accounts for less than 2  		percent of expenditures. (Miller et al., 1999). </p>
<p>1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services waiver authority has been  		available since 1981. States which choose to cover these services must submit a  		waiver request to HCFA. HCFA approves state waiver requests after reviewing  		them to ensure the statutory and regulatory requirements have been met.</p>
<h3>Medicaid Personal Care Services: The State Plan  		Option</h3>
<p> Thirty states and the District of Columbia include a personal care  		services benefit in their Medicaid state plans. The personal care benefit is  		used primarily by elderly and younger physically disabled persons. In FY 1999,  		Medicaid spending under the personal care state plan option totaled $3.5  		billion.</p>
<p>Where a state elects to provide the personal care services benefit, it  		is available to all those enrolled in the states Medicaid program who meet the  		criteria for personal care. Thus, it is not possible for the personal care  		services benefit to have a waiting list. Aggregate annual funding is open-ended  		because states must serve all eligibles. However, states may set coverage  		limits. These coverage limits may be imposed regardless of need. In other  		words, states are under no obligation to provide the full amount of personal  		care services that a disabled Medicaid-eligible individual may require in order  		to have all of his or her needs for assistance met. Neither is a state required  		to provide a sufficient level of personal care services to ensure that the  		recipient can live safely in the community. In many programs, personal care  		services providers who determine that coverage limits prevent them from  		providing the level of service which the provider considers necessary to  		maintain a given client safely in the community may legally refuse to provide  		these services to that client. </p>
<p> The personal care benefit has been available in Medicaid since the  		mid-1970s. Examples of states which have chosen to provide home and  		community-based services for the elderly and disabled predominantly through the  		personal care services benefit are New York, California, Texas, and Arkansas.  		These states also have smaller 1915(c) home and community-based waiver programs  		for the aged and disabled. </p>
<p> States are not required to limit coverage of personal care services to  		individuals who qualify for nursing home admission. There is also no statutory  		requirement that the personal care services benefit demonstrate  		cost-effectiveness or budget neutrality vis a vis spending on nursing home  		care. In some states, a doctor's order is sufficient to establish need for  		personal care services. In other states, individuals' needs for assistance with  		basic and/or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs and IADLs) are  		assessed and coverage is authorized only if an established threshold of  		severity of disability has been met. Some states provide personal care to  		clients with one or more Activity of Daily Living (ADL) dependencies (i.e.,  		"personal care" needs); others require two or more ADL dependencies. Still  		others use a standardized assessment instrument that assigns "points" to  		various ADL and IADL dependency measures; individuals can satisfy the coverage  		requirements with a variety of combinations of ADL/IADL assistance needs. Some  		measures of service need consider only "hands-on" assistance; others include  		stand-by assistance or verbal cuing. </p>
<h3>Why Do States Elect to Use One or the Other of These  		Medicaid Coverage Options?</h3>
<p>States that choose the personal care services option can simply submit a  		state plan amendment to elect this benefit. </p>
<p> States may choose the personal care services option if they wish to  		serve everyone in the state who meets the functional need criteria. Unlike the  		waivers, the personal care benefit is not restricted by Federal law to persons  		who are in need of an institutional level of care. Also, under the personal  		care benefit, states need not make calculations about cost neutrality with  		respect to institutional care.</p>
<p> States have two motives for choosing to use a home and community-based  		services waiver rather than the personal care services option. First, services  		coverage under the personal care benefit is far more restrictive than the  		waiver program, since it only covers personal care attendant services. The home  		and community-based services waiver permits coverage of a broader range of  		services, including services such as habilitation which are unique to the needs  		of individuals with MR/DD. Second, some states fear the possibility of runaway  		spending under the personal care option since it is available for all who meet  		the qualifying criteria. The home and community-based services waiver mechanism  		permits states to cap aggregate as well as per capita expenditures. States are  		held to a "budget neutrality" standard under the waiver but states themselves  		have some ability to define that standard and can change it by submitting an  		amended waiver request to HCFA.</p>
<h3>Waiting Lists are Permitted</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The number of clients who may be served annually in a home and  			 community-based waiver program is limited to the number of unduplicated  			 recipients that the state has requested and had approved by HCFA; however,  			 there is no requirement that states serve this maximum number of recipients.  			 For example, Florida currently has Federal approval to serve approximately  			 42,000 recipients annually across several different home and community-based  			 waiver programs; however, the legislature has appropriated funds sufficient to  			 serve only about 22,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For administrative/managerial purposes, states typically determine  			 the maximum number of clients who can be served at any given point in time so  			 as not to exceed--as individual clients go on and off the program over the  			 course of the year--the maximum annual number of federally approved (or state  			 authorized) waiver recipients. This maximum "caseload" is commonly referred to  			 as the number of available waiver "slots." Generally speaking, slots are  			 assigned to the various case management agencies that are responsible for  			 administering the program at the local level (that is, each agency is allocated  			 a fixed number of "slots" and given a budget predicated on the number of  			 "slots" the agency has been allocated). Once all slots have been filled, new  			 applicants are placed on a waiting list. Before a new client may be admitted to  			 the program, a "slot" must be vacated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In theory, a case management agency might be able to admit  			 additional clients to the program in excess of its approved "slots"--if it  			 could more economically provide benefits--thereby lowering average per capita  			 spending (e.g., using volunteers to provide respite services). Otherwise, the  			 agency would exceed its budget allocation. Because going over budget for a case  			 management agency and its providers is viewed as taking a risk that excess  			 services will never be reimbursed, case management and provider agencies tend  			 to be quite reluctant to admit clients over and above the "slots" they are  			 budgeted to serve. The state agency in charge of the waiver program might not  			 reimburse the case management agency--and the providers it contracts with to  			 provide the actual services--for costs in excess of its authorized budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state agency might deal with such a situation by transferring  			 unused funds (if there are any) from another case management agency's budget  			 elsewhere in the state. It may also request that HCFA increase the number of  			 people the state may serve under the waiver. Alternatively, the state agency  			 might decide to go to the state legislature to request a supplemental budget  			 appropriation (which the legislature might or might not be willing to grant).  			 The state agency would also need to consider whether or not such a request for  			 a supplemental appropriation would result in annual spending under the waiver  			 that would exceed the home and community-based services waiver standard for  			 "budget neutrality."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients on waiting lists for these waiver programs are frequently  			 served in state only companion programs which provide average benefit levels  			 less than half the state's share of average Medicaid benefits in the waiver  			 programs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Setting Waiver Cost Limits</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Under Federal Medicaid law, average annual expenditures per capita  			 for waiver clients may not exceed average annual Medicaid spending on  			 institutional residents (i.e., a nursing home, ICF/MR, or acute care hospital).  			 Thus, the annual aggregate expenditures for a home and community-based waiver  			 program targeted on the aged/disabled population may not exceed annual per  			 capita Medicaid costs for individuals in nursing homes (including expenditures  			 on nursing home care, hospital care, physician services and all other Medicaid  			 spending on such clients) times the number of waiver recipients that the state  			 has requested and been approved by HCFA to serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a state makes expenditures under the waiver that actually exceed  			 budget neutrality, HCFA will not necessarily take disallowances (i.e., deny  			 reimbursement for the Federal share) for expenditures in excess of budget  			 neutrality so long as the state takes swift corrective action--to ensure that  			 subsequent expenditures will fall below this cap or, alternatively, to amend  			 the state's waiver to obtain a higher budget neutrality standard. However,  			 states believe that HCFA is legally entitled to take disallowances if it  			 chooses and that HCFA might choose to do so. Accordingly, state officials  			 believe that they are placing the state in a financially risky position if they  			 allow their home and community-based waiver program expenditures to exceed the  			 "budget neutrality" caps.</p>
<p>This is one reason why, within the states' own administrative and  			 legislative processes, states may decide to set annual expenditure caps for  			 1915(c) waivers which are lower than the maximum spending that HCFA would  			 recognize as satisfying the statutory requirement of "cost-effectiveness" or  			 "budget neutrality." They do this in one or both of the following ways: (1) by  			 establishing coverage limits which will ensure average per capita home and  			 community-based services spending considerably less than 100 percent of average  			 per capita institutional costs and/or (2) by appropriating fixed annual budgets  			 for the state share of Medicaid waiver expenditures which do not provide  			 funding sufficient to fill all approved waiver slots. States which adopt such  			 an approach do so in order to protect themselves from coming anywhere near a  			 level of annual spending that would exceed "budget neutrality."</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Average Per Capita Spending</h3>
<p> In 1995, average monthly spending per capita for clients receiving  		services in "aged/disabled" home and community-based waivers across all states  		with these waivers was $485 per month. In contrast, average monthly spending  		per Medicaid-covered nursing home resident was $2,426.14. Average per capita  		spending under the personal care services benefit was $589 per month. (Ladd et  		al., 1999). Comparable figures for average per capita spending on individuals  		with MR/DD under the waiver are not available.</p>
<h3>Waiver Eligibility</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The Federal statute authorizing home and community-based services  			 waivers refers to clients who may be served under the waiver as individuals who  			 "but for" the waiver services would require care in nursing homes or other  			 institutional settings. Strictly speaking, this language implies that states  			 may only serve those clients in waiver programs whom the state is certain would  			 enter nursing homes or other institutional care settings if the waiver services  			 were not provided. As a practical matter, however, it is no simple matter for  			 states to determine prospectively which clients who are eligible for Medicaid  			 services in nursing homes would actually enter nursing homes or ICFs/MR in the  			 absence of waiver services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether a state would actually have to pay for institutional  			 services for all clients eligible for institutional care in the absence of home  			 and community-based waiver services is complicated by the fact that many states  			 have closed down ICFs/MR so that the bed supply in such facilities is steadily  			 declining. This reached the point by June 1997 that in one-third of all states  			 (17), the number of people with MR/DD enrolled in home and community-based  			 waiver programs outnumbered the ICF/MR population by more than 4 to 1. Thus, it  			 would be impossible for many MR/DD clients currently receiving services under  			 the waiver to be served in institutional settings. An analogous situation is  			 now developing with respect to the availability of nursing home beds for the  			 aged and disabled in some states. In Oregon, for example, there are now more  			 than twice as many Medicaid aged and disabled clients receiving 1915(c)  			 waiver-funded home and community-based services as there are Medicaid-funded  			 residents of nursing homes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The "Cold Bed Rule"</h3>
<p>Throughout most of the first dozen or so years of the 1915(c) waiver  		program, the Office of Management and Budget required HCFA to take the  		availability of nursing home and ICF/MR beds into account in approving state  		requests for home and community-based waiver slots. States were often asked to  		document that nursing home or ICF/MR beds equal to the number of new waiver  		slots being requested would be closed (or, alternatively, had been approved for  		construction under "Certificate of Need" requirements but would not be built).  		This requirement--known as the "cold bed" rule--was widely criticized for  		limiting the expansion of home and community services. However, early in the  		Clinton Administration, an agreement was reached with the National Governors'  		Association that HCFA would no longer take institutional bed supply into  		account in reviewing states' waiver requests and this change was reflected in  		the most recent (1994) HCFA regulations. </p>
<h3>Can Home and Community-Based Services Substitute for  		Nursing Home Care?</h3>
<p> In principle, either the personal care services benefit or the home and  		community-based services waiver programs could provide highly disabled Medicaid  		eligible individuals with an alternative to nursing home placement. However, in  		practice, there are limitations on the effectiveness of these programs in  		deterring nursing home admissions.</p>
<p> In an effort to ensure cost-effectiveness, states may impose per capita  		cost limits that make it difficult to meet some individuals' functional  		assistance needs unless the individual has access to supplemental informal  		help. This is especially likely if an individual requires 24 hour supervision  		and on-call assistance.</p>
<h3>Cost-Effective Compared to What?</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The average private pay cost for a year of nursing home care is now  			 estimated to be $46,000 (Wiener and Stevenson, 1998). However, Medicaid does  			 not pay private pay rates. The relationship between private pay and Medicaid  			 rates varies from state to state; average Medicaid rates are at least 25  			 percent and perhaps as much as 33 percent lower than private pay rates. In  			 addition, most Medicaid-covered nursing home residents have some personal  			 income from Social Security, private pensions, and other sources which must be  			 applied toward the cost of nursing home care. Typically, such private income  			 covers from one-quarter to one-third of a Medicaid nursing home resident's  			 monthly bill.</p>
<p> Per capita Medicaid spending on nursing home care averaged $2,426  			 per month in 1995 (Ladd et al., 1999). This means that if the average state  			 spent more than this amount per month on home and community-based services for  			 an individual client, they would likely to be spending more than they would  			 have spent had that same individual entered a nursing home. Requiring clients  			 to apply their private income toward the costs of home and community-based  			 services--as would be required in the nursing home--is impractical because when  			 an individual resides in the community all or most of those funds are needed to  			 cover basic living expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many states will authorize monthly personal care services or home  			 and community-based services waiver benefit levels in individual cases which  			 are far in excess of average per capita, monthly benefits. Some individuals in  			 some states may receive services that cost in excess of what Medicaid would  			 have paid had they been institutionalized. However, even in Oregon, one of the  			 most generous states, coverage limits are such that spending for home and  			 community-based services under the waiver will not exceed $1,500-$1,800 per  			 month for any individual client. Individuals who require more services to  			 maintain them safely in the community must enter nursing homes. Only one  			 state--New York--routinely authorizes personal care services benefits costing  			 $1,500 per month or more for severely disabled clients. For a small percentage  			 of clients in New York with very intensive service needs, the monthly cost of  			 personal care services is well in excess of what nursing home care would  			 cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One reason why states tend to be reluctant to authorize coverage  			 amounts that would bring average per capita spending on home and community  			 services up to the full amount of the average per capita nursing home payment  			 on nursing home care is that they believe that, on average, individuals who  			 reside in the community as opposed to nursing homes may make greater use of  			 other Medicaid-covered medical services (e.g. physician visits, emergency room  			 visits, home health agency services) than those residing in nursing homes where  			 the "medical model" provides for access to a certain amount of professional  			 medical attention and this cost is included in the daily nursing home  			 rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1995, average monthly per capita spending under home and  			 community-based waivers for the aged/disabled exceeded $1,000 in only a handful  			 of states: Hawaii-$1,229 for 404 individuals, Maine-$1,075 for 1,225  			 individuals, New York-$1,187 for 23,021 individuals, and North Carolina-$1,030  			 for 7,648 individuals. Average monthly per capita personal care services  			 spending also exceeded $1,000 in only a handful of states: D.C.-$1,126 for 866  			 individuals, Massachusetts-$1,725 for 5,717 individuals, New Hampshire-$1,370  			 for 126 individuals, New York-$1,055 for 125,991. </p>

</ul><h2><a name="research" id="research">RESEARCH FINDINGS ON THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF HOME  		AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES COMPARED TO NURSING HOME SERVICES</a></h2>
<h3>Studies Focusing on Alternatives to Nursing Home Care  		for the Elderly and Disabled</h3>
<p> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Federal Government sponsored  		a series of randomized controlled experimental and quasi-experimental design  		demonstrations to test the cost-effectiveness of home and community-based  		services as a substitute for nursing home use. Most of these demonstrations  		were Medicaid "1115" research and demonstration projects. They served as the  		experimental prototypes for the Medicaid home and community-based services  		waiver program, although Congress enacted the 1915(c) waiver legislation in  		1981, several years before the research for these demonstrations was completed  		and the findings were known.</p>
<p>The best known of these projects is the National Channeling  		Demonstration, which tested two different models of financing and delivering  		home and community-based services in six sites each (Kemper et al., 1988).  		However, HCFA and the National Center for Health Services Research also  		sponsored more than a dozen other state or region-specific demonstrations. The  		best known of these are the National Center for Health Services Research Day  		Care/Homemaker study, the South Carolina LTC demonstration, Georgia Alternative  		Health Services (AHS), Connecticut Triage, ACCESS in Rochester, New York, and  		New York's "Nursing Home Without Walls." In the early 1980s, the Health Care  		Financing Administration contracted with Berkeley Planning Associates to carry  		out a cross-cutting evaluation of 13 projects that were conducted under either  		Medicaid 1115 and/or Medicare 222 research and demonstration waivers (Berkeley  		Planning Associates, 1984). Kemper et al. (1987) provides an overview and  		meta-analysis of 15 federally-sponsored demonstration projects testing home and  		community-based alternatives to institutionalization, including the Channeling  		Demonstration.</p>
<p>The National Channeling Demonstration data were widely disseminated in  		the late 1980s in the form of a public use data-tape. Several researchers  		(Greene, 1993; Weissert, 1993) have developed sophisticated computer models  		which simulate alternative targeting and benefit levels and/or changes in  		service mix. The purpose of the modeling is to determine whether any such  		changes might have yielded different outcomes with regard to Channeling's  		cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, the Health Care Financing Administration contracted  		with La Jolla Management Corporation to conduct an evaluation of the early  		experience of the Medicaid 1915(c) waiver program. The evaluation focused on  		the Georgia Community Care Services Program (which was built upon the state's  		experience with the Georgia Alternative Health Services Demonstration) and  		three waiver programs in California (the California Multipurpose Senior  		Services Program which targeted the elderly, the California In-Home Medical  		Care Waiver, which targeted ventilator-dependent children, and the California  		Developmentally Disabled Services Waiver, which targeted the developmentally  		disabled/mentally retarded.) (Clinkscale and Vertrees, 1986; Vertrees et al.,  		1989). </p>
<p> In recent years, efforts to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home and  		community-based waiver programs have focused on the widely admired programs in  		Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Colorado. These studies have employed  		historical trend data to project what nursing home and total aggregate  		long-term care costs might have been in the absence of these programs (GAO,  		1994; AARP/Lewin, 1996; Weissert et al.). There is no analogous evaluation  		research literature on the cost-effectiveness of Medicaid personal care  		services programs.</p>
<p>A review of the research literature on the cost-effectiveness of home  		and community-based services alternatives to nursing home care yields the  		following major findings:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>The "woodwork" effect seriously impedes the cost-effectiveness of  			 home and community-based services.</b></p>
<p> Research and demonstration projects that used controlled  			 experimental or quasi-experimental designs to evaluate the cost-effectiveness  			 of home and community-based services under the above programs and  			 demonstrations found that expanding access to these services did not succeed in  			 reducing--and indeed most often increased--aggregate long-term care  			 expenditures (that is, total long-term care spending, including spending for  			 nursing home and home and community-based services combined).</p>
<p>A review of 15 separate research and demonstration studies on the  			 cost-effectiveness of home and community-based services alternatives to nursing  			 homes (Kemper et al., 1987) found that: </p>
<blockquote><p> "Small reductions in nursing home costs for some [clients] are  				more than offset by the increased costs of providing expanded community  				services to others who, even without expanded services, would not enter nursing  				homes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The HCFA sponsored cross-cutting evaluation of federally-sponsored  			 demonstrations conducted under Medicaid 1115 and/or Medicare 222 research and  			 demonstration authority (Berkeley Planning Associates, 1984) had already  			 reached a similar conclusion. Only two of the thirteen projects studied  			 demonstrated cost containment after the incremental coss of case management and  			 expanded community services were considered. The authors concluded that these  			 two projects (South Carolina CLTCP and On Lok CCODA) did not raise total costs  			 because they targeted services on individuals who had both high levels of  			 functional impairment and high risk of nursing home placement. Other projects  			 were unsuccessful in achieving cost containment because, though the individuals  			 served were financially and functionally "eligible" for nursing home placement,  			 they actually had a low likelihood of entering nursing homes in the absence of  			 formal home care. </p>
<p>This finding which has been confirmed in numerous other reviews of  			 individual studies (Weissert et al., 1988; Weissert and Cready, 1989; Kane et  			 al., 1998), has become widely known as the "woodwork effect." </p>
<p> In one randomized design demonstration (Georgia AHS) it was  			 determined that of every five participants who received home and  			 community-based services as an alternative to nursing home care, two would not  			 have actually entered nursing homes in the absence of the experimental  			 intervention. Other demonstrations did even more poorly in prospectively  			 identifying the applicants for home and community-based services for whom the  			 services truly served as a deterrent to nursing home admission. For example,  			 Vertrees et al. (1989) estimated that targeting efficiency in the Georgia  			 1915(c) HCBS waiver (which was based on the Georgia AHS demonstration) was  			 greater by a factor of ten that of the California Multipurpose Senior Service  			 Program (also a demonstration that became a 1915(c) waiver program). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Narrow targeting, low average benefit levels (taking into account  			 availability of informal supports), and a strong emphasis on services provided  			 in alternative residential facilities can increase the chances that home and  			 community-based services programs will achieve budget neutrality.</b></p>
<p>Controlled experimental and quasi-experimental design evaluations of  			 research and demonstration programs suggest that home and community-based  			 services programs can achieve budget neutrality--but only under certain  			 circumstances. Programs in which increased spending on home and community-based  			 services was offset by reductions in nursing home spending shared the following  			 attributes:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>They restrained spending on case management. (E.g., the South  				  Carolina demonstration which achieved budget neutrality spent $49 per client,  				  on average, for case management as compared to $85-$145 per client in the other  				  demonstrations which increased aggregate long-term care costs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They provided services only to clients judged to be at high risk  				  of nursing home admission. (E.g., applicants who were already in nursing homes  				  or who had applied for nursing home admission and had passed pre-admission  				  screens qualifying them for nursing home placement).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They kept benefit levels low. That is, per capita spending for  				  home and community-based services was substantially less, on average, than per  				  capita spending for nursing home care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available services included residential care alternatives to  				  nursing homes or ICFs/MR (e.g., "board and care" or other small group  				  homes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They emphasized low cost approaches to the provision of  				  services--approaches that minimized administrative overhead and kept labor  				  costs down by employing low-wage non-professionals wherever possible. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Unfortunately, abiding by these requirements in the design of home  			 and community-based services programs results in very restrictive eligibility  			 for these programs and also places less emphasis on "home care" (as distinct  			 from "community-based" residential settings other than nursing homes) than many  			 elderly and disabled persons would prefer. </p>
<p> Kemper et al. (1987) drew the following policy implications:</p>
<blockquote><p> "In light of the demonstration results, the issue of eligibility  				criteria changes from one of targeting efficiency--for whom will cost reduction  				through substitution of community care for nursing home care be greatest--to  				one of equity--who deserves the limited community care that society can pay  				for."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Vertrees et al. (1989) evaluated four 1915(c) waiver programs and  			 found that none were budget neutral. These researchers concluded that if HCBS  			 programs must be "budget neutral" in order to be considered successful, they  			 will fail the test. However, they also questioned the appropriateness of  			 judging the value of HCBS by this criterion alone:</p>
<blockquote><p> "No one requires that Medicaid hospital payments or expenditures  				for physician services be budget neutral. In other words, these programs [HCBS  				waiver programs] actually should ultimately be judged against broader social  				criteria in order to determine if the good that is done by them outweighs their  				cost by more than the good that could be obtained by spending the same amount  				of money in alternative ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Medicaid law continues to require that 1915(c) waiver program  			 expenditures cannot exceed projections of the total expenditures for  			 institutional services in the absence of HCBS alternatives. Wiener and  			 Stephenson (1998) note that this requirement drives states to impose  			 restrictions on access to HCBS. For example,</p>
<blockquote><p>"In order to mitigate the 'woodwork effect,' states must limit use  				of home and community-based care to those who otherwise would be  				institutionalized without services, Thus, Colorado first screens all home and  				community-based services waiver applicants to determine whether or not they  				would qualify for nursing home coverage based on their severity of functional  				disability. Colorado then employs a second screen to assess the likelihood that  				a given individual will actually enter a nursing home. Only those applicants  				who pass both screens receive home and community services. This process is  				criticized by some as making it more difficult to obtain home and  				community-based services than to obtain nursing home care, which reinforces the  				institutional bias of the delivery system."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kane et al. (1998) take a more optimistic view:</p>
<blockquote><p> "Undoubtedly, there is validity to the concerns about a woodwork  				effect, but Oregon and other states that have heavily invested in alternatives  				found this effect was not overwhelming and could be offset by efficiencies in  				[home and community-based services] HCBS programs." These authors go on to  				state that: "The woodwork effect could be a greater problem in states with a  				low level of current provision and high poverty rates, thus creating a pent-up  				demand for service--for example, Alabama and Georgia, but even then a carefully  				targeted and managed program with available and well-priced services should, in  				the long run, reduce overall long-term care costs while serving more  				people."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> According to Kane et al. (1998), Oregon found that 2.6 people  			 needed to be served in home and community settings (including alternative forms  			 of residential care) to eliminate a single nursing home bed. In other words,  			 Oregon officials are convinced that it is necessary for a state to stimulate a  			 certain amount of "woodwork effect" in order for Medicaid-funded home and  			 community services to have enough impact in terms of achieving systemic reform  			 that it becomes possible to actually begin to reduce the availability of  			 nursing home beds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The goal of achieving "budget neutrality" poses difficult  			 trade-offs and often requires the imposition of unpopular limitations on access  			 to home and community services.</b></p>
<p> Research on cost-effectiveness of home and community services since  			 the late 1980s has typically focused on helping program administrators  			 fine-tune targeting and assessment criteria and determine the most appropriate  			 benefit levels and service mix. Reconciling the inherent contradiction between  			 targeting services to persons at greatest risk of nursing home admission,  			 providing the right types of services, while also keeping per capita costs down  			 is a difficult balancing act.</p>
<p> Weissert (1993) has estimated that in order to offset the "woodwork  			 effect" and achieve budget neutrality, average benefit levels in home and  			 community-based services programs should not exceed 20 percent of nursing home  			 costs. Wiener and Stephenson (1998) note that, in Colorado, cost-effectiveness  			 concerns have limited the average per recipient Medicaid cost of in-home and  			 alternative care facilities to 16 percent and 14 percent respectively of the  			 average per recipient Medicaid expenditure for nursing home care. </p>
<p> However, there is a significant trade-off between targeting  			 services on the high risk population and providing home and community-based  			 services benefits that are well under what would be spent on nursing home care  			 if the eligible individual actually entered a nursing home. Individuals who  			 lack strong informal supports often require high benefit levels to remain in  			 the community. Programs that strictly limit per capita spending to keep home  			 and community services benefit levels low may only be able to offer adequate  			 services to individuals who have substantial access to informal supports--and  			 these individuals are those most likely to be able to avoid nursing home  			 placement in the absence of home and community-based alternatives. The only  			 effective response appears to be to take the availability of informal care into  			 account in assessing need for publicly-funded services. Under these conditions,  			 very high benefit levels are reserved for highly disabled persons who live  			 alone and lack access to informal care. Clients with substantial access to  			 informal support receive low benefit levels, even when they are severely  			 disabled. </p>
<p> Some re-analyses of Channeling data (Greene et al., 1993) suggest  			 that home and community services might have proved to be a cost-effective  			 substitute for nursing home care if the service mix had emphasized  			 home-delivered skilled nursing services rather than personal care for those  			 most at risk of nursing home admission. Medicaid recipients of 1915(c) waiver  			 services may also receive additional skilled services via the Medicaid funded  			 home health services benefit. These Medicaid home health services must be  			 included in a state's calculations of cost-effectiveness for 1915(c) waiver  			 services. However, if elderly and disabled waiver clients also access  			 Medicare-financed home health benefits (most Medicaid eligible elderly are also  			 eligible for Medicare but most younger disabled are only eligible for  			 Medicaid), the cost of these services is not included in 1915(c) waiver  			 cost-effectiveness calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Recent research is leading policymakers more and more in the  			 direction of emphasizing home and community services in residential care  			 alternatives to nursing homes such as adult foster care homes, assisted living  			 facilities, and other board and care settings.</b></p>
<p>Some recent studies based on historical trend analysis suggest that,  			 by investing in home and community-based services, certain states (Oregon,  			 Washington, Colorado) have avoided building nursing home beds that otherwise  			 would have been built. (GAO, 1994; AARP/Lewin, 1996). In several of these  			 states, the nursing home beds which projections indicate would have been built  			 in the absence of home and community services were replaced by beds in other  			 residential care facilities including assisted living, adult foster care, and  			 other board and care facilities. For example, in Oregon, approximately  			 one-third of home and community-based services clients are served in  			 alternative residential facilities (i.e., adult foster homes, assisted living  			 facilities or other board and care settings). </p>
<p> Use of alternative residential care settings can result in Medicaid  			 costs savings for three reasons: (1) Alternative residential facilities charge  			 less than nursing homes because they provide fewer medical services, (2)  			 spend-down to Medicaid by private payers is slowed because per diem costs are  			 lower, and (3) Medicaid is not responsible for paying the room and board  			 portion of daily costs in these alternative residential settings, whereas  			 Medicaid must pay these costs in nursing homes. To the extent that Medicaid  			 savings accrue primarily from covering room and board costs in alternative  			 residential savings via other payment sources (mainly SSI cash assistance  			 payments which are all but eliminated when eligible individuals enter nursing  			 homes), use of residential alternatives represents a cost shift rather than a  			 true cost savings. </p>
<p> Lakin et al. (1998) reports that the number of persons with mental  			 retardation or other developmental disabilities in nursing homes continues to  			 decrease slowly. Individuals with MR/DD in nursing homes make up only 6.8  			 percent of all persons with these conditions who receive Medicaid long-term  			 care services including home and community-based services, ICF/MR or nursing  			 home care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Home and community services provided in a Medicaid client's own  			 or a relative's home may reduce nursing home use, when services are provided in  			 the context of a managed long-term care system. </b></p>
<p>The nation's first statewide capitated long-term care Medicaid  			 program--the Arizona Long-Term Care System (ALTCS) appears to have operated  			 cost-effectively while offering an expanded home care option (Weissert et al.,  			 1997). Because the ALTCS was implemented statewide, an evaluation could not be  			 conducted using a within-state control or comparison group. Accordingly, the  			 evaluators developed a sophisticated statistical model to simulate estimated  			 costs in the absence of home and community-based services. Coefficients for  			 institutionalization risk factors were estimated in a logistic regression model  			 developed using national data. These were applied to characteristics of Arizona  			 clients. A similar methodology was used to estimate lengths of nursing home  			 stays. Lengths of stay by the ALTCS' nursing home users were regressed on their  			 characteristics using an event history analysis model. Coefficients for these  			 characteristics from the regression analysis were then applied to HCB services  			 clients to estimate how long their nursing home stays would have lasted, had  			 they been institutionalized. The results suggested that home care did  			 substitute for some nursing home use that would otherwise have occurred because  			 total observed days of nursing home care among ALTCS clients were less than the  			 estimated days of nursing home use predicted by the model. The authors  			 observed:</p>
<blockquote><p> "These findings should be very encouraging for advocates of home  				care. With its structural features, the ALTCS program appears to have finally  				been able to encourage actual substitution of HCB services for nursing facility  				care. The most important features include a capitated program contractor with  				overall responsibility for costs of both nursing facility and home care; a  				limit on how much the program contractors could spend, set at an average for  				all patients; a competitively bid price; and incentives to spend less rather  				than more for care. These features appear to have achieved what previous  				fee-for-service home care efforts failed to achieve: low-cost home care and  				cost-effective substitution of home care for nursing home  				care."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> However, because Arizona is such an unusual state (the only state  			 that never implemented a traditional Medicaid program), the authors raised a  			 number of questions about whether the findings from Arizona would hold up if  			 the same approach were tried elsewhere. They recommend that other states  			 experiment cautiously with the Arizona approach:</p>
<blockquote><p> "Preferably, states would try these features out in a few  				counties at a time to permit comparison of program effects on case mix of  				nursing home clients, nursing home occupancy rates, services used, client  				outcomes, and costs per poor and near-poor resident and per enrollee. The  				dramatic savings seen in Arizona certainly may not be realized in states with  				more mature Medicaid programs, but an least the incentives for inefficiency  				built into traditional fee-for-service home care arrangements would be replaced  				by a system with fewer perverse incentives. The ALTCS approach deserves to be  				tried out and studied elsewhere."</p>

<p><b>It is difficult-indeed it is virtually impossible-to design and  			 conduct research that truly measures cost-effectiveness as distinct from  			 "cost-shifting" from one program to another, from state to Federal funds, and  			 from formal to informal care.</b></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness of home and community-based services is almost  			 always measured in terms of Medicaid expenditures only. However, from the  			 earliest studies (ASPE, 1981), analysts have repeatedly observed that, in a  			 broader conceptual framework, "cost-effectiveness" estimates would also  			 consider the impact on other public programs such as Medicare, SSI, and Food  			 Stamps. These studies have not been done because it is too difficult and costly  			 to obtain the necessary data. Some analysts also insist that research on the  			 cost-effectiveness of alternatives to institutionalization ought to take into  			 account the role of informal caregivers in subsidizing the costs of services in  			 "at home" settings. That is, a true comparison of costs on either side of the  			 home and community services/nursing home ledger should assign a dollar value to  			 the hours of unpaid care provided by informal caregivers.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Studies Focusing on Alternatives to Institutional  		(ICF/MR) Care for the Mentally Retarded/Developmentally Disabled  		Population</h3>
<p>The Federal Government has shown considerably less active interest in  		evaluating the relative cost-effectiveness of home and community services  		versus institutional services (ICF/MR) for persons with MR/DD despite the fact  		that three-quarters of home and community-based services recipients are  		individuals with MR/DD. The reasons for the limited interest is not wholly  		clear, but may be influenced by the commitment of most states to dramatically  		reduce institutionalization of persons with MR/DD, often under court order,  		irrespective of "cost-effectiveness" considerations. Related to this movement  		toward reducing the use of institutional services, which nearly halved state  		institution populations between 1985 and 1997 (-48.8 percent), came  		institutional expenditures that were highly inflated by the resulting  		inefficiencies (expenditures doubled between 1987 and 1997). As a result, the  		cost-effectiveness standard of being less expensive than state institutions,  		which dominate ICF/MR expenditures, was a dubious standard at best. Still there  		has been some research that has attempted to control for similar "baskets" of  		comparable services in institutional and community services. These studies that  		have also attempted to establish controls on the characteristics of service  		users have generally found expenditures for the recipients of community  		services to average between 75 percent and 95 percent of the expenditures for  		persons in institutional settings (Cambell and Heal, 1995; Greenberg et al.,  		1985; Knobbe et al., 1995; Schalock and Fredericks, 1990). </p>
<p>Because of the commitment to depopulate larger institutions, the  		relevant cost-effectiveness comparisons between ICF/MR and home and  		community-based services for persons with MR/DD are obtained by focusing on  		"community" ICF/MR (4-15 residents) and home and community-based services.  		Community ICFs/MR house a relatively small, but growing, portion of the total  		number of ICF/MR residents (35.6 percent) and an even smaller proportion (16.8  		percent) of the combined community ICF/MR and home and community-based services  		recipients. But community ICFs/MR reflect the only arguably comparable  		alternative to home and community-based services for persons with MR/DD.</p>
<p>There have been only a limited number of studies that have directly  		compared home and community-based services and community ICF/MR costs and  		effects for comparable services and comparable populations. One such study was  		conducted in Minnesota for the Minnesota legislature and later published  		(Stancliffe and Lakin, 1998). In that study, 187 persons who began in state  		institutions were tracked over a four year follow-up period. The study included  		71 persons who remained in state institutions, 42 persons who moved to the  		community with home and community-based services, and 74 persons who moved to  		community ICFs/MR. Although no statistical differences were evident in the  		three groups in demographic, diagnostic, functional or behavioral  		characteristics, analysis of co-variance was used to further control their  		comparability. The results of the study showed community ICFs/MR (versus home  		and community-based services) to have 15 percent higher expenditures when  		characteristics of residents were controlled ($199.75 per day versus $174.36).  		No statistically significant outcomes differences were noted among community  		ICF/MR and home and community-based services recipients on a range of community  		integration, social relationship and consumer choice variables. </p>
<p>A study by Conroy (1996) compared the cost-effectiveness of community  		ICFs/MR and alternative community living arrangements financed by home and  		community-based services in Pennsylvania. This study employed matched samples  		of 51 persons each from community ICFs/MR and in community-based living  		arrangements, matched on aged, gender, and adaptive and challenging behavior  		index scores. Thirty-five outcome measures were employed in the study,  		including measures in the areas of behavioral progress, choice-making,  		community integration, quality of home environment, health and health care  		indicators, and life safety. None of the 35 outcomes favored the ICFs/MR, while  		10 favored the community living arrangements. In contrast to the Minnesota  		study which found lower cost, but not significantly different outcomes for the  		home and community-based services, this study found better outcomes for the  		home and community-based financed services but no adjusted per capita cost  		differences ($66,529 for the ICFs/MR and $64,370 for the home and  		community-based services groups respectively).</p>
<p>Finally, there have been efforts to examine whether, on a national  		level, increased funding of home and community-based services resulted in  		reductions in ICF/MR use (Lakin, 1998). The so-called "woodwork effect" may be  		most pronounced for persons with MR/DD, although it must be noted that the  		"woodwork effect" is a very simplistic notion in light of the complex social,  		political and administrative factors involved. </p>
<p>First, the "fact" of the woodwork effect: In June 1982, the end of the  		first state fiscal year in which states had access to both the ICF/MR program  		and home and community-based services alternative, there were 140,684 persons  		receiving ICF/MR services and 1,381 home and community services recipients with  		MR/DD. Fifteen years later, in June 1997, there were 126,697 persons receiving  		ICF/MR services and 223,164 persons with MR/DD receiving home and  		community-based services. The years in between show a remarkably stable number  		of ICF/MR residents and a steadily growing home and community services program,  		until repeal of the "cold bed" standard, at which time home and community-based  		services growth has been dramatic. Between 1982 and 1992, the home and  		community-based services program grew at an average of 6,100 recipients per  		year and between 1984 and 1992, the average annual growth in recipients was  		slightly less than 17 percent per year. With reduction of the "cold bed"  		scrutiny between 1992 and 1997, home and community-based services grew at an  		annual growth rate of 29 percent. Relatedly, although ICF/MR expenditures  		remained substantially greater than home and community-based services  		expenditures ($9.996 billion versus $5.965 billion in FY 97), ICF/MR  		expenditures grew by only $1.1 billion (12 percent) between 1992 and 1997  		(albeit with decreasing total recipients), while home and community-based  		services expenditures grew by $4.3 billion (260 percent). (Prouty and Lakin,  		1998.)</p>
<p>In part, this growth may reflect a "woodwork effect." About two-thirds  		of all ICF/MR services in 1997 were provided in large institutions (16 or more  		residents). These are indisputably undesirable services for the vast majority  		of persons with developmental disabilities. Many if not most families would  		endure substantial hardship to avoid having their children or other relatives  		with MR/DD reside in such facilities. Indeed, as described above, although the  		total size of the ICF/MR program decreased by only slightly since 1982 (0.99  		percent), the number of residents in large ICFs/MR decreased by 38 percent  		(from 130,970 to 81,553), while the number of residents in small ICFs/MR  		residents increased by 365 percent (from 9,714 to 45,144). Growth of residents  		in the small, community ICFs/MR growth would have been even greater if New  		York, Massachusetts and other states had not "decertified" hundreds of small  		community ICFs/MR and begun to finance their services under their home and  		community-based services programs. Clearly, the movement toward community-based  		long-term care options and the ability to finance such options under Medicaid  		has contributed greatly to the demand for Medicaid long-term care services.</p>
<p>It should be recognized, however, that much of the growth in Medicaid  		financed community services involves state decisions to incorporate previously  		state financed services under Medicaid. States efforts to do so, and their  		ability to leverage budgets by shifting existing state financed services into  		Medicaid where the Federal Government shares 50 percent or more of the costs  		has contributed to rapidly expanded access to services for persons with  		developmental disabilities. For example, between 1993 and 1997, the numbers of  		people with developmental disabilities receiving out-of-home residential  		services grew from 291,855 to 342,244 (Prouty and Lakin, 1998).</p>
<p>Two main conclusions can be drawn from this research on expansion of  		home and community-based services for individuals with MR/DD.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>In contrast to long-term care services systems for the elderly  			 and disabled, state MR/DD systems have evolved far beyond the traditional  			 "cost-effective alternatives to institutional care" paradigm.</b></p>
<p> In the service system for persons with MR/DD, a totally different  			 perspective is evident. States are moving toward a community service system in  			 which Medicaid is used efficiently to cost-share service expenditures. At the  			 same time, states have had to develop criteria for setting budget limits, other  			 than the criterion of serving persons "at risk" of institutional admission. In  			 MR/DD systems there are substantial waiting lists for community services  			 (estimated at 83,000 people waiting for residential services in 1997). States  			 do not make those desiring services demonstrate or contend that they will  			 otherwise go into institutions, the states are on record as desiring that  			 people are spared that debilitating experience. Instead states are faced with  			 creating priorities for people waiting community services, based on factors  			 such as immediacy of need (crisis), severity of disability, length of wait, and  			 so forth. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Despite the expansion of home and community services, state MR/DD  			 systems continue to rely heavily on residential care settings (including  			 certified ICFs/MR), but they have created systems in which both the character  			 and cost of residential services have been dramatically altered. Thus, the  			 emphasis is now on small facilities rather than large "institutional" ones. At  			 the same time, availability of "at home" services has made it possible for most  			 children with MR/DD to remain with their parents so that most persons with  			 MR/DD in residential settings are adults.</b></p>
<p> Instead of relying predominantly on very large residential care  			 settings, most clients in residential care now live in settings with no more  			 than 16 beds. These smaller facilities (some of which are certified ICFs/MR  			 others of which are non-certified community facilities) are more  			 "cost-effective" providers of residential care than the large institutions. In  			 addition, funding for "at home" services has fundamentally changed the age  			 profile of persons with MR/DD residing in residential care.</p>
<p> It is worth noting that the proportion of the total U.S. population  			 receiving out-of-home residential services for persons with MR/DD in 1997  			 (126.2 per 100,000) is not appreciably different than the number in 1967 (130.4  			 per 100,000) or 1977 (118.8 per 100,000). What has changed dramatically is the  			 percentage of children and youth in out-of-home residential placements. In  			 1977, there were an estimated 91,180 children and youth (0-21 years) with MR/DD  			 in out of home residential settings. This was 36.8 percent of all 247,780  			 persons with MR/DD receiving residential care. In 1997, children and youth with  			 MR/DD in out-of-home residential services numbered an estimated 24,299, only  			 7.1 percent of all 342,244 persons receiving out-of-home residential services.  			 This may be attributable in part to the estimated 61,935 persons receiving  			 services while living in their family home (most of whom are presumed to be  			 children). It is also true that the effects of home and community-based  			 services in realizing such outcomes cannot be separated from the effects of  			 special education entitlement in one's local schools, SSI for poor families  			 (including SSI payments specifically for very severely disabled children),  			 state family subsidies, and other social financial, and psychological supports  			 that have been made available to families with members with MR/DD.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Research on Alternatives to Institutionalization for the  		Severely and Persistently Disabled Mentally Ill Population</h3>
<p>The research literature on home and community-based services versus  		mental hospital treatment for the severely and persistently disabled mentally  		ill is quite different in focus from the studies reviewed above on home and  		community-based services for the elderly and disabled and for the individuals  		with MR/DD. The most important difference is that the studies on the mentally  		ill population are primarily concerned with assessing the efficacy of  		alternative treatments and treatment settings in improving the functioning of  		the severely and persistently mentally ill, in alleviating symptoms of severe  		mental illness, and in reducing the frequency and severity of certain highly  		undesirable behaviors associated with mental illness (in particular, behaviors  		on the part of the mentally ill individual that are judged to pose a threat to  		his or her safety or to the safety of others). Cost-effectiveness is always  		addressed in the context of comparative treatment efficacy. Current research on  		treatment alternatives for the severely and persistently mentally ill is also  		informed by the lessons that many researchers draw from several decades of  		experience with "deinstitutionalization." (That is, the concerted effort which  		began after World War II to avoid long-term institutional placements in mental  		hospitals and to return long-term residents of state mental hospitals to the  		community or to place them in alternative residential settings). </p>
<p>Hargreaves and Shumway (1989) observe that: "The legacy of  		deinstitutionalization hangs heavily over services efficacy research. ...Our  		understanding of the causes and treatment of the serious mental illnesses is  		improving. A sense of urgency has arisen about providing better care for this  		core group of the mentally ill, not because they share a common etiology or  		respond to similar treatments, but because as a group they are the most ill,  		the least able to support themselves or pay for their care, and the most likely  		to become a public burden."</p>
<p>These same authors found in a review of the services efficacy literature  		on alternative treatments for serious mental illness that: "The studies of  		alternatives to hospital treatment showed good consistency in their results.  		This is especially remarkable because individual studies are flawed in a number  		of respects ... and the studies examined a wide variety of treatments in  		different settings with disparate patient groups. One may conclude that caring  		for severely ill psychiatric patients in ways that avoid or shorten traditional  		hospital treatment is, on average, at least equally effective and may be more  		effective than standard use of hospital care. Well organized services using  		alternatives to hospitalization can cost less, sometimes much less, without  		incurring offsetting social or private costs, and may provide greater  		improvement in symptoms or social functioning."</p>
<p>The authors go on to state some caveats, however: "Although this  		relatively global question is coming to some closure, it represents a  		simplistic concept of community services that focuses too specifically on  		crises leading to hospital admission. Also, few researchers have compared  		different alternatives to hospital admission or studied community settings in  		which particular mixes of strategies may be most cost-effective." </p>
<p>Additional caveats concern the need for and the difficulty of providing  		for sustained community treatment over long periods of time: "Experience has  		suggested that the availability of community treatment programs is not  		sufficient, in and of itself, to ensure sustained adjustment of the severely  		and persistently disabled. For this reason continuity of care ... has become a  		common goal of services to the mentally ill. The concept of continuity includes  		continuing treatment that is (a) comprehensive, offering access to a variety of  		services; (b) flexible, consistently responsible to clients' changing needs in  		scope, intensity, and location of services; and (c) is characterized by ongoing  		communication and interaction among different treatment providers." Case  		management has been promoted as the best way to increase continuity of care.  		However the authors note that a review of studies of case management yields  		mixed results which suggest that the efficacy of case management may depend  		greatly on variations--which are poorly understood and documented--with respect  		to how case management is actually carried out and the service system  		environment in which case management takes place." The authors also stress the  		need for broader social services such as housing, welfare application  		assistance, transportation, and recreation services as the context in which  		long-term treatment of severe mental illness in the community is most likely to  		have positive outcomes and to be successful in avoiding further  		hospitalizations.</p>
<p>A more recent literature review of different models of community care  		involving case management (Mueser et al., 1998) suggests that substantial  		progress has been made over the past decade in understanding how specific  		models of case management may improve the efficacy of community treatment for  		the severely and persistently mentally ill. The authors reviewed 75 studies.  		They concluded that: "Most research has been conducted on the assertive  		community treatment (ACT) or intensive case management (ICM) models. Controlled  		research indicates that the above models reduce time in the hospital and  		improve housing stability, especially among patients who are high service  		users. Both models also appear to have moderate effects on improving  		symptomology and quality of life; however, most studies also suggest little  		effect on social functioning, arrests and time spent in jail, or vocational  		functioning. Studies on reducing or withdrawing ACT or ICM services suggest  		some deterioration in gains. Research on other models of community care is  		inconclusive.</p>
