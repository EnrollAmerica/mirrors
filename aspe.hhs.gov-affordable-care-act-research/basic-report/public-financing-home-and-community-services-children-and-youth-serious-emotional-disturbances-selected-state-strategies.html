<p>We asked two panels of experts to assist in the development of the  		project and final report. The first, convened in May 2004, included Robert  		Friedman, Gary Harbison, Russell Frank, Darcy Gruttadaro, Bruce Kamradt, Carol  		Lichtenwalter, Lucy Keating, Sybil Goldman, Karen Spoelman, Randy Myers, and  		Andrea Fiero. These individuals helped develop an appropriate focus for the  		project in its early stages. The second panel, convened in March 2006, included  		Gary Blau, Sybil Goldman, Ron Hendler, Chris Koyanagi, Ken Martinez, Martha  		Moorehouse, Judith Teich, Constance Thomas, and James Wotring. This group read  		an early draft of the report and provided many helpful comments and  		suggestions. We are grateful to everyone who participated in these panels, and  		absolve them all from any inaccuracies or misinterpretations that remain in the  		report.</p>
<p>Cille Kennedy, our project officer in the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, provided the initial impetus for this  		project as well as continued encouragement, support, and good ideas. We thank  		her very much for her considerable help and leadership. Lindsay Harris, a  		former analyst on our staff, helped enormously in the early stages of the  		project, participated in many of the discussions with state officials, and  		drafted several of the summaries found in the appendices.

<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Numerous reports have underscored the contradictions and deficiencies in  		the nations mental health service system for children with serious  		emotional disturbances (SED), including a heavy reliance on residential care  		and out-of-home placements (e.g., Campaign for Mental Health Reform 2005; New  		Freedom Commission on Mental Health 2003). Recent studies have also reinforced  		long-standing concerns that some parents have had to relinquish custody of  		their children solely to obtain treatment for their childrens behavioral  		or emotional problems (Government Accounting Office 2003). Overall, these  		reports have motivated federal and state legislators to consider new strategies  		for improving child mental health services and, in particular, enhancing access  		to effective home and community services.</p>
<p>Youth with SED include children and adolescents with chronic depression,  		major conduct disorders, substance abuse problems, and other behaviors that are  		challenging for families and communities. Many youth with SED are first  		identified in the schools, child welfare or juvenile justice systems, and they  		often claim a great deal of public attention because of the wide gap between  		their need for intensive treatment and the availability of appropriate  		services, including home-based counseling, respite care, family-to-family  		support, treatment foster care, and school-based mental health care. More and  		more studies indicate that these services are effective not only in improving  		mental health outcomes for youth with SED, but also in reducing or preventing  		stays in residential care and other out-of-home settings (Hawaii Department of  		Health 2004; Knitzer and Cooper 2006; Sheidow et al. 2004). Given these signs  		of progress, policymakers have expressed greater interest in making these  		services more widely available (Waxman 2006). For example, the 2005 Deficit  		Reduction Act (Public Law 109-171) authorizes demonstration projects for up to  		ten states to assess the effectiveness of home and community-based alternatives  		to psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). </p>
<p>States and counties currently are pursuing numerous approaches to  		support home and community services and, more broadly, to initiate and sustain  		a fundamental transformation of their child mental health service systems.  		These approaches include enhancing access to Medicaid coverage of these  		services, re-directing funds from residential services to community care,  		integrating funds from the numerous agencies that serve children, designating  		care management entities to oversee services for high-risk populations, and  		implementing demonstration projects to develop specific financing models.</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to present the results of a study of  		selected public financing mechanisms that states have used to pay for intensive  		home and community services for children and youth with SED.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteES1">1</a></font></sup> Although the study covers  		several key public strategies for funding home and community services for  		children with SED, it focuses particularly on the Medicaid home and  		community-based service (HCBS) waiver as a result of recent federal and state  		interest in this particular financing approach. Policymakers have focused on  		the HCBS waiver partly because this financing mechanism allows states to  		provide an expanded set of Medicaid services to a limited number of children.  		With an HCBS waiver, states have considerable flexibility in addressing the  		needs of high-risk children by paying for services not included in their  		standard Medicaid state plans; at the same time, they can maintain some control  		over costs by sharply limiting the number of children enrolled in the waiver  		program.</p>
<p>However, the HCBS waiver is only one of several methods for supporting  		intensive home and community services for youth with SED. States that already  		have such a waiver also use other financing mechanisms to support comprehensive  		mental health care for these children and their families. Previous studies have  		described the financing of model community-based programs (e.g., Bazelon Center  		2003; Pires 2002), but there remains a need to examine in greater detail the  		mechanisms used by states to finance intensive home and community services and  		the reasons behind states decisions for choosing some mechanisms over  		others. Better information on strategies for selecting the best set of  		financing mechanisms may help states design and implement new initiatives for  		broadening home and community-based alternatives to psychiatric residential  		treatment and other out-of-home care.</p>
<p>To develop this information, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation in the Department of Health and Human Services  		contracted with Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. to examine how states and  		communities have financed, or could finance, these services for youth with SED  		and their families. </p>
<p>Specific policy questions examined in the study include:</p>
<ul><li>What are the benefits and disadvantages of HCBS waivers and other  		  financing approaches for building home and community services as alternatives  		  to residential care?</li>
<li>Why do states feel they need waivers and what are the arguments for  		  or against amending the current 1915(c) waiver program to include PRTFs under  		  the rubric of an institution?</li>
<li>How have different financing approaches been combined to support  		  community alternatives to residential care or out-of-home placements?</li>
<li>What financing strategies are likely to contribute to the  		  sustainability of improvements in mental health services for youth with  		  SED?</li>
</ul><h3>Methods</h3>
<p>This report is based on discussions with officials in three groups of  		states, and a review of federal and state reports on financing services for  		youth with SED and their families. The three groups of states include those  		that:</p>
<ul><li>Are implementing broad, statewide reforms in their child mental  		  health service systems (New Jersey and New Mexico);</li>
<li>Deliver services to youth with SED through HCBS waivers (Indiana,  		  Kansas, New York, Vermont, and Wisconsin);<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteES2">2</a></font></sup> and</li>
<li>Received awards in 2003 from CMS to assess the feasibility of  		  developing an HCBS waiver as an alternative to psychiatric residential  		  treatment facilities (Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, and  		  Texas).</li>
</ul><p>As a group, these states are using many different strategies to  		configure and support mental health services for youth with SED, are at varying  		stages in the development of statewide systems, and have encountered a diverse  		set of obstacles and opportunities for improving home and community services.  		Consequently, discussions with officials in these states covered a wide range  		of topics, including the legislative and policy background related to services  		for youth with SED, the reasons for selecting a given financing strategy or  		strategies, the benefits and challenges associated with HCBS waivers, the  		extent to which demonstration projects influenced a states selection of  		particular financing mechanisms, tactics for promoting coordination among key  		agencies, the role of residential treatment centers, and general lessons  		learned from recent state efforts to strengthen the financing of these  		services. </p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Discussions with state officials underscore the challenges of paying for  		the mix of intensive mental health services that are appropriate to each child  		and family by combining the resources of different agencies or expanding the  		type of services covered (or both). Many factors influence the way in which  		states address these challenges, including:</p>
<ul><li>The proportion of children living in rural areas;</li>
<li>The set of services covered under the existing Medicaid plan and the  		  status of the Medicaid budget;</li>
<li>Prior experience with demonstration projects involving home and  		  community services for children with SED;</li>
<li>Leadership on this issue from the governors office and the  		  extent of support from the state legislature;</li>
<li>The willingness of residential provider organizations to engage in  		  discussions of new service models;</li>
<li>The strength of family advocacy and support for change; and</li>
<li>The history of collaboration among departments of child mental  		  health, child welfare, juvenile justice, and special education. </li>
</ul><p>Because of the many factors involved, state officials have to balance a  		variety of issues as they decide what financing strategies are most suitable  		given a states resources and constraints. Five findings from this study  		provide insights into this decision-making process. </p>
<p><b>First, state officials typically seek to combine a variety of  		mechanisms and funding sources because no one mechanism provides the  		flexibility and breadth needed to coordinate and pay for a comprehensive set of  		intensive home and community services.</b> The mechanisms examined closely in  		this study include:</p>
<ul><li>The 1915(c) HCBS waiver.</li>
<li>The Medicaid rehabilitation option.</li>
<li>The development of case rates for designated care management entities  		  serving high-risk populations (whereby states pay a monthly fee for each child,  		  allowing the child access to a flexible, individualized array of services and  		  supports).</li>
<li>A provision in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA)  		  known as the Katie Beckett provision.</li>
</ul><p>Determining what combination of these funding mechanisms is appropriate  		for a particular state means balancing their advantages and disadvantages in  		light of the states fiscal, legislative, and agency resources (see  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableES1">Table ES.1</a>). In addition to these resources, officials  		at the state or county level can blend or braid funds from multiple  		child-serving systems, which allows states to pay for a broader range of  		services than any one agency could cover. This approach is often used in  		conjunction with a case rate approach. Many states also have implemented  		Medicaid managed care (1915(b)) and research and demonstration (1115) waivers  		that allow for flexibility in types of covered services by implementing managed  		behavioral health systems. A few states and counties have designated sales,  		property, or income taxes to generate new revenue to enhance public mental  		health services, including services for youth with SED. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>A second finding involves the importance of legislative and budgetary  		action at the state level</b>. In several of the states in this study, the  		passage of state legislation directly focused on services for children has been  		an important impetus for interagency collaboration around the financing of  		services for youth with SED. Although state legislation alone is neither  		necessary nor sufficient for garnering financial support for intensive home and  		community services for youth with SED, it can move a state in the right  		direction by establishing expectations and goals, removing barriers to  		collaboration, and, in some cases, providing new dollars to build the  		infrastructure necessary to sustain these services. Discussions with state  		officials suggest that decisions about how to finance intensive community  		services have to account for a states history of legislative and  		political efforts to improve the child mental health service system.</p>
<p><b>Third, states and counties that carefully manage access to  		residential treatment services and psychiatric hospitals tend to have more  		resources for intensive home and community services</b>. In the process of  		building financial support for intensive home and community services for  		children with SED, many states began by re-directing expenditures away from  		psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment services and toward community  		alternatives. This process, coupled with careful management of access to beds  		in both residential treatment facilities and in-patient psychiatric hospitals,  		is important because it has allowed states to conserve dollars and invest their  		resources in developing the provider capacity and infrastructure necessary for  		a community-based service system. Careful management of access to residential  		care is critical not only because such care is expensive but also because there  		is little evidence of its long-term effectiveness in solving problems to which  		it is usually applied.</p>
<p><b>Fourth, within states, certain administrative and budgetary  		procedures can support the cost-sharing of services among all or most of the  		agencies that serve children</b>. Problems with interagency coordination and  		the associated duplication and gaps in services have long been recognized as a  		serious barrier to comprehensive child mental health care. In addition to  		instituting strategies for improving interagency coordination at a policy  		level, states also have established mechanisms for ensuring that funds from  		different agencies are integrated at the local level to ensure that the child  		and family can obtain needed services. In some states, for example,  		individualized plans of care specify which state agency (mental health, child  		welfare, juvenile justice, or special education) will pay for which services.  		In other states, dollars are blended to allow for integrated service delivery  		across child-serving systems. According to some state officials, case rates are  		an especially useful financing mechanism because: (1) several agencies can  		contribute dollars to the case rate for an individual child; and (2) agencies  		have a predictable amount of dollars to pay for a wide range of home and  		community services tailored to help children with SED achieve specific  		outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Fifth, because of the urgent needs of near-poor children with SED who  		have little or no insurance coverage for mental health care, and for families  		of these children who exhaust their coverage, financing mechanisms that allow  		these children to access intensive services (even if their families are not  		Medicaid eligible) are critically important</b>. One of the principal  		advantages of the HCBS waivers is that they allow states to disregard  		Medicaids rules for using parental income in determining a childs  		eligibility for Medicaid. Several state officials emphasized the importance of  		this particular component of the waiver because it provides states with a means  		for: (1) covering high-risk and uninsured or inadequately insured children who  		would not otherwise have access to mental health services; and (2) ensuring  		that families do not have to relinquish custody of a child with SED solely to  		obtain intensive mental health services.</p>
<h3>Implications</h3>
<p>The findings from this study have three major implications for  		policymakers concerned with improving mental health services to youth with SED  		and their families. First, sustained improvements in financing intensive home  		and community services for youth with SED depends on the development of  		effective partnerships between key agencies at the state and local levels. No  		simple recipe can create this partnership. In some cases, the key partnership  		was forged between the state mental health department and the Medicaid agency.  		Medicaid programs in every state now pay for a considerable portion of mental  		health services for youth with SED, while mental health agencies have the  		experience necessary to manage clinical care, certify providers, and assess  		service quality. The resources of both agencies can be used to support  		initiatives that provide appropriate and cost-effective services. Child  		welfare, juvenile justice and education agencies also are key because they  		often control considerable behavioral health dollars, and they serve the  		majority of children who need mental health services and supports.</p>
<p>In states that are actively pursuing ways to expand the availability of  		home and community-based services, agencies that serve children have developed  		new partnerships with one another. Discussions with state officials provided  		many examples of initiatives--often mandated by state legislation or budgetary  		processes--that bring different agencies together on behalf of youth with SED  		(e.g., mental health, Medicaid, child welfare, juvenile justice and education  		agencies). From a state perspective, the challenge is to ensure that the  		process of collaboration does not threaten the budget of any single agency, but  		instead leads to an equitable distribution of financial responsibility across  		the agencies. From a federal perspective, the challenge is to ensure that  		legislation directly affecting one system or one funding source (for example,  		Medicaid) does not unintentionally create barriers to interagency agreements at  		the state level.</p>
<p>The second implication involves the impact of prior demonstration  		projects funded under the original federal Child and Adolescent Service System  		Program, the current federal Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for  		Children and Their Families Program, or other foundation-sponsored initiatives.  		These efforts spawned community level demonstration projects in virtually every  		state, and many officials with whom we spoke noted that the roots of current  		initiatives often lay in the experience gained during the implementation and  		operation of these projects. This finding underscores the strong potential for  		positive long-term outcomes of the demonstration projects authorized under the  		Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. </p>
<p>Finally, the study findings indicate that state officials value HCBS  		waivers because they can provide states with an additional mechanism for  		financing home and community services and support other efforts to manage  		access to residential treatment. Moreover, states would be interested in  		applying for an HCBS waiver for youth with SED if the criteria for documenting  		budget neutrality could be linked to psychiatric residential treatment  		facilities rather than to psychiatric hospitalization alone. In most states,  		very few children now enter psychiatric hospitals, and even fewer stay for long  		periods of time. Because most states are spending comparatively little on  		psychiatric hospitalization for children, they will not save many dollars, if  		any, by substituting intensive home or community services for treatment in  		these hospitals. However, as inpatient utilization has decreased, use of  		residential treatment has increased; this trend has placed corresponding  		demands on Medicaid dollars because Medicaid covers psychiatric residential  		care for children in most states. By replacing this residential care with more  		effective home and community services, states should be saving both federal and  		state Medicaid dollars, which could be available to enhance home and community  		services for youth with SED.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Numerous reports have underscored major deficiencies in the response of  		the nations mental health, juvenile justice, and child welfare systems to  		children with serious emotional disturbances (SED) and their families,  		including a heavy reliance on residential care and out-of-home placements  		(Campaign for Mental Health Reform 2005; New Freedom Commission on Mental  		Health 2003; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1999). In addition,  		recent studies (for example, General Accounting Office 2003) have reinforced  		long-standing concerns that some parents have had to relinquish custody of  		their children solely to obtain treatment for their childrens behavioral  		or emotional problems. Prompted by these findings, many federal and state  		legislators and program administrators have begun to consider new mechanisms  		for improving child mental health services.</p>
<p>Youth with SED include children and adolescents with chronic depression,  		major conduct disorders, substance abuse problems, and other behaviors that are  		challenging for families and communities. These children and adolescents have  		claimed a great deal of attention because of the gap between their need for  		intensive treatment and the availability of appropriate home and community  		services, which include a range of nontraditional treatments from home-based  		family counseling, respite care, and family-to-family support to independent  		skills training, crisis intervention, and treatment foster care. More and more  		studies indicate that these services are effective not only in improving mental  		health outcomes for youth with SED, but also in reducing or preventing stays in  		residential care and other out-of-home settings (Burns 2002; Hawaii Department  		of Health 2004; Knitzer and Cooper 2006; Sheidow et al. 2004). Given these  		signs of progress, policymakers have begun to express greater interest in  		making these services more widely available (Waxman 2006).</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to present the results of a study of the  		mechanisms that states use to pay for intensive home and community services for  		children and youth with SED and their parents. Although the study covers the  		major public strategies for funding home and community services for children  		with SED, it focuses on the Medicaid home and community-based service (HCBS)  		waiver, also known as the 1915(c) waivers, because of the substantial  		legislative interest in this particular financing approach. It is not intended  		to be a review of all possible public and private mechanisms for funding mental  		health services for this group of children.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the study, five states were operating HCBS waivers  		for youth with SED: Indiana, Kansas, New York, Vermont and Wisconsin.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> However, the 2005 Deficit  		Reduction Act (Public Law 109-171) authorizes demonstration projects for up to  		ten states to assess the effectiveness of home and community-based alternatives  		to psychiatric residential treatment. As states pursue these demonstration  		projects and more generally seek to improve their mental health service system  		for children, they will need information on how different public financing  		mechanisms can be applied. This report is designed to provide background  		information to policymakers and program administrators in federal and state  		departments of mental health, child welfare, juvenile justice, and education  		who are working to improve care for children and youth with SED. </p>
<p>HCBS waivers allow states to provide an expanded set of Medicaid  		services to a limited number of children identified as having SED through  		various clinical criteria. These waivers enable states to provide high-risk  		children with a set of intensive services not included in the standard Medicaid  		plan while maintaining some control over costs. However, the HCBS waiver is  		only one of several methods for supporting intensive home and community  		services for youth with SED. States and counties are combining many approaches  		to finance these services and, more broadly, to initiate and sustain a  		fundamental transformation of their child mental health service systems. These  		approaches include the various Medicaid coverage options, integrated funds from  		the numerous agencies that serve children, designated care management entities  		(CMEs) for high-risk populations, time-limited demonstration projects funded by  		the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and  		other Medicaid waivers (such as the 1115 waivers).</p>
<p>Although case studies have been used in previous studies to describe the  		financing of model community-based programs (e.g., Bazelon Center 2003; Pires  		2002; Stroul 2003), there remains a need to examine in greater detail the  		mechanisms used by states to finance intensive home and community services, and  		the reasons behind the states decisions for choosing one mechanism over  		another. To explore these questions, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation in the Department of Health and Human Services  		contracted with Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. to examine how states and  		communities have financed, or could finance, these services for youth with SED  		and their families. In particular, the study examines states use of HCBS  		waivers and other financing approaches in order to provide a context for  		understanding what can be accomplished with and without waivers.</p>
<h3>A. Research Questions and Methods</h3>
<p>The study addressed the following research questions:</p>
<ul><li>What are the benefits and disadvantages of HCBS waivers, as well as  		  other financing methods for building home and community alternatives to  		  residential care?</li>
<li>Why do states feel they need HCBS waivers, and what are the arguments  		  for or against amending this waiver program to allow for alternatives to  		  psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs), as well as to hospital  		  level care? </li>
<li>How and why have different financing approaches been combined to  		  support alternatives to residential care or out-of-home placements?</li>
<li>What financing strategies are likely to contribute to the  		  sustainability of improvements in mental health services for youth with  		  SED?</li>
<li>What role do different financing mechanisms play in promoting  		  collaboration among mental health, child welfare, juvenile justice, and special  		  education agencies?</li>
<li>To what extent have demonstration projects provided the experience  		  that states can use to develop effective financing strategies for home and  		  community services?</li>
<li>What financial arrangements should be avoided because they work  		  against long-term improvements in the overall system-of-care?</li>
</ul><p>To collect the data required to address these questions, officials in  		three groups of states were contacted:</p>
<ul><li>States that are implementing comprehensive statewide reforms in their  		  child mental health service systems, but are not using HCBS waivers as part of  		  this effort: New Jersey and New Mexico.</li>
<li>States that have HCBS waivers for youth with SED: Indiana, Kansas,  		  New York, Vermont, and Wisconsin.</li>
<li>States that received grants from the Centers for Medicare and  		  Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2003 to assess the feasibility of developing an  		  application for an HCBS waiver: Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, and  		  Texas.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Discussions with officials in these states covered a wide range of  		topics, including the legislative and policy background related to services for  		youth with SED, the reasons for selecting a given financing strategy or  		strategies, the benefits and challenges associated with HCBS waivers, the  		extent to which demonstration projects influenced a states selection of  		particular financing mechanisms, tactics for promoting coordination among key  		agencies, the role of residential treatment centers (RTCs), and general  		lessons learned from recent state efforts to strengthen the  		financing of these services. Discussions were held during visits to two states  		(Kansas and New York) and through telephone conference calls with officials in  		the other states. </p>
<p>These discussions and a review of relevant state and federal reports  		were used to develop a summary of each states experience in supporting  		intensive home and community services for youth with SED. Each summary covered  		the policy context that shaped the services provided to youth with SED; key  		features of the HCBS waiver, the feasibility study, or the statewide reform  		plan (depending on which strategy a state had followed); the role of RTCs in  		each states mental health service system for children; and the lessons we  		might learn from each states experience. Officials from each state  		reviewed the summary for their state, and their comments were incorporated to  		the extent possible.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#note3">3</a></font></sup>  		The summaries are included in <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>,  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>, and <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>.</p>
<h3>B. Overview of Report</h3>
<p>Strengthening the financing of intensive home and community services for  		youth with SED involves a complex set of policy issues, regulatory constraints,  		and payment mechanisms. <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#background">Chapter II</a> presents critical  		background information on these topics. It describes important system-of-care  		principles that have shaped the services for youth with SED, the role of the  		various agencies that serve these children, and the financing mechanisms used  		by many states.</p>
<p><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#approaches">Chapter III</a> and <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#strengths">Chapter  		IV</a> present the study findings. The former identifies the general financing  		themes that emerged in our discussions with officials in each of the three  		groups of states. The latter covers the strengths and weaknesses of four major  		financing mechanisms: HCBS waivers, the Medicaid rehabilitation option,  		case-rates for high-risk populations, and provisions in the Tax Equity and  		Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA), also known as the Katie Beckett provision.  		The final chapter presents a synthesis of findings with respect to the research  		questions, and discusses what the findings may imply for current legislative  		and policy efforts to strengthen the financing of intensive home and community  		services for youth with SED and their families.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">II. MECHANISMS FOR FINANCING SERVICES FOR YOUTH  		WITH SED AND THEIR FAMILIES: CRITICAL BACKGROUND ISSUES</a></h2>
<p>At least 10 percent of the children in the United States--more than six  		million young people--have an SED, defined as any diagnosable mental disorder  		that severely disrupts social, academic, and emotional functioning (U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services 1999). An estimated 70-80 percent of  		these children do not get the treatment they need (Campaign for Mental Health  		Reform 2005; Koppelman 2004). As a result, many become involved with juvenile  		justice systems, drop out of high school, and are poorly prepared for adult  		life (Duchnowski et al. 2002). </p>
<p>Most children and youth with SED are first identified <i>not</i> in  		mental health clinics but in child welfare agencies, detention centers,  		juvenile courts, schools, primary care practices, and childcare programs. These  		agencies and institutions play a critical role in providing services for these  		children, albeit only for a short time or for certain problems (New Freedom  		Commission on Mental Health 2003). To complicate the issue, the various  		agencies that serve youth with SED and their families differ in terms of their  		legislative mandates, treatment philosophies, funding sources, and reporting  		requirements. In many states, these differences make for a rigid, poorly  		coordinated delivery system with financing silos that are difficult  		to integrate. For example, if a child with SED comes to the attention of one  		agency, he or she may have access to community services; if he or she comes to  		the attention of another agency, residential treatment may be the only option  		available. </p>
<p>Problems with interagency coordination and the associated duplication  		and gaps in services have long been recognized as a serious barrier to  		comprehensive child mental health care. In 1986, for example, the National  		Institute of Mental Health developed the Child and Adolescent Service System  		Program (CASSP) as a means to strengthen mental health services for children by  		improving interagency coordination and developing a cohesive system-of-care,  		defined by Stroul and Friedman (1986) as a comprehensive spectrum of  		mental health and other necessary services which are organized into a  		coordinated network to meet the multiple and changing needs of children and  		adolescents with severe emotional disturbances and their families.  		Ideally, such systems of care should also be community-based and culturally  		competent (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendD">Appendix D</a> for the ideal attributes of a  		system-of-care for youth with SED, as defined by Stroul and Friedman 1986).  		</p>
<p>CASSP provided both an important conceptual framework and financial  		support for states that wanted to strengthen their systems of care for children  		with SED and their families by promoting more flexible funding and interagency  		approaches (Potter and Mulkern 2004). CASSP funding ended in the early 1990s,  		but Congress passed a new program to support efforts in local communities: the  		Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families  		Program. This program, administered by the Center for Mental Health Services  		(CMHS), provides six-year grants to selected communities, states, or tribal  		organizations for the purpose of creating, through a demonstration program,  		sustainable changes in infrastructure and service delivery systems for children  		with emotional and behavioral problems who require services from several  		agencies. Grantees are required to match federal dollars with local, state, or  		other funds in the early years of their programs and must assume an  		increasingly larger share of program expenses over time. In October 2005,  		SAMHSA announced 25 new grantees, totaling $184.5 million over the next six  		years (Mental Help Net 2005), bringing to over 120 the total number of grantee  		sites funded to date. As of March 2006, programs were operating in 56  		sites.</p>
<p>In addition to federal funds for demonstration projects, several private  		foundations have sponsored local initiatives to enhance access to community  		services for youth with SED (see, for example, Saxe and Cross (1998) for an  		overview of the Mental Health Services Program for Youth (MHSPY), funded by the  		Robert Wood Johnson Foundation). </p>
<p>Despite more than two decades of experience in the application of  		system-of-care principles and flexible funding through demonstration programs  		(see Potter and Mulkern 2004 for a partial review), few states have adopted a  		comprehensive approach to re-engineering their interagency agreements in  		support of a statewide financing system for child mental health services  		(Knitzer and Cooper 2006). Instead, most states have taken an incremental  		approach to reform, making circumscribed policy changes or implementing  		demonstration programs under one agency or another. Although these changes have  		improved access to intensive home and community services for certain  		populations of at-risk children, the policy and procedural differences still  		remaining between the various child-serving agencies continue to stifle the  		emergence in most states of a coordinated, statewide system of financing  		services for youth with SED (Institute of Medicine 2005). </p>
<p>Nonetheless, many states persist in the search for a better way to pay  		for services for children with SED and their families (see Armstrong et al.  		2006 for a state planning guide). They do so because home and community  		services offer an opportunity to provide services that are less expensive and  		more effective than residential care. In fact, a growing number of  		methodologically sophisticated studies, many based on a randomized design, have  		demonstrated the positive impact of home and community services such as  		multisystemic therapy, multidimensional treatment foster care, functional  		family therapy, various cognitive behavioral therapies, and  		wraparound interventions, among others (see, for example, Burns  		2002; Glied and Cuellar 2003; Sheidow et al. 2004). Based on this evidence,  		states are beginning to recognize the value of these services as essential to  		any comprehensive child mental health service system (see, for example, Hawaii  		Department of Health 2004). In contrast to the growing empirical support for  		these services, there is marked absence of evidence for the long-term  		effectiveness of traditional residential care (Frensch and Cameron 2002; Joshi  		and Rosenberg 1997; Weiner et al. 2001). </p>
<p>This chapter provides the foundation for our analysis of strategies that  		states have used or could use to pay for intensive home or community services  		as part of a broader system for financing effective treatment for youth with  		SED. Specifically, we:</p>
<ul><li>Present estimates of the number of youth with SED in residential care  		  and the costs associated with care in these facilities;</li>
<li>Describe the incentives that shape the financing decisions made by  		  different agencies;</li>
<li>Outline mechanisms for financing home and community services;  		  and</li>
<li>Discuss financial incentives that shape the policy decisions of state  		  agencies.</li>
</ul><p>A limited number of states and counties (for example, Proposition 63 in  		California, Spokane County in Washington State and Jackson County in Kansas)  		have designated sales, property, or income taxes to enhance public mental  		health services, including services for youth with SED. Because so few  		localities have designated tax revenues specifically for mental health  		services, the report does not address this issue further. However, tax  		initiatives are an important potential source of new revenue for child mental  		health services and are attracting interest from an increasing number of states  		and localities.</p>
<h3>A. Number of Youth with SED in Residential Care and  		Costs Associated with Their Care</h3>
<p>When intensive home or community services are unavailable or  		ineffective, parents and other authorities typically turn to psychiatric  		in-patient units, residential settings, or other out-of-home placements to  		treat children with SED. Residential settings include psychiatric residential  		treatment facilities (PRTFs), residential treatment centers (RTCs), therapeutic  		group homes, and therapeutic foster care residences. These facilities are owned  		by a wide variety of public and private entities and are operated under the  		jurisdiction of various state agencies, including departments of mental health,  		child welfare, and juvenile justice (Ireys et al. 2006; Goldstrom et al. 2001;  		Pottick et al. 2004). According to analyses of data from SAMHSAs 1997  		Client/Patient Sample Survey, social service agencies, including child welfare  		units, were responsible for referring about 37 percent of all youth in  		residential care in 1997, and juvenile justice agencies were responsible for  		referring another 28 percent.</p>
<p>The number of children in residential settings has increased during the  		past two decades partly in response to the closing of long-term psychiatric  		hospitals and in-patient institutions (Manderscheid et al. 2004). As states  		have focused on closing hospital beds and Medicaid managed care has worked to  		reduce in-patient admissions and lengths of stay, the number of children placed  		in residential treatment has increased. </p>
<p>Overall, the number of residential beds in a state is shaped by several  		factors, including:</p>
<ul><li>Coverage of residential care for youth with mental illness in the  		  states Medicaid plan.</li>
<li>The extent to which juvenile justice, child welfare, special  		  education, and mental health agencies place children in residential care  		  without considering other alternatives.</li>
<li>Financial incentives that favor placement in residential treatment  		  over provision of home and community care (such as a Medicaid state plan that  		  includes coverage for residential treatment but not in-home counseling).</li>
<li>The availability of home and community services that could prevent or  		  shorten placement in residential care (a particular problem in the rural areas  		  of many states).</li>
<li>State agency, juvenile court, provider and family awareness of and  		  willingness to use intensive home and community services as an alternative to  		  residential settings.</li>
<li>Reluctance on the part of many communities to care for children who  		  are perceived to be very dangerous or uncontrollable.</li>
</ul><p>The total number of beds in RTCs or other out-of-home settings operated  		or funded by all state agencies combined is an important element in a financing  		analysis because care in these facilities is expensive. For example, analyses  		of Medicaid administrative and claims data from New Jersey indicate that annual  		costs in 1999 for all Medicaid services averaged $25,759 for a child with an  		emotional or behavioral disorder who spent 30 days or less in an institution  		for mental diseases (IMD) and $73,884 for children who spent more than 30 days  		in an IMD (Ireys and Cherlow 2004). In 2002, the Colorado state auditor  		estimated that the average annual cost in fiscal year 2001 for a child in a  		PRTF was $56,064 for children committed by the state Department of Youth  		Corrections (DYC), and $52,990 for children placed by their county child  		welfare or mental health agency (Colorado Office of the State Auditor 2002).  		The cost of care in PRTFs with on-grounds schools was higher, averaging $68,313  		annually for children placed by DYC, and $65,901 for children placed by a  		county agency.</p>
<p>In contrast, costs for children who receive home and community services  		through an HCBS waiver range between $12,813 and $28,058 per child per year  		(excluding Kansas), depending on the particular state and year of waiver  		operation (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableII1">Table II.1</a>). These figures are  		substantially lower than the estimates of the institutional level of care costs  		that would have been incurred had these children not been enrolled in the  		waiver, ranging from $22,736 to $113,572 per child per year, again depending on  		the particular state and year of waiver operation (<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableII1">Table  		II.1</a>). Given that total treatment dollars for youth with SED are limited,  		the more that states spend on residential and other out-of-home care, the less  		they have for intensive home and community services. Faced with this dilemma,  		policymakers in many states see their ability to enhance community services for  		youth with SED as depending, at least in part, on their ability to reduce the  		number of residential beds and average lengths of stay in residential settings.  		The monies saved by diverting children from residential care into community  		treatment are often referred to as diversion dollars or  		re-investment funds, and some states allocate all or a portion of  		these funds to child-serving agencies with the specific goal of enhancing  		intensive home and community services. </p>

</tr></table><h3>B. Sources of Federal Funding for Child Mental Health  		Services</h3>
<p>In addition to the demonstration projects funded by SAMHSA under the  		Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families  		Program, states draw from several federal sources to pay for mental health  		services for children, including Medicaid, Title IV-E and Title IV-B of the  		Social Security Act, special education, and community mental health block  		grants, among others. They also draw considerably on state and local general  		funds. </p>
<p>Medicaid is todays largest payer of mental health services in the  		nation (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health 2003). Consequently, the  		program plays a significant role in financing mental health services for youth  		with SED. About 20 percent of all children with mental illness are publicly  		insured, mostly through Medicaid, which in 1998 covered 24 percent of all  		childrens mental health expenditures (Koppleman 2005). </p>
<p>States use Medicaid to finance a wide range of mental health services  		including, in most states, treatment in psychiatric in-patient and residential  		facilities. Various waivers (such as the HCBS waiver), if approved by CMS,  		allow states to waive compliance with certain portions of the Medicaid statute,  		such as the amount, duration, and scope of Medicaid services they provide. As a  		result, a state may pay for specialized services not otherwise covered under  		its Medicaid plan in lieu of placing children in hospital in-patient settings  		but not, currently, in lieu of placing children in PRTFs. </p>
<p>For children involved in the child welfare system, Title IV-E provides  		states with matching federal funds to pay for the cost of room and board for  		eligible children in residential settings, including foster homes and other  		types of out-of-home care under a court order or voluntary placement. Title  		IV-E does not pay for mental health services provided outside of residential  		facilities, although it does cover certain types of administrative services,  		such as case management. (Medicaid typically pays for mental health services  		for Medicaid eligible children in foster care.) </p>
<p>Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act  		(IDEA), children who require special education services because of a  		disability, including SED, are entitled to receive such services, which will  		enable them to make progress in school and prepare for employment and  		independent living. IDEA requires public schools to evaluate children who are  		referred for special education services and, if it is determined that services  		are required, these schools must develop an individualized education program  		(IEP) that documents the type and intensity of services that will be provided  		(General Accounting Office 2003). Public schools are obligated to ensure that  		services specified in IEPs are provided, including paying for services if  		necessary, including mental health services and tuition at private schools  		designed for children with particular types of problems. Many school systems  		are reluctant to include intensive home or community services in IEPs because  		of their cost, although many school systems are paying for the cost of services  		in residential facilities. </p>
<p>The Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program supports the  		delivery of a broad range of community-based systems of care for individuals  		with serious mental illnesses, including children with SED, as an alternative  		to hospitalization. All states and territories are eligible for the grant  		program, which is administered by CMHS within SAMHSA. The grants are based on a  		states demographic and economic factors. They offer flexible funding that  		states can use not only to support mental health services not covered by other  		sources but also to pay for mental health treatment for uninsured individuals.  		Overall, these funds are quite limited, representing about 3 percent of all  		mental health costs in most states. </p>
<p>Changes in Medicaid payment strategies to support states use of  		intensive home and community services are essential. However, significant  		improvement in treating youth with SED depends on aligning the incentives and  		funding priorities of <i>all</i> key agencies, not just those that rely on  		Medicaid funding.</p>
<h3>C. Financing Mechanisms </h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two policy options through which states can  		reform the way they finance intensive home and community services for youth  		with SED: </p>
<ul><li>They can make comprehensive statewide reforms intended to address the  		  entire service delivery and financing system through procedural changes in all  		  participating agencies at the same time over a period of several years; or</li>
<li>They can make incremental reforms intended to address pieces of the  		  service delivery and financing system through procedural changes in one agency  		  or one department at a time or in a limited number of counties at a time.</li>
</ul><p>As a practical matter, the latter option is typically more feasible than  		the former, but the large variety of mechanisms that states can actually use to  		effect change is the same under either approach. This report focuses on the  		following four mechanisms (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableII2">Table II.2</a>):</p>
<ol><li>Medicaid 1915(c) HCBS;</li>
<li>The Medicaid rehabilitation option;</li>
<li>TEFRA provisions; and</li>
<li>Case-rates used by designated CMEs for high-risk populations, using  		  blended or braided funding.</li>
</ol><p>Each is briefly described below, together with other mechanisms that can  		be important components in developing a comprehensive financing system for  		childrens mental health services. </p>
<p><b>1. Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services Waivers</b></p>
<p>Through HCBS waivers, states can expand coverage of mental health  		services to intensive HCBS for a designated number of children with SED as an  		alternative to institutional care (defined as hospital level not residential  		treatment) that would otherwise be covered by Medicaid. States also can use  		HCBS waivers to expand coverage to populations not otherwise eligible for  		Medicaid, creating access, for example, to uninsured families and those who  		exhaust their private insurance because they have a child with SED. These are  		the families who otherwise may have to relinquish custody of their children to  		access services. </p>
<p>The waivers are attractive because they allow states to provide selected  		services to a limited number of children, thereby reducing their risks for a  		rapid escalation in expenditures. Children are determined to be eligible based  		on specific clinical criteria and, in some states, on whether the waiver is  		operational in their county. The expanded package can include a wide range of  		intensive services that many children with SED and their families need, and  		that can be combined into individualized plans of care tailored to the needs of  		the child and family. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>2. The Medicaid Rehabilitation Option</b></p>
<p>The Medicaid rehabilitation option can include a wide range of  		psychiatric rehabilitation services, which are defined as medical or  		remedial services for maximum reduction of mental disabilities and restoration  		of maximum functioning (<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableII2">Table II.2</a>). Such  		services include: (1) restoration and maintenance of daily living skills  		(grooming, personal hygiene, cooking, nutrition, health and mental health  		education, medication management, money management, and maintenance of the  		living environment); (2) training in the social skills appropriate to the use  		of community services; (3) development of appropriate personal support  		networks; (4) recreational services that are therapeutic in nature; and (5)  		telephone counseling services (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law 2001; Smith  		et al. 2000, p. 84). States vary widely in the rehabilitation services they  		offer depending on the various political and administrative factors that  		influenced the states decision to include this option. Some provide  		psychological assessment; crisis intervention; individual, group, and family  		therapy; and day treatment. Others offer home-based services, behavioral  		management skills training, therapeutic foster care, family preservation  		services, care coordination, or help in medication compliance (Smith et al.  		2000, pp. 75-76). Once a state has adopted the rehabilitation option as part of  		the state plan, it must make the covered services available to all Medicaid  		beneficiaries. </p>
<p><b>3. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982</b></p>
<p>TEFRA added the Katie Beckett provision to the Medicaid  		program as a state option. This provision allows states to waive the  		requirement for considering parental income in the process of determining  		Medicaid eligibility for children with disabilities under 18 years old who are  		living at home but would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid-funded  		institutional care. As of 2002, 20 states include this provision in their  		Medicaid plan, but in only ten do children with mental and emotional disorders  		qualify (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law 2002). Children who qualify under  		the provision are eligible only for the services provided under the  		states Medicaid plan. That is, TEFRA did not authorize a specialized  		package of intensive services for children covered under this provision. (TEFRA  		included many other provisions not related to children.) </p>
<p><b>4. Case-Rates for High-Risk Populations</b></p>
<p>More and more states and counties are contracting with designated CMEs  		to provide a flexible, individualized array of services and supports for  		defined populations of youth and pay these CMEs on a case-rate basis in return  		for meeting specified outcomes. For example, in Oneida County, New York, the  		Department of Social Services pays a nonprofit CME (Kids Oneida) $2,550 per  		month for each youth with SED to provide an individualized plan of care (IPC),  		including such services and supports as care coordination, family support,  		crisis response, skill building, intensive in-home counseling services, and  		respite care (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> for additional  		details).</p>
<p>In some other states, several state and local agencies that serve  		children contribute to the case-rate amount. Wraparound Milwaukee, for example,  		uses pooled dollars from child welfare, juvenile justice, Medicaid, and mental  		health (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> for additional details). This  		program accepts full risk for enrolled children but is able to purchase a  		broad, flexible array of services and supports. When necessary, the program  		pays RTCs for care (generally very short-term) on the basis of negotiated  		fee-for-service arrangements, as it does for all other types of services and  		supports. </p>
<p>Overall, CMEs such as Kids Oneida or Wraparound Milwaukee can provide a  		wider range of services tailored to the needs of the individual child and  		family than would be possible for any single agency. Moreover, because the  		state contracts with these entities, the state can include provisions  		specifically designed to enhance quality of care, such as specifying that  		evidence-based mental health treatments will be used to the extent possible.  		</p>
<p><b>5. Other Important Medicaid Financing Mechanisms</b></p>
<p><b><i>a. Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment  		Program </i></b></p>
<p>States use other Medicaid provisions to pay for mental health services  		for children, including the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and  		Treatment (EPSDT) program, the optional clinic benefit, 1915(b) waivers, and  		1115 waivers. Under EPSDT, all Medicaid-eligible children under the age of 21  		are entitled to be screened regularly for physical and mental health  		conditions. States are required to provide screened children with any medically  		necessary, federally authorized Medicaid service regardless of whether the  		service is included in the states Medicaid plan. Ideally, states would  		use EPSDT to enhance access to mental health treatment services for children  		with SED by ensuring that: (1) primary care physicians and clinics use standard  		screening tools to identify children with or at high risk for SED; (2)  		identified children are referred for further evaluation and treatment; and (3)  		identified children have access to a broad range of treatments, including  		intensive home and community services. </p>
<p>Most states, however, have neither fully put the EPSDT program into  		practice nor implemented the standard screening tools statewide that can  		reliably identify children and adolescents at risk for mental health problems  		(Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law 1999; Koppelman 2004). Consequently,  		lawsuits have been filed in numerous states alleging shortcomings in the  		provision of EPSDT services. Some of these lawsuits have focused on a  		states failure to provide intensive community-based mental health  		services to youth with SED and their families that would enable the youth to  		reside at home or in the community (GAO 2001; Perkins and Strickland 2004). For  		example, in June 1999, as a result of a class action lawsuit (<i>Emily Q v.  		Bontá</i>), Medi-Cal, the California Medicaid Program, was required to:  		(1) offer therapeutic behavioral services (TBS) so that children with SED could  		receive treatment in their communities instead of being institutionalized; (2)  		assess children in institutions to determine if they qualify for TBS; (3)  		develop and distribute a request and referral form for providers to request TBS  		services; (4) revise the EPSDT brochure to inform beneficiaries and applicants  		about TBS and other developmental services; and (5) provide compensatory  		benefits to class members wrongfully denied TBS services (Perkins and  		Strickland 2004). The most recent decision in a class action suit (<i>Rosie D.  		v. Romney</i>) occurred on January 26, 2006 when a judge ruled that  		Massachusetts violated EPSDT by failing to provide various intensive  		community-based mental health services, including comprehensive assessments,  		case management and clinical oversight, and in-home behavioral health services  		necessary to maintain a child at home or in the community. (Rosie D. v. Romney,  		No. 01-30199-MAP, January 26, 2006). </p>
<p><b><i>b. Clinic Option</i></b></p>
<p>Through the Medicaid clinic option, states can provide nonhospital-based  		community services, but only in community clinics and by or under the direction  		of a physician. Mental health services supported under this option typically  		include traditional counseling, psychotherapy, and medication management. The  		intensive home and community services required by youth with SED and their  		families are not generally covered under the clinic option.</p>
<p><b><i>c. Managed Care Waivers and Demonstrations</i></b></p>
<p>Through 1915(b) waivers, states can implement managed care delivery  		systems or "carve out" delivery systems for specialty care (e.g., behavioral  		health) that limit an individuals choice of provider under Medicaid.  		These waivers must be budget neutral but do not have to be operated statewide.  		Although the 1915(b) waiver can be used only for individuals who are already  		Medicaid eligible, the managed care system can utilize funding streams beyond  		Medicaid, thereby providing a vehicle for using diverse funding sources to  		implement a coordinated service delivery system for both Medicaid and  		nonMedicaid eligible children. CMS approves 1915(b) waivers for two years and  		states have the option to renew for successive two-year periods.</p>
<p>Medicaid 1115 waivers permit states to conduct demonstration projects  		that are likely to promote the objectives of the Medicaid program. For example,  		some states use 1115 waivers to expand eligibility to individuals not otherwise  		eligible under the Medicaid program, to provide services to Medicaid  		beneficiaries that are not typically covered, or to test innovative service  		delivery systems. States must show that the demonstrations will be budget  		neutral. CMS approves 1115 waivers for five years, after which states can  		submit renewal applications.</p>
<p>Because they offer states substantial flexibility in developing service  		packages and extending coverage to particular subgroups of beneficiaries, both  		1915(b) and 1115 waivers can be important vehicles for funding intensive home  		and community services for youth with SED.</p>
<p><b>6. Financing Mechanisms in the Study States</b></p>
<p>The states in the study are at different points in the process of  		transforming their mental health services for youth with SED, and have used or  		are using different combinations of financing mechanisms to do so (<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableII3">Table II.3</a>). The HCBS waiver states tend to use a greater  		number of mechanisms compared with the states that are exploring the  		feasibility of an HCBS waiver application. New Jersey and New Mexico have taken  		yet a different approach in their effort to implement comprehensive statewide  		reforms.</p>

</tr></table><h3>D. Financial Incentives for State Agencies </h3>
<p>Although state departments of mental health, child welfare, juvenile  		justice, and special education all provide treatment services to youth with  		SED, the services may vary according to differences in the agencies  		financial and programmatic incentives. </p>
<ul><li>Child welfare agencies focus on ensuring that children are safe from  		  harm and living under appropriate custody arrangements; the primary sources of  		  federal funding include Title IV-E (for foster care services, including room  		  and board in residential facilities) and Title IV-B (for child welfare  		  services, including family preservation services) of the Social Security Act.  		  Title IV-E dollars are entitlement dollars (i.e., essentially uncapped) that  		  are designated primarily for the maintenance costs associated with out-of-home  		  placements, including foster care and residential services, but Title IV-B  		  dollars, which can be used to pay for intensive community or home mental health  		  services, are capped. As a result, most youth with SED involved in the child  		  welfare system who need intensive treatment are steered toward some type of  		  residential care.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></li>
<li>With funding from state and federal special education appropriations,  		  special education departments focus on providing services that will promote a  		  childs ability to learn. In most cases, special education officials do  		  not view home or community services as related to education, and hence tend not  		  to include them in a childs IEP. School-based mental health counseling  		  may be included, but usually for strictly defined time periods. It is difficult  		  for parents to argue successfully that intensive mental health services of any  		  kind should be included in the childs IEP; when they are included, they  		  typically entail out-of-school day or residential placements.</li>
<li>Departments of mental health focus on providing preventive,  		  diagnostic, and treatment services for children who have or are at high risk  		  for mental illness or substance abuse, and receive much of their funding for  		  these services through Medicaid, mental health block grants, and general state  		  and local revenues. Treatment dollars typically move through state and county  		  mental health agencies to local community mental health centers (CMHCs) and  		  hence state and county policies (as well as the state Medicaid plan) shape the  		  incentives for CMHCs to provide home and community services. In a number of  		  states, CMHCs function as quasi-independent agencies under contract with the  		  state and accept risk for mental health services provided to children in their  		  area; as a result, they have strong incentives to replace expensive services  		  (i.e., residential care) with less expensive and more effective alternatives  		  (i.e., intensive home or community treatment.) In most states, however, CMHCs  		  do not bear this risk and are limited to providing services for which Medicaid  		  or the state will reimburse them.</li>
</ul><h3>E. The Role of Residential Treatment  		Facilities</h3>
<p>In addition to state agencies, PRTFs and RTCs also play pivotal roles in  		treating youth with SED and, like state agencies, their decisions are shaped by  		financial incentives. These facilities or centers are owned and operated by  		various entities, including private nonprofit firms, for profit companies, and  		to a lesser extent state agencies, and are operated or funded under the  		auspices of various state agencies, including departments of mental health,  		child welfare, and social services (Ireys et al. 2006). In 2000, state mental  		health agencies alone operated 474 RTCs for emotionally disturbed children with  		SED with a total of 33,421 beds (Manderscheid et al. 2004). This figure does  		not include beds operated or purchased by other child-serving systems, and  		hence is a substantial undercount of the total number of beds for children in  		residential treatment settings (see Ireys et al. 2006).</p>
<p>In some states, the leadership of RTCs is well organized and may  		actively resist the development and implementation of financing reforms for  		children with SED because such reforms typically shift dollars away from  		residential settings. On the other hand, a limited number of residential  		centers have begun to re-engineer their services by re-training staff to  		provide intensive home and community services. They also are taking a broader  		view of their mission, focusing not only on providing residential treatment but  		also on a continuum of services that vary in intensity and delivery site. For  		instance, some centers are beginning to explore methods for providing crisis  		intervention, stabilization, and treatment services in the home, school,  		detention centers, or other community settings (Kamradt and Connolly 2003).</p>
<h2><a name="approaches" id="approaches">III. STATE APPROACHES TO FINANCING HOME AND  		COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES FOR YOUTH WITH SED AND THEIR FAMILIES</a></h2>
<p>Developing better mechanisms for financing home and community services  		for youth with SED is a work-in-progress for most states, and an integral part  		of their ongoing efforts to improve the child mental health service system. By  		necessity, discussions with state officials focused on their policy and program  		environments at one point in time (late 2004 to mid 2005), but these  		environments can change quickly in response to new legislation or lessons  		learned from ongoing program implementation. For example, during this period,  		two states had recently initiated HCBS waivers and were still in the early  		phases of implementation. In addition, several of the states that had received  		CMS grants to study the feasibility of developing an HCBS waiver were moving  		forward to implement study recommendations. </p>
<p>Although the summaries are snapshots of the policies and programs in  		selected states at one point in time, they illustrate the large constellation  		of mechanisms available to all states interested in financing intensive home  		and community services for youth with SED and their families. In particular,  		they show how the states are combining different financing methods to support  		these services and why the states made the choices they did. This chapter: (1)  		describes findings from two states (New Jersey and New Mexico) that have  		implemented broad statewide financing reforms; (2) presents findings on  		incremental reforms implemented by the states with HCBS waivers; and (3)  		discusses the key issues that emerged as states conducted their CMS-supported  		feasibility studies. </p>
<h3>A. Comprehensive Statewide Reforms</h3>
<p>In light of funding constraints and the many other policy issues  		competing for legislative attention, few states are likely to have the  		combination of sustained political leadership, financial resources, and  		technical capacity required to reform their entire public mental health system  		for children over a period of several years. Nonetheless, two states in this  		study--New Jersey and New Mexico--have pursued this goal. (See the  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#NJ">New Jersey exhibit</a> and <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#NM">New Mexico exhibit</a>  		and the states summaries in <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendA">Appendix A</a> for more  		details.) </p>
<p>In 2004, New Jersey began using a statewide administrative service  		organization (ASO) to manage the financing and monitoring of child mental  		health services across several child-serving systems. The ASO uses a standard  		tool to assess children and refers those at risk for out-of-home placement to  		local care management organizations (CMOs). The CMOs develop individualized  		service plans (ISPs), provide care management, and contract with family support  		organizations (FSOs) for family-to-family services. To help pay for these  		intensive home and community services, New Jersey implemented the  		rehabilitation services option under Medicaid and expanded coverage to include  		such services as mobile response and stabilization, in-home services, and  		intensive care management.</p>

<ul><li><font>Development of fundamental structural and  				  financing reform of the states system of mental health care for children  				  began in 1999 and led to the Childrens Initiative, a community-based  				  system-of-care that brought together once disparate child welfare, juvenile  				  justice, mental health and Medicaid agencies.</font></li>
<li><font>The state implemented the Medicaid  				  rehabilitation option and expanded service coverage and contracted with  				  ValueOptions to provide a single point of entry and standard assessments of  				  children.</font></li>
<li><font>This organization refers children who are at  				  risk of out-of-home placement to CMOs, which are local, private, nonprofit  				  entities developed specifically under the new program to serve children with  				  complex, multisystem needs; operating in all of the states 15 service  				  areas, CMOs serve over 3,000 children.</font></li>
<li><font>Each CMO receives about $500,000 per year to  				  support individualized service planning, provide intensive care management  				  services, and must contract with FSOs, which are new, locally-based family-run  				  organizations funded by the state and play a key role in the reform.  				  </font></li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Financing Issues</b></font>
<ul><li><font>In the first year of reform, New Jersey  				  financed its share of Medicaid costs by combining $167 million in existing  				  state dollars for children with SED from the child welfare and mental health  				  divisions (including $117 million previously spent by the department of child  				  welfare on residential care) with $39 million in new funds authorized for  				  children with SED in the governors 2001 budget.</font></li>
<li><font>To build infrastructure for intensive home and  				  community services, the state used dollars saved by drawing down federal  				  Medicaid dollars for services covered under its expanded rehabilitation option  				  and by claiming federal matching dollars for services that it had previously  				  supported solely with state funds.</font></li>
<li><font>Partly because more children are receiving  				  community services than in earlier years, growth in spending for community care  				  has outpaced growth in spending for residential care, which now constitutes a  				  smaller fraction (60 percent instead of 90 percent) of the overall budget for  				  childrens mental health than it did before system reform, and the goal is  				  to reduce this ratio further.</font></li>
</ul></td>

<li><font>By pooling state and federal dollars, New  				  Jersey has been able to provide more appropriate and timely services (including  				  intensive and nontraditional community-based services in addition to  				  residential treatment) in more settings to more children and their families,  				  regardless of illness severity or insurance status.</font></li>
<li><font>New Jersey opted to reform its childrens  				  mental health system using the Medicaid rehabilitation option because it  				  allowed the state to develop a continuum of services that would be commensurate  				  with a range of mental health needs statewide; the HCBS waiver was perceived as  				  being too administratively burdensome and inconsistent with the goal of serving  				  all children in need, in all areas of the state.</font></li>

</ul></td>
</tr></table><p>Discussions with officials in these two states also indicated the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>The statewide reform efforts were spurred, at least in part, by  		  emerging crises in the mental health system in each state: New Jerseys  		  system was heavily dependent on in-patient and residential treatment beds, with  		  high costs and poor outcomes.

<li>Reform efforts were initiated and then supported by top levels of  		  government (either the governors office or the legislature or both).</li>
<li>Political support for system re-design, including support from family  		  members, led directly to expanding financial resources for home and community  		  services and the infrastructure necessary for major changes to occur.</li>
<li>Extensive collaboration among key agencies was necessary for the  		  research, planning, and development efforts required to ensure that funds from  		  key child-serving agencies could be: (1) combined or otherwise coordinated to  		  give care managers flexibility in developing ISPs; and (2) managed in a way  		  that would support a continuum of care in which intensive home and community  		  services could be used to improve outcomes.</li>
<li>Both states planned and instituted reforms to restructure their  		  entire mental health system for children in order to provide a continuum of  		  care for all children with mental health needs--not just those with the most  		  severe conditions in specific areas of the state.</li>
</ul><h3>B. Incremental Reforms</h3>
<p>When comprehensive statewide reform was not politically or financially  		feasible, other states addressed the problem of a less-than-adequate child  		mental health system incrementally, implementing specific aspects of a larger  		program over time. Most of the states with HCBS waivers took this approach.  		Each has several programs that aim to support intensive home or community  		services for youth with SED, resulting in wide variation in the services  		available across different counties or different groups of children within a  		state. The summaries in <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> illustrate this  		pattern. This section describes the incremental approaches taken by three  		states: New York, Indiana, and Vermont. <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>  		includes additional information on Kansas and Wisconsin.</p>
<p><b>New York</b>. New York (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#NY">New York exhibit</a> and  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>) has had a Medicaid HCBS waiver for about ten  		years that now serves approximately 1,700 children with SED in 40 of the  		states 57 counties and the five boroughs of New York City. Even with the  		waiver, however, funding strategies in the state vary widely at the county  		level:</p>
<ul><li>In some counties, for instance, the waiver is the only vehicle  		  through which some youth with SED can become eligible for Medicaid and gain  		  access to intensive HCBS because counties do not have the resources for  		  providing intensive service through other sources.</li>
<li>In other counties, children with SED have access to intensive  		  services either through the waiver or through other community-based programs  		  and supports funded by: (1) state re-investment dollars; (2) resources pooled  		  from the Office of Mental Health (OMH), Medicaid, and the local Department of  		  Social Services; and (3) a SAMHSA grant. In these counties, the HCBS waiver  		  supplements, rather than defines, the intensive services available to children  		  with SED.</li>

<ul><li><font>A Medicaid HCBS waiver was implemented in 1996,  				  allowing the state to: (1) finance an expanded array of intensive  				  community-based services; (2) lift requirements for applying parental income to  				  otherwise eligible children (known as deeming); (3) waive  				  statewideness requirements; and (4) control exposure to rapid increases in  				  Medicaid expenditures by limiting the number of waiver-enrolled  				  children.</font></li>
<li><font>In 2003, New York spent $25.6 million on  				  services (including medical care) for waiver-enrolled children, and in 2005  				  expects to serve approximately 1,700 children in 40 counties and the boroughs  				  of New York City.</font></li>

</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Lessons Learned</b></font>
<ul><li><font>Given the different mechanisms used by the  				  states counties, New York State reflects the diversity of approaches  				  found in the nation as a whole.</font></li>
<li><font>Legislation promoting individualized service  				  planning and interagency collaboration has enhanced the effectiveness of HCBS  				  waivers and other efforts to finance intensive home and community  				  services.</font></li>
<li><font>The ability to waive parental deeming and  				  statewideness requirements was useful for New York State during the initial  				  implementation of the HCBS waiver.</font></li>
<li><font>New York continues to face challenges in  				  managing admissions to residential treatment facilities for children with SED  				  because counties must pay some of the costs for intensive community services  				  but none of the costs of residential care; consequently, counties have a strong  				  financial incentive to place youth with SED in residential  				  settings.</font></li>
</ul></td>
</tr></table><ul><li>Still other counties have sophisticated systems of financing. For  		  example, rather than enrolling children with SED into the HCBS wavier, Oneida  		  County uses a managed care model that is based on case rates and depends also  		  on fiscal collaboration among county departments of social service and mental  		  health. Kids Oneida is a nonprofit CME that has negotiated with the county to  		  receive a case-rate of $2,550 per child per month to provide about 200 children  		  with a flexible, individualized set of services similar to those provided under  		  the HCBS wavier. In addition, the state Medicaid program pays Kids Oneida a  		  monthly case-rate of $1,225 for each Medicaid-eligible enrolled child.</li>
<li>Some counties have no special financing initiatives for children with  		  SED.</li>
</ul><p>New Yorks experience illustrates the challenge of aligning county  		and state financing in a county-structured state. For instance, when youth with  		SED cannot enroll in the wavier (i.e., when counties do not participate in the  		HCBS waiver program or when all waiver slots are filled), counties have a  		strong financial incentive to admit these children to residential care because  		the state covers the entire portion of the Medicaid match for residential  		services whereas the counties have to pay a portion of the Medicaid match for  		community services.</p>
<p><b>Indiana</b>. Like New York, Indiana has used a variety of mechanisms  		to fund intensive home and community services for youth with SED (see  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#IN">Indiana exhibit</a> and <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>). In  		addition to an HCBS waiver, the state uses the Medicaid rehabilitation option  		and state-funded awards grants of about $50,000 per year for up to two years to  		32 single and multicounty sites (covering about half of its 92 counties)  		specifically to develop system-of-care programs. In state fiscal year 2005,  		these sites reported serving 993 children. The funds supporting these programs  		pay for an individualized, wraparound approach to service planning and provide  		counties with some flexible monies to support specific services. These dollars,  		however, are not derived from redirecting existing monies currently being spent  		on residential care, suggesting that the state has provided modest support for  		new community services but has not implemented a strategy for reducing and  		re-deploying dollars spent on residential care. In fact, as noted below, the  		number of the states residential beds is increasing. </p>
<p>Indianas experience provides insight into two important financing  		issues: legal pressures to expand the number of residential beds and the  		challenges of implementing innovative projects statewide. The first issue is  		related to a class-action lawsuit that was filed in the late 1990s on behalf of  		parents who had to relinquish custody of their Medicaid-enrolled children in  		order to obtain residential treatment services because the states  		Medicaid program did not cover services provided to children in PRTFs unless  		the children were wards of the state. In January 2004, Indiana lost the  		lawsuit, forcing it to cover, through Medicaid, services provided to children  		in PRTFs under the auspices of mental health agencies. This change contributed  		to an increase in the total number of PRTF beds for children in the state. As  		of early 2005, 11 PRTFs had a total bed capacity of 150, but state staff expect  		this number to rise as new PRTFs are completed. This increase will add to the  		existing beds in residential facilities operated under the auspices of juvenile  		justice and child welfare. Indianas counties pay the full amount of the  		state match of federal Medicaid dollars for PRTF services, and most use their  		child welfare dollars to do so. </p>

</tr></table><p>The historical absence of Medicaid coverage for treatment services in  		PRTFs also meant that Medicaid expenditures for residential care were minimal  		in the 1990s and early 2000s. As a result, there was no financial incentive  		within Medicaid to develop community services because these services would not  		reduce Medicaid expenditures on residential care. In short, there was no  		business case to be made for diverting Medicaid dollars from  		residential care to community services, as there is now.</p>
<p>The second financing issue--developing a county-based financing program  		and attempting to apply it statewide--is exemplified by the Dawn Project, a  		designated CME operating in Marion County (Indianapolis), similar in design to  		Kids Oneida and Wraparound Milwaukee. The project negotiated case-rates with  		child welfare, juvenile justice, and special education that cover intensive  		home and community services for children with SED and their families. Although  		the project has been a good learning experience for state and county level  		mental health authorities, several factors have limited the states  		ability to expand this model statewide:</p>
<ol><li>Mental health services are planned and organized largely at the  		  county level; as a result, county level factors (such as leadership, population  		  density, and service accessibility) play important roles in shaping mental  		  health services.</li>
<li>Most counties have little experience in managed behavioral health  		  care technologies, such as utilization management and risk-based financing, and  		  as a result do not have the experiential foundation necessary to replicate the  		  Dawn Project.</li>
<li>In theory, because counties are at risk for the Medicaid match for  		  placements in residential facilities, they should have an incentive to develop  		  Dawn-like projects and participate in the waiver program. However, according to  		  state officials, officials in some counties believe that the number of youth  		  with SED in their county who are at risk for placement in residential care is  		  not sufficient to justify the costs of establishing a Dawn-like  		  system-of-care.</li>
<li>The viability of an integrated services program depends on sustained  		  coordination among key county agencies, which can be difficult to achieve  		  because of the agencies different missions and funding streams.</li>
</ol><p><b>Vermont</b>. Vermont is a third state that has taken the route of  		incremental reform. In Vermonts case, however, the incremental reforms  		have added up to a comprehensive statewide system-of-care, in part because the  		number of children with SED is low compared with many other states and in part  		because state officials have been working aggressively on reforms for almost a  		quarter of a century (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#VT">Vermont exhibit</a> and  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>).

</tr></table><p>In 1982, Vermont applied for and received a Medicaid HCBS waiver. This  		small, but important, component of the states mental health system for  		children with SED allows it to provide these children with intensive services  		beyond those available in the standard Medicaid benefit package. In doing so,  		the waiver allows Vermont to manage the costs of care for high-need children by  		helping it to avoid costly institutional level placements. The waiver also  		allows the state to serve children who would not otherwise be Medicaid eligible  		because parental income is usually applied to children for purposes of  		determining eligibility (a process known as deeming). Other key  		financing strategies in Vermont include the following:</p>
<ol><li>By passing Act 264 in 1988--which mandated interagency collaboration  		  and parental involvement at all levels of decision-making--Vermont enhanced  		  support for the coordination and planning of community-based services. The goal  		  of this effort was to ensure that families of children with SED would be  		  provided with an IPC that was developed and coordinated by teams of mental  		  health, special education, and child welfare staff and family members and that  		  specified which agencies would pay for which services in the IPC. </li>
<li>By expanding the Medicaid rehabilitation option in the mid 1990s, the  		  state made other services available, such as targeted case management.</li>
<li>By using the Katie Beckett provision in the TEFRA, the state was able  		  to provide services for some children with SED whose families had incomes above  		  the Medicaid criteria and who did not meet clinical criteria for the  		  waiver.</li>
<li>By increasing eligibility for Medicaid to 300 percent of the federal  		  poverty level, the state ensured that all but a very few children had health  		  coverage.</li>
</ol><p>The product of Vermonts multifaceted and aggressive use of  		financing alternatives is a comprehensive, flexible mental health care system  		for children with SED. </p>
<h3>C. Contemplating Future Reforms</h3>
<p>The feasibility studies conducted by Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi,  		Missouri, and Texas indicate that these states are seriously contemplating an  		HCBS waiver to finance reforms to their mental health system for children. Each  		of the states used its grant dollars for somewhat different purposes, but  		collectively, their efforts tell a great deal about how change begins and where  		it leads in the ever-evolving landscape of the child mental health system. For  		instance, discussions with officials in the five states that received grants  		from CMS to study the feasibility of developing an application for an HCBS  		waiver provide fresh insight into the key financing issues that emerge as  		states work to improve the financing of intensive home and community  		services.</p>
<p>In most states, assessing the feasibility of an HCBS waiver application  		entailed an examination of a states overall system-of-care for youth with  		SED. Some states saw the act of developing an application for an HCBS wavier  		for youth with SED not only as a contribution to their ongoing efforts to  		enhance the child mental health service system but also as a vehicle to  		encourage collaboration among child-serving agencies, thus making the somewhat  		disparate missions and funding streams of these agencies more congruent with  		one another. Many grantees used their funds to build on work already underway  		through interagency committees or as a result of state laws requiring them to  		improve their systems of care for youth with SED. In addition, most grantees  		used the funds to support studies of the factors that must be considered in the  		service expansion process, including defining provider case-rates, determining  		the number of children with mental health service needs, and identifying needed  		services. </p>
<p>Maryland, for example, actually applied for an HCBS waiver in the 1990s  		and was denied because the state used residential facility expenditures rather  		than expenditures for care in psychiatric hospitals in its cost-neutrality  		calculations. In its continuing efforts to build support for intensive home and  		community services, the state is using its CMS feasibility grant dollars to  		develop actuarially sound case-rates and build support for a pilot wraparound  		program that it plans to launch in two locations (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#MD">Maryland  		exhibit</a> and <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>), which would re-direct  		Medicaid dollars now spent on residential treatment to local CMEs to provide  		individualized, intensive home and community services and supports. A committee  		is working on convincing child welfare and juvenile justice agencies that a  		wraparound program could reduce their direct costs by reducing stays in  		residential facilities, detention centers, and foster care. These agencies,  		however, have little incentive to support such a program because as long as a  		Medicaid-enrolled child is in a residential facility, they are not obligated to  		cover the cost of care, which is paid for by the state mental health department  		or Medicaid. </p>
<p>Missouri passed legislation in 2003 and 2004 to address the problem  		posed by a policy that forces parents to relinquish custody of their children  		in order to gain access to mental health treatment. The bill paved the way for  		the state to both increase interagency collaboration and obtain a CMS grant for  		a feasibility study. The study addressed the question of how to expand access  		to mental health services and supports so that parents would not have to turn  		to the child welfare system for help (see the <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#MO">Missouri  		exhibit</a> and <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>). Through the study, the  		state found that in 2003, about 600 children were in state custody for no  		reason other than that was the only means through which their parents could  		secure mental health care for them, and that the total annual cost in 2002 for  		such children was about $43,000 per child. The study presented a series of five  		alternatives to providing these children with mental health services (see  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>), including a Medicaid HCBS wavier. The state  		has submitted an application for an HCBS waiver and is in the process of  		developing a new data system that should support efforts to implement a  		comprehensive system-of-care.</p>

</tr></table><h3>D. Summary</h3>
<p>The findings in this chapter illustrate the diversity of mechanisms that  		states are using to pay for intensive home and community services for youth  		with SED. This variation is a function not only of the mosaic of funding  		sources and financing mechanisms available to them, but also of the many  		historical, legislative, and experiential factors that are unique to any given  		state. Despite this variation, four themes are common across the states.</p>
<p>First, legislative or budgetary action has been an important impetus for  		interagency collaboration around planning, financing, and program development.  		Although legislation alone is neither necessary nor sufficient for garnering  		financial support for intensive home and community services for youth with SED,  		it can certainly move a state in the right direction by establishing  		expectations and goals, removing barriers to collaboration, and, in some cases,  		providing new dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to sustain these  		services. Some of this money has come from diversion dollars, re-investment  		funds, or tobacco settlement monies. </p>
<p>Second, extremely tight budgets have made states reluctant to add  		services to their Medicaid plans for fear that they will substantially raise  		expenditures, and current federal priorities are not favorable for expanding  		coverage of services for youth with SED. At this point in time, few states  		appear to be considering seriously an expansion of the Medicaid rehabilitation  		option to cover intensive services for these children, although many have taken  		this step in the past. </p>
<p>Third, system-of-care demonstration projects gave states useful  		experience in the financing of intensive home and community services. Although  		many of these demonstration projects did not continue after federal funding  		ended, some states (e.g., Kansas, Indiana, Mississippi, Maryland, Texas, and  		Wisconsin) indicated that the projects were critical to developing technical  		experience in: (1) funding and managing community services; and (2) fostering  		the interagency collaboration that underpins a flexible and comprehensive set  		of services for youth with SED. In fact, states with these projects typically  		created coordinated systems-of-care in selected locations, which, in some  		states, helped build the administrative support for a waiver application.</p>
<p>Fourth, states and counties that carefully manage access to residential  		treatment services and psychiatric hospitals tend to have more resources for  		intensive home and community services. Careful management of access to  		residential care is important for a variety of reasons. The evidence supporting  		the effectiveness of residential treatment is poor (Frensch and Cameron 2002;  		Joshi and Rosenberg 1997; Weiner et al. 2001) and managing access to  		residential placements avoids both the high cost of such care, as well as the  		problems that occur when children return to their families without appropriate  		transition and family support services. In fact, much of the initial success of  		Wraparound Milwaukee resulted from re-directing child welfare, juvenile  		justice, and Medicaid funds from residential care to intensive home and  		community services (Kamradt and Connolly 2003). </p>
<p>Discussions with state officials indicated that establishing a statewide  		gate-keeping system for managing admissions and lengths of stay in residential  		treatment depends on several factors including:</p>
<ul><li>The use of standard assessments that are strength-based, culturally  		  competent, and family focused to inform service planning.</li>
<li>The availability of community services that provide an effective  		  alternative to residential care.</li>
<li>The extent of collaboration among key agencies, which ensures service  		  continuity and prevents a child from cycling from one agency to the  		  next.</li>
<li>Financial incentives that favor HCBS over residential placement.</li>
<li>Recognition on the part of juvenile court judges, child welfare case  		  workers, providers and families that intensive home and community services are  		  effective alternatives to residential care.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="strengths" id="strengths">IV. STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF SELECTED FINANCING  		MECHANISMS</a></h2>
<p>In addition to documenting the financing issues specific to each state,  		the discussions with state officials provided general information on the  		states experience with the following four financing mechanisms: HCBS  		waivers, the Medicaid rehabilitation option, case-rates used by designated  		CMEs, and the Katie Becket provision of TEFRA. This chapter examines the  		strengths and weaknesses of each of these mechanisms (<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableIV1">Table  		IV.1</a>). As noted in <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#background">Chapter II</a>, states also have  		other Medicaid financing options (for example, the EPSDT program, Section 1115  		waivers and Section 1915(b) waivers), but these are not covered again in this  		chapter. </p>
<h3>A. HCBS Waivers</h3>
<p>According to state officials, HCBS waivers offer five benefits. First,  		in allowing states to circumvent restrictions on the type, amount, duration,  		and scope of Medicaid services, the waivers permit states to provide selected  		individuals and their families with a set of specialized intensive HCBS that  		would not otherwise be covered by any other financing mechanism. These services  		include wraparound facilitation, respite care, parent support, daily living  		skills, and other services (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableIV2">Table IV.2</a>). </p>
<p>Second, HCBS waivers allow states to lift requirements for applying  		parental income to children, thereby providing access to medical and mental  		health services for youth who might not otherwise meet the Medicaid financial  		eligibility criteria. These services include not only the specialized intensive  		services covered under the waiver, but also all other services offered in the  		states standard Medicaid plan. This feature of the waiver is especially  		valuable for children in low or moderate-income families in which one or both  		parents work but whose employer-based insurance has very restrictive mental  		health benefits or none at all, as well as for parents of children with serious  		disorders who exhaust their private insurance coverage. Lifting these  		requirements also allows children with SED who enroll in an HCBS waiver to  		obtain services without having to be wards of the state, so parents no longer  		have to relinquish custody of their children to obtain services for  		them.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Third, HCBS waivers remove the statewideness requirement for  		standard Medicaid services, thereby allowing states to roll out waiver services  		county by county as resources and experience allow. As a practical matter, most  		states have designated a certain number of slots that will be open under the  		waiver and established mechanisms for determining which counties or localities  		can enroll children in the waiver. For example, New York makes 610 total slots  		available, and has allotted a certain number of slots to 40 of its 57 counties  		and to all the boroughs in New York City. Overall, this translates into a total  		of about 1,700 children served annually because many children are enrolled in  		the waiver for only part of a year. Other states, such as Vermont, have capped  		waiver expenditures, allowing IPCs to be developed for as many children as  		possible, provided that total expenditures for all plans do not exceed the  		limit.</p>

</tr></table><p>Fourth, in some states, the HCBS waivers have contributed to an increase  		in the number of organizations that provide intensive home or community  		services, such as respite care or family-to-family support. For these  		organizations, predictable access to clients and reimbursements brings  		economies of scale that can sustain them over time and, in turn, make intensive  		home and community services more available. </p>
<p>Finally, the states with HCBS waivers have gained considerable  		experience in pricing intensive home and community services. For example,  		several states have contracted with family organizations for the delivery of  		various kinds of family support programs and services. <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendE">Appendix E</a> provides examples of the cost of these and other  		services provided through the waivers. An examination of the actuarial  		implications of these costs was beyond the scope of this study, but additional  		study of states collective experience in developing costs estimates for  		specific home and community services could be a useful resource for states  		working to expand coverage of these services.</p>
<p>Although HCBS waivers help states to support intensive home and  		community services for selected youth with SED, they also have several  		disadvantages. Overall, state officials cited six disadvantages of the HCBS  		waivers.</p>
<p>First, HCBS waivers for youth with SED are focused on treatment services  		for high-risk or high-need children, and as a result do not allow states to  		support services that would prevent children from moving into a high-risk  		category. Nor does the basic Medicaid plan in many states cover services for  		these children. The result is a gap in coverage for children whose problems are  		not serious enough either to qualify for the waiver or to be addressed through  		Medicaid. </p>
<p>Second, building the administrative support necessary to develop and  		implement a waiver requires substantial administrative effort that results in  		coverage for a relatively small number of children. For example, Indiana (see  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#approaches">Chapter III</a>) found that it had to provide substantial  		guidance to county level personnel in the use of software that enrolls and  		tracks waiver enrollees. The combination of too few computers and field workers  		who had relatively little experience with a new software package contributed to  		lower enrollment rates than anticipated. During the first 15 months of  		operation, the waiver enrolled only 20 children. </p>
<p>Third, HCBS waivers alone do little to align funding practices and  		financial incentives in a way that would make home and community services for  		children with SED more widely available. For instance, although the waivers  		have brought state Medicaid and mental health agencies together in the effort  		to strengthen coverage for intensive home and community services for youth with  		SED who need a hospital level of care, they do not directly affect financing  		practices in other agencies, such as child welfare, that often cover  		residential services for the majority of youth with SED, nor do the waivers  		currently allow for alternatives to residential treatment. If child welfare and  		juvenile justice agencies are not financially motivated to support home or  		community services, then the HCBS waiver itself will be a somewhat isolated  		effort that affects only a small proportion of the target population. Indeed,  		that has been the case in all of the current waiver states. Discussions with  		state officials suggest that HCBS waivers have the most impact when states also  		have passed legislation compelling child-serving agencies to enhance  		collaboration and align their missions and funding streams to jointly support  		the financing of intensive home and community services. </p>
<p>Fourth, in states where counties play a major role in financing services  		for youth with SED, the HCBS waiver can introduce or reinforce a financial  		disincentive to support home or community services. For example, if counties  		must contribute to the state Medicaid match for waiver services but not for  		residential care, they are more likely to place youth with SED in residential  		settings than to link them with community services because it will be less  		expensive for the counties to do so even though it will be more expensive for  		the state. The same rationale holds for counties in which state child welfare  		agencies pay for the majority of residential care for youth with SED. For these  		counties, it is likely to be financially advantageous to pay for residential  		care through Title IV-E funds rather than to contribute a portion of the state  		Medicaid match for waiver services. </p>
<p>Fifth, the HCBS waivers may do little to reduce a states  		geographic disparities in access to mental health services and the  		fragmentation of the mental health system. For example, not all counties in New  		York State can enroll children with SED in the waiver even though it has been  		in existence for about a decade. Although the rationale for waiving  		statewideness may be reasonable in the early stages of waiver implementation  		(i.e., so states can gain experience with the waiver before expanding it more  		broadly), states may be slow to broaden access to all of its jurisdictions  		because of cost concerns. </p>
<p>Finally, children who improve enough to disenroll from a waiver are  		likely to need some continuing treatment services. Unless the state provides an  		effective continuum of services, most of which would not be covered under an  		HCBS waiver, maintaining the benefits of waiver services can be challenging.  		Many program administrators who have implemented an HCBS waiver underscore the  		importance of viewing the waiver as one part of a larger, continuing effort to  		strengthen the child mental health service system and improve interagency  		collaboration overall. </p>
<h3>B. Medicaid Rehabilitation Option</h3>
<p>Because federal regulations give states wide latitude in defining the  		type, scope, and delivery site for services covered under this option, the  		services covered under the Medicaid rehabilitation option vary widely from  		state to state (see <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#background">Chapter II</a>, <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#tableII2">Table II.2</a>). For example, states offer services such as  		assessment, in-home services, school-based services, behavioral management  		skills training, and crisis intervention. Depending on the state, services may  		be covered under this option if they are provided either in the childs  		residence, school, or other community institution. This flexibility is very  		useful to states because it allows them to cover a number of intensive home and  		community services that are particularly important for youth with SED and their  		families. </p>
<p>Despite the flexibility offered by the rehabilitation option, several  		officials see the expansion of the option as financially risky. Offering the  		services is potentially expensive because these services are needed and sought  		after by families, and because they would be available to all categorically  		eligible beneficiaries, not just to high-need children; consequently, the rise  		in utilization could increase state Medicaid expenditures substantially. </p>
<h3>C. Case-Rates Used by Designated Care Management  		Entities for High-Risk Populations</h3>
<p>States, counties and other local jurisdictions in several of the study  		states have developed approaches that specifically serve youth with SED using  		managed care technologies and risk-based financing. These approaches provide a  		case-rate to a designated CME to provide a flexible, individualized array of  		services and supports and intensive care management for youth with SED and  		their families, giving the CME wide latitude in individualizing care in return  		for meeting specified outcomes. These include Wraparound Milwaukee in  		Wisconsin, the Dawn Project in Indiana, and Kids Oneida in New York. New  		Jerseys CMOs are also modeled on this approach, but they do not involve  		risk-based financing currently. Other states like Maryland are exploring  		similar alternatives. These approaches seek to achieve better cost and quality  		outcomes by providing an alternative to placement of youth in residential  		treatment. Referrals to these programs typically come from juvenile justice,  		child welfare, and education agencies, which contribute to the case-rate for  		each child. Thus, comprehensive services for children enrolled in these  		programs are paid for by multiple child-serving agencies and delivered in a  		coordinated and efficient manner by designated CMEs. Moreover, CMEs are usually  		under contract to report specific performance measures to the states as a means  		for tracking quality of care. Because of these contractual agreements, CMEs  		typically aim to provide only those services that have demonstrated  		effectiveness.</p>
<p>The successful application of managed care principles to services for  		youth with SED has several advantages, including comprehensive service  		coordination; careful tracking of service utilization, quality, and costs; and  		accurate monitoring of performance and outcomes. However, this approach also  		has several disadvantages. First, it requires expertise in financial  		management, organizational development, clinical supervision, and data  		systems--a set of skills that can be developed in many state and local agencies  		only through substantial training and technical support. </p>
<p>Second, even states with experience in the use of case-rates to pay for  		services for youth with SED in selected counties may find it difficult to  		expand the arrangement statewide. Again, the financial and experiential  		resources needed to broadly implement even a well-tested program take time to  		develop at a local level. </p>
<h3>D. The TEFRA Provision</h3>
<p>As noted in <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#background">Chapter II</a>, the Katie Beckett  		provision in TEFRA allows states to waive the requirement for considering  		parental income in the process of determining Medicaid eligibility for children  		with disabilities under 18 years old who are living at home but would otherwise  		be eligible for Medicaid-funded institutional care. The strength of this  		provision lies in the fact that it extends Medicaid eligibility to children who  		would not normally have access to Medicaid services and who are likely to have  		no or inadequate coverage for mental health services. </p>
<p>However, the provision is restrictive in that it requires states to  		determine that: (1) the child has a disability as defined by the SSA disability  		definition; (2) the child requires the level of care provided in an  		institution; (3) home care is appropriate; and (4) the cost of home care is no  		more than the cost of institutional care. For children with SED, documentation  		of a disability that meets SSA standards can be particularly difficult. As of  		2002, 20 states had a TEFRA option, but of these, only ten included children  		with SED (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law 2002).<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> In 2001, in nine of these ten states (all  		except Vermont), the percentage of children with SED was less than 21 percent  		of all children enrolled in Medicaid through this TEFRA provision, amounting to  		less than 2,500 children with SED across all ten states (Bazelon Center for  		Mental Health Law 2002). In addition, TEFRA does not expand coverage of home  		and community services; rather, it expands eligibility to a states  		existing Medicaid benefit package.</p>
<h2><a name="synthesis" id="synthesis">V. SYNTHESIS AND IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>Discussions with state officials indicate that policymakers in many  		states are committed to finding better ways to finance intensive home and  		community services for youth with SED and their families because the problem is  		urgent and legislative interest is high. Also, the evidence for the  		effectiveness of home and community services for this population is growing. In  		contrast, sustainable outcomes associated with residential treatment and other  		out-of-home placements have not been demonstrated and the costs of these  		interventions are high. The discussions also provide numerous examples of how  		states finance these services by combining various mechanisms--from cobbling  		together several Medicaid-based strategies (e.g., the HCBS waivers, the  		rehabilitation option, and the TEFRA provision) to broad statewide reforms of  		the child mental health system as a whole. </p>
<p>State officials decisions regarding a suitable combination of  		financing mechanisms vary from state to state because of many factors,  		including differences in demographic variables, political leadership, financial  		resources, and availability of technical expertise. Discussions with state  		officials underscore the challenging political environments in most states  		because financial resources are sharply limited. In addition, developing a  		long-term commitment to collaboration between and among key state departments,  		county agencies, private sector providers, family members, and other key  		stakeholders requires substantial administrative time and, in most instances,  		sustained leadership from the governors office or the legislature. </p>
<p>Moreover, each individual financing mechanism has particular strengths  		and weaknesses, and no single mechanism alone can address the scope of  		challenges involved in paying for intensive home and community services for  		youth with SED. Although comprehensive statewide reforms, like the ones being  		implemented in New Jersey and New Mexico, promise fundamental improvements in  		child mental health services over a number of years, most states are  		approaching the task through incremental reforms because they tend to be more  		politically, financially, and technically feasible. </p>
<p>Overall, state officials have to balance a variety of issues as they  		decide what financing strategies are most suitable and sustainable given a  		states resources and constraints. Discussions with state officials point  		to the following issues as critical in their decision-making process: </p>
<ul><li><b><i>Finding a process for re-directing expenditures away from  		  residential treatment services and toward community alternatives, coupled with  		  careful management of access to beds in both RTCs and in-patient psychiatric  		  hospitals</i></b>. Programs in Wisconsin, New York, and other states illustrate  		  the financial benefits of ensuring that community services are both available  		  to and used by all agencies that serve children in order to avoid unnecessary  		  out-of-home placements and payments for services that have little evidence of  		  effectiveness. In sites such as Wraparound Milwaukee and Kids Oneida,  		  traditional models of intervention, such as removing a child from the home, are  		  no longer viewed by court judges or most mental health professionals as the  		  treatment of choice for children with SED because other, evidence-based  		  treatment options are available. The key challenge for states is to develop  		  administrative and tracking mechanisms that shift the emphasis from paying for  		  out-of-home placements to supporting a range of home and community  		  services.</li>
<li><b><i>Devising an administrative structure that supports equitable  		  sharing of service costs among all or most state and local level agencies that  		  serve children, including Medicaid, mental health, child welfare, juvenile  		  justice, and education</i></b>. Cost-sharing arrangements can be implemented at  		  several levels. For example, at the local level, a designated agency can  		  receive funds from multiple agencies to support services provided to selected  		  children with SED. In some states, such as Vermont, legislation supports the  		  development of individual care plans that specify which agency (mental health,  		  child welfare, juvenile justice, or special education) will pay for which  		  services. In still other states, local agency staff meet regularly to ensure  		  that needed services are covered for designated children; these local teams can  		  be supported by state level counterparts to find ways to pay for specialized  		  services not otherwise covered (for example, the Coordinated Childrens  		  Services Initiative in New York).</li>
<li><b><i>Developing financing strategies that promote flexibility in  		  supporting IPCs</i></b>. One of the major challenges in financing home and  		  community services for youth with SED is paying for the particular combination  		  of services that each individual requires. Because each funding source covers  		  some needed services but not others, state officials in most states have to  		  find different means for combining funding sources for each child depending on  		  his or her needs. However, discussions with officials in some states (e.g.,  		  Indiana, New York, and Wisconsin) suggest that case-rates are especially useful  		  in promoting flexibility in service planning. Case-rates mean that dollars can  		  be used to purchase a wide range of individual, family, and community services  		  to help the child reach specific outcomes. </li>
<li><b><i>Establishing procedures that do not remove or dilute local or  		  state responsibility for higher levels of care. </i></b>Ideally, local agencies  		  should arrange for the care of youth with SED who live in their jurisdiction.  		  In many cases, this means that counties contribute to a share of the costs--to  		  the state Medicaid match, for example. But policies that obligate counties to  		  cover a portion of the costs for community or home services but not for  		  residential care bring financial disincentives to improving access to community  		  services. If county governments are asked to share responsibility for community  		  services, it makes sense to ask them to share responsibility for residential  		  care as well, but there is, understandably, often a great deal of political  		  resistance from localities on this point.</li>
<li><b><i>Providing children with SED access to intensive services even  		  if their families are not Medicaid eligible</i></b>. One of the principle  		  advantages of the HCBS waivers is that they allow states to waive  		  Medicaids deeming rules, as does the Katie Beckett provision in the TEFRA  		  legislation. Several state officials emphasized the importance of this  		  particular component of the waiver because it allows states to: (1) cover  		  high-risk and uninsured or inadequately insured children who would not  		  otherwise have access to mental health services; and (2) ensure that families  		  do not have to relinquish custody of a child with SED solely to obtain  		  intensive mental health services. </li>
<li><b><i>Enhancing policy coordination among agencies and institutions  		  that serve children</i></b>. Discussions with state officials suggest that  		  sustainable improvements in the financing of services for children with SED  		  will not occur in the absence of a strong commitment to policy coordination by  		  all key child-serving agencies and institutions. In many states, this  		  commitment began and was sustained through legislation mandating interagency  		  collaboration. In addition, efforts to engage the leadership of RTCs in  		  discussions of new community-based models of care have increased at both the  		  federal and state levels. In particular, officials in several of the states in  		  this study have supported workshops and conferences with directors of  		  residential settings to ensure that their perspectives are taken into account  		  and that they are made aware of the rationale behind reform agendas as new  		  financing strategies are developed and implemented. </li>
<li><b><i>Finding providers of nontraditional services in areas where  		  such providers are in short supply.</i></b> Several directors noted a serious  		  Catch-22 in the development of comprehensive community service  		  systems: States cannot pay for these services because there are no  		  organizations to provide them, and the organizations do not exist because there  		  is no money to support them. Building provider capacity appears to be one of  		  the most difficult challenges facing state officials. Some officials indicated  		  that, in theory, a part of the provider capacity problem could be addressed by  		  re-training staff of RTCs and enlisting the cooperation of residential programs  		  to diversify the type of services they offer, including home and community  		  services. The clinical and administrative leaders of these facilities have  		  considerable experience in treating children with SED; furthermore, in most  		  states that are moving to home and community care, the number and bed capacity  		  of residential facilities are likely to decrease as home and community services  		  expand. The experienced staff who leave their positions as a result of this  		  restructuring can act as a natural labor pool for states that can give these  		  qualified individuals an opportunity to apply their skills in a community  		  setting.</li>
</ul><p>The findings from this study have three major implications for  		policymakers concerned with improving mental health services to youth with  		SED.</p>
<p>First, sustained improvements in financing intensive home and community  		services for youth with SED depend on the development of effective partnerships  		between key agencies at the state and local levels. The state descriptions in  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>, <a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>, and  		<a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#appendC">Appendix C</a> provide substantial evidence that the  		financing of these services is more effective when agencies work together in  		new ways. </p>
<p>In some cases, the key partnership was between the state mental health  		department and the Medicaid agency. Medicaid programs in every state now pay  		for a considerable portion of mental health services for children, especially  		for youth with SED, but mental health agencies have the experience necessary to  		manage clinical care, certify providers, and assess service quality. The  		resources of both agencies are therefore needed to support initiatives that  		provide appropriate and cost-effective services. Child welfare, juvenile  		justice and education agencies also are critical partners, because they control  		many behavioral health resources and serve the majority of children needing  		mental health services and supports.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the states in the appendices include numerous  		examples of initiatives--often mandated by state legislation--that bring these  		different agencies together on behalf of youth with SED. Because the same  		children are often served by several agencies, interagency coordination makes  		fiscal sense; from a state perspective, however, the challenge is to ensure  		that the process of collaboration does not threaten the budget of any single  		agency but leads instead to an equitable distribution of financial  		responsibility across the agencies. From a federal perspective, the challenge  		is to ensure that legislation that may directly affect one system or one  		funding source (for example, Medicaid) does not unintentionally create barriers  		to interagency agreements at the state level.</p>
<p>The second implication involves the impact of prior demonstration  		projects funded under the original CASSP program, the current Comprehensive  		Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program, or  		other foundation-sponsored initiatives. These efforts spawned demonstration  		projects in virtually every state, and officials in most of the study states  		noted that the roots of current initiatives often lay in the experience gained  		during the implementation and operation of these projects. In many cases,  		individuals who were involved in early projects moved into leadership roles in  		subsequent initiatives. This observation suggests that the demonstration  		projects authorized by the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act (Public Law 109-171) will  		provide important opportunities not only to strengthen the financing of  		community services for youth with SED in selected states but also to develop a  		new generation of leaders whose experience can have enduring effects on the  		field. </p>
<p>Finally, the study findings suggest that more states would be interested  		in applying for an HCBS waiver for youth with SED if the criteria for  		documenting budget neutrality were linked to PRTFs rather than to psychiatric  		hospitalization alone. In most states, very few children now enter psychiatric  		hospitals, and even fewer stay for long periods of time. Because most states  		are spending comparatively little on psychiatric hospitalization for children,  		they will not save many dollars, if any, by substituting intensive home or  		community-based services for treatment in these hospitals. Rather, the savings  		for state and federal Medicaid agencies will come from decreasing current use  		of residential treatment facilities by replacing that treatment with effective  		and less costly home and community care, which could be available to enhance  		home and community services for youth with SED.</p>

<h3><a name="appendA-NJ" id="appendA-NJ">Comprehensive Statewide Reform Of  		Child Mental Health Services: New Jersey</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>Child advocates in New Jersey have long identified the need for  		fundamental reform of the states system of care for children with  		behavioral and emotional disturbances. Before 1999, services for children with  		serious emotional disturbances (SED) were largely uncoordinated. For example,  		the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), New Jerseys child  		welfare agency, provided funding for some intensive mental health  		services--including residential services--for children in state custody, and  		the Division of Mental Health Services (DMHS) and the Division of Medical  		Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS, the state Medicaid agency) provided  		funding for community and residential services for children not in state  		custody. None of these agencies had the authority to coordinate services to  		support children with intensive needs in the community. Moreover, there were no  		high-intensity, community services that would have otherwise allowed children  		with SED to remain at home while being treated. </p>
<p>In 1999, however, the commissioner of the Department of Human Services  		(DHS) initiated a major reform of New Jerseys child mental health system  		by establishing a steering committee comprising directors of DYFS, DMHS, and  		DMAHS as well as other executives such as the DHS chief fiscal officer. The  		committee was charged with developing plans for a coordinated system of care  		that would increase funding to expand community services statewide and broaden  		the target population to include children with a range of mental health service  		needs. </p>
<p>In January 2000, the steering committee published a concept paper  		outlining the DHSs vision of fundamental structural reform of the  		states system of care for children with emotional and behavioral  		disorders. The cornerstone of the reform was the Childrens Initiative, a  		community-based system of care that would bring together the once disparate  		child welfare, mental health, juvenile justice, and education systems as the  		means to maintaining and strengthening whenever possible the ties between  		children, families, and communities. To achieve this goal, the initiative  		would incorporate two basic principles: (1) all child-serving divisions within  		DHS will use a common screening and assessment process for determining service  		needs; and (2) regardless of the point at which children enter the public  		mental health system, they will have the same access to coordinated, community  		services. </p>
<p>While the Childrens Initiative was being implemented, a  		childrens rights advocacy group filed a class action lawsuit against  		DYFS, alleging that DHS was failing children in the state foster care system.  		New Jersey settled the lawsuit in 2004 by agreeing to a plan for child welfare  		reform that required the state to restructure DYFS, improve coordination and  		collaboration among child-serving systems, and develop community resources for  		children in the welfare system.</p>
<p>As part of the reforms related to the lawsuit, New Jersey passed  		legislation creating a new Office of Child Services (OCS) within DHS charged  		with implementing the child welfare reform plan. (The head of OCS, a deputy  		commissioner, reports directly to the commissioner of DHS.) The legislation  		also placed DYFS under the OCS and moved responsibility for the Childrens  		Initiative from a planning division within DHS to a new Division of Child  		Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS) within OCS. The DCBHS was also given  		responsibility for managing mental and behavioral health services for children  		with SED, a move intended to ensure the coordination across multiple  		child-serving agencies, including child welfare.</p>
<p><b>Expanding Community Services Through the Medicaid Rehabilitation  		Option</b></p>
<p>New Jersey opted to reform its childrens mental health system by  		using the Medicaid rehabilitation option because it wanted not only to enact  		system-wide reforms but also to develop a community-based system of care that  		would serve all children with mental health problems, including, but not  		limited to, those with intensive, high-end needs. The state also expanded use  		of the early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment program to  		provide mental health services for children under the age of 21, which allows  		it to provide screening and assessment services for children with a variety of  		mental health needs.</p>
<p>In January 2001, New Jersey selected ValueOptions, a contracted system  		administrator (CSA) to serve as the single point of entry into the mental  		health system for most children with mental health needs. The CSA conducts or  		arranges for a needs assessment for each child and provides a critical level of  		utilization review to ensure that children receive the services identified in  		the assessment. It provides the state with administrative support for the child  		mental health system without assuming any risk for the services it authorizes.  		</p>
<p>Children with SED are referred to the CSA from a variety of sources,  		including the child welfare system, the juvenile justice or mental health  		system, or the family. The CSA then either formally assesses a childs  		needs or helps the family secure an assessment with a community provider that  		is certified to conduct such assessments. In the former case, the CSA uses a  		standard instrument to determine the level of care each child needs, refers the  		family to providers in the community for community or residential treatment  		services, and assists the family in developing a coordinated plan of care if  		needed. The CSA does not manage admissions to acute care hospitals or access to  		outpatient day treatment services. </p>
<p>Children at risk of out-of-home placement are referred by the CSA to a  		care management organization (CMO). Created as part of the states reform  		plan, CMOs are local, private, nonprofit entities developed specifically to  		serve children with complex, multi-system needs. Using a child-family-team  		model, CMOs support the development of individualized service plans and provide  		intensive case management services. CMOs submit a plan of care to the CSA,  		which reviews the plan to ensure that it addresses the childs needs and,  		if so, then authorizes the services in the plan. The CSA also reassesses  		children regularly to determine the effectiveness of services, change the plan  		accordingly, and monitor provider performance. Currently, CMOs serve about  		2,900 children. CMOs are now operating in all but two of the New Jerseys  		15 service areas. Two more CMOs will be operational by January 2006.</p>
<p>In addition, CMOs are required by contract to partner with family  		support organizations, which are parent-run organizations that provide peer  		support, sponsor youth partnerships, and conduct outreach to contact families  		and help them apply for Medicaid and New Jersey Family Care, the states  		child health insurance program. State officials view the family support  		organizations as critical to the new system, and the state can claim Medicaid  		administrative dollars for outreach activities conducted by these  		organizations. In state fiscal year 2005, these organizations served 1,306  		children and their families. </p>
<p><i><b>Financing Issues</b></i></p>
<p>New Jersey uses several approaches to financing the structural reforms  		to its child mental health service system. In 2001, the state began to draw  		down federal Medicaid dollars for services covered under its expanded  		rehabilitation option, including group home and home treatment services as well  		as intensive case management--services that previously were not available or  		were covered by state funds alone. New Jersey uses remaining state funds to  		support other community programs and to provide flexible funding for a variety  		of wraparound services (e.g., mentoring) that are not reimbursable through  		Medicaid. The state disperses these funds to CMOs, youth case management  		agencies, and mobile response and stabilization management agencies. Each CMO,  		which provides the most intensive level of care coordination, for example,  		receives approximately $500,000 per year for wraparound services and community  		development activities.</p>
<p>In addition, New Jersey identified services previously supported solely  		with state dollars that could be considered part of the Medicaid state plan.  		This allowed the state to secure federal funding for services that it had  		provided to children before 2001 for which it had not claimed the federal  		match. New Jersey used these freed dollars as seed money to build  		the infrastructure for new community services across the state. </p>
<p>In the first year of reform, New Jersey financed its share of Medicaid  		costs by combining $167 million in existing state dollars for children with SED  		from the child welfare and mental health divisions (including $117 million  		which was previously expended by DYFS on residential care) with $39 million in  		new funds authorized for children with SED in the governors 2001 budget.  		</p>
<p>CMOs arrange for children with SED to receive services listed in their  		individual service plans from community providers. Providers bill Medicaid  		directly, and Medicaid reimburses them only for services authorized by the CSA.  		This mechanism serves a check on the system insofar as only CSA-authorized  		services are provided. The CMOs receive a fee-for-service rate for the care  		management services they provide to children with SED. </p>
<p>To assist children who are exhibiting behaviors that may disrupt their  		living arrangements, New Jersey created 24-hour mobile response and  		stabilization providers, which offer immediate (within one hour of dispatch)  		in-home interventions. Mobile response and stabilization providers are  		responsible for providing care for the first 72 hours of the response. They can  		also (as needed) develop, and oversee the implementation of, a stabilization  		plan for up to eight weeks to ensure that children are linked to appropriate  		ongoing services and supports. These providers are reimbursed either by  		Medicaid or the state, depending on whether the child is Medicaid eligible.  		Either way, the reimbursement amount is the same, which ensures that services  		are provided equitably and without regard to insurance status. Private insurers  		pay for a small fraction of the services offered by these providers. </p>
<p><i><b>The Role of Residential Care </b></i></p>
<p>According to state officials, New Jersey had too few in-state  		residential care beds as well as too few home and community service  		alternatives to residential treatment before the DCBHS initiative. As a result,  		many children were placed in out-of-state residential settings. In 1999, 2.2  		million children lived in New Jersey, but there were only 797 in-state  		residential treatment center beds, 369 group-home beds, 450 treatment-home  		beds, and 145 psychiatric community-residence beds. The state also maintained  		40 beds at a psychiatric hospital for children. Since the initiative began, the  		state has reduced the number of psychiatric hospital beds to 18 and is  		currently in the process of closing the psychiatric hospital completely because  		it is required to do so under the DYFS lawsuit. </p>
<p>Although the psychiatric hospital is closing, New Jersey is adding  		residential capacity throughout the level-of-care continuum. This effort  		includes funding additional beds in family-like settings in the community. The  		state also is working to shorten out-of-home stays, thus allowing more children  		to be served within the existing system of residential facilities. </p>
<p>Spending on residential care has increased over the past five years  		because New Jersey has provided services to more children, expanded the  		capacity of the residential system to meet the need, supported the provision of  		specialized in-state services in lieu of sending children out of state, and  		raised the reimbursement it pays facilities. However, growth in spending for  		community services has dramatically outpaced growth in spending for residential  		care, meaning that residential care now constitutes a smaller fraction of the  		overall budget for childrens mental health than it did before New Jersey  		implemented system reforms (60 percent instead of 90 percent). State officials,  		however, believe that the amount spent on residential care, while a significant  		improvement, remains too high.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned </b></p>
<ul><li><i>Support from the New Jersey legislature, the governor, and the  		  commissioner of DHS was essential to implementing major structural reforms to  		  the states child mental health system.</i></li>
</ul><p>New Jersey was able to make major structural reforms to its system of  		care for children with SED for two reasons: (1) the governor and the  		commissioner of DHS were willing to re-direct state dollars once spent largely  		on residential treatment in the child welfare system to developing the  		infrastructure for a community-based mental health service system and to  		funding an expanded array of community services; and (2) with the  		governors encouragement, the state legislature appropriated additional  		funds to support DCBHS activities and approved an expansion of the state  		Medicaid plan.</p>
<p>While a strong local economy allowed the state to invest new resources  		in 2000 and 2001, according to state officials, current fiscal constraints have  		made it harder for New Jersey to implement major reforms. State officials cite  		two such barriers in particular. First, they note that major reforms hinge on  		the ability to invest new federal funds in the infrastructure needed to support  		community services, but new federal dollars are difficult to identify in the  		current fiscal climate. Furthermore, the ability to reinvest all or most of the  		state dollars saved from more efficient use of existing payment methods is  		critical to a major statewide reform effort, but again this strategy is less  		feasible when state Medicaid budgets are extremely tight. Second, they believe  		that the leadership in the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  		is currently more focused on cost savings than service expansion and therefore  		would be reluctant to support major system reforms. </p>
<ul><li><i>By pooling state and federal dollars, New Jersey has been able to  		  provide more appropriate and timely services (including intensive and  		  nontraditional community services in addition to residential treatment) in more  		  settings to more children and their families, regardless of illness severity or  		  insurance status. </i></li>
</ul><p>Over the past five years, New Jersey has substantially reformed its  		child mental health system such that it now provides a continuum of services to  		children with varying levels of mental health needs. Children with SED now have  		access a variety of high-intensity, flexible services in the community in  		addition to residential treatment options. Children with less severe mental  		health problems have access to traditional treatment and preventive services  		that can preclude the need for residential care and support children in their  		homes after they are discharged from residential treatment. State officials  		hope these services will allow them to treat less severe mental health problems  		early, preventing the onset of more serious problems or the escalation of  		current ones. </p>
<p>New Jersey has supplemented (rather than replaced) traditional  		residential treatment with community-based residential care and in-home  		services for children with SED, and overall has reduced admissions and lengths  		of stay in residential care settings. Local mental health agencies,  		community-based providers, and regional CMOs now provide home and community  		services to children once served in distant residential treatment  		facilities.</p>
<p>According to state officials, New Jerseys ability to pool state  		and federal dollars has opened the door to an expanded access to an array of  		mental health services to more children in both community and residential  		settings than before the reforms were implemented. State officials expect the  		budget for childrens mental health services to continue to grow as more  		children with mental health needs are identified and referred for timely and  		appropriate treatment. </p>
<ul><li><i>New Jersey opted to reform its childrens mental health  		  system using the Medicaid rehabilitation option because it allowed the state to  		  develop a continuum of services that would be commensurate with a range of  		  mental health needs statewide; the home and community-based services (HCBS)  		  waiver was perceived as being too administratively burdensome and inconsistent  		  with the goal of serving all children in need, in all areas of the  		  state.</i></li>
</ul><p>New Jersey opted to reform its childrens mental health system by  		using the Medicaid rehabilitation option instead of an HCBS waiver because it  		wanted to enact system-wide reforms and to develop a community-based system of  		care that would serve all children with mental health problems, not just those  		who would otherwise be placed in a psychiatric institution (as required under  		an HCBS waiver). State officials felt the services covered under the  		rehabilitation option were sufficiently comprehensive to allow the state to  		meet the needs of children with SED and their families, without the added  		administrative burden required to apply for and operate an HCBS waiver. The  		rehabilitation option, however, does not allow New Jersey to use federal  		Medicaid funds to support services for children with SED who are not eligible  		for Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Program. Services for these  		children are financed using state dollars.</p>
<h3><a name="appendA-NM" id="appendA-NM">Comprehensive Statewide Reform of  		Child Mental Health Services: New Mexico</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>During the last several years, New Mexico has made steady progress in  		replacing an ineffective behavioral health care system with a single statewide  		system that will braid funds and expertise from a variety of state agencies to  		provide behavioral health care services to children with serious emotional  		disturbances (SED), among other needy groups of people. Salud!, the original  		statewide managed care system launched under a 1915(b) Medicaid waiver,  		involved contracts with three managed care organizations (MCOs), each of which  		was required to provide primary care as well as mental health and substance  		abuse services to Medicaid-eligible children and families.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteA1">1</a></font></sup> By 1999, there was widespread  		dissatisfaction with the behavioral health care component of the system.  		According to several reports, the system was seriously fragmented as a result  		of several administrative layers, multiple funding streams, and a variety of  		service definitions, data systems, billing processes, and oversight  		mechanisms.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteA2">2</a></font></sup> The  		reports noted evidence of waning access to mental health treatment and an  		absence of home and community services, especially for high-need populations  		such as children with SED and their families. </p>
<p>The main impetus for reform came in 2003, when Bill Richardson, the  		newly elected governor, instructed all agencies in New Mexico that deliver or  		fund behavioral health related services to work together to create a single  		purchasing collaborative that would establish a cohesive behavioral health  		service delivery system focused on recovery and resiliency. The report from the  		Presidents New Freedom Commission on Mental Health provided additional  		support for New Mexicos reform efforts. These forces culminated in the  		Behavioral Health Design Work Group, created in October 2003 and comprising  		representatives from all the agencies in New Mexico that deliver or fund  		behavioral health-related services potentially affected by a purchasing  		collaborative. Chaired by the Secretary of the Human Services Department (HSD)  		and co-chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Health (DOH), the work  		group began meeting in late 2003 to gather stakeholder input on program design  		issues. </p>
<p>During the 2004 New Mexico legislative session, House Bill 271<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteA3">3</a></font></sup> was passed and signed into law  		by Governor Richardson. This legislation established two new groups: the  		Behavioral Health Planning Council and the Interdepartmental Behavioral Health  		Purchasing Collaborative (IBHPC). </p>
<p>Staffed by the DOH and the Children, Youth and Families Department  		(CYFD), the planning council includes gubernatorial appointees (consumers,  		family members, providers, advocates, state agency representatives, and  		others), no more than 49 percent of whom can be providers or state agency  		representatives. The councils mission is to provide input into the  		states behavioral health service delivery system.</p>
<p>The IBHPC, chaired by the Secretary of Human Services with rotating  		co-chairmanship by the Secretaries of the DOH and CYFD, includes staff from all  		state agencies that oversee mental health and substance abuse-related programs  		(17 in total).<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteA4">4</a></font></sup> The  		goals of the IBHPC include: (1) identifying behavioral health needs statewide;  		(2) conducting an inventory of all the states behavioral health and  		substance abuse services; (3) planning, designing, and directing a statewide  		behavioral health system; and (4) contracting with a behavioral health  		organization to provide services throughout the state. </p>
<p>In its April 2004 concept paper, New Mexico Interagency Behavioral  		Health Purchasing Collaborative, the IBHPC recommended a fundamental  		restructuring of the states behavioral health system by establishing a  		single statewide entity to administer the states mental health and  		substance abuse programs. New Mexico considered, but rejected, implementing a  		home and community-based service waiver (HCBS) mainly because the states  		overall goal was to redesign the entire behavioral health system <i>not</i>  		implement incremental changes that would affect a limited number of  		individuals. </p>
<p>In fall 2004, New Mexico released a request for proposals in search of  		this entity and in the spring of 2005 awarded a contract to ValueOptions of New  		Mexico. On July 1, 2005, New Mexico officially made the transition to a single  		behavioral health service delivery system.</p>
<p>New Mexico conceptualizes its structural reforms in three phases: July  		1, 2005 to June 30, 2006; July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2008; and July 1, 2008  		onward. During each phase, the state expects the system to mature as additional  		funding streams are braided in, data systems are refined, local system-of-care  		collaboratives become stronger, additional unmet needs are fulfilled, and  		performance outcome measures are refined.</p>
<p><b>Creating A Single Behavioral Health Service Delivery System</b></p>
<p><i><b>Administrative Structure</b></i></p>
<p>The IBHPC has primary authority over statewide behavioral health reform  		in New Mexico. Operating as a board of directors, the IBHPC is responsible for  		overseeing the ValueOptions contract such that behavioral heath services are  		readily available throughout the state. The planning council serves as an  		advisory group to the IBHPC and reports annually to the governor and the  		legislature on the adequacy of behavioral health services throughout the state.  		The council consists of standing subcommittees, one of which focuses on  		children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Another component of New Mexicos reform was the creation of  		local collaboratives, which are based on a system of care model;  		there is one in each of the 13 judicial districts in the state and at least  		three more for Native Americans. Operated by community members (such as  		consumers, families, advocates, providers, and representatives of tribes,  		juvenile and adult corrections agencies, child welfare, and schools), the local  		collaboratives are responsible for identifying unmet needs in particular areas,  		developing plans and programs to address these needs, and evaluating the  		quality of services provided through the programs.</p>
<p>At the state level, DOH is responsible for nonMedicaid adult mental  		health and substance abuse services and prevention; HSD is responsible for  		Medicaid-funded behavioral health services for children, adults, and seniors;  		and CYFD is responsible for nonMedicaid eligible children and for funding of  		nonMedicaid covered services for Medicaid eligible children. Several other  		state agencies operate programs that fill in gaps, particularly in substance  		abuse services. </p>
<p>Overall, New Mexicos statewide behavioral health reform is  		intended to provide a seamless transition from the old system to the new.  		Children who previously qualified financially (and clinically) for behavioral  		health services still qualify under the reform system. Children with SED remain  		a priority in the state, as evidenced by concerted efforts to ensure that this  		population has access to behavioral health services, including community-based  		care. </p>
<p><i><b>Financing Issues</b></i></p>
<p>Funds for the single behavioral health service delivery system in New  		Mexico will be braided from the various state agencies that now purchase  		behavioral health services. First-year funds are to top out at approximately  		$350 million in state and federal dollars. In the second year, additional  		funding streams from the various agencies will be added to significantly  		increase the total fund. ValueOptions will manage the entire behavioral health  		system on a risk-based basis through capitation, fee-for-service, and other  		strategies. The IBHPC will work with ValueOptions to make the individual  		funding streams as flexible as possible within federal or state constraints.  		The following monies will be braided for child services: </p>
<ul><li>HSD funds reserved for Medicaid mental health and substance abuse  		  services for children.</li>
<li>DOH federal mental health and substance abuse block grants and  		  general funds for community services for children.</li>
<li>CYFD, DOH and HSD funds for school-based behavioral health  		  services.</li>
<li>CYFD general funds for children and for non-Medicaid covered services  		  for Medicaid eligible children.</li>
<li>Flexible funding from CYFD, also known as the wraparound  		  fund.</li>
</ul><p>From July 2005 to January 2006, the behavioral health service package  		will include services previously covered under New Mexicos Medicaid plan  		(e.g., outpatient services, residential treatment, in-patient care, and case  		management) and the enhanced services previously offered under the states  		Medicaid managed care program (e.g., behavioral health respite, intensive  		outpatient services, in-home services, including multisystemic therapy,  		functional family therapy, and wraparound services). During these six months,  		ValueOptions will evaluate the effectiveness of these services and assess  		payment rates to determine whether changes are required.</p>
<p>Under the emerging system, eligibility will be based on a combination of  		financial eligibility, federal and state mandates, and the needs of individuals  		and their families. As specified in its contract, ValueOptions must ensure that  		all mandatory or entitled populations are served and that all mandated services  		are available.</p>
<p>Even before the statewide reforms took effect, New Mexico made important  		strides in covering mental health services for children. For example, the  		states childrens health insurance program (SCHIP) covers children  		through age 18 in families with an income up to 235 percent of the federal  		poverty level. New Mexico also uses the SCHIP presumptive eligibility option to  		extend limited Medicaid coverage to certain individuals from the time a  		qualified provider determines that the individuals income does not exceed  		the eligibility threshold until a formal determination of eligibility is made  		by the Medicaid agency.</p>
<p>In addition to these actions, New Mexico has taken advantage of the  		Medicaid family of one category (Category 32), through which  		certain children can become eligible for Medicaid based solely on their own (as  		opposed to family) income. If a childs condition warrants short-term  		placement in a residential treatment center (RTC), New Mexico uses flexible  		state general funds to pay for services for up to 30 days. This mechanism helps  		to keep families united because parents do not have to give up custody of their  		children in order to access necessary residential mental health services. </p>
<p><i><b>The Role of Residential Care </b></i></p>
<p>In New Mexico, residential care continues to play a key role in the  		service system for residents with mental illness issues. New Mexico is home to  		a variety of RTCs ranging from group homes to nonaccredited and accredited  		facilities. Some are private nonprofit, and some are private for profit. All  		RTCs are licensed and certified by the CYFD. </p>
<p>Under New Mexicos old behavioral health system, providers were  		required to obtain prior approval from the MCOs (or from CYFD for  		fee-for-service populations) for RTC admissions and continued stays. However,  		it was fairly easy for a child to gain access to an RTC, according to one state  		official. Furthermore, there was little coordination between providers or  		child-serving agencies in general in terms of determining a childs  		appropriate level of care.</p>
<p>In 1997, when New Mexico introduced managed care, there were about 1,200  		RTC beds in the state. Four years later, that number dropped to about 600, a 50  		percent reduction. Since that time, the number of beds has remained relatively  		stable. According to a state official, New Mexico does not expect the statewide  		behavioral system redesign to lead to another significant reduction in the  		number of RTC beds. However, the state feels that it will rely less and less on  		RTC beds as the emphasis in care shifts to keeping children in their homes and  		in their communities. For example, under the redesigned system, judges will be  		able to refer children with SED to a range of treatment programs and services,  		not just RTCs.</p>
<p>According to one official, state efforts to engage RTC leadership in its  		redesign efforts have been met with mixed success. Although New Mexico has  		tried to convince RTC providers: (1) of the value and effectiveness of home and  		community services; and (2) that the services will work as intended by keeping  		families together, few RTCs have expressed interest in developing a diversified  		product line (e.g., respite services or community-based crisis prevention  		services). </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>New Mexicos statewide behavioral health care system was  		  created by the twin forces of visionary political leadership and the widespread  		  perception of an inadequate public mental health service system.</i> </li>
</ul><p>New Mexicos commitment to reforming its behavioral health system  		is evidenced in: (1) the governors willingness to champion creative  		solutions to the critical problems around access to and quality of behavioral  		health services; and (2) legislative action to create a statewide behavioral  		health delivery system supported financially by multiple agencies. The new  		system officially began in July 2005, so it is too early to assess its impact.  		However, there is reason to be optimistic insofar as the new system involved  		key players at the state and local level, and has broad support statewide. </p>
<p>Financing of the new system rests on the states ability to braid  		dollars from various funding streams and state agencies. The state has hired a  		single entity, ValueOptions of New Mexico, to manage the distribution of  		resources. ValueOptions also will develop uniform service definitions, standard  		eligibility determination processes, and comprehensive data systems needed for  		effective resource management and patient tracking. The contractor will also  		aim to promote services, such as home and community care, that will minimize  		use of high-cost inpatient or residential treatment settings. </p>
<ul><li><i>New Mexico did not implement a HCBS waiver for two reasons: it did  		  not think the it could show budget neutrality, and its overall goal was to  		  redesign the entire behavioral health system rather than to implement  		  incremental changes that would affect a limited number of individuals.  		  </i></li>
</ul><p>New Mexico opted to reform its behavioral health system using a  		purchasing collaborative instead of a HCBS waiver because it wanted to enact  		system-wide reforms to better coordinate behavioral health services for all  		individuals with mental illness in the state, not just a specific group of  		high-need children. Furthermore, although New Mexico realizes the benefits of  		the HCBS waiver, in-patient psychiatric stays are typically quite short  		(usually five to seven days). As a result, New Mexico officials did not think  		they would have sufficient data to show budget neutrality. Moreover, New  		Mexicos new system should enable the state to accomplish the same goals  		associated with an HCBS waiver, according to a state official. For example, the  		new system will encourage the use of home and community services and greater  		accountability through performance measurement. </p>
<ul><li><i>Before the states reform efforts, there was a noticeable  		  absence of innovative programs for children with SED. </i></li>
</ul><p>According to a state official, the MCOs that provided Medicaid-funded  		behavioral health services were not focused on developing home and community  		services as an alternative to psychiatric in-patient and residential treatment.  		The state had not applied the Medicaid rehabilitation option to mental health  		services for children. Furthermore, although New Mexico had a system of care  		grant in the mid 1990s, it was not sustained. Overall, the long-standing  		absence of innovation in services for children with SED made the need for major  		reform more urgent but has left the state with little experience in and few  		resources for actually implementing, managing, and coordinating home and  		community services for youth with SED. </p>

<h3><a name="appendB-IN" id="appendB-IN">The Home And Community-Based  		Service Waiver in Indiana</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>Indiana has been committed to expanding home and community services for  		youth with serious emotional disturbances (SED) and their families since 1994,  		when the state started covering mental health services for Medicaid-enrolled  		children through the Medicaid rehabilitation option. In the late 1990s, the  		Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) in the Family and Social  		Services Administration (FSSA) began providing counties with seed funding and  		technical assistance to develop local system-of-care programs that would  		further expand community services for youth with SED. </p>
<p>In 1995, the state legislature passed a bill giving Indianas 31  		private nonprofit community mental health centers (CMHCs) authority over  		admissions to the states six public psychiatric hospitals, which have a  		total of approximately 90 beds for children and adolescents. Each CMHC is  		allocated a certain number of beds, depending on the size of its catchment area  		population. Subsequent legislation, passed in 2001, expanded the CMHCs  		responsibilities to monitoring the hospital stay, case management, discharge  		planning, and follow-up services. CMHCs do not, however, have authority over  		admissions to psychiatric residential treatment facilities. Rather, children  		are referred to these facilities by physicians, private and public mental  		health providers (including CMHCs), families, and staff in child welfare  		agencies, juvenile justice agencies, and schools. The facilities are licensed  		under the authority of the Division of Family Resources (formerly the Division  		of Family and Children) in the FSSA.</p>
<p>In 1997, two federally funded system-of-care (SOC) projects were  		launched: the Dawn Project in Marion County and Circle Around Families in Lake  		County. Because the federal grants ended and funds are no longer available,  		both projects now receive support from state and local resources. Choices,  		Inc., a nonprofit administrative services organization, manages the Dawn  		Project, which is described in more detail below.</p>
<p>As of 2000, the DMHA began offering funding to additional localities to  		develop SOC programs. By 2005, 32 single and multicounty SOC sites covered  		about half of Indianas 92 counties. Each site receives about $50,000 per  		year in state funding for up to two years. In state fiscal year (SFY) 2004, the  		SOC sites reported serving 723 children, and by SFY 2005, 993 children were  		being served. The DMHA funds Choices to provide SOC sites with technical  		assistance, including information about evidence-based practices. </p>
<p>Despite its commitment to providing youth with SED with home and  		community mental health services, Indiana has discovered that some parents must  		relinquish custody of their children to access the mental health services  		appropriate for them. Although the state passed legislation in 2001 to prevent  		parents from giving up custody, it did not allocate funds to help parents pay  		for the services they need to keep their children at home safely. In response  		to this problem, Indiana began to look for ways to finance the intensive  		community services that would allow children to remain at home <i>and</i>  		receive appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>The state considered several options:</p>
<ul><li>Using provisions under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act  		  (TEFRA, known also as the Katie Beckett provision).</li>
<li>Expanding the Medicaid rehabilitation option.</li>
<li>Implementing a 1915(c) home and community-based service (HCBS) waiver  		  for youth with SED.</li>
</ul><p>The TEFRA provision appeared to be a good candidate because it allows  		the state to waive family income in determining a childs eligibility for  		Medicaid. However, it requires children to be designated as disabled according  		to the Social Security Administrations (SSA) definition of disability and  		does not allow the state to provide any services not included in the state  		Medicaid plan. Indiana rejected this option primarily because including new  		intensive services needed for youth with SED and other disabilities as an  		entitlement would be likely to raise Medicaid costs. The state also recognized  		how difficult it could be for many youth with SED to meet SSAs definition  		of disability.</p>
<p>The second option, expanding Medicaid rehabilitation services, also was  		seen as financially risky. Moreover, it would not allow the state to change the  		rule governing the use of the familys income in determining a  		childs Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>In the end, Indiana came to believe that an HCBS waiver would offer the  		greatest promise for improving access to intensive community services for  		children with SED because it had the potential to provide a means for: (1)  		offering specific services designed to prevent out-of-home placements of  		children with SED; (2) helping children to make the transition from a state  		hospital to their home; (3) waiving family income in determining Medicaid  		eligibility; and (4) controlling financial risk by controlling the number of  		children in the waiver. </p>
<p>To complete the application for a 1915(c) HCBS waiver, the state  		appointed a task force consisting of representatives from multiple agencies and  		groups, including child welfare, the state Department of Education, juvenile  		justice, the Indiana Council of Community Mental Health Centers, the Dawn  		Project, and advocacy and consumer organizations. The application, filed and  		approved in 2003, officially went into effect on February 1, 2004.</p>
<p>In January 2004, however, Indiana lost a major class-action lawsuit  		involving custody relinquishment, forcing the state to expand the number of  		psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). Before 2004, the  		states Medicaid plan did not cover services provided to children such  		facilities unless the children were wards of the state. Thus, parents who were  		unable to pay for residential care had to relinquish custody of their child if  		the child needed a residential level of care. As a result of the lawsuit, the  		state had to add coverage of PRTF services to its Medicaid state plan. This  		change has contributed to a rapid and continuing increase in the number of PRTF  		beds for children in the state. As of early 2005, there were 11 PRTFs in  		Indiana with a total bed capacity of 150, but state staff expect this number to  		increase substantially as new PRTFs are completed. </p>
<p>According to state officials, intensive community services that could be  		alternatives to residential and institutional care remain underdeveloped in  		many parts of the state, in part because children with SED typically have been  		placed in residential settings under the auspices of the juvenile justice,  		child welfare, and special education systems. Recent legal actions noted above  		have begun to change this pattern. Because funding for PRTF care is now  		reimbursed through Medicaid, more children with SED are being placed in these  		settings through mental health agencies. Nonetheless, the public mental health  		system still serves only a small percentage of children with SED.</p>
<p><b>The HCBS Waiver</b></p>
<p>Under Indianas HCBS waiver, children who would otherwise not be  		eligible for Medicaid can be enrolled in the program and provided with  		intensive services beyond those available through the standard Medicaid benefit  		package or the rehabilitation option if they are 4-19 years old and at high  		risk for placement into a state psychiatric hospital, as determined by clinical  		staff at a CMHC using the Institutional Level of Care instrument. Their  		families also must meet certain financial eligibility criteria. </p>
<p>The additional services available under the waiver include:</p>
<ul><li>Assistance in accessing wraparound services.</li>
<li>Respite care (only available if the child is using any other waver  		  service, that is, a child cannot receive only respite services).</li>
<li>Family support and training.</li>
<li>Independent skills training.</li>
</ul><p>In the first year that the waiver was implemented, Indiana expected to  		fill 50 slots distributed across ten counties varying in their experience with  		SOC programs. (Counties were chosen on a competitive basis.) However, only 30  		applications were completed in the first 15 months of operation (January 2004  		through March 2005), and only 20 children were enrolled in Medicaid under the  		waiver. Five of these children were transferred to out-of-state psychiatric  		hospitals. As of March 2005, three cases were closed because the children no  		longer met clinical eligibility criteria (i.e., their condition had improved to  		the extent that they could be treated through less intensive care). According  		to state officials, enrollment in the waiver program has been slower than  		expected primarily because of administrative barriers, such as the difficulty  		experienced by front line staff when they used the required management  		information system (discussed below) and delays in processing waiver  		applications at CMHCs.</p>
<p>Those who were enrolled in Medicaid through the HCBS waiver receive  		services as stipulated in the individual plans of care (IPCs) developed by the  		treatment team in conjunction with the child and family. Depending on the needs  		of the child, IPCs can change frequently and are formally revised every three  		months. </p>
<p>As a result of the waiver, members of family support organizations can  		be designated as SED providers, entitling them to be paid as mentors to engage,  		educate, and otherwise support families of enrolled children. This change has  		made family support and respite more available to many rural communities.</p>
<p>A key operational component of the HCBS waiver program is the Indiana  		In-Home Services Information Systems (INsite), a state-funded software package  		that is used to: (1) track children as they move through the mental heath  		system; and (2) develop and update IPCs. Indiana uses INsite for participants  		in all of the states waiver programs, including the waiver for youth with  		SED. </p>
<p>Despite the value of INsite, it was one of the major hurdles in  		implementing the HCBS waiver. For example, training staff in CMHCs to use  		INsite proved to be more challenging than anticipated because: (1) some case  		managers were unfamiliar with or had no access to computers; (2) some staff  		were reluctant to learn a new software program; (3) some CMHCs were unwilling  		to invest the resources required to ensure that staff could master the package;  		and (4) the person who used INsite to enroll a child in the program may not  		have had access to key information because he or she was not necessarily the  		childs case manager. This problem was especially prominent in larger  		counties where multiple staff were involved with the same family. According to  		state officials, some CMHC staff were frustrated because, given that INsite was  		designed to be used for people in all of the states waiver programs, only  		10-20 percent of the fields in the package were actually relevant to youth with  		SED. As a result, users had to wade through many irrelevant  		screens. </p>
<p>According to state officials, however, most of these problems have been  		resolved. All case managers now have access to computers (CMHCs purchased  		them), and designated staff in CMHCs were further trained in the use of INsite.  		However, the learning curve has been uneven throughout the state. Staff in  		counties in which few children have been referred to the waiver program  		continue to struggle with INsite because they have not used it often enough to  		have mastered it yet. </p>
<p>Overall, state officials note that the waiver has been more successfully  		implemented in rural systems of care than in the more developed and previously  		funded urban systems. For the rural areas, the waiver has provided a way to  		fund previously unavailable intensive community services. Several rural  		counties that do not now have waiver-enrolled children have expressed interest  		in offering waiver services when resources allow for expansion. </p>
<p><b>Financing Issues </b></p>
<p>In the original waiver application, Indiana estimated that: (1) the cost  		of Medicaid services for youth enrolled under the waiver would be about half  		the cost of care in state hospitals, which is about $23,000 per child per year;  		and (2) the services listed in IPCs would cost about $3,000 in any quarter, or  		about $12,000 annually. For the 20 children enrolled through March 2005,  		expenditures have been about twice the anticipated level. As of March 2005,  		state officials estimated that IPCs have been costing roughly $6,000 a quarter,  		which represents all Medicaid costs (including costs for physical health  		services) or approximately $24,000 a year. The average time of enrollment in  		the waiver program is 220 days, slightly longer than anticipated, which may  		explain some of the unexpectedly high costs. Approximately 70 percent of  		children enrolled through March were already on Medicaid. Most of the remaining  		children were covered by private insurance but had exhausted their mental  		health benefits. </p>
<p>Officials cautioned against drawing premature conclusions from the data,  		stressing the point that as enrollment grows, average costs and enrollment  		spells are likely to change. </p>
<p>The DMHA provides the majority of matching funds for the HCBS waiver,  		but other agencies play supportive roles. For example, as specified in a  		memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Department of Corrections (DOC)  		and the DMHA, DOC contributes $100,000 per year for as long as the HCBS waiver  		is in operation. The MOU between the DMHA and the Department of Education  		(DOE), however, does not specify DOEs contribution. According to state  		officials, DOE will refer children to the waiver program but its financial role  		will be limited. Furthermore, the child welfare agency has not yet contributed  		funds to support waiver services for children referred from child welfare  		offices. </p>
<p><b>Managing Access to Residential Care</b></p>
<p>As mentioned, Indiana covers PRTF services through the Medicaid state  		plan under the terms of a law-suit settlement in January 2004. Providers refer  		children to residential care, but Health Care Excel (HCE), an outside entity  		that has a contract with the state to administer its Medicaids Prior  		Authorization programs, makes the final decision regarding PRTF admissions.  		According to state officials, HCE is contractually obligated to perform prior  		authorization to ensure that the state pays only for services that are  		medically necessary, appropriate, and cost-effective.</p>
<p>When a provider refers a child to residential care, he or she must  		provide HCE with supporting documentation, including an intake assessment, a  		prior authorization request form, a certificate-of-need-for-admissions form, a  		physician history and physical results, a current in-patient treatment plan,  		physician progress notes, nursing notes from any in-patient treatment, and a  		physician letter recommending the child for residential placement. If HCE  		approves admission to residential care, the approval is back-dated to the date  		of the admission or to the date of the initial request.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>If HCE approves residential placement for a child, and the child is  		Medicaid eligible, Medicaid will pay for the treatment. Counties must pay the  		full amount of the state match of federal Medicaid dollars for PRTF services,  		and they usually use their child welfare dollars to do so. </p>
<p><b>The Dawn Project: An Example of a County-Based SOC Program</b></p>
<p>Launched in 1997, the Dawn Project in Marion County, Indiana (which  		includes Indianapolis) represents the states effort to coordinate  		services for children that are provided through multiple systems. A managed  		behavioral health carve-out for children with SED, the project is modeled on  		the Wraparound Milwaukee program. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported  		efforts to design the Dawn Project in the mid 1990s. </p>
<p>Since its inception, the Dawn Project has served more than 1,000 youth  		and families,<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB2">2</a></font></sup> blending  		funding from several sources, including the federal Substance Abuse and Mental  		Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), state departments of mental health and  		child welfare, and city and county agencies. The Dawn Project contracts with  		Indiana Behavioral Health Choices (Choices), a nonprofit entity, to manage  		childrens clinical and financial processes and to monitor outcomes.</p>
<p>For children referred by child welfare or juvenile court who are at risk  		of entering or who are in residential care, the Dawn charges a case-rate of  		$4,379 per child per month to provide mental health services. Another case-rate  		of $1,809 per member per month provides intensive community services for  		children identified by Indianapolis public schools. No residential services are  		involved in the second case-rate. For Medicaid-eligible children, Dawn bills  		Medicaid directly for services covered through Medicaid. Medicaid does not  		contribute to the per-member-per-month case rate.</p>
<p>Although the Dawn Project has been a good learning experience for the  		state mental health authorities and other counties, several factors limit the  		states ability to expand this model statewide. Most important, mental  		health services are largely county-organized in Indiana, and counties other  		than Marion County have little experience in managed behavioral health care.  		According to state officials, at least 100 youth must be enrolled in a managed  		care plan that uses a risk-based case rate if that plan is to be sustainable.  		Moreover, the development of a program in which services are integrated, as  		they are in the Dawn Project, requires sustained and effective collaboration  		among the leadership in several county agencies. </p>
<p>According to state officials, three SOC sites, are now seeking SAMHSA  		funding for a child mental health initiative grant, and two of them may work  		with Choices to implement a managed care program similar to the Dawn  		Project.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned </b></p>
<ul><li><i>Implementing an HCBS waiver requires a substantial amount of  		  administrative effort during the initial years. </i></li>
</ul><p>Indiana has faced several challenges in implementing the HCBS waiver,  		not the least of which was a large volume of administrative work. During the  		first year of implementation, there were long delays for many children between  		the initial application for waiver services and actual approval of the  		application (the shortest wait was about 35 days, and the longest was about  		three months). Other administrative challenges included high CMHC staff  		turnover, coordinating the activities of the person who enrolled a child in the  		waiver program with the person responsible for case management, and a lack of  		provider familiarity with the Medicaid enrollment and billing system. </p>
<ul><li><i>Unexpected legal challenges underscore the need for statewide  		  consensus on future directions</i>.</li>
</ul><p>When Indiana lost a major class-action lawsuit that involved custody  		relinquishment, the state was forced to add PRTF services to its Medicaid plan.  		This change engendered a rapid increase in the number of PRTF beds for  		children--a trend that is inconsistent with DMHAs interest in expanding  		community-based service systems as alternatives to residential care.  		Residential treatment costs are likely to increase unless the state either  		finds a way to closely monitor the process through which children with SED are  		placed in PRTFs or divert children to community-based alternatives. In  		addition, some state officials express concern that mental health providers may  		come to rely on PRTFs as the primary mode of treatment and, as a result, not  		see the need to support the state in its efforts to finance an expansion of  		intensive community services as an alternative to out-of-home placements. </p>
<ul><li><i>Implementing local SOC programs in multiple counties has been a  		  useful experience for the state, but differences among counties make it  		  challenging to replicate any single model. </i></li>
</ul><p>The Dawn Project in Marion County, which serves children who have been  		or are about to be placed in residential treatment facilities, is an example of  		an effective Medicaid managed care behavioral health carve-out for children  		with SED. The extent to which the state can replicate this approach in other  		counties is variable, however, because of a long-standing tradition of county  		autonomy and because other counties lack the experience and infrastructure that  		allowed Marion County to develop the project. However, the unexpected success  		in implementing the waiver in rural areas suggests that SOC models may be an  		effective way to serve children with SED in these areas if local leaders within  		and across multiple counties can work together to develop economies of scale  		for intensive community and family support services. </p>
<p>Overall, the state can play a major supportive role in providing  		counties with seed monies and technical guidance to help them develop their own  		community services for children with SED. For example, when counties had  		trouble determining whether their wraparound programs were consistent with core  		program principles, the state developed the Wraparound Fidelity Index, a  		special instrument designed to assess compliance with the values and principles  		of the wraparound model, identify training needs, improve local planning, and  		develop technical assistance plans. In addition, by bringing together the  		various agencies responsible for child welfare, Indiana has begun to develop a  		comprehensive state mental health plan for children and their families, and  		including a routine screening, assessment, and treatment process for those in  		the child welfare system. </p>
<ul><li><i>Changes in administration at the state level can affect the level  		  of support for implementing an HCBS waiver. </i></li>
</ul><p>The November 2004 state-level elections resulted in a restructuring of  		FSSA priorities. As a result, there has been less attention within the overall  		Medicaid context to addressing problems with HCBS waiver implementation. In  		addition, some officials have expressed concern about the implications for  		continued support of the waiver if expenditures for waiver-enrolled children  		continue to be higher than expected. </p>
<h3><a name="appendB-KS" id="appendB-KS">The Home And Community-Based  		Service Waiver in Kansas</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, Kansas ranked 42nd in the nation in providing care  		for individuals with serious mental illness. There was little coordination  		between services delivered by state hospitals and community mental health  		centers (CMHCs)<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB3">3</a></font></sup> and  		the majority of funds for mental health services were allocated to  		institutional care even though most individuals with mental illness were not  		institutionalized. In recognition of the serious problems in the mental health  		system, the state launched several initiatives by the end of that decade.</p>
<p>First, it applied for and received in the late 1980s and early 1990s two  		grants through the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) to help  		develop a comprehensive mental health system of care for youth with SED and  		their families. Though short-lived, the grants gave the state experience in  		implementing home and community services, prompting it to adopt CASSP  		principles as guidelines for subsequent mental health policies and programs  		throughout the state.</p>
<p>Second, the state passed the Mental Health Reform Act of 1990 in an  		attempt to transform the adult and child mental health service systems by  		shifting the emphasis from institutional care to community services.  		Specifically, the Act authorized the state to distribute $33 million in grants  		(approximately $6 million of which were designated specifically for children)  		to all 29 CMHCs according to each centers population base and historical  		use of state psychiatric facilities. Key elements of the legislation included  		the following: </p>
<ul><li>A new screening process (also known as a single-point-of-entry) for  		  all state hospital admissions.</li>
<li>Funds for CMHCs to increase the availability of community mental  		  health services.</li>
<li>Catchment areas designated specifically for each CMHC.</li>
<li>Requirements for CMHCs to establish state hospital liaison services  		  through which care and discharge planning would be coordinated between a  		  hospital, the CMHC, and other community resources. </li>
</ul><p>Third, in the early 1990s, Kansas began covering certain mental health  		services--including training in social skills--for Medicaid-enrolled children  		through the Medicaid rehabilitation option</p>
<p>By the mid 1990s, state policymakers realized that the Mental Health  		Reform Act was having a greater impact on the adult mental health system than  		on the child mental health system. To address this imbalance, the state applied  		for and, in 1994, received two system-of-care (SOC) grants from SAMHSA: The  		Family and Children Community Services in Sedgwick County and KanFocus, which  		would cover a group of counties in the southeastern part of the state. These  		grants allowed the state to more fully develop its experience with a  		family-centered approach to mental health care, interagency collaboration, and  		performance measurement strategies. Using outcome data from an analysis of  		these two SOC grant projects as well as information gathered from focus groups  		with consumers, meetings among key stakeholders, and a series of planning  		conferences held in different regions of the state, the Kansas Mental Health  		Authority (MHA) developed a comprehensive strategic plan for enhancing child  		mental health services. The plan evolved into the Childrens Mental Health  		Initiative, which officially began in November 1996. Through the initiative,  		the state legislature increased appropriations specifically to enhance the  		CMHCs capacity to provide community services to youth with serious  		emotional disorders (SED).</p>
<p>Kansass experiences with statewide mental health reform and the  		Childrens Initiative helped it to develop its application for an HCBS  		waiver for youth with SED. When the state began to implement the waiver in June  		1997, it had already taken major steps toward building a comprehensive  		community-based mental health service system for youth with SED. The waiver  		added a component to this emerging system. As these developments made mental  		health services more available in the community, Kansas closed Topeka State  		Hospital, a state psychiatric hospital for adolescents, in the late 1990s and  		used the savings to further develop home and community services.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In 2000, the state launched the Mental Health Initiative, which, in  		addition to providing additional resources to the CMHCs for crisis intervention  		and diversion services, instituted additional reporting requirements for the  		public mental health system. In the same year, Kansas also added services under  		its Medicaid rehabilitation services option. CMHCs now receive other state  		dollars for intensive in-home services and family support interventions for  		children with mental illness and their parents who are either uninsured,  		underinsured, or do not qualify for the home and community-based services  		(HCBS) SED waiver. As a group, the CMHCs receive:</p>
<ul><li>$10 million in general state aid, giving the centers the flexibility  		  to pay for intensive or specialized mental health services that would not  		  otherwise be covered.</li>
<li>$5 million from the states tobacco settlement designated  		  specifically as Family Centered System of Care (FCSC) funds and distributed  		  according to a CMHCs population base and catchment area socioeconomic  		  status.</li>
</ul><p>The state also awards monies to CMHCs for special projects on  		childrens mental health on a competitive basis. For example, a $1 million  		annual allocation was recently divided between six CMHCs for providing  		therapeutic services to preschool children.</p>
<p>Overall, Kansas has a well-integrated network of CMHCs, the majority of  		which are private, nonprofit entities with their own governing boards. Under  		state contracts and licensing regulations, CMHCs are required to serve not only  		individuals regardless of their ability to pay but also youth with SED and  		their families as a specific contractual responsibility. CMHCs are also  		responsible for determining clinical eligibility for the waiver, providing  		mental health services to all residents in their catchment area, establishing  		medical necessity for admissions to psychiatric in-patient units and some  		residential treatment facilities, providing diversion services in the  		community, and reporting on both service delivery and outcomes. CMHCs,  		especially those in rural areas, have been challenged to find enough qualified  		staff to provide intensive home and community services and to develop adequate  		means for measuring their quality.</p>
<p><b>The HCBS SED Waiver</b></p>
<p>The HCBS waiver for youth with SED is an important component of the  		overall service system because it allows Kansas to provide, in addition to  		general Medicaid services, intensive mental health services to children with  		SED who would otherwise be ineligible for Medicaid because of family income.  		State officials believe that the waiver is especially valuable to children and  		families who have private insurance coverage but have exhausted their mental  		health benefits or whose private insurance does not cover community-based  		rehabilitative mental health services.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the mental health services provided through the standard  		Medicaid package, the waiver makes four additional services available to  		children and their families: </p>
<ul><li>Respite care (up to 300 hours per year).</li>
<li>Parent support services.</li>
<li>Wraparound facilitation.</li>
<li>Skill-building for independent living.</li>
</ul><p>Eligibility for services provided under the waiver is based on clinical  		and financial status. The former is determined by CMHCs in terms of the risk  		for state psychiatric hospitalization, which must be imminent. The latter is  		determined by local offices in the Department of Social and Rehabilitation  		Services (SRS) on the basis of the childs income alone, so very few  		children are deemed financially ineligible for the waiver. </p>
<p>In addition to determining clinical eligibility for waiver services,  		CMHCs develop individualized services plans based on meetings with the child,  		the family, other natural supports, and staff from other agencies as needed.  		The centers are also responsible for updating these plans periodically and for  		monitoring and reporting on services provided to all waiver-enrolled children.  		</p>
<p>To reduce the number of children who are institutionalized by providing  		treatment in both the home and community, the Kansas MHA and the CMHCs have  		contractually agreed to a bed-day allocation process through which each CMHC  		has use of a pre-determined number of state psychiatric hospital beds.  		Implemented as a management tool to reduce inpatient care, the bed-day  		allocation was established based on a formula that considered the CMHCs  		historical use of state hospital care. By providing children with mental health  		services through the waiver, CMHCs can keep their bed-day allocations under the  		allotted number, thus showing the state that they are being accountable for the  		delivery of care. The MHA conducts quarterly reviews of the HCBS SED waiver  		plans of care to ensure services are meeting childrens needs. </p>
<p>The state has increased waiver enrollment from 305 children in 1998 to  		2020 in 2005, with a corresponding increase in its financial commitments.</p>
<p><i><b>Financing Issues</b></i></p>
<p>In its annual report to CMS for fiscal year 2003 (the 372  		report), Kansas indicated that average annual per capita expenditures for  		all waiver and other Medicaid services provided to the 1,614 children enrolled  		in the waiver totaled $13,575 per child. The state estimated that had the  		waiver not been available, the average annual costs would have been $26,186 per  		child served. </p>
<p>In fiscal year (FY) 2004, the state estimated that the average annual  		expenditures for services to the 1,789 children then enrolled in the waiver  		program were $14,035 per child. Overall, in FY 2004, Kansas spent a total of  		$27,000,000 for all medical and mental health services for youth enrolled in  		the HCBS waiver. Of this amount, $1,024,503 was spent on the specialized  		services available through the waiver. Specifically, a total of $518,170 was  		spent on wraparound facilitation, $328,134 on parent support and training  		services, $177,199 on respite care, and none on skill building for independent  		living, which overlaps with community services covered under the rehabilitation  		option and other methods. According to state officials, respite care is used  		infrequently because it is not fully reimbursed, and it requires substantial  		documentation (e.g., a state license is required if respite care is provided  		for more than 24 hours).</p>
<p>CMHCs are paid on a fee-for-service basis for providing mental health  		services covered under the standard Medicaid benefit package, the  		rehabilitation option, and the expanded service package authorized through the  		waiver. CMHCs bill Medicaid for parent support services and wraparound  		facilitation services in units of 15 minutes under rates set by the state.  		CMHCs typically subcontract out for respite care, and that provider bills the  		CMHCs on a fee-for-service basis, and the CMHC bills Medicaid in turn.</p>
<p>According to state officials, Kansas is facing several key issues in  		terms of providing mental health care for children with SEC:</p>
<ul><li>In the past, the state has increased Medicaid funding for mental  		  health services as needed. In light of the current Medicaid budget crisis at  		  both the state and federal levels, state staff are concerned about the  		  potential for future budget cuts, which could force them to reduce either  		  coverage of mental health services or payments to providers, or both.</li>
<li>Community services and supports to waiver-enrolled children are  		  provided as needed in the school setting. Although schools systems have become  		  more aware of the impact of SED on childrens learning and are willing to  		  send staff to planning meetings with mental health service providers, the  		  school system does not typically cover any services provided to children  		  enrolled in the SED waiver.</li>
<li>Youth with SED who are discharged from detention centers or  		  residential treatment programs operated under the authority of the juvenile  		  justice agency and their families typically need reintegration services to help  		  them adapt to community life. Toward this end, however, there is very little  		  formal collaboration between the juvenile justice system and public mental  		  health service providers. Furthermore, Medicaid funds cannot be used to pay for  		  services provided to youth in detention centers or correctional facilities and,  		  as a result, access to treatment services is reduced. </li>
<li>Medicaid does not cover several potentially useful services. For  		  example, in-home family therapy can be reimbursed only if the child is present  		  even though it is sometimes clinically necessary for therapists to work with  		  the parents alone. In addition, parent-to-parent support services or respite  		  services can be extremely helpful for many families but are typically only  		  reimbursable for waiver-enrolled children. Finally, federal rules restrict  		  Medicaid from paying for services that could facilitate a childs  		  discharge from an institution for mental disease (IMD). </li>
</ul><p>In the absence of the HCBS SED waiver, state officials report that the  		MHA could probably find alternative ways to finance the array of nontraditional  		services now covered through by the waiver for Medicaid-eligible youth with  		(e.g., CMHCs could use state grant dollars to provide respite care). However,  		according to state officials, Kansas remains committed to the waiver because it  		is a valuable resource and other alternatives are limited. Officials note  		that:</p>
<ul><li>Obtaining CMS approval for including respite care or parent support  		  services in the states Medicaid state plan would be highly unlikely.</li>
<li>Implementing the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act provision  		  (TEFRA, also known as the Katie Beckett provision) would have a relatively  		  small impact on the target population in Kansas because, according to state  		  staff, only a small number of children with SED would be defined as having a  		  disability according to the definition in the TEFRA provision, and they would  		  not have access to the intensive services covered by the states HCBS SED  		  waiver.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB6">6</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Increased funding of nontraditional services through state general  		  funds is highly unlikely because of the current fiscal environment. </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Managing Access to Residential and Inpatient Care</b></i></p>
<p>CMHCs must approve admissions to state psychiatric hospitals, but they  		have never been responsible for serving as gatekeepers to residential treatment  		centers. Most children are referred to residential treatment facilities from  		the child welfare agency or the juvenile justice agency. Historically, there  		has been little collaboration between the MHA and either child welfare or  		juvenile justice in relation to residential care placements. Recent  		negotiations among these agencies, however, have transferred management  		responsibilities of some residential facilities to the MHA. </p>
<p>The two types of residential treatment facilities in Kansas--referred to  		as Level 5 and Level 6--have traditionally been funded and managed by the child  		welfare system. Placement in these facilities depends on a childs  		specific needs and severity of mental illness, with Level 6 facilities  		generally reserved for children with more severe mental illnesses. On July 1,  		2004, the fiscal management for Level 6 facilities was transferred to the state  		Medicaid agency, and negotiations are currently underway to transfer  		programmatic management of Level 6 facilities to the state MHA. Overall, these  		changes should improve the connections between local mental health service  		providers, residential treatment facilities, and providers of community  		services.</p>
<p>If a child enrolled in the HCBS waiver is placed in a residential  		treatment facility or an inpatient setting for more than 14 days, he or she is  		no longer eligible for waiver services. The child can, however, reapply for the  		HCBS SED waiver when he or she returns to the community.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>CMHCs in Kansas have developed a relatively uniform approach for  		  providing a comprehensive set of intensive home and community services for  		  children with SED, regardless of whether they are enrolled in the  		  waiver.</i></li>
</ul><p>CMHCs draw on a variety of funding sources to provide comprehensive  		services to individuals in their catchment areas, including children with SED.  		These sources include state and local funds, Medicaid, and special grants or  		contracts. The HCBS waiver for youth with SED is essentially a means for  		obtaining reimbursement for certain services provided to children who are at  		risk for admission to a state psychiatric hospital. Children with SED who are  		not enrolled in the waiver receive community mental health services covered  		under the state Medicaid plan and some additional intensive services covered  		through other mechanisms. However, virtually all children with SED who meet the  		clinical criteria for the waiver are enrolled because most of them are also  		financially eligible. </p>
<ul><li><i>It takes time, patience, dedicated individuals, a clear long-term  		  strategic plan, and stakeholder consensus to build a comprehensive state mental  		  health system. </i></li>
</ul><p>Kansas began to build a comprehensive community-based mental heath  		system in 1990 with the Mental Health Reform Act. Over time, that system has  		been expanded through other initiatives. Now 15 years later, many community  		service options are available, but, according to state officials, more work  		needs to be done. Throughout that 15-year history of service development,  		stakeholder consensus has been critical to gaining additional resources for  		providing mental health services to youth with SED. Each time the state has  		devoted a major share of its resources to the mental health system, program  		administrators have been in agreement about what was needed, and they worked  		with the legislature and the state agencies toward obtaining resources for the  		mental health system. This is true for all major system enhancements achieved  		through the Mental Health Reform Act of 1990, the Childrens Initiative  		and subsequent HCBS SED waiver, the Family Centered System of Care, and the  		2000 Mental Health Initiative.</p>
<ul><li><i>The availability of outcome data on the states two  		  SAMHSA-funded SOC grants helped Kansas gain legislative and financial support  		  for expanding community services for youth with SED, including the HCBS  		  waiver.</i></li>
</ul><p>Kansas used the data from the two SAMHSA-funded SOC grants to show the  		legislature that community services could lead to positive outcomes for youth  		with SED. The data also enabled the state to illustrate gaps in services,  		leading to further funding opportunities and program development such as  		funding for the FCSC program and the success of the HCBS waiver application.  		</p>
<ul><li><i>Young children and older adolescents with SED need services that  		  are not now covered by existing mechanisms. </i></li>
</ul><p>State and local mental health professionals in Kansas remarked on the  		increase in the number of children under five years of age who are entering the  		mental health system with serious behavioral and emotional problems. Several  		officials noted the importance of supporting early intervention programs in  		efforts to identify and prevent mental health problems. </p>
<p>Mental health professionals also noted that as they make improvements in  		serving youth with SED, they are finding that, by the time these individuals  		are 21, their symptoms no longer conform to the diagnosis of severe and  		persistent mental illness turn 21, which is basis for obtaining Medicaid  		coverage for mental illness throughout adulthood. Officials underscored not  		only the importance of helping young adults to obtain coverage but also the  		need for earlier and more comprehensive access to vocational training that can  		help adolescents with SED to make a successful transition to employment in  		adulthood.</p>
<h3><a name="appendB-NY" id="appendB-NY">The Home And Community-Based  		Service Waiver in New York State</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>New Yorks mental health service system for youth with serious  		emotional disturbances (SED) is shaped by the states county-based  		structure of governance. At the county level, departments of mental health and  		social service play a key role in service delivery because the counties provide  		half of the nonfederal Medicaid match (i.e., the states share of Medicaid  		costs). Counties are also required by state law (Article 41 of the Mental  		Hygiene Law) to develop plans for mental health services, but the availability  		of services, including waiver services, is driven by both state and county  		policies. At the state level, the Office of Mental Health (OMH) is required by  		law to develop programs and services for individuals with mental illness. The  		state Department of Health (DOH), which is the single state agency for Medical  		Assistance (i.e., Medicaid), and the Office of Children and Family Services  		(OCFS), which is responsible for child welfare and juvenile justice also play  		important roles in the care of children, including those with SED. </p>
<p>All of OMHs child mental health initiatives build on Child and  		Adolescent Services System (CASSP) principles, also known as system-of-care  		(SOC) principles. The agencys first efforts in this area began in the  		early 1990s, when it instituted the Coordinated Childrens Services  		Initiative (CCSI) to support localities in creating systems of care to ensure  		that children at risk of residential placement remain at home and in the  		community whenever possible and to address barriers to developing a system of  		care in which services are based on individual needs. Since the initiative was  		developed, CCSI principles have been implemented in over 50 counties, including  		the five boroughs of New York City.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB7">7</a></font></sup> The CCSI was signed into legislation in  		2002.</p>
<p>In the mid 1990s, the state took three additional steps to enhance home  		and community services for youth with SED. First, several counties obtained  		CASSP grants to build community-based systems of care, and the state OMH used  		CASSP dollars to support the development of five statewide consultant positions  		for parents of children with SED. These consultants work to encourage family  		involvement in local planning and to facilitate family support activities by  		bringing parents into the process. Currently, New York State has four SOC sites  		funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  		(SAMHSA).<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Second, reinvestment dollars were designated to pay for some  		child mental health services and service integration projects across the state.  		The money was first made available in state fiscal year 1994-1995, when New  		York closed some of its psychiatric institutions and eliminated nongeriatric  		beds in the institutions that remained. Initially, the state used a standard  		formula to distribute this money to all 62 counties including the five boroughs  		of New York City. Although the statute mandating the distribution of this money  		has expired, funds continue to be authorized and counties continue to use them  		for child mental health service programs previously approved.</p>
<p>Third, New York began planning for Medicaid managed behavioral health  		care in the mid 1990s. In 1995, the state applied for a home and  		community-based services (HCBS) waiver to help support what it anticipated  		would be a broadly managed behavioral health plan. Partly in response to these  		developments, Oneida County began a special program for children with SED  		(described in detail in the section below on county-level programs) in 1998. By  		the late 1990s, however, the state had backed away from implementing managed  		behavioral health plans, and most mental health services for children are paid  		today under fee-for-service arrangements. </p>
<p>Despite New Yorks extensive experience with SOC principles in the  		early 1990s, a study commissioned by OMH in 1999 noted continuing problems in  		interagency coordination. These problems were addressed in 2000-2001 by the  		Governors New Initiatives Guidelines. Under these guidelines, OMH  		requested counties to designate a Single Point of Access (SPOA) agency to  		identify children at the highest risk of placement in out-of-home settings. The  		SPOA process was designed to: (1) implement a universal intake form to  		facilitate entry into services; (2) develop a process to manage access to  		high-end services; (3) use a comprehensive functional assessment to develop an  		individualized plan of care; and (4) develop appropriate strategies to support  		children with SED in their communities. The SPOA process complements existing  		initiatives in each locality. In addition, many localities have extended the  		use of the SPOA process to children who need multiple services from multiple  		agencies, regardless of mental health status. SPOA processes for children are  		operational in every county and in the Bronx. In 2002, SPOA agencies referred  		nearly 6,000 children for mental health services. </p>
<p>Medicaid covers some out-patient mental health services for children  		under the standard clinic option. Although New York has elected the Medicaid  		rehabilitation option and uses it for some mental health services for children,  		it has not been used to support intensive community services for children with  		SED. These services are financed through state dollars, without regard to  		childrens Medicaid eligibility. The cost of Medicaid services is divided  		evenly between the Federal Government and the state. For most services, the  		state splits its portion of the bill with the counties.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because counties do not contribute to the cost of care in psychiatric  		residential treatment facilities (PRTFs), they have a financial incentive to  		place youth in such facilities instead of supporting the development of  		community services, to which they do contribute. The state, however, has  		assumed the responsibility for paying the local share of Medicaid services for  		youth with SED who are enrolled in the HCBS waiver to avoid creating a  		disincentive to developing community services.</p>
<p><b>The HCBS Waiver</b></p>
<p>New Yorks HCBS waiver formally began in January 1996 with 125  		slots throughout 11 counties including the five boroughs of New York City.  		Today, 610 slots are spread across 40 of New Yorks 57 counties and all  		five boroughs. The waiver currently serves about 1,700 youth with SED ages 5-18  		(or up to age 21 if the youth enters the program before his or her  		18<sup>th</sup> birthday) who need an institutional level of care.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The waiver allows the state to:</p>
<ul><li>Waive the amount, duration, and scope of Medicaid services, thereby  		  enabling it to offer specialized services that are not available as mandatory  		  or optional Medicaid services or through other state or county programs.</li>
<li>Lift parental deeming requirements, thereby providing access to  		  intensive mental health services for youth who might not otherwise meet the  		  financial eligibility criteria for Medicaid (which in New York is a family  		  income below 100 percent of the federal poverty line, effective April 1,  		  2005).</li>
<li>Waive statewideness requirements, allowing the state to  		  phase in the waiver by county.</li>
<li>Control costs by limiting the increase in waiver slots and managing  		  its exposure to high-cost cases.</li>
</ul><p>Waiver services in each county are organized by Individualized Care  		Coordination (ICC) agencies, which are private, nonprofit entities with current  		Medicaid certification. Children are referred to waiver services by the local  		SPOA agency; however, the ICC agency makes the final eligibility determination.  		The ICC agency also develops a service plan and creates an individualized  		budget for each child served under the waiver. </p>
<p>There are six core waiver services, which were developed with input from  		the county mental health departments, providers of childrens mental  		health services, and families across the state:</p>
<ul><li>Individualized care coordination.</li>
<li>Family support.</li>
<li>Crisis response.</li>
<li>Skill building.</li>
<li>Intensive in-home services.</li>
<li>Respite care.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Financing Issues </b></i></p>
<p>New York views its waiver as a financial mechanism that allows it to pay  		for an expanded array of community services while controlling costs by limiting  		the number of children who have access to this expanded benefit package. The  		state OMH contracts with ICC agencies to ensure that: (1) the ICC agency makes  		available all six services; and (2) individuals enrolled in the waiver receive  		the services in their individual service plan. ICC agencies are required to  		provide individualized care coordination directly and to offer families a  		choice of providers whenever possible for the remaining five services. </p>
<p>The structure of the fee received by ICC agencies depends on whether a  		service is provided by a contracted provider or by the agency itself. The  		agencies can contract out for all services (except individualized care  		coordination) and bill Medicaid a fee-for-service basis. They can also bundle  		three types of services (individualized care coordination, intensive in-home  		services and crisis response services) and provide them directly, in which case  		they receive a previously negotiated case rate from Medicaid.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>New York State requires each ICC agency to bill $1 for each service-hour  		(even if services are bundled and the ICC agency is receiving a case rate) so  		that it is possible to track utilization rates. However, the incentive for  		doing so is weak because it is costly for the ICC agencies to file the  		necessary billing paperwork. As a result, there is significant under-reporting  		of the use of waiver services. </p>
<p>In 2003, New York spent $25.6 million on services (including medical  		care) on youth enrolled in the waiver program. About 65 percent ($16.8 million)  		of these dollars went to the six core waiver services. Of these services,  		individualized care coordination cost the most ($12.8 million) because it is a  		part of every childs service plan. </p>
<p>ICC agencies also receive $2,500 per slot from Medicaid to pay for  		wraparound services (for example, recreational camps) related to a childs  		treatment plan. ICC agencies contract out for these services and are then  		reimbursed by DOH, which, in turn, is reimbursed by OMH from federal Medicaid  		matching funds. OMH pays the entire state share of waiver services.</p>
<p>In 2004, New York renewed its HCBS waiver. As in previous waiver  		applications, the state showed cost neutrality by comparing the cost of  		community treatment with the cost of treatment in in-patient psychiatric  		hospitals, including PRTFs. New York state law defines hospitals as including  		in-patient psychiatric facilities, which, in turn, are defined as including  		residential treatment facilities.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB12">12</a></font></sup> Using calendar year 2002 data on  		utilization and expenditures in the waiver program, in PRTFs, and in in-patient  		psychiatric settings, the state estimated that it would spend an average of  		$28,324 per youth per year, including $18,028 for waiver services, on community  		treatment in 2004. By contrast, it estimated that residential treatment would  		cost an average of $113,572 per youth per year. </p>
<p>In rural areas, in which there are few children in the waiver, OMH and  		the ICC agencies have had trouble making services available because demand for  		particular services is too low for contracted providers to justify hiring staff  		for the waiver. This problem is exacerbated by Medicaid Freedom of Choice  		requirements, which prevent New York from limiting provider choice by  		contracting with a limited number of providers in certain areas (particularly  		those that are rural and have few of the states 610 waiver slots). New  		York has not yet determined how best to balance federal requirements and the  		desire to give families a choice of providers with the limits this places on  		their ability to ensure access to care in all areas of the state.</p>
<p><i><b>Managing Access to PRTFs or In-patient Care</b></i></p>
<p>New York controls access to PRTFs fairly tightly for children with SED.  		Before a child with SED can enter an PRTF, the SPOA agency reviews the case  		and, if it is determined that the family has tried all lower levels of care,  		refers the child to the state-mandated Pre-Admission Certification Committee  		(PACC). The PACC committee has final authority for placing children in any of  		New Yorks 539 PRTF beds for youth.</p>
<p><b>County Level Programs</b></p>
<p>Although New York State has taken numerous steps to improve community  		services for children with SED, some counties have collaborated with the OMH to  		further develop such services. Two such counties are Oneida and  		Westchester.</p>
<p><i><b>Oneida County</b></i></p>
<p>When the state began developing the HCBS waiver program, Oneida County  		initiated Kids Oneida, its own program to expand the services available to all  		youth with SED in the county. Developed in part through a Mental Health  		Services Program for Youth Initiative replication grant of $75,000 from the  		Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kids Oneida offers services similar to those  		available through New Yorks HCBS waiver. Having enrolled the first group  		of children in the summer of 1998, Kids Oneida was providing services to 162  		enrolled children and 52 siblings by 2003.</p>
<p>The Kids Oneida budget ($4.2 million in 2003) comes from two sources:  		Oneida County Department of Social Services (DSS) and Medicaid. Oneida County  		DSS pays $2,550 per child per month via a blend of state (65 percent) and local  		(35 percent) funds. Kids Oneida was established as a state-certified  		out-patient mental health clinic and receives a bundled Medicaid case rate of  		$1,225 per month for each child it enrolls who is Medicaid eligible (about 65  		percent of enrollees have Medicaid). Program staff estimate that it spent  		$2,318 per family per month in 2003 on community mental health services, 44  		percent less than was spent per family per month in residential treatment  		(where the average cost was $5,268). </p>
<p><i><b>Westchester County</b></i></p>
<p>Westchester County has relatively substantial local resources, little to  		no turnover in its leadership, and a history of extensive interagency  		collaboration. As a result, it has been especially successful in creating an  		integrated community-based service system for children with SED. In the mid  		1980s, the county obtained a small grant from the state to develop interagency  		collaborations modeled on CASSP principles and designed to foster a coordinated  		SOC for youth with SED. Westchester County was also one of the counties that  		received state funds throughout the 1990s to support cross-system efforts for  		children with SED. In addition, in 1999, the county obtained a six-year SAMHSA  		grant to further develop its SOC around the needs of families that have  		children with SED. The main thrust of the SOC project has been to develop  		infrastructure that could support community services. The result was Family  		Ties, a 501(c)(3) organization that runs five resource centers for families,  		supports a thriving family and youth movement, and works to improve  		coordination among the various agencies that serve children. </p>
<p>Westchester has also expanded its SPOA process by creating a Single  		Point of Return program, which helps children make the transition into the  		community when they are discharged from RTFs. The county estimates that it has  		saved $12 million over three years by diverting children from residential to  		community care through SPOA.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>The counties in New York State have responded in various ways to  		  the challenges of developing community services for children with SED; the  		  state itself reflects the diversity of approaches characteristic of the nation  		  as a whole.</i></li>
</ul><p>From a statewide perspective, the HCBS waiver is a small but important  		component of the mental health service delivery system for children in New  		York. It allows the state to finance services for up to 1,700 youth with SED  		who need intensive services in order to remain in their homes or communities.  		For the 45 counties that have waiver slots (out of 62 counties including the  		five boroughs of New York City), the HCBS waiver is essential because it allows  		them to finance an array of nontraditional services that go beyond those  		available through the standard state Medicaid plan and other state programs. In  		addition, many children enrolled in the waiver would not have access to these  		services because they are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p>For example, in Orange County 16 children are typically enrolled in the  		waiver at any one time; without it, some of them would not be eligible for  		Medicaid, and all would have little access to intensive community services  		because Orange County has limited resources for providing them with state funds  		or through the Medicaid clinic option. </p>
<p>In contrast, in Westchester County, 26 children usually are enrolled in  		the waiver program, and there are a variety of other community programs and  		supports funded by: (1) state reinvestment dollars; (2) resources pooled from  		OMH, Medicaid, and the local DSS; and (3) its SAMHSA grant. As a result, the  		waiver supplements, rather than defines, the services available to children  		with SED. Oneida County has taken yet a different approach by implementing a  		funding model that relies on case-rates and fiscal collaboration among county  		departments of social service and mental health. Nevertheless, the waiver  		services offered to children with SED in Westchester resemble those offered by  		Oneida County at a similar per child cost. In each case, the current system  		emerged from the vision of key program leaders who, on the one hand, have used  		similar government resources in different creative ways and, on the other, have  		generated unique opportunities through service grants.</p>
<ul><li><i>Legislative mandates that promote individualized service planning  		  and collaboration among key agencies at the state and local level have created  		  an environment that enhances the effectiveness of HCBS waivers and other  		  efforts to finance home and community services. </i></li>
</ul><p>Current systems and processes, such as SPOA and CCSI, are the means  		through which core SOC principles are implemented at local, county, and state  		level and, as a result, have created the fabric through which services are  		delivered to youth with SED. The CCSI, by uniting a variety of child-serving  		agencies, has spawned the infrastructure for a coordinated community-based  		system of care. The SPOA process allows officials from the critical agencies to  		work with families to ensure that children with SED receive the services they  		need in the community and to develop a comprehensive and individualized plan of  		care for each child and family. SPOA agencies offer a variety of community  		services and manage access to other services, including the HCBS waiver program  		and residential treatment facilities. State officials believe that the SPOA  		initiative has reduced the need for out-of-home placement by helping ICC  		agencies to identify and plan for services early in the treatment process.</p>
<p>Despite the progress that many counties in New York State have made in  		developing a community-based system of care through the CCSI and county-based  		programs, integrating the services offered by different systems (i.e., mental  		health, justice, welfare, education) and the funds they receive from general  		state revenues is a continuing challenge. Even counties that have strong  		interagency partnerships struggle to develop integrated, community-based  		systems of care, especially during periods when funds are limited in all of the  		service sectors. CCSI continues to support training and technical assistance to  		allow for collaborative planning. In many counties, SPOA agencies have expanded  		their scope to plan for all children who are high risk or high need by working  		with other child-serving agencies to serve these children despite regulatory  		and funding restrictions.</p>
<ul><li><i>The ability to waive parental deeming and statewideness  		  requirements was useful for New York State during the implementation of the  		  HCBS waiver. </i></li>
</ul><p>The HCBS waiver allows New York to expand the population of youth it is  		able to serve because it allows the state to consider the youths income  		alone when determining financial eligibility. As it is, the waiver serves only  		a very small fraction of children with SED in the state. In addition, the  		waiver has allowed the state to expand services incrementally, control costs  		for services to a high-need population, and give counties the option of  		participating.</p>
<ul><li><i>New York continues to face challenges in managing admissions to  		  PRTFs for children with SED.</i></li>
</ul><p>Counties do not share responsibility for the costs associated with  		treating youth in PRTFs, but they do share responsibility for the costs  		associated with community-based treatment alternatives (excluding waiver  		services). As a consequence, counties have a strong financial incentive to  		place youth with SED in PRTFs if waiver slots are unavailable or if there is no  		waiver program in that locality as opposed to developing community-based  		systems of care. </p>
<p>Many children served by the HCBS waiver are not eligible for Medicaid  		upon discharge because parental deeming rules come back into play outside of  		the waiver. New York pays for some services with state dollars, but in many  		cases, there is a need for more services than are available through the state  		alone. The state will need to address this critical problem if children who are  		not Medicaid eligible are to successfully make the transition out of the  		waiver.</p>

<p>The home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver, implemented in  		Vermont in 1982, has been one in a series of steps taken by the state to cover  		children with serious emotional disturbances (SED) who are not eligible for  		Medicaid. Before 1982, Vermont provided mental health services to  		Medicaid-enrolled children with SED only through the clinic and rehabilitation  		options. The latter, however, included coverage of intensive services such as  		community support and skill-building as well as one-on-one supportive services  		provided at home or in school. When the waiver was implemented in 1982, the  		state was able to cover additional home and community services (e.g., respite  		care, therapeutic foster-care, and environmental modifications) for children  		with SED who were at immediate risk for hospitalization or out-of-home  		placements, some of whom would otherwise be ineligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p>Vermont initially applied for an HCBS waiver because more and more  		children were being served in residential treatment centers, in part because  		the state relocated children to these centers from the state psychiatric  		hospital in the 1970s. Vermont saw the waiver as a sustainable funding source  		that would minimize the use of residential treatment by making community  		services more readily available and thus ensuring that the  		deinstitutionalization process would have positive outcomes. Today, the waiver  		has become an indispensable component of the overall system of funding home and  		community services for children with SED.</p>
<p>Since obtaining the waiver, Vermont has taken several steps to improve  		the child mental health service system. In 1988, the state passed Act 264,  		which mandated interagency collaboration, coordination, and parental  		involvement at all levels of decision making. The act provides families of  		children with SED the legal right to have a coordinated plan of care and gives  		local community mental health centers (CMHCs) the responsibility for convening  		staff from mental health, special education, and child welfare agencies to  		develop such plans. The resulting local interagency teams work out coordination  		issues and determine appropriate funding strategies using dollars from  		different agencies as appropriate. In the rare instances when the teams cannot  		develop an appropriate plan (e.g., for children with especially complex needs),  		a state interagency team steps in. That team may involve staff from the health  		department, child welfare agencies, juvenile justice, or advocacy  		organizations. However, the majority of problems are worked out at the local  		level. </p>
<p>In 1991, Vermont began to cover children with SED and other disabilities  		under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act option (TEFRA, also known as  		the Katie Beckett provision). This provision gives states the option to waive  		the deeming of parental income and resources for children with disabilities  		under 18 years old who are living at home but would otherwise be eligible for  		Medicaid-funded institutional care.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB13">13</a></font></sup> Children who qualify for TEFRA are eligible  		to receive the same services provided under the states Medicaid plan.  		Approximately 410 children are now enrolled in this coverage group in Vermont.  		Although the state could not provide the specific number of these children who  		have SED, a previous report indicated that in 2002, about half of the children  		who enrolled in Medicaid through the TEFRA provision had SED. </p>
<p>Financial support for community services was strengthened further in the  		1990s, when the state expanded the rehabilitation option to include targeted  		case management. This service now accounts for the largest number of dollars  		billed under the option. </p>
<p>By the end of the decade, Vermont had built a fairly comprehensive  		service system for youth with SED based on the HCBS waiver, the interagency  		collaboration mandated by Act 264, the TEFRA option, and the expanded  		rehabilitation option. The state Medicaid agency pays for mental health  		services for most enrolled children on a fee-for-service basis. Managed  		behavioral health plans have a minimal role in providing services to children  		with SED. </p>
<p><b>The HCBS Waiver</b></p>
<p>As one component in the overall service system, Vermonts HCBS  		waiver is important because it allows the state to provide children under 18  		years old with SED who meet financial eligibility criteria with intensive  		services beyond those available through the standard Medicaid benefit package  		or the rehabilitation option. Some of these children would be ineligible for  		Medicaid absent the waiver. </p>
<p>Out of about 3,800 children estimated to have SED, approximately 140  		were enrolled in Vermonts HCBS waiver program in 2004. From 90 to 100  		children are enrolled in the waiver at any one time. Average time in the waiver  		program is 14 months. Mental health professionals determine clinical  		eligibility for the waiver by using a standard behavioral checklist and  		information from evaluations of functional status. Children who are referred  		for possible enrollment into the HCBS waiver must be at high risk for placement  		into a residential treatment facility or a psychiatric in-patient program or  		facility. </p>
<p>The HCBS waiver entitles eligible children and their families to all  		standard Medicaid services, including those provided under the rehabilitation  		option and the following additional services:</p>
<ul><li>Respite care.</li>
<li>Home and family supports.</li>
<li>Additional community and social supports and crisis  		  intervention.</li>
<li>Environmental modification.</li>
<li>Adaptive equipment.</li>
<li>Therapeutic foster care.</li>
</ul><p>Like other children with SED, those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program  		receive services through one of ten nonprofit CMHCs and one specialized agency  		that are spread over Vermonts 14 counties. To ensure that services are  		coordinated for any child with an SED, CMHCs develop individual plans of care  		(IPCs) in collaboration with the parent, schools, pediatricians, and other key  		stakeholders, as specified under Act 264. The plan specifies a budget for  		services (typically $100-$200 per day depending on the needs of the child) and  		identifies the fiscal responsibilities of each agency. Every three months, a  		psychiatrist is required to sign off on the IPC, and each one is rewritten and  		audited annually, or every six months if necessary. Under Vermonts  		door always open philosophy, no child who needs an IPC goes without  		one. </p>
<p>When developing IPCs, CMHCs consider various factors, such as the  		childs strengths, natural resources, clinical needs, and the extent to  		which the child and the parent want to be involved in the decision-making  		process. As described below, IPCs include specifications for how services will  		be financed in addition to how they will be coordinated. The information on  		service needs and financing strategies included in an IPC is used to determine  		whether a CMHC will refer a child to Division of Mental Health (DMH) for  		enrollment into the HCBS waiver. Although local CMHCs are responsible for  		developing IPCs, DMH monitors the IPC process closely.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Financing Issues</b></i></p>
<p>To be financially eligible for the HCBS waiver in Vermont, a child  		(though not the family) must be financially eligible for Medicaid. The  		states Medicaid eligibility limit is up to 300 percent of the federal  		poverty level, which is more generous than most states. Under the terms of the  		HCBS waiver, Vermont can disregard standard Medicaid financial eligibility  		rules, thus allowing only the childs income to be considered. As a  		result, very few children who meet the clinical eligibility requirements for  		enrollment into the HCBS waiver are found to be financially ineligible. DMH  		staff re-examine eligibility every six months.</p>
<p>Total Medicaid funding for children enrolled in the HCBS waiver program  		is capped. In 2003, the cap was $3,212,100. This money is allocated to the care  		of waiver-enrolled children via the budgets specified in their IPCs. In 2004,  		the average cost of Medicaid services for waiver-enrolled children was $156 per  		day and $57,000 per year, compared to $1,200 per day and $438,000 per year for  		psychiatric in-patient care.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because of the cap, the dollars specified in all IPCs combined cannot  		exceed the total amount of funds available. In some instances, therefore, an  		IPC may be rewritten in order to free up funds for another child, assuming that  		neither plan of care is compromised. Vermonts triage system  		ensures that children most at risk of institutionalization are prioritized for  		funding. In addition, once a child is enrolled on the waiver, Vermont assesses  		each childs clinical progress and continued waiver eligibility, allowing  		the state to remain within its cap while serving the neediest children. </p>
<p>Service costs are shared by all agencies involved, including special  		education and child welfare, according to IPC specifications. For example, if a  		child under the custody of the child welfare system is placed on the HCBS  		waiver, child welfare will pay for designated services, billing Medicaid for  		the portion of services covered under the waiver provisions. The state uses the  		dollars contributed by child welfare (or any other agency) as part of the state  		Medicaid match. In recent years, however, the Department of Education has  		substantially reduced its financial support for mental health services by  		discouraging the inclusion of mental health services in individualized  		educational plans. </p>
<p>A small amount of money ($60,000 per year for all children served  		through the CMHC system combined) can be used for special services not funded  		through other means. For example, these dollars could cover costs for a special  		summer camp. CMHCs request these dollars from DMH on behalf of specific  		children. The money, 100 percent general fund, and are not reimbursed by  		Medicaid or funded by the waiver. </p>
<p>CMHCs typically provide most of the mental health services for  		waiver-enrolled children, billing Medicaid as appropriate and drawing from  		their share of state general funds to cover other services.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB16">16</a></font></sup> When services are provided to  		waiver-enrolled children, CMHCs use a standard form to document that these  		services are consistent with a childs IPC. </p>
<p><i><b>Managing Access to Residential or Inpatient Care </b></i></p>
<p>If the IPC process indicates that not even waiver enrollment will  		provide the necessary level of care for a child with SED, then the CMHC  		recommends inpatient psychiatric care or placement in a residential treatment  		setting. DMH reviews the recommendation and makes the final placement  		decision.</p>
<p>At any one time, about 225 children, all of whom have an IPC, are in a  		residential setting. This number includes about 200 children under the custody  		of child welfare, most of whom are placed in these settings because of  		delinquent or dangerous behaviors (e.g., sex offenders) and the absence of a  		community entity that specializes in serving these youth. DMH is responsible  		for the remaining 20 to 25 children. Judges in the juvenile justice system,  		which is administratively part of the child welfare agency, do not usually send  		youth with SED to residential care without first referring them to a CMHC for  		an IPC. </p>
<p>Residential treatment facilities in Vermont are private nonmedical  		institutions (PNMIs), which determine the rates for education, treatment, and  		room and board. The Department of Education funds the education portion,  		Medicaid funds treatment services, and general state revenues cover room and  		board. There are three PNMIs for children ages 6-12 and six facilities for  		adolescents. The average length of stay in both is 9-10 months. The state also  		has two mental health assessment facilities, which are designed for short-term  		stays. </p>
<p>Although Vermont does not have inpatient hospital facilities that  		specialize in adolescents, the state can send individuals to designated  		psychiatric facilities in New Hampshire or New York. On any given day, these  		facilities have one or two adolescents from Vermont residing in them. Even  		though placement is out of state, the CMHCs in Vermont control their  		childrens access to these facilities by conducting screenings, making the  		referrals, and organizing after-care and discharge planning. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>Vermonts system of care is firmly supported by legislation  		  that aims to ensure financial support for services included in the ICPs that  		  are developed for all Medicaid-eligible youth with SED; although this  		  legislation forms the bedrock for providing access to community services,  		  according to state officials, the HCBS waiver adds an essential component to  		  the states capacity to finance services for children with SED.</i></li>
</ul><p>Vermont has a comprehensive and flexible system for providing mental  		health services to most youth with SED. Act 264 ensures that multiple agencies  		work together to fund a set of services tailored to a childs needs. Also,  		the basic Medicaid package is itself quite broad with respect to the mental  		health services available to youth with SED.</p>
<p>In the minds of some agency staff, the robust structure of the current  		system raises questions about the utility of the HCBS waiver. For example, one  		individual suggested that Vermont would probably not apply for an HCBS waiver  		today if it did not already have one, exploring other options instead, such as  		expanding the states use of the TEFRA option. Furthermore, managing the  		waiver process requires substantial provider involvement and administrative  		time to plan for services for a relatively small proportion (slightly more than  		1 percent) of youth with SED. Demonstrating cost neutrality, for example, can  		be a complex process that would not be needed if waiver services were included  		in the states general Medicaid plan. </p>
<p>Despite these reservations, Vermont remains committed to maintaining the  		HCBS waiver and in early 2005 submitted to CMS its application for continuing  		the waiver. This step underscores the waivers value in helping the state  		manage the costs of care for high-need children even with other financing  		strategies available. One child with SED who is placed in a residential  		treatment setting or in psychiatric in-patient care can cost the state a  		substantial amount of money. So, if Vermont uses the waiver to pay for extra  		services that will divert even a few children from these placements, it will  		save money that can be used to support community services for additional  		children with SED. Furthermore, the waiver represents a means for expanding  		coverage to an extremely high-risk group of children without altering the basic  		financial eligibility criteria for Medicaid. By creating this pathway to  		Medicaid while capping total expenditures for waiver-enrolled children, the  		state can serve needy children while slowing the growth of mental health care  		expenditures. </p>
<ul><li><i>The IPC process, and the fact that final authority over placement  		  decisions resides with the DMH, ensures that the road to expensive residential  		  and in-patient care for most of the states children with SED is closely  		  monitored. </i></li>
</ul><p>Act 264 provides an effective mechanism for controlling access to  		expensive residential and in-patient care for youth with SED by: (1)  		establishing a collaborative process among key stakeholders, including the  		family, that ensures access to the intensive community and family support  		services that may prevent out-of-home placement; and (2) designating a single  		agency (DMH) as the final authority for placement decisions, including  		decisions affecting children in the custody of child welfare. This arrangement  		has allowed Vermont to minimize costs for unnecessary residential or in-patient  		services, use limited dollars to provide intensive services to more children,  		and prioritize the use of scarce resources from a statewide perspective. </p>
<p>One factor contributing to placement of children in residential care is  		the absence of providers who have the training and experience to provide  		intensive home or community services. Provider shortages are especially acute  		in rural areas. Although Vermont has developed the infrastructure to manage  		placements in high-cost settings, the effectiveness of this infrastructure  		depends in part on the availability of mental health professionals who have the  		training and experience in providing intensive home and community services.  		</p>
<h3><a name="appendB-WI" id="appendB-WI">The Home And Community-Based  		Service Waiver in Wisconsin</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>Wisconsins system of care for children with serious emotional  		disorders (SED) has its roots in legislation enacted in the late 1980s and in  		other related efforts around that time to build capacity for home-base care. By  		passing the Children Come First Act in 1988, Wisconsin began to implement basic  		system-of-care (SOC) principles by establishing integrated service projects  		(ISPs) in five of the states 72 counties. These projects allowed counties  		to develop home and community wraparound services for children with SED who  		would otherwise have been treated in out-of-home settings (e.g., psychiatric  		hospitals, residential treatment centers, or foster care homes). The state  		currently allocates about $80,000 in mental health block grant funds to each of  		nineteen counties that have ISPs. In providing at least an equal match to these  		dollars, counties have an equally important role as the state in the funding  		and delivery of mental health services for children and families. </p>
<p>Around the same time, Wisconsin began to close child and adolescent  		psychiatric in-patient units, re-allocating some of the savings to the  		development of more services in the community. These funds, referred to as  		diversion dollars, though variable from year to year, have provided  		critical support for community services, which reduce risk for out-of-home  		placements and are not otherwise covered by Medicaid. In 2005, the state  		allocated about $1.2 million of these funds to various programs, including a  		multicounty crisis intervention and stabilization program. </p>
<p>Wisconsin continued to show its commitment to developing home and  		community services throughout the 1990s, when ISPs and diversion dollars  		allowed counties to implement a variety of approaches to delivering these  		services. Two counties (Dane and Milwaukee) established wraparound service  		systems based on a managed care model and supported by funds from several  		agencies that serve children. Specifically, the counties assumed the risk for  		providing a specific package of services and in turn negotiated capitation or  		case rates with key funding agencies. Wraparound Milwaukee, one of the better  		known and most replicated models of a managed SOC for children with SED,  		emerged during this period of time (see the description below). According to  		state officials, most counties, however, have used ISPs and diversion dollars  		to develop fee-for-service home and community services for three reasons: (1)  		county staff did not believe that there were enough children in the county to  		justify the development of capitation or case rates within a managed care  		approach; (2) they were unwilling or unable to enter into multicounty  		purchasing collaboratives; or (3) they were unwilling to invest the county  		dollars needed to support program expansions. </p>
<p>By the end of the 1990s, Wisconsin had developed solid experience in the  		development of community services for children with SED. In 1997, for example,  		the state established the Childrens Long-Term Support Redesign Committee,  		which was modeled on a similar initiative for adults and drew its members from  		the state Medicaid, mental health, children with special health care needs, and  		developmental disability agencies. Other members included parents, child  		advocates, providers, and staff from county mental health, child welfare, and  		education agencies. The goal of the committee was to redesign long-term support  		services for children with serious mental health and developmental needs by  		identifying service gaps, enhancing the capacity of counties to improve  		childrens services, and making childrens services more consistent  		across counties. The committee released a comprehensive report for re-designing  		Wisconsins SOC for children in 1998 and has continued to play an  		important role in the development of several initiatives in the early 2000s,  		including applying for a 1915(c) home and community-based services (HCBS)  		waiver on behalf of the state. </p>
<p>In 2000, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)  		indicated that it could not approve Wisconsins continued use of state  		Medicaid fee-for-service dollars to support intensive in-home treatment  		services for children with autism spectrum disorders, which were covered  		through the states Medicaid Rehabilitation Option. These services were  		considered habilitative and therefore more appropriate to a waiver  		context. The state therefore added these services to its comprehensive children  		services waiver application originally intended to cover three groups of  		children: those with developmental disabilities, those with SED, and those with  		physical disabilities. Before approving the waiver request, CMS required the  		state to submit three separate waiver applications, one for each group. </p>
<p>Among its other goals, the HCBS waiver for youth with SED was seen as  		the means through which the state could support intensive services for children  		with autism that would not otherwise be covered. Children with autism remain  		the single largest group of children now enrolled in the waiver. </p>
<p>In 2002, Wisconsin began to award selected counties with competitive  		three to five-year grants to support coordinated service teams (CSTs), whose  		mission is to improve the infrastructure for providing services to children  		with SED with funds from several agencies. The idea was to base service  		delivery and financing on a nonmanaged care, braided-funding model.  		Braided dollars are typically used to support cross-agency training and  		technical assistance at the county level. Actual services, however, continue to  		be covered through individual agency dollars, including Title IV-E monies,  		Medicaid, special education funds, and state and local general revenue dollars.  		The state supports CSTs with both mental health and substance abuse treatment  		block grant dollars along with diversion dollars and child welfare funding.  		</p>
<p>Wisconsins Medicaid program elected to pay for childrens  		services under the Rehabilitation Option beginning in the mid 1990s. In 2005,  		the state re-configured these services so that two levels of care are now  		available under the option. One level includes community level support  		programs, such as assertive community treatment for adolescents with SED who  		are making the transition to adult services. The second level, referred to as  		comprehensive community services (CCS), covers a wide range of rehabilitation  		services such as psychotherapy, symptom management and support, medication  		management, recovery planning, and rehabilitative in-home supports. Now  		operating in nine counties (including some counties with ISPs or CSTs), CCS  		helps to support comprehensive wraparound programs customized to meet the needs  		of any individual child. To obtain CCS coverage for an individual child,  		counties must develop child-specific individualized service packages via  		multidisciplinary teams that include family members and staff from county-level  		child-serving agencies. The state must approve these packages. </p>
<p>Wisconsin expanded access to Medicaid (including the Rehabilitation  		Option) by implementing the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA)  		Medicaid amendment provisions (also known as the Katie Beckett provisions)  		since 1981. Through TEFRA, Wisconsin is able to provide children who are  		Medicaid eligible because of their need for long-term inpatient services with  		services in the home if appropriate. The level-of-care standard present in  		these provisions also appears in the HCBS waiver. </p>
<p>Wisconsin has received two SOC grants from the Center for Mental Health  		Services (CMHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  		(SAMHSA). The first, awarded in 1994, helped to launch the Wraparound Milwaukee  		project; the second, awarded in 1997 and terminated in 2004, helped the  		Northwoods Alliance for Children and Families, a coalition of six counties, to  		enhance home and community services in rural areas and tribal communities.</p>
<p><b>The HCBS Waiver</b></p>
<p>Wisconsins HCBS childrens waivers were approved in November  		2003 and officially went into effect on January 1, 2004. Broadly speaking, the  		SED waiver allows the state to: (1) enroll a specific group of children (i.e.,  		individuals from birth through age 21 with SED who meet specific level-of-care  		and financial eligibility criteria); and (2) provide them with intensive  		services beyond those available through the standard Medicaid benefit package  		or the Rehabilitation Option. Were it not for the waiver, some of these  		children would be ineligible for Medicaid. Children eligible for the HCBS  		waiver program must be at risk for placement into a state psychiatric hospital  		or residential treatment center as established by the level-of-care  		determination process, which includes documentation not only of an emotional  		disability that has persisted for at least six months and is expected to  		persist for a year or longer but also symptoms or functional impairments that  		would place the child at risk for hospitalization. In addition, the child must  		be receiving services from two or more systems that serve children. </p>
<p>The HCBS waiver entitles children and their families to all the standard  		Medicaid services available through the fee-for-service payment system,  		including those provided under the Rehabilitation Option, as well as the  		following community-support services:</p>
<ul><li>Support and service coordination (case management).</li>
<li>Respite care.</li>
<li>Supportive home care (personal care services).</li>
<li>Day habilitation and supported employment services.</li>
<li>Daily living skills training.</li>
<li>Home modifications and specialized transportation.</li>
<li>Adaptive and communication aids as well as specialized medical and  		  therapeutic services.</li>
<li>Personal emergency response systems.</li>
<li>Foster care.</li>
<li>Consumer education and training.</li>
<li>Consumer and family-directed supports, including financial management  		  counseling.</li>
<li>Counseling and therapeutic services.</li>
<li>Training in daily living skills.</li>
<li>Intensive in-home autism treatment.</li>
</ul><p>For each child enrolled in the waiver, clinical county level teams  		develop an individualized service plan. Only the services listed in these plans  		are covered through Medicaid waiver funds. Although Wisconsin is seeking to  		standardize assessment and treatment practices across counties (for example, by  		requiring counties to use the same eligibility assessment and service delivery  		methods and developing one tool for determining the service needs of enrolled  		children), the actual process of developing these plans accounts for the needs  		and circumstances particular to each county. </p>
<p>In its SED waiver application, Wisconsin projected that 280 children  		would be enrolled in the waiver in the first year, rising to 654 in the third  		year. Actual enrollment is about on par with expectations. As of September 30,  		2005, 190 children had been enrolled in the waiver. About half of them,  		according to state officials, are receiving intensive in-home therapeutic and  		rehabilitation services, and about half have moved to less intensive services,  		such as service coordination. Because the waiver is still relatively new, the  		state is just beginning to assemble the data needed to track service trends.  		</p>
<p><b>Financing Issues</b></p>
<p>In its application for the HCBS waiver, Wisconsin estimated that total  		Medicaid costs for waiver-enrolled children would be approximately $20,200 per  		child in the first year of the waiver, compared to approximately $24,100 per  		child for services that would have been used if the waiver were not  		available.</p>
<p>State officials also projected that intensive in-home autism treatment  		would account for a substantial proportion of total expenditures. Specifically,  		it was assumed that, in the first year of the waiver, 65 children with autism  		would need on average 47 units of treatment (defined as one-week of  		intervention) per year at a cost of $740 per unit for a total annual projected  		cost of approximately $2.3 million. The next highest annual total cost  		projection ($892,000) was for counseling and therapeutic resources (including  		treatment provided by psychotherapists, registered nurses, speech and language  		pathologists and occupational, recreational, art, music, or physical  		therapists). Support and service coordination was projected to be the third  		most expensive category, at $457,000 in annual costs. Actual costs for children  		enrolled in the waiver are not yet known because the waiver is still relatively  		new, and complete data for children enrolled in 2004 are not yet available.  		</p>
<p>In terms of financing, counties are required to provide 40 percent of  		the cost of many community mental health services (i.e., targeted case  		management, crisis intervention, community support, and comprehensive service  		programs) provided to children enrolled in Medicaid. These dollars usually  		derive from county tax revenues or general funds from the state. However,  		counties do not have to provide this match for many children enrolled in the  		HCBS waiver. As of June 2005, for example, about 1,400 of the 1,661 children  		enrolled in all three waivers combined were fully matched by the state, meaning  		that counties were not covering any portion of care. </p>
<p>Wisconsin has the funds to fully cover the costs of many children  		enrolled in the waiver program because it was willing to continue covering  		intensive in-home therapy for children with autism even after CMS signaled that  		it would not allow these services to be covered under the standard Medicaid  		program. Around the same time (1999-2000), a total of 1,325 children with  		autism were receiving home-based services at a cost of about $36.5 million  		dollars annually. The state enrolled most of these children in the waiver  		program and now covers the services they receive at a cost of about $26 million  		as part of the its match for waiver services. These dollars allow the state to  		cover intensive in-home services for children with autism at no expense to the  		counties. </p>
<p>State officials report that many counties were initially concerned that  		they would not be able to come up with the requisite match dollars for the HCBS  		waiver. However, these concerns were allayed by a combination of  		factors--including substantial outreach, training, and technical assistance  		from the state and opportunities to receive federal matching dollars for a  		major segment of the enrolled population--that eventually persuaded most  		counties to enroll children in the HCBS waiver program. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the HCBS waiver, the state waives standard Medicaid  		financial eligibility rules, thus allowing only the childs income to be  		considered. As a result, most children who meet the clinical eligibility  		requirements for enrollment are found to be financially eligible as well.  		Eligibility is reviewed annually or whenever there a childs condition  		changes substantially. </p>
<p><b>Managing Access to Residential Care</b></p>
<p>For the past decade, if not more, most counties in Wisconsin have been  		able to proactively manage access to residential care for children with SED  		because ISPs and CSTs have provided the infrastructure for identifying and  		tracking the needs of these children and the services they use. As a result,  		the childrens length of stay in most of the states residential  		treatment centers has become dramatically shorter. Prompted by these trends and  		encouraged specifically by the Wraparound Milwaukee staff, many of these  		centers have begun to offer new community services, including such wraparound  		services as intensive case management and in-home therapies.</p>
<p>CSTs afford other advantages as well. For instance, counties that have  		CSTs must demonstrate to the state that key child-serving agencies are working  		together, which means that child welfare and juvenile justice agencies are  		beginning to work more closely with mental health agencies at both the state  		and local levels. In some counties, this new degree of collaboration is  		prompting the agencies to avoid out-of-home placements for children in the  		juvenile justice system by accelerating access to family education and support  		services as well as intensive in-home therapy. </p>
<p><b>A Model Local Program: Wraparound Milwaukee</b></p>
<p>Supported originally by a 1994 SOC grant from the CMHS of the federal  		SAMHSA, Wraparound Milwaukee was established as a managed care organization  		under the auspices of the County Division of Child Mental Health Services. It  		operates without any type of federal waiver. </p>
<p>Funds once allocated to child welfare and juvenile justice for  		behavioral health services now flow to Wraparound Milwaukee through a case rate  		formula; in addition, Medicaid covers mental health, substance abuse, social  		and other support services through capitated payments for enrolled children.  		Pooled dollars from child welfare, juvenile justice, Medicaid, and mental  		health allow Wraparound Milwaukee not only to accept full risk for enrolled  		children but also to purchase a broad, flexible array of services and supports.  		When necessary, the program pays residential treatment centers for care  		(generally very short-term) on the basis of negotiated fee-for-service  		arrangements, as it does for all other types of services and supports. Children  		enrolled in Wraparound Milwaukee have been adjudicated through the citys  		juvenile court system, all of whom were involved in either the child welfare  		system, the juvenile justice system, or both. </p>
<p>According to one report,<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteB17">17</a></font></sup> Wraparound Milwaukee reduced not only the  		average number of children in residential placements from 375 in 1997 to 50 in  		2003, but also the average residential stay from 14 months to 90 days over the  		same period. At that time, the volume of in-patient psychiatric care fell from  		5,000 to 200 days a year, bringing a corresponding drop in total expenditures.  		</p>
<p>Since the early 2000s, Wraparound Milwaukee staff have moved to  		re-engineer residential treatment by partnering with residential  		care providers to bring the two systems of care closer together. The partners  		have set their sights on creating better linkages between residential care and  		community services, forging close working relationships between residential and  		community program staff around comprehensive treatment and transition planning,  		and involving family and other caregivers in treatment provided during  		residential stays.</p>
<p>Wraparound Milwaukees success as a full-risk managed behavioral  		health organization has been linked to the following key achievements:</p>
<ul><li>Obtaining public support for a change in the roles of child welfare  		  and juvenile justice and thus breaking with tradition by purchasing community  		  services instead of placing children in long-term residential treatment  		  programs.</li>
<li>Creating pooled or braided funds by persuading state agencies of the  		  potential savings that might accrue as a result of purchasing services through  		  case rates and capitated arrangements.</li>
<li>Forming and sustaining partnerships with residential treatment  		  centers in addition to providing them with training to ensure that they could  		  play a substantive role in developing new services and products.</li>
<li>Establishing clear benchmarks and measurable outcomes in order to  		  assess performance and identify successes and problems.</li>
</ul><p>Beyond these accomplishments, Wraparound Milwaukee was recently tapped  		by an HMO in Milwaukee County to provide behavioral health services under their  		contract with the state to manage not only behavioral health care but also all  		physical health and dental care for all children in foster care, or about 3,000  		children county-wide. About 1,500 subsidized adoptive families will be able to  		opt into the program as well.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>Many roads lead to system transformation.</i></li>
</ul><p>Wisconsins counties have considerable autonomy in shaping mental  		health services for children with SED, and as a result, their efforts to build  		comprehensive, integrated mental health service systems for these children vary  		widely. When dollars for improving mental health services for children with SED  		first became available in the late 1980s, some counties began to develop  		systems that were more integrated in that they included wraparound services in  		addition to standard mental health treatment. Two counties implemented a  		managed care model; others used a traditional fee-for-service approach.</p>
<p>During the past two decades, as the state has made other dollars  		available to counties for improving mental health services for children,  		counties have found additional ways to integrate services traditionally  		provided by separate agencies. Some have come together to implement new  		services, such as a multi-county crisis response teams. Others have used the  		Medicaid Rehabilitation Option to support wraparound services. The HCBS waiver  		fits into this mix of options by providing counties with still another way to  		pay for intensive, special services not otherwise covered by Medicaid or to  		cover children not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. </p>
<p>Wisconsin has also benefited from the presence of Wraparound Milwaukee,  		a financing model that has attracted national interest, evidenced by the fact  		that it has been replicated in several sites in other states as well as in Dane  		County, Wisconsin, where it is known as Children Come First. The Wraparound  		Milwaukee staff continue to consult extensively with state and county  		officials, but the former have not pushed for broad implementation of the model  		because many other counties: (1) could not or did not want to take on the  		financial risks inherent in a managed behavioral health model; (2) wanted to  		establish systems that were more independent of the juvenile court system than  		in Wraparound Milwaukee; or (3) could not generate the necessary level of  		leadership and interagency collaboration. Also noteworthy is the fact that two  		important state features affect its ability to make Medicaid managed care  		programs like Wraparound Milwaukee financially feasible. First, almost all of  		Wisconsins seventy-two counties are primarily rural. Second, the counties  		provide matching funding for many Medicaid-funded community services for  		children. Together, these features make it justifiably difficult for the state  		to ensure that it has both enough covered lives and enough money to support  		either a county or a noncounty-based managed care organization.</p>
<ul><li><i>The state sought the three Medicaid HCBS childrens waivers  		  because they afforded federal matching funds for significant unmatched amounts  		  of state and local funds committed to children services. </i></li>
</ul><p>Although Wisconsin funds home and community services for children with  		SED in a variety of ways, state officials saw the HCBS waiver as a way to avail  		itself of another important opportunity to support intensive home and community  		treatment and wraparound services, especially for children with autism. Because  		CMS required Wisconsin to remove in-home treatment services for children from  		coverage under the Rehabilitation Option, these services were added to the HCBS  		waiver for children with SED.</p>
<ul><li><i>State support goes a long way in terms of a countys ability  		  to improve mental health services. </i></li>
</ul><p>Technical assistance from the state can help counties to: (1) develop  		effective practice models and appropriate system infrastructures; and (2) find  		financing for specific services. For example, some counties have been awarded  		CST grants to build inter-agency relationships and infrastructure by providing  		joint training to key staff from the various county-level agencies that serve  		children. Wisconsin is also working closely with its counties to develop  		strategies for identifying and enrolling children into the HCBS waiver. </p>
<p>State officials noted the value of separating practice models from  		funding models. Although the states various child mental health  		initiatives have been based on similar SOC principles, the development and  		implementation of actual programs has varied across counties because of  		differences in leadership, local resources, and population characteristics. In  		addition, funding strategies have varied over time in response to changes in  		both policy and economic conditions in the state. According to state officials,  		the critical tasks are to help counties identify system improvements and then  		help them find the best strategies for financing these improvements given the  		prevailing opportunities and challenges. The nature and extent of assistance  		with these two tasks depends in part on the background and experience of the  		leadership in county mental health agencies. </p>
<ul><li><i>It is possible to forge new relationships between Medicaid and  		  mental health at both the state and county level through efforts to redesign  		  states systems of care, including efforts to develop an HCBS waiver.  		  </i></li>
</ul><p>The process of defining desired outcomes in five key areas and related  		guiding principles led to increased collaboration among key divisions in the  		states Department of Health and Family Services (which houses both  		Medicaid, and the bureaus that house the states HCBS childrens  		waivers). As part of this process, staff from the state mental health agency  		have had to learn more about Medicaid rules, regulations, and approaches to  		funding services based on eligibility groups and state plan provisions. In  		turn, staff from the Medicaid program have learned more about the need for  		flexibility in access to specialized services for selected children with  		SED.</p>
<p>Enhanced collaboration among key agencies at the state level has led to  		a strong foundation for providing guidance and technical assistance to county  		mental health agencies, which typically have little awareness of Medicaid HCBS  		Waiver procedures. Increased understanding of these procedures (and sustained  		access to technical assistance from state staff) has led to an enhanced ability  		among county staff to implement the waiver effectively and, more broadly, to  		cobble different resources together to: (1) improve training of key agency  		staff in relation to services for children with SED; and (2) enhance access to  		coverage of intensive home and community services. </p>
<ul><li><i>It takes time and effort to build local support for systems of  		  care for children with SED.</i></li>
</ul><p>The state mental health agency began work on wraparound services and SOC  		principles for children with SED as far back as 1988. That the current system  		evolved essentially at a snails pace is a product not so much of a lack  		of interest in improving care for these children but of an initial reluctance  		on the part of child-serving agencies in many counties to adopt these  		principles or to support wraparound services. Over the past several years,  		however, the perspective appears to be changing. For example, some county child  		welfare agencies are now contributing Title IV-E dollars to CSTs, and some  		school districts are beginning to contribute special education dollars. In  		addition, staff in the state mental health agency have recently been asked to  		play a role in a new program designed to enhance mental health services in  		local child welfare agencies. State officials suggested that these developments  		signal a deeper willingness among key agencies to work together more closely to  		support a comprehensive, community-based service system for children with SED.  		</p>

<h3><a name="appendC-IL" id="appendC-IL">Feasibility Study and Development  		Project for Community-Based Treatment Alternatives for Children with SED in  		Illinois</a></h3>
<p>Illinois supports children with serious emotional disorders (SED)  		through the Individual Care Grant (ICG) program. Operated by the Division of  		Mental Health (DMH) in the Department of Human Services (DHS), the ICG program  		includes children who have severe impairments in accurately understanding the  		world around them (e.g., psychotic symptoms) and who are not in state custody.  		Eligibility is determined based on severity of mental illness, severity of  		impairment, and residency status (i.e., child resides with family and the  		family members are residents of the State of Illinois). There are no financial  		eligibility criteria for participation in the ICG program. About half of the  		children in the ICG program are enrolled in Medicaid. With an annual budget of  		approximately $25 million, the program serves about 440 children.</p>
<p>The ICG program offers families of enrolled children two placement  		options: residential setting or community services. The latter includes such  		services as one-on-one therapeutic stabilization, behavioral management skills  		training, and therapeutic recreation and after-school services. The decision as  		to whether children are placed in a residential facility or in the  		community-based program rests with the family. Currently, about 25 percent of  		enrolled children are in the community-based program. </p>
<p>Illinois also operates a pre-screening program for youth with mental  		health problems, including children with SED in the ICG program, called the  		Screening, Assessment, and Support Services (SASS) program.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC1">1</a></font></sup> SASS agencies offer a single  		point of access to the mental health system for children with SED who are  		referred for hospital level residential care and provide services to a wide  		range of low-income children with SED, including those in the child welfare  		system. The agencies are financed by DMH, the Department of Public Aid (DPA,  		the states Medicaid agency), and the Division of Children and Families  		(DCFS, the child welfare agency). </p>
<p>In 2003, DHS received a $100,000 Real Choice Systems Change grant from  		the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) to conduct a study that  		would allow it to develop recommendations geared to improving the ICG  		community-based program as an alternative to residential treatment.  		Specifically, the study was conducted to gather information from consumers and  		providers regarding barriers to community care for this group of children and  		to identify ways to improve community services so that more families would  		elect to place their ICG-enrolled children in this option. Such improvements  		could include additional provider and consumer training, changes in program  		administration, modifications to the administrative rule that governs the ICG  		program, or securing an home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver through  		which additional services for youth with SED could be financed.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Developed in the mid 1970s, the ICG program initially offered only  		residential care. Five years ago, the administrative rule governing the program  		was amended to allow community treatment. As a result, approximately 10 percent  		of the 400 youth in the program began receiving community services at that  		time; as noted, this figure has risen to 25 percent. DMH currently pays an  		average of approximately $19,000 per recipient per year in the community-based  		program and $85,000-$90,000 per recipient per year in residential care. DMH  		pays providers on a fee-for-service basis. Illinois views the ICG program as an  		entitlement, which means that funds for individual ICG recipients (and for the  		program as a whole) are uncapped.</p>
<p>About half of the children in the ICG program are not Medicaid eligible,  		and DMH uses state dollars to cover community-based ICG services provided to  		these children. For Medicaid-eligible children, Medicaid pays for all standard  		services offered under the state plan, including services covered under the  		clinic and rehabilitation options. The Medicaid rehabilitation option in  		Illinois is quite comprehensive in terms of services offered. Illinois draws  		down the federal financial participation (FFP) dollars for these services and  		deposits them into its general revenue. DMH pays for some mental health  		services, and the state returns the federal match for these services to a  		special mental health fund. Although Medicaid covers a portion of residential  		services, the ICG program only began to bill Medicaid for such services as  		recently as this year. Before then, DMH used state dollars to pay the entire  		cost of residential treatment for youth in the ICG program. DMH also pays for  		some community services offered through ICG program that are not covered by  		Medicaid, including one-to-one therapeutic stabilization services, behavior  		management, and therapeutic recreation and after-school services. </p>
<p>All families in the ICG program have contact with SASS agencies, which  		help families navigate the service system and provide referrals to the least  		restrictive, most appropriate level of care given a childs mental health  		status, including a residential facility for ICG youth whose parents have  		elected the residential care option. All ICG families also receive ongoing case  		coordination services from SASS agencies. For families who elect the  		community-based option, SASS helps to plan for and, in some cases, provide the  		community services and supports listed on the familys treatment plan.  		These services can include: </p>
<ul><li>Therapeutic stabilization services, such as one-on-one interventions  		  between professionals and the ICG participant to enhance specific social or  		  life-management skills.</li>
<li>Child support services, including therapeutic recreation such as  		  camps and after-school services.</li>
<li>Behavior management services, including, for example, a  		  weight-reduction program offered by a dietician.</li>
</ul><p>In 2003, Illinois passed the Childrens Mental Health Act, which  		created the Childrens Mental Health Partnership and mandated that DPA,  		DHS, and DCFS work together through the SASS program to provide screening,  		assessment, and treatment for any child at risk of psychiatric hospitalization;  		enhance access to coordinated community services in lieu of or following  		residential treatment; and effectively link families to the appropriate level  		of care to meet their childrens needs. The partnership is working to  		develop a childrens mental health plan that will include short and  		long-term recommendations for: (1) providing comprehensive, coordinated mental  		health services related to prevention, early intervention, and treatment for  		children; (2) possible changes to the state budget for childrens mental  		health services; and (3) mechanisms for integrating federal, state, and local  		funding streams to support mental health care for children. This plan is  		scheduled for release in 2005.</p>
<p><b>The Feasibility Study</b></p>
<p>As noted, Illinois received a grant from CMS to conduct a feasibility  		study that would develop recommendations for improving its community-based  		option as an alternative to residential treatment for youth in the ICG program.  		DMH hired a health care consultant to conduct a series of focus groups and  		telephone surveys in late spring 2004 with 15 ICG providers, 58 parents, and  		six ICG program participants. The purpose of these focus groups was to assess  		barriers to providing community-based mental health care.</p>
<p>To support the development and implementation of its feasibility study,  		DMH established an 11-member governance council that included six parents, two  		ICG program staff, and staff from three SASS agencies. DMH invited one of the  		parents from the governance council to serve as co-principal investigator for  		the study. This parent worked with DMH staff to write the CMS grant proposal  		and will do the same with regard to the final report, which is due to be  		completed later this year. A teen advisory council, established by DMH, also  		assisted in the design of the survey for the youth focus groups. </p>
<p><i><b>Focus Group Findings</b></i></p>
<p>According to ICG staff, findings from the parent focus groups suggests  		that parents: </p>
<ul><li>Like therapeutic stabilization services partly because the one-on-one  		  interactions between children and the mental health professionals give parents  		  some respite.</li>
<li>Value therapeutic recreation services because they provide children  		  with normative developmental experiences.</li>
<li>Are not clear about the role that SASS providers do or could play in  		  the provision of ICG services.</li>
<li>Expressed the need for more respite services, transportation,  		  linkages with the special education system, and assistance with  		  transition.</li>
</ul><p>The youth who participated in the focus groups said that they need more  		family therapy, particularly during stays at residential treatment facilities  		or psychiatric hospitals, so that they (and their families) are better prepared  		when they re-enter the home after being discharged from the facility. In  		addition, these youth want more vocational and transitional support services to  		help them enter college or find employment.</p>
<p>According to results from the provider focus groups, providers believe  		that SASS staff need training to help them better understand their role and the  		relevant service delivery systems so that they can advocate more effectively  		for the youth they serve.</p>
<p><i><b>Next Steps</b></i></p>
<p>Based on the focus group findings, the governance council developed a  		report indicating its recommendations for changes to the ICG program. Many of  		these recommendations are programmatic, focusing on issues such as SASS  		provider training. However, some of the recommendations address services that  		are not currently available, including respite care, wraparound facilitation,  		and transportation and transitional services. In the coming months, DMH will  		assess these recommendations to decide which to implement and how best to pay  		for them. DMH is considering two financing options to make these services more  		widely available: applying for a Medicaid HCBS waiver, changing the Illinois  		administrative rule governing the services available through the ICG program,  		or both. DMHs final decision will be influenced by the findings and  		recommendations of the Childrens Mental Health Partnership. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>State legislation brought with it the opportunity to improve the  		  system of care for children with SED in Illinois.</i> </li>
</ul><p>Through the Childrens Mental Health Act of 2003, Illinois has  		taken a critical step in developing a single point of access for hospital level  		care by requiring SASS agencies to respond directly to hospitals and emergency  		rooms whenever a child presents with symptoms that require immediate  		hospitalization or crisis intervention services. Additionally, SASS agencies  		and inpatient facilities are beginning to coordinate discharge planning to  		ensure that youth with SED are adequately prepared to re-enter their homes and  		communities when they are released from these facilities. </p>
<ul><li><i>Although the ICG program has given Illinois extensive experience  		  in developing and operating home and community services for a targeted group of  		  children with SED, the state still faces major challenges in developing service  		  capacity and selecting the most appropriate strategy for expanding community  		  services.</i></li>
</ul><p>Through the ICG program, Illinois has developed an array of community  		services for children with high-end, multisystem needs. However, the state  		faces several challenges to improving the community services available to ICG  		program recipients and to other children who could benefit from intensive home  		and community services. For instance, several of the services parents requested  		in focus groups are either not part of the current service array or limited to  		families with access to Medicaid or KidCare, the State Childrens Health  		Insurance Program. In addition, some community services, such as therapeutic  		stabilization services, are also scarce, especially in rural areas. </p>
<p>Overall, if Illinois is to improve its community services, it will need  		to show the families of ICG program participants that such services are  		available and effective, allowing parents to keep their children at home  		safely. Illinois appears to be succeeding in this effort because the number of  		families selecting the community-based option has increased during the last  		five years. However, many families that could benefit from community services  		are still choosing residential treatment, suggesting that there is room for  		more progress.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing the numbers of providers, Illinois could  		expand community services either by funding a broader array of services or by  		making services available to more children with SED. Although the state would  		like to make more community services available in the future, it is still  		trying to determine the best way to reach this goal. A 1915(c) waiver is one  		possibility, but the state is still in the early stages of determining which  		services it would cover with a waiver, which children with SED would be served  		under the waiver, and how to show cost neutrality relative to in-patient  		hospitalization.</p>
<h3><a name="appendC-MD" id="appendC-MD">Feasibility Study and Development  		Project for Community-Based Treatment Alternatives for Children with SED in  		Maryland</a></h3>
<p>Since 1997, Marylands Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA) has  		explored various strategies for re-allocating dollars from residential  		treatment to community services for youth with serious emotional disturbances  		(SED). In July of that year, for example, the MHA applied for an HCBS waiver  		for youth with SED. The application was denied, however, because the state had  		used residential treatment facilities (RTFs) rather than psychiatric hospitals  		or inpatient facilities as the basis for establishing cost  		neutrality.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As a result, the MHA is exploring the possibility of implementing a  		wraparound model of service delivery in which selected entities would be paid a  		standard case rate for managing services for selected children with SED. In  		return, the entities would be expected to assume the risk for all mental health  		service costs but not for the costs of physical health services,  		pharmaceuticals, or laboratory tests.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC3">3</a></font></sup> In 2003, the MHA received a $100,000 Centers  		for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Real Choice Systems Change grant to  		implement a wraparound model for delivering effective home and community  		services for children with SED, based on the experience of Wraparound  		Milwaukee. The MHA is using grant funds to develop appropriate case rates,  		strengthen the interagency foundation needed to test a wraparound program in  		two locations, and build support for this model among the leaders of the  		states RTFs. </p>
<p><b>Overview </b></p>
<p>In 1997, Maryland received an 1115 waiver to implement a Medicaid  		managed care program, which the state named HealthChoice. Under this program,  		physical health and substance abuse treatment services are delivered by health  		maintenance organizations. Mental health services are delivered through a  		carve-out overseen by the MHA, which also has responsibility for the  		carve-outs Medicaid match. MHA shares its oversight responsibility with  		local core service agencies (CSAs), which receive money from the MHA to  		contract with mental health care providers for services. MHA also contracts, on  		a nonrisk, fee-for-service basis, with an administrative service organization  		for utilization management, provider enrollment, and claims payment. </p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Baltimore Citys CSA developed a partial  		capitation pilot program for its adult chronically ill population, the goal  		being to move adults with serious and persistent mental illness out of  		psychiatric in-patient and residential settings and into community services.  		Over the past several years, Maryland has designed but not yet implemented a  		similar program for children in or at risk for entering residential treatment  		settings. As mentioned, the program is modeled on Wraparound Milwaukee and  		expects to pay providers a standard case rate. The current plan is to  		pilot-test the program in two jurisdictions: Baltimore City and Montgomery  		County.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC4">4</a></font></sup> At present,  		MHA Medicaid pays for virtually all youth in residential treatment, including  		children not eligible for Medicaid, because the states family of  		one option allows it to waive income limits for youth who meet disability  		criteria for RTF placement. </p>
<p>The state plans to enroll 200 children in the program, but it has not  		decided how many children will be enrolled from each jurisdiction. Eligible  		families will be able to choose between the pilot program with wraparound  		services and RTF placement. The state will finance the pilots by redirecting  		what are now largely Medicaid dollars that pay for Baltimore City and  		Montgomery County youth in and at risk for residential treatment. A small  		amount of the redirected funds will be set aside in a risk pool for children  		with particularly severe conditions, the cost of which may exceed the  		case-rate. The state plans to contract with a local management entity in each  		of the two pilot sites to manage care for program participants. The average  		treatment spell is expected to range from 16 to 18 months and to cost about  		$4,500-5,000 per child per month (compared to current RTF stays of about 12  		months on average at a cost as high as $7,000 per child per month). </p>
<p>Both Baltimore City and Montgomery County volunteered to be pilot  		jurisdictions. In addition to wanting to build on its partial capitation pilot  		program for adults with chronic mental illness, Baltimore City is one of the  		top jurisdictions in terms of the number of children in residential treatment  		settings. Montgomery County, where a substantial number of children with SED  		are in residential care, volunteered $1.6 million in funds to match federal  		dollars. If, through the pilot, Baltimore City or Montgomery County reduces the  		overall cost of services for participating children, it is not yet clear  		whether either jurisdiction will be allowed to keep a portion of the savings.  		</p>
<p>Both pilot-tests are being launched under the auspices of the Maryland  		Wraparound Committee, an interagency body, formed after House Bill 1386 was  		passed, that is dedicated both to strengthening a coordinated system of care  		for children who are likely to be placed in residential treatment settings and  		facilitating their re-integration into the community. The committees  		mission reflects the legislatures growing interest in reducing its heavy  		reliance on residential care in favor of family support and community services.  		</p>
<p>Despite support for the wraparound model, the legislature has indicated  		that no new dollars will be made available for the pilot programs. However, if  		the state can increase access to community services and if this leads to the  		closure of residential treatment beds, then the funds once used to support  		these beds may be re-directed to expanding community services for youth with  		SED. </p>
<p>Marylands RTFs have not opposed this initiative, in part because  		the MHA has developed positive and collaborative relationships with the  		residential treatment center community. Center representatives and MHA leaders  		meet every six weeks to review issues of common interest. Although some centers  		have begun to develop experience in providing community services, many  		residential treatment providers remain concerned that a rapid transition to  		community services will threaten their viability. </p>
<p><b>The Feasibility Study</b></p>
<p>As noted, Maryland received a grant from CMS to examine the feasibility  		of implementing a wraparound model for delivering home and community services  		for children with SED. In terms of building support for community-based  		alternatives to residential treatment for children with SED, Maryland has used  		or is planning to use the CMS grant funds to:</p>
<ul><li>Subcontract with the Center for Mental Health Services Research at  		  the University of Maryland to conduct actuarial analyses that will define the  		  capitation rates for the pilot programs in Baltimore City and Montgomery  		  County.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC5">5</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Explore how wraparound concepts and case rate strategies can be  		  applied to Baltimore City and Montgomery County by consulting with the  		  directors of Wraparound Milwaukee, the Dawn Project of Indianapolis (which is  		  also based on a wraparound model), and the Baltimore adult capitation  		  project.</li>
<li>Convene an expert panel to provide information and guidance in a  		  roundtable format to the leaders of residential treatment centers, the goal  		  being to support efforts to redirect funds from residential care to community  		  services.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Continuing Challenges</b></i></p>
<p>Although the state is building the foundation for a full-scale  		wraparound program, it has yet to find an administrative mechanism that will  		allow Medicaid to pay for all of the types of intensive home and community  		services that will be included in that program but that are not part of the  		states standard Medicaid plan. MHA and the Maryland Wraparound Committee  		are exploring several waiver-related options for addressing this  		challenge.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A second challenge involves persuading other agencies to participate in  		the wraparound program. Specifically, the MHA is hoping that social service and  		juvenile justice agencies will contribute dollars to fund the program because  		they are responsible for large numbers of children with SED in residential  		settings. However, they do not have an incentive to support the program because  		as long as a child is in a residential facility, MHA (through the Medicaid  		match) picks up the cost of care. The Wraparound Committee is working on  		getting child welfare and juvenile justice to understand the role that a  		wraparound system of care can play in reducing direct costs to their systems,  		such as costs related to group homes, detention centers, and foster care. The  		MHA also is beginning discussions with the state Department of Education to  		investigate whether improvements in community-based care will affect the use of  		nonpublic day school programs for youth with SED.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>Finding a way to support community services can be time-consuming  		  even when a detailed plan is available. </i></li>
</ul><p>The individuals who developed the wraparound program submitted a report  		in July 2003 that described the proposed model for delivering effective home  		and community services for children with SED, but the state has yet to  		implement the program statewide for various reasons. In addition to facing  		budget constraints, the state has not yet identified the appropriate  		administrative mechanism, waiver or otherwise, through which to implement the  		program. State Medicaid officials believe that a waiver is needed for two  		reasons: (1) to ensure that Medicaid can cover intensive services for children  		with SED that are not now in the state plan without opening up the entitlement  		to additional services for all children; and (2) to provide the mechanism for  		controlling costs by controlling the number of individuals eligible for the  		waiver. </p>
<ul><li><i>Prudent arguments for strengthening home and community services  		  involve redirecting existing funds rather than projecting substantial cost  		  savings. </i></li>
</ul><p>In light of recent actuarial analyses, state officials have concluded  		that a comprehensive plan to strengthen home and community services should be  		based not on the possibility of the cost savings that could result, but on  		re-directing existing dollars from residential services. Although this argument  		is the more realistic one, it may not be the more appealing in terms of  		generating legislative support. </p>
<ul><li><i>Braided funding is an effective way to garner financial support  		  for a wraparound program because it allows each agency to retain some control  		  over its dollars.</i></li>
</ul><p>Maryland has turned to braided funding as the means for bringing other  		agencies on board with regard to developing a large-scale wraparound program.  		Unlike pooled funding, braided funding allows each agency to see where its  		money goes because each contribution covers a specific portion of a defined  		case-rate for a defined number of children.</p>
<h3><a name="appendC-MS" id="appendC-MS">Feasibility Study and Development  		Project for Community-Based Treatment Alternatives for Children with SED in  		Mississippi</a></h3>
<p>Mississippi has been working to enhance its capacity to provide care for  		children with serious emotional disorders (SED) and their families since the  		mid 1990s, when it passed legislation allowing the state level social service  		agencies to blend their funding streams for mental health services. The  		Department of Human Services (DHS, which includes the child welfare and  		juvenile justice agencies), and the Department of Education each contributed  		$50,000 per year, and the Department of Mental Health (DMH) put in $100,000 per  		year. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation also provided a $100,000 technical  		assistance grant through its initiative, Mental Health Services for Youth  		Replication. </p>
<p>In addition, in 1996, the Pine-Belt community mental health center  		(CMHC) was awarded $600,000 to initiate a small pilot project in Forrest County  		with a blended global rate for flexible wraparound services for  		children with SED who had been hospitalized or who were at immediate risk of  		hospitalization. The project, Mississippi Connections, served 43 children from  		1996 thorough 2000. It reduced out-of-community placements by 95 percent in its  		first year of operation and spent $1.2 million (or an average of $53 per client  		per day) over four years.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC7">7</a></font></sup> Residential treatment costs, in contrast,  		were about $250 per child per day. Despite its success, Mississippi Connections  		ended in 2000, when the state political landscape level changed and DHS  		withdrew funding. </p>
<p>In 2000, the state established the Mental Health Services Division, the  		first unit in Medicaid focused specifically on mental health services. In 2001,  		the Mississippi legislature passed a law creating a state system-of-care (SOC)  		program in an effort to divert youth with SED from inappropriate institutional  		placement. The law mandated that the states child-serving agencies work  		together to plan and develop a service system through the Interagency  		Coordinating Council for Children and Youth and the Interagency System of Care  		Council (ISCC). The council brings together executive staff from the state  		agencies that serve children with SED, including DHS, Medicaid, DMH, the  		Department of Education, the Department of Rehabilitation Services, and the  		State Department of Education; the council also includes Mississippi Families  		As Allies (a parent organization). The ISCC comprises mid level managers from  		the respective agencies, who are responsible for long-range planning for  		at-risk children. At the county level, Mississippi has established  		Multidisciplinary Assessment and Planning (MAP) teams, which work with families  		of youth with SED to develop individualized service plans.</p>
<p>Although these developments have enhanced access to community services  		for many children with SED, children with the most serious conditions still  		enter residential care because the intensive services required by them and  		their families are not available in the community. To address this problem, the  		state Medicaid agency obtained a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  		(CMS) Real Choice Systems Change grant in 2003 to examine the feasibility of  		using a home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver to provide  		nontraditional services for children with SED who require a very high level of  		care. </p>
<p><b>Service Environment</b></p>
<p>Mississippi provides community-based mental health services for children  		through 15 regional CMHCs, each of which serves several counties. The CMHCs are  		quasi-governmental, public entities operated by local commissions and  		comprising representatives appointed by the Board of Supervisors from each  		county in their catchment areas. The state DMH monitors CMHC performance and  		secures state Medicaid match funds for the CMHCs through the legislative  		process but has no direct line of authority over the CMHCs. Aside from  		providing traditional counseling and distributing medications, CMHCs vary  		widely in the services they offer and especially in their capacity to provide  		intensive, individualized services for children with SED. </p>
<p>Although Mississippi has the Medicaid rehabilitation services option,  		the state does not use it to pay for the intensive in-home support and  		crisis-diversion services frequently required by this group of children and  		their families. Medicaid does pay for residential treatment, however. </p>
<p>DMH, the states child mental health agency, has very limited  		general revenue funds for community services. DHS provides therapeutic foster  		care and therapeutic group homes but has limited funds for nontraditional  		community services. </p>
<p>Mississippi has approximately 250 beds for youth at six in-state  		psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) and access to an  		additional 65 beds (including five specifically for children with SED who are  		deaf) in residential facilities in Tennessee, Texas, and Florida. Any  		child-serving agency can refer children for placement in a PRTF, although  		admission must be pre-certified as medically necessary by a peer review  		organization or a quality improvement or utilization management organization.  		HealthSystems of Mississippi now performs this function. Some PRTFs have begun  		to develop their own set of community services to help children as they move  		through different levels of care. However, this type of  		continuum-of-care approach is scarce in most parts of  		Mississippi.</p>
<p>In 33 of the states 88 counties, local MAP teams work with  		families of children with SED to develop individualized service plans. The  		teams receive a small amount of flexible funding ($15,000-25,000 per year per  		team) from the DMH for services that are not reimbursable through Medicaid.  		Children and youth with SED whom MAP teams cannot serve are referred to a state  		level case review team, which is charged with developing an appropriate service  		plan through interagency collaboration.</p>
<p>The state covers some children with SED under the Tax Equity and Fiscal  		Responsibility Act option, although services under this option are limited to  		children with SED who also have mental retardation or developmental  		disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Current Community Level Projects</b></i></p>
<p>Mississippi currently has a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  		Administration (SAMHSA) funded SOC project in the Jackson metropolitan area  		(Hinds County) that is providing services to 244 children. The project,  		Children of Mississippi and Their Parents Accessing Strength-Based Services  		(COMPASS), brought together DHS, DMH, Catholic Charities (the social service  		agency of the Catholic Diocese of Jackson), Mississippi Families As Allies, and  		schools in Jackson to improve the system of care available to children with  		SED.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC8">8</a></font></sup> The project  		helped the regional CMHC, which had been one of the lowest performing centers  		in the state, to draw down more state match funds from Medicaid for children  		with SED. COMPASS also established satellite clinics of the CMHC in local  		schools, allowing them to deliver mental health services to additional  		children. This year, the project expanded to include Rankin County, which is  		served by another regional CMHC. Now in its sixth year, COMPASS recently  		received an extension from SAMHSA to continue through August 2006. The state is  		working on a plan to ensure that the children now enrolled will continue to  		have access to community services when the project ends next year, but the  		success of these efforts is dubious, given the historical absence of public  		mental health services.</p>
<p><b>The Feasibility Study</b></p>
<p>Mississippi awarded the contract to conduct its feasibility study to  		Vanderbilt University, which will work with the state to:</p>
<ul><li>Determine whether to apply for a Medicaid 1915(c) waiver or a  		  Medicaid 1915(b)(c) combination waiver;</li>
<li>Examine how many children either waiver could cover;</li>
<li>Develop a waiver application;</li>
<li>Establish a case rate for the target population; and</li>
<li>Build support for a 10-year implementation grant from CMS. </li>
</ul><p>In a recent study, staff at DMH identified 700 children with SED as  		high-end users. If possible, the state would like to develop a waiver  		application that would allow it to serve all of these children.</p>
<p>Either type of Medicaid waiver under consideration would allow  		Mississippi to finance an expanded array of community services for a limited  		number of children who are poorly served by the current system. This approach  		is attractive to state officials because it would allow them to control costs  		by limiting the number of children served. Either waiver also would give  		Mississippi the opportunity to serve children who are not Medicaid eligible  		under the states regular eligibility rules and to limit services to  		certain areas in the state (such as the Jackson metro area) where a  		community-based program would be feasible. </p>
<p>State officials also are investigating the possibility of contracting  		with a management entity that would accept risk for providing a continuum of  		services to selected children with SED (basing eligibility upon medical  		necessity criteria) and be financed through multiple sources. Using this  		approach, the state could avoid submitting a waiver. Overall, state officials  		noted that a major reason for conducting the feasibility study was to position  		the state for a possible ten-year implementation grant from CMS. </p>
<p>The study itself will involve the analysis of state Medicaid claims and  		administrative data, the goal being to develop a single case-rate for providers  		willing to serve as the management entity for the target population. The study  		also will include a series of public meetings, supported by the state and led  		by Mississippi Families As Allies, to identify the services that families  		believe are needed to support children with SED in their homes. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>Although the state has implemented several community projects for  		  children with SED and has established a variety of mechanisms at the state and  		  local level to support interagency collaboration in service planning and  		  development, this experience has not been enough to overcome funding  		  constraints that are preventing DMH and Medicaid from paying for intensive  		  community services for youth with SED. </i></li>
</ul><p>The hallmarks of Mississippis effort to improve services for  		children with SED include the Mississippi Connections project in Forrest  		County, the COMPASS project in the Jackson metropolitan area, the Interagency  		Coordinating Council for Children and Youth, local MAP teams, and the state  		level case review team. But despite these achievements in program development  		and infrastructure, Mississippi has not been able to adequately serve the  		majority of children with SED because of funding constraints and less than full  		use of the rehabilitation option. Neither DMH nor Medicaid can pay for the  		intensive community services that would allow children with SED to remain in  		their homes, and the state has not used the rehabilitation option to the full  		extent because it would require the state to increase substantially its  		investments in community services and make services available to a large group  		of children with mental health needs.</p>
<ul><li><i>The absence of a residential care gatekeeper is adding to  		  Mississippis fiscal problems. </i></li>
</ul><p>Although Medicaid pays for all residential care and acute in-patient  		treatment for children with SED in Mississippi, the program has little control  		over the amount it pays out for this service because any child-serving agency  		(including DHS, DMH and the 15 regional CMHCs) can refer a child who meets  		medical need criteria for residential placement. The state health plan  		determines the number of PRTF beds, and additional beds are granted through the  		legislative process. As more PRTF beds are opened each year, and more children  		are referred for residential treatment, the escalating cost of treatment is  		compounding the states fiscal problems. In state fiscal year 2004, for  		example, 94 new residential beds became available at an average cost per bed  		per day of $250. </p>
<ul><li><i>An HCBS waiver is attractive to Mississippi for two reasons: (1)  		  it would support the expansion of services for children with SED while limiting  		  the states liability; and (2) it may be the avenue for a substantial  		  infusion of federal grant funds if they become available.</i> </li>
</ul><p>Mississippi hopes to use information gathered through its feasibility  		study to pursue a long-term HCBS waiver implementation demonstration, a project  		that would be fully funded by the Federal Government. Even if the state is  		unsuccessful in these efforts, it views a waiver as being more feasible to  		implement than other options (such as expanding state services or expanding the  		Medicaid rehabilitation option) because a waiver provides the means for  		limiting the states liability by limiting the size of the population  		eligible for intensive services. </p>
<p>Mississippi will only be able to move forward with a waiver application  		if the rule requiring it to show budget neutrality relative to in-patient  		expenditures is modified to include PRTF expenditures. Because most children  		with SED in Mississippi who need hospital level-of-care do not stay in  		in-patient hospitals for more than 10-15 days before moving to PRTFs, average  		annual per-child Medicaid expenditures for hospital level care in Mississippi  		are relatively low. As a result, the state would be unable to demonstrate that  		community services are budget-neutral relative to in-patient expenditures. If  		the rule were amended to allow comparisons with PRTF expenditures, Mississippi  		would have the data needed to show budget neutrality in a waiver  		application.</p>
<h3><a name="appendC-MO" id="appendC-MO">Feasibility Study and Development  		Project for Community-Based Treatment Alternatives for Children with SED in  		Missouri</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context</b></p>
<p>As part of its continuing effort to improve its mental health system for  		children, Missouri has focused recently on ensuring that parents do not have to  		relinquish custody of their children in order to gain access to mental health  		services. In 2003, the state passed Senate Bill 266 (SB266), which requires the  		Department of Mental Health (DMH) and the Department of Social Services (DSS)  		to jointly prepare a plan to provide mental health services and related support  		to children who would otherwise be placed in DSS custody solely to receive  		mental health services. DMH and DSS were charged with determining the  		feasibility of securing federal funds, including Medicaid waivers, to provide  		mental health services to these children. </p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, the state convened an interagency group to: (1)  		identify children placed in state custody solely to access mental health  		services; and (2) explore how the mental health needs of these children might  		be met without placing them in state custody. The group included  		representatives from the state DSS Childrens Division, DMH, the Office of  		State Courts Administrator, Citizens for Missouris Children, and parents  		and local representatives. Based on information indicating that many children  		placed in state custody need a residential level of care that families are  		often unable to pay for, the group developed a statewide protocol to divert  		children from state custody solely to access mental health services. This  		protocol is predicated on the belief that no parent should have to relinquish  		custody of their child in order to access mental health services if clinically  		appropriate services and supports, either within or outside the home, can be  		provided. </p>
<p>In 2004, Missouri passed Senate Bill 1003 (SB1003), expanding SB266 in  		several ways. First, it requires the Childrens Division to both identify  		children who are in its custody solely because of their mental health needs and  		develop an individualized service plan for each child in conjunction with the  		appropriate agencies and the family within 60 days of when childrens  		mental health needs are identified. These plans, which indicate which agencies  		will provide and pay for services, subject to appropriations, are submitted to  		the juvenile court for approval, after which children are returned to the  		custody of their families. </p>
<p>Second, SB1003 expands SB266 by creating a new funding relationship  		between DMH and the Childrens Division. After children return to the  		custody of their family, DMH can bill the Childrens Division for the cost  		of services as specified in the individualized service plan and in the  		associated financing agreement between the two agencies. </p>
<p>Third, the legislation waives the standard means test for children in  		need of mental health services to avoid custody transfers to DSS and authorizes  		DMH, in partnership with the state child serving departments, to establish the  		Comprehensive System Management Team (CSMT). This interagency team, which is  		charged with developing a comprehensive, coordinated childrens mental  		health service system, includes representatives from DMH, DSS, the Department  		of Elementary and Secondary Education, health, public safety, juvenile justice,  		child advocacy organizations, family run organizations, and family members.  		</p>
<p>Based on the interagency efforts to improve mental health services for  		children, especially those in DSS custody, Missouri pursued and was awarded a  		three-year, $99,821 Real Choice Systems Change grant in 2003 from the Centers  		for Medicare and Medicaid Services to conduct a feasibility study that would  		guide the state in designing and implementing a comprehensive system of  		community services and supports for children with serious emotional  		disturbances (SED). DMH and DSS hope that the feasibility study fulfills the  		requirements of SB266 by allowing the state to:</p>
<ul><li>Identify children with SED who are in the custody of DSS exclusively  		  because they need for mental health services and where there is no instance of  		  abuse, neglect, or abandonment.</li>
<li>Estimate the extent and nature of current Medicaid, DMH, and DSS  		  expenditures for these children.</li>
<li>Determine the cost of providing mental health services for these  		  children in the community.</li>
</ul><p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Mental health services funded by DMH are currently provided through 25  		nonprofit, community mental health centers (CMHCs) that contract with DMH. Most  		CMHCs provide services in-house, although a few also contract with other  		providers in the community. These services include screening and assessment,  		crisis services, general out-patient services, targeted case management, and  		medication management. </p>
<p>CMHCs also administer Missouris community psychiatric  		rehabilitation program (CPRP), which is supported by the Medicaid  		rehabilitation option and provides an array of community services such as  		evaluations, crisis intervention, community support, medication management, and  		psychosocial rehabilitation to individuals with severe, disabling mental  		illness. CPRP started as a program for adults but began serving children five  		to six years ago. Children with SED receive maintenance, rehabilitation, or  		intensive levels of care based on need. Because of budget constraints, however,  		CPRP cannot support all children with SED. </p>
<p>In 2000, the child-serving divisions in DMH, DSS, and the Department of  		Health and Senior Services, along with the Department of Elementary and  		Secondary Education launched the Interdepartmental Initiative for Children with  		Severe Needs, a behavioral health carve-out for children with serious and  		complex disorders. These divisions pooled their funding to support  		community-based alternatives to residential care, intensive case management,  		and activities to ensure child-serving agencies partner with families in  		developing individualized care plans for about 250 children with severe  		behavioral health needs in the St. Louis area and in an 18-county area in  		central Missouri. Services available under the initiative were provided through  		a care management organization, which received a case-rate for each enrolled  		child, financed by contributions from divisions within DMH (14 percent) and DSS  		(86 percent).<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC9">9</a></font></sup> The  		initiative ended in 2002, two years after it was launched. </p>
<p>In addition to the CMHCs, Missouri operates two residential treatment  		facilities (RTFs), which are monitored by DSSs Family Support Division.  		The state also contracts with many residential treatment providers.  		Historically, children with SED have been placed in RTFs by the courts or by  		private physicians following emergency placement in a psychiatric hospital.  		</p>
<p>In 2003, the interagency group convened by the state to identify ways to  		prevent children from entering state custody solely to access mental health  		services determined that many of these children were being discharged from  		in-patient psychiatric facilities with recommendations for long-term  		residential treatment. However, because most insurance plans do not cover this  		kind of treatment, families had no recourse but to give up custody directly to  		the Childrens Division or to refuse to pick the child up on the day of  		discharge, leading the facility staff to call the Child Abuse Hotline and  		transfer custody to the state on the basis of abandonment. In response, the  		group developed a statewide protocol whereby families would be linked to  		appropriate community services after their children were discharged from  		in-patient psychiatric facilities or PRTFs. In addition, during the past  		several years, DMH has been working with the state juvenile courts both to  		assess the level of care needed by adjudicated youth with mental health  		problems and to find alternatives to residential placement. As a result, DMH  		has begun to see a drop in court-mandated residential placements.</p>
<p><b>The Feasibility Study</b></p>
<p><i><b>Goals</b></i></p>
<p>Missouris feasibility study was intended to develop a demographic,  		service use, and cost profile of the children placed in the states  		custody solely to receive mental health services. Missouri also hoped the study  		would identify financing options for a comprehensive system of care capable of  		providing these children with services in the community. The central issue  		examined in the study was how to expand access to mental health services  		and supports in order to prevent parents from having to turn to the child  		welfare system for help.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Methods</b></i></p>
<p>Missouri contracted with a consultant to develop the study, which would  		focus on children age 3-17 who had been removed from their homes because of a  		behavior problem, a disability, alcohol abuse (either by the parent or the  		child), abandonment, or relinquishment, or who had been placed in an  		institutional setting within 90 days of removal and had received mental health  		services within six months of placement. Utilization and payment data from DMH  		and DSS were used to estimate the quantity and cost of mental health services  		provided to children placed in state custody for the purpose of accessing  		mental health services before and after entering the states care. The  		study excluded children for whom there was a substantiated report of abuse or  		neglect and those with moderate or severe retardation or developmental  		disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Findings and Recommendations</b></i></p>
<p>In calendar year 2002, a total of 296 children were in state custody  		solely for the purpose of accessing mental health services. Virtually all of  		these children received Medicaid while in custody, but only 15 percent were  		eligible for Social Security Act Title IV-E funding for services received  		through the Childrens Division. The total number of children in state  		custody for mental health services rose to approximately 600 by November 30,  		2003. </p>
<p>The study indicated that the quantity and mix of services needed by  		children with SED changed markedly when they entered out-of-placements under  		state custody. For instance, in 2002, the average cost per child per month to  		Medicaid more than doubled (rising from $455 before placement to $1,000 after  		placement) largely because these children had greater access to and  		consequently utilized far more mental health services (including psychiatric  		rehabilitation, psychiatric therapy, pharmaceuticals, and residential  		treatment) than they would have had they remained in their homes. Forty-nine  		percent of these children also received services paid for by DMH (versus 43  		percent before placement); as a result, DMH spending rose from $1,292 to $2,926  		per child per month. Altogether, it was estimated that the total annual cost of  		providing care to children placed in the states custody to obtain mental  		health services was approximately $43,000 per child in 2002.</p>
<p>On the basis of study findings, the contractor identified five options  		open to Missouri in terms of what it could do to improve its mental health  		system so that parents would not have to relinquish custody of their children  		in order to gain access to mental health services.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC11">11</a></font></sup> The contractor also recommended why or why  		not the state should adopt each option.</p>
<p><b><i>Option 1: Implement a Voluntary Placement Option Under Title IV-E  		of the Social Security Act.</i></b> The study contractor recommended that  		Missouri should immediately implement voluntary placement under Title IV-E of  		the Social Security Act, allowing families to relinquish physical but not legal  		custody of their children to gain access to Medicaid and residential services  		covered by the child welfare agency through Title IV-E funds. The study  		findings suggest that this option would reduce the stigma and emotional stress  		associated with relinquishing custody and ensure that parents stay involved in  		their childrens care. This option also would limit Missouris  		financial exposure for mental health services for youth with SED because it  		would not expand the population of children eligible for publicly funded mental  		health services through the mental health system.</p>
<p><b><i>Option 2: Apply for a 1915(c) Waiver for Children with  		SED.</i></b> The study contractor argued that a 1915(c) waiver would allow  		Missouri to build capacity and develop home and community resources without  		exposing [itself] to unlimited financial pressure because the  		waiver could limit the number of children made eligible for services.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC12">12</a></font></sup> That is, a waiver would allow  		the state to focus on a small group of children with SED who are poorly served  		under the current system. </p>
<p>The study findings also indicate that there are three barriers to  		implementing a waiver program: (1) the lack of state funds to pay the its share  		of Medicaid costs for more mental health services; (2) the federal eligibility  		requirement that children need an institutional or hospital level of care; and  		(3) the federal requirement that community services be cost neutral with  		respect to in-patient treatment provided in psychiatric hospitals. The state  		continues to examine these issues. </p>
<p><b><i>Option 3: Apply for a Section 1115 Research and Demonstration  		Waiver to Blend Federal Funding Streams and Support a Comprehensive System of  		Care for Children.</i></b> According to the contractor, a Section 1115 waiver  		would act as a long-term strategy to develop a comprehensive system of care for  		youth with SED. For instance, it would allow Missouri to waive many Medicaid  		federal provisions, giving the state the opportunity to blend federal funding  		streams, waive parental deeming rules, and serve a larger population of youth  		with SED because, under the waiver, the state would not be limited to serving  		those who meet institutional level of care requirements.</p>
<p><b><i>Options 4 and 5: Expand Services Under the Medicaid Rehabilitation  		Option and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act. </i></b>Although both  		of these options are open to all states, the study did not show that they would  		be useful in Missouri because they cannot be applied to the population of  		children in custody for mental health services without also expanding  		eligibility to other children, thus dramatically increasing Missouris  		costs. In addition, in order to adequately serve youth with SED, the state  		would need to expand the services available through Medicaid, further adding to  		the financial burden. According to state officials, these changes are not  		feasible in the current political climate.</p>
<p><i><b>Next Steps</b></i></p>
<p>Missouri has decided to apply for a Section 1915(c) waiver. Thus far,  		DMH has both collected data on hospitalizations and started to compare the  		cost-effectiveness of providing home and community services for children with  		SED to the cost of in-patient hospitalization for the same population. The  		state also is considering waiving the parental deeming rules so that it can  		serve children who would not otherwise be Medicaid eligible. The waiver  		application also will include an expanded list of flexible services and  		supports for youth with SED. Despite a limited provider capacity in many rural  		areas, Missouri does not plan to apply for a waiver of the statewideness  		provision because it does not want to preclude any child in need from receiving  		waiver services.</p>
<p>Assuming that its waiver application is accepted, Missouri will target  		home and community services to children with in-patient psychiatric hospital  		stays of 30 or more days during the year, hoping to serve between 200 and 266  		children in the first year of the waiver program. </p>
<p>The state also is working to improve its information management system  		by centralizing DMH and DSS expenditure and utilization data in an information  		warehouse. Through this approach, Missouri expects to make it easier to  		identify all services used by children with SED and their costs than it was  		when each agency had its own unique data management system. </p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>New state laws to prevent custody relinquishment and coordinate  		  mental health services have helped to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive  		  service system for children in Missouri.</i></li>
</ul><p>Passage of SB266 and SB1003, as well as the development of the state  		level CSMT, reflects Missouris commitment to improving its mental health  		service system for children through greater interagency collaboration. DMH, the  		leading clinical authority, has started to give technical assistance to other  		agencies in terms of designing mental health services and managing mental  		health expenditures. Missouri also used the feasibility study findings as the  		basis for developing a central data management system that will support a  		comprehensive service system for children with SED, including those placed in  		DSS custody to receive mental health services. </p>
<ul><li><i>To finance mental health services for children with SED, Missouri  		  has applied for a Section 1915(c) waiver because it will allow the state to  		  control Medicaid expenses while providing mental health services to children  		  who, until now, have not been served adequately. </i></li>
</ul><p>Although Missouri uses the Medicaid rehabilitation option to finance  		comprehensive substance abuse treatment and the CPRP, DMH does not believe it  		is feasible to expand the option to provide services to children with SED.  		Instead, Missouri plans to pursue a Medicaid home and community-based services  		(HCBS) waiver in order to serve children with SED who cannot access many of the  		mental health services in the state without entering DSS custody. Missouri  		favors the waiver because it is a mechanism that would allow the state to  		expand services slowly and incrementally. Given the current political climate  		and escalating Medicaid costs, state staff emphasize the need to carefully  		manage the costs of providing mental health services to a new group of  		beneficiaries. </p>
<p>A Medicaid HCBS waiver would bring some children with SED under the  		public service umbrella; however, it would leave out those who have SED but do  		not require intensive hospital level care. According to state officials, the  		larger group of children with SED could be served only through a more  		systematic effort to create a comprehensive system of care.</p>
<ul><li><i>It is expected that a data system that consolidates information  		  from the various social service agencies will better support efforts to create  		  a comprehensive system of care.</i></li>
</ul><p>Through its feasibility study, Missouri found that it was unable to  		identify all of the services used by children with SED (and the associated  		expenditures) because each agency has its own data collection system. The  		development of a data warehouse should provide more complete information about  		the services used by children with SED use and how these services are financed.  		The resulting ability to more accurately identify the costs of institutional  		care will support Missouris efforts to develop a 1915(c) waiver  		application.</p>
<h3><a name="appendC-TX" id="appendC-TX">Feasibility Study and Development  		Project for Community-Based Treatment Alternatives for Children with SED in  		Texas</a></h3>
<p><b>Policy Context </b></p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, Texas has supported four initiatives to improve  		its community-based child mental health service system. </p>
<p>The first, authorized by state legislation passed in 1987, established  		community resource coordination groups (CRCGs), which are county-based  		inter-agency teams charged with developing individual plans of care for youth  		receiving services from several agencies. CRCGs have been supported with  		existing local revenues. </p>
<p>The second, referred to as the Texas Integrated Funding Initiative  		(TIFI), was implemented in the late 1990s in four sites that serve children  		with serious emotional disturbances (SED) and their families in selected  		counties. The TIFI provides an opportunity for child-serving state agencies and  		private sector organizations and associations to enhance interagency  		coordination and collaboration to better serve children with SED and their  		families. Each site receives $40,000 annually from state general revenues to  		develop a local system-of-care (SOC) infrastructure and deliver direct services  		through a wraparound approach. In some sites, state funds are supplemented by  		local dollars and in-kind contributions from child-serving agencies. </p>
<p>The third initiative involves four sites<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC13">13</a></font></sup> that have received grants from by the  		Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to enhance SOC for  		youth with SED. These grants have provided the state with strategic experience  		in financing intensive in-home and community services. </p>
<p>Fourth, the Texas legislature passed House Bill 2292 in 2003, which was  		designed to fundamentally transform the delivery of health and human services  		in the state. Prompted by both this legislation and results from a consensus  		conference among key stakeholders, Texas public mental health system  		piloted a resiliency and disease management (RDM) approach in community mental  		health and mental retardation centers in four selected sites to develop  		services that foster recovery for persons with mental illness. The RDM  		initiative sought to define: (1) eligibility criteria for mental health  		services; (2) an appropriate service package; (3) methods for managing  		utilization; (4) strategies for tracking costs of services; and (5) expected  		outcomes of services. For example, based on clinical diagnosis and functioning  		level, a child with SED would be assigned to one of four levels of care, each  		of which contains different service packages and rates for those services. In  		accordance with HB 2292, the initiative was rolled out statewide in September  		2004. </p>
<p>In 2003, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), the  		agency responsible for the state Medicaid program, received a $100,000 Centers  		for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Real Choice Systems Change Grant to  		assess the feasibility of the following three options for providing services to  		children with mental health issues in a community setting instead of in an  		in-patient psychiatric facility: a 1915(c) home and community-based service  		(HCBS) waiver, an 1115 demonstration waiver, and a state-funded-only project.  		Having completed its final report on the study in January 2005, the state has  		started to implement some of the recommendations from the report, including  		detailed financial analyses that will lay the groundwork for an HCBS  		waiver.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Service Infrastructure</b></p>
<p>The responsibility for providing mental health services lies with four  		agencies that operate under the umbrella of the Texas HHSC.<sup><font><a href="public-financing-home-and-community-services-children-and-youth-serious-emotional-disturbances-selected-state-strategies.html#noteC15">15</a></font></sup> Other agencies such as  		juvenile justice, education, and the child welfare system also fund mental  		health services for children. Of the 41 community MHMRs, 39 serve as the Mental  		Health Authority (MHA) for single counties (in urban areas) or several counties  		(in rural areas). Each MHA must provide the mental health services covered by  		the state Medicaid plan, including assessment, counseling, and crisis  		intervention. The MHMRs receive most of their funding from Medicaid and general  		state revenue.</p>
<p>Each MHA also partners with one of nine state hospitals that provide  		in-patient mental health and substance abuse services and that account for a  		total of 361 child and adolescent beds. Furthermore, a residential treatment  		program for adolescents with SED is offered by the Waco Center for Youth, and  		29 private mental health hospitals are licensed by the state to provide mental  		health services. </p>
<p>The Department of Family and Protective Services (DPS) licenses 24-hour  		child care facilities, some of which provide mental health services. Services  		provided to children in DPS custody are funded through Title IV-E, Temporary  		Assistance for Needy Families, and general funds. Parents, juvenile probation  		units, child protective services, and local school districts may also place  		children in these facilities.</p>
<p>Medicaid covers rehabilitation services, including psychosocial  		rehabilitation and family therapy but not psychiatric residential treatment for  		children. </p>
<p>The TIFI sites and the CRCGs are local inter-agency collaboratives  		designed to improve the child mental health system. TIFI sites collaborate with  		a variety of agencies to provide wraparound planning for children in order to  		prevent residential placements or to return children to their home from an  		institutional or residential setting. The idea is to seamlessly deliver  		services provided by several agencies. The CRCGs provide a coordinated plans of  		care for children with complex mental health needs who would otherwise be  		served in a more fragmented way by a variety of agencies. CRCGs also seek to  		provide these children with access to a fuller array of services that may not  		have been available through traditional channels. Despite recent improvements  		in inter-agency coordination, however, some state officials indicated that the  		states overall funding for child mental health services remains severely  		limited.</p>
<p><b>Feasibility Study</b></p>
<p><b>Study Goals and Activities</b>. The broad goals of the feasibility  		study were to: (1) identify community alternatives to out-of-home placement;  		(2) give families more treatment options to choose from; and (3) identify ways  		to expand the array of high-quality intensive treatments and supports. To  		achieve these goals, Texas contracted with Community Ties of America, Inc., an  		outside consulting company to examine various service delivery and funding  		options that would allow more children to live at home and receive treatment in  		their community as opposed to in an institution. The options included a 1915(c)  		waiver, a 1915(c) and (b) combination waiver, an 1115 demonstration waiver, or  		changing current Medicaid and block grant services. Community Ties of America  		was also charged with describing the current system of mental health service  		for children in Texas, determining the number of children in the priority  		population served in an in-patient mental health hospital setting during  		fiscal year (FY) 2003, and determining the cost of in-patient mental health  		hospitalization for these children. Texas defined the priority  		population as children ages of 3-17 with a serious emotional, behavioral,  		or mental disorder and who either have a serious functional impairment, are at  		risk for out-of-home placement because of psychiatric symptoms, or are enrolled  		in special education because of a severe emotional disturbance.</p>
<p><b>Findings and Recommendations</b>. In its final report on the study,  		Community Ties of America documented detailed findings on the mental health  		system for children in Texas and made recommendations on the feasibility of  		using the standard federally sanctioned delivery and financing options for  		covering children with mental illness. Findings on the state mental health  		system for children include the following:</p>
<ul><li>In FY 2003, community MHMRs served 26,452 priority population  		  children. </li>
<li>4,660 children had an in-patient stay in a private or public  		  psychiatric hospital covered in FY 2003 by Medicaid or by state dollars; this  		  total does not include children in Medicaid managed care plans or whose stay in  		  a private hospital was not covered by state funds. The cost to the state to  		  cover the 4,660 children was over $150 million. In addition, these children  		  represent those who could potentially be diverted from in-patient  		  hospitalization if they were provided with community services. </li>
<li>Average length of stay in both private and public psychiatric  		  hospitals was 52 days (slightly less than three months) per admission at an  		  average daily cost of $535 per child and an average annual cost of $27,569 per  		  child. That amount represents the target for budget neutrality in an HCBS  		  waiver application.</li>
</ul><p>With regard to the 1915 waivers, 1115 waivers, the Medicaid state plan,  		and other funding streams, the report recommended that the state develop a  		1915(c) waiver program based on a case management model of service delivery. In  		this model, the case manager interacts regularly with the child and the family  		and monitors the service plan to ensure that the child receives high-quality,  		appropriate services. The state would designate an administrative lead agency,  		likely DSHS, to develop the waiver. The report also recommended that Texas  		perform a site comparison analysis to identify the communities, cities, or  		regions in which the waiver might be most successfully implemented.</p>
<p>Although Texas is likely to move forward with a 1915(c) waiver  		application, state officials noted initial enrollment in the waiver program  		will be limited (possibly to 400 children) so that the state can more easily  		and accurately track Medicaid expenditures and potential savings in state funds  		from the reduced use of psychiatric hospitalization. </p>
<p>Although the report examined the potential utility of several different  		funding streams, it did not specifically address the implications of the  		following: modifying the Medicaid rehabilitation option to broaden access to  		intensive community services, developing case rates or other strategies  		involving the blending of funds across state agencies, or implementing a Tax  		Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act/Katie Beckett provision. According to  		state officials, the third strategy was not examined because it was seen as  		financially risky.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<ul><li><i>The CMS grant established a framework for bringing a diverse set  		  of state agencies together to collaborate in developing the HCBS  		  waiver.</i></li>
</ul><p>CMSs Real Choice Systems Change Grant gave Texas agencies that  		serve children an opportunity to collaborate in an evaluation of options for  		enhancing community-based services for children with SED. This process may  		provide a foundation for further collaboration as the wavier application is  		developed and, if awarded, when the actual program is implemented.</p>
<ul><li><i>An HCBS waiver is desirable for Texas because it has several  		  attractive features.</i> </li>
</ul><p>According to state officials, an HCBS waiver will give Texas the  		flexibility to: (1) expand services incrementally by managing the number of  		waiver slots available; and (2) obtain federal reimbursement for some services  		now supported entirely by the state (e.g., wraparound services and foster care  		placement). </p>
<ul><li><i>A lack of qualified providers, especially providers of intensive  		  home and community services, is hindering Texas effort to expand mental  		  health services to children with SED.</i> </li>
</ul><p>Texas realizes that it will be challenging to implement an HCBS waiver  		in areas of the state that do not have enough qualified providers. Even special  		initiatives in urban areas (e.g., The Childrens Partnership, an SOC site  		in Austin) that have funds to purchase additional services for children with  		SED have found it very difficult to find appropriately trained providers,  		especially providers of nontraditional services. Intensive services such as  		mobile response and stabilization, and in-home crisis interventions, though  		essential to a community-based service system for youth with SED, will not be  		available in areas that lack appropriate providers. Implementation may also be  		stymied by resistance on the part of facility-based providers (e.g.,  		residential treatment facilities) to re-engineer and provide- home and  		community services.</p>

Montgomery County obtained a six-year system of care grant in 1999. Since then,  			 Montgomery Countys project called Community Kids, an  			 initiative of the Montgomery Countys Health and Human Services Department  			 and the Montgomery County Collaboration Council for Children, Youth and  			 Families, has been developing wraparound services, interagency collaboration,  			 and family partnerships for children with SED and their families.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="appendD" id="appendD">APPENDIX D: VALUES AND PRINCIPLES SUPPORTING THE  		SYSTEMS-OF-CARE APPROACH</a></h2>
<p>Underpinning Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP), and  		subsequently the Community Mental Health Services program, has been the  		conceptual framework by Stroul and Friedman that defined and illustrated a  		system of care model for children with serious emotional  		disturbances (SED). According to Stroul and Friedman (1986), systems of care  		should exhibit three core values: child centered and family focused,  		community-based, and culturally competent. Furthermore, Stroul and Friedman  		outline ten guiding principles of the systems of care philosophy:</p>
<ol><li>Children should have access to a wide array of services that address  		  their social, educational, physical, and emotional needs.</li>
<li>Children should receive individualized services designed to meet the  		  unique characteristics and situations of each child as delineated in an  		  individualized service plan.</li>
<li>Children should receive services in the least restrictive, clinically  		  appropriate setting.</li>
<li>Families and guardians of children should be involved in all aspects  		  of service planning and delivery.</li>
<li>Children should receive an integrated set of services, with all  		  child-serving agencies planning, developing, and coordinating services.</li>
<li>Children should be provided with case management in order to assure  		  that their services are coordinated and they are able to move through the  		  established system of care as their needs change.</li>
<li>Systems of care should promote early identification and intervention  		  for children with SED.</li>
<li>Smooth transitions to the adult service system must be assured for  		  children with SED.</li>
<li>The rights of children should be protected, and advocacy for children  		  with SED promoted.</li>
<li>Children should receive services without regard to race, religion,  		  national origin, sex, or physical disability in a culturally competent and  		  sensitive manner.</li>
