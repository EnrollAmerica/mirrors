</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This paper reports the findings of an exploratory study to document and  		analyze selected best practices related to state-administered home and  		community-based services (HCBS) programs. What the programs look like and how  		they work provided the context for examining two interrelated areas of policy  		interest: </p>
<ol><li>How states organize and deliver a range of home and community-based  		  services (HCBS) within fixed budgets, what mechanisms they use to manage  		  program resources, and how they deal with actual or projected budget shortfalls  		  in relation to demand for service; and</li>
<li>how eligibility determination, needs assessment, care planning and  		  service authorization functions are structured and linked to one another  		  administratively.</li>
</ol><p>HCBS programs in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maine and North Dakota  		were selected for review. These particular states were identified as examples  		of HCBS programs reflecting somewhat different approaches to organizing,  		managing and delivering home and community-based long-term care services to  		their target populations -- primarily older people, but in some cases also  		younger persons with physical disabilities.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Since older people represent the largest proportion of the population of  		persons with significant disabilities (70% of the Administration's proposed  		HCBS program's target population was estimated to be persons 65 and older), the  		statewide programs included in the project were chosen from among HCBS programs  		managed by state units on aging. In addition to being statewide, the selected  		programs offer a range of community-based services, have a significant resource  		base relative to their target population, and have a well-defined assessment  		and care management system in place. </p>
<p>Two of the states -- Indiana and North Dakota -- offer their home care  		services within a single administrative structure to both older and younger  		persons with disabilities. In Maine, in addition to managing the aging waiver  		and the state-funded home care program, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs)  		administer a modest amount of state program resources to provide services to  		persons with physical disabilities who are under age 60. The Arkansas and  		Illinois programs that were examined serve older adults exclusively. </p>
<p>Arkansas and Illinois also provide particularly relevant contrasts with  		respect to one of the policy issues that framed the project. While Arkansas  		relies heavily on fixed federal, state and local budget resources to support  		its HCBS program, it also has access to an additional, essentially open-ended  		source of funding for personal care, available as an optional service in its  		Medicaid state plan. In Illinois, the HCBS program, funded by both state  		general funds and Medicaid waiver resources, operates as a statewide  		entitlement. </p>

<p>Site visits to the five states took place over a two-month period during  		August and September, 1994. On-site interviews were conducted with staff from  		the state aging and Medicaid agencies and other relevant senior level  		policymakers and administrators at the state level, and with program  		administrators and operations staff at the substate service delivery level.  		Information from on-site data collection was supplemented by document reviews  		and telephone discussions. </p>

</ul><h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND AND PROJECT RATIONALE</a> </h2>
<p>Even before the Administration's Health Security Act was officially  		introduced, the debate regarding details of its health care and insurance  		reform proposals dominated the domestic political and media landscapes. Less  		attention and, particularly noticeable within the relevant Congressional  		committees, less controversy were focused on its proposals for a new,  		federally-legislated HCBS program. Except for special interest groups who felt  		that the needs of their particular constituencies were not being addressed  		adequately, there appeared to be no major opposition to the substantive  		elements of the HCBS proposals. </p>
<p>For example, there seemed to be general acceptance of such notions as  		using functional measures to determine eligibility, allowing a great deal of  		flexibility for states to determine what HCBS benefits they would offer, and  		not using age as a basis for program eligibility. What was much more at issue  		-- not only in the Congress, but within the Administration and also in states  		across the country -- was the question of financing levels for the new program.  		</p>
<p>There were several schools of thought. The President's plan called for  		an annual $38 billion "capped entitlement" when the program was fully phased  		in, calculated and apportioned to each state by means of a generous formula and  		with higher match rates than those of Medicaid. The Administration was  		confident that the numbers derived from its calculations were adequate to cover  		the costs of providing home and community-based services to the population  		targeted for the new program, even building in a safety factor to add further  		assurance that state allocations would be sufficient. On the other hand, many  		in the Congress were concerned that the bottom line figure was too high,  		regardless of how soundly-based it was vis-a-vis the numbers and needs of the  		program's proposed target population. </p>
<p>From the states, a different set of financing issues surfaced. Among  		some state-level policy analysts and program administrators, especially those  		accustomed to managing budgets and making decisions and recommendations in the  		context of Medicaid's open-ended entitlement benefits, there was considerable  		opposition. For them, the idea of an annual fixed maximum dollar amount to  		cover what they believed were uncertain program costs seemed particularly  		onerous. "if you are going to cap our dollars, give us a way to cap our  		program" was how one of the more vocal state officials framed the concern. </p>
<p>On the other hand, many other state officials and local program staff,  		while they too stated their preference for open-ended program funding, viewed  		the potential of a new federally-supported, state-administered HCBS program  		with great enthusiasm. This latter group was comprised mainly, though not  		entirely, of people accustomed to working with formula grant programs and block  		grants, i.e., having a fixed amount of money to serve particular categories of  		individuals in order to accomplish specific goals. </p>
<p>For most of 1994, the debate regarding health care reform was  		wide-ranging and frequently heated, generating so much controversy that  		Congress was not able to coalesce around any of the various versions that were  		introduced during its legislative session. One matter was made clear during the  		process: Open-ended entitlement funding to states for <b>any </b>new federal  		social program was not at all likely to be politically feasible, at least for  		the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Even though the 103rd Congress did not produce any long-term care  		legislation, the importance of creating well-designed home and community-based  		services systems to meet the long-term care needs of the current and growing  		population of older and younger persons with disabilities, continues unabated.  		Seeking to better understand the dynamics of how existing HCBS programs are  		operating within the limitations of a fixed budget environment continues to be  		a useful activity. It is hoped that findings from this exploratory study will  		be instructive and prove useful to both federal and state policymakers as they  		consider how best to proceed with their efforts to encourage and support  		effective HCBS policies and programs. </p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY OF PROJECT FINDINGS</a> </h2>
<h3>A. Program Elements and Funding Sources for Selected  		HCBS Programs</h3>
<h4>1. Resource Bases: Medicaid and Other Funding </h4>
<p>Although HCBS programs in all five states were originally begun with  		non-Medicaid funds, Medicaid now plays an integral role in their financing --  		ranging from a low of 27% in waiver funds for North Dakota's "Home and  		Community-Based Services Program for Elderly and Disabled" to 83% in combined  		waiver and Medicaid state plan resources in Arkansas.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In four of the five states -- Illinois, Indiana, Maine and North Dakota  		-- state HCBS program resources plus at least one Medicaid waiver designated to  		serving the same populations are combined to form a coordinated home and  		community-based service delivery system and funding nucleus operated through a  		single administrative structure. In Indiana and North Dakota, the coordinated  		program serves older people and younger persons with physical disabilities. In  		Illinois and Maine, the programs that are included in the project focused  		exclusively (in Illinois) and primarily (in Maine) on people 60 and older. In  		Arkansas, the state's waiver program is directed to persons 65 and older and is  		administratively separated from its elderly home care services program, which  		relies on a combination of state revenues and federal formula grants to pay for  		services to the state's 60 and older population needing home care services.  		</p>
<p>In two states, Medicaid state plans include personal care and targeted  		care management as optional services. In Arkansas last year, Medicaid payments  		for personal care amounted to more than $52 million. Estimates are that at  		least 75%, or about $40 million, was paid out to seven of the state's eight  		Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) in their role as certified providers of personal  		care services. Medicaid payments for targeted care management on the other  		hand, which also is provided primarily by AAAs to non-waiver clients who are  		Medicaid-eligible, were only about $400,000 last year.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In Maine, Medicaid reimburses AAAs for targeted care management for  		Medicaid-eligible clients receiving state-funded home-based care services.  		However, AAAs have no special access to personal care, nor to adult day care  		and private duty nursing services, which are also included in the Medicaid  		state plan. No funding breakout by service currently is available, but last  		fiscal year's Medicaid payments for the four services for all eligible  		population groups totalled $4.4 million. </p>
<p>With the exception of Indiana, which has waiting lists for all but its  		OBRA waiver, the remaining four states appear to have a larger number of  		approved waiver slots than they are likely to need in order to serve their  		current and projected caseloads -- at least for the near term. This might  		suggest that at relatively high levels of disability, estimates of the numbers  		of people who are eligible and who are likely, or able, to take advantage of  		the availability of waiver services may be on the high side. (See also the  		discussion of time lags in the next section, which relates to applicants'  		ability to utilize waiver services.) </p>
<p>Other significant resources used to varying degrees for HCBS programs  		include the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), Older Americans Act Title III  		programs, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Commodity Foods program for  		home-delivered meals, federal and state grants, and contributions and local  		resources. </p>
<p>Only Arkansas and Indiana have administratively connected SSBG and Title  		III services into their broader HCBS program framework, so that HCBS care  		managers can authorize the delivery of SSBG- and Title III-funded services. In  		the other states, the care managers have to rely on their ability to broker  		services over which they have no authority and for which their clients have no  		special priority status. </p>
<h4>2. Cost-Sharing</h4>
<p>All the state programs except those in Arkansas include client  		cost-sharing provisions which, beyond various protected amounts, can reach 100%  		of the costs of services provided. Although the total amounts collected are  		relatively low -- ranging from less than 1% to no more than 5% of the program  		budget -- the general belief is that cost-sharing serves the added function of  		raising awareness of service costs as a way to encourage a "prudent purchaser"  		perspective among clients. </p>
<h3>B. Process for Establishing Program Budgets</h3>
<p>State agencies administering the HCBS programs develop budgets, usually  		based on a target set of figures generated by their state's budget office. As a  		rule, agency staff work within these limits, using program experience, growth  		projections and anticipated policy changes to arrive at a budget, or series of  		budgets, to cover HCBS program expenditures. Because of fiscal constraints,  		these budgets often reflect "least harm" scenarios. After passing through  		various layers of internal review, the proposed HCBS program budgets are  		ultimately included in the Governor's budget submission to the state  		legislature, where the external political process takes over. At this point,  		advocates for HCBS programs attempt to influence budget decisions in their  		favor but, given the fiscal climate, not with as much success as they have had  		in the past. </p>
<h3>C. Principal Issues Affecting HCBS Program  		Financing</h3>
<p>Severe budget pressures due to the economic downturn of recent years  		continue to be felt by all of the states. While they would like to see their  		programs grow, the states' fiscal situations are such that level funding often  		is considered a victory! </p>
<p>All of the state agencies administering the HCBS programs -- including  		Illinois, whose Community Care Program has the unique status of being an  		entitlement -- feel vulnerable to fiscal pressures. Even in Arkansas, with its  		very significant Medicaid personal care entitlement, financing for HCBS is not  		nearly as stable as the state and service delivery level staff would like it to  		be. A referendum to repeal a state tax dedicated to generating the state match  		for Medicaid was defeated in the last election, but the outcome was not at all  		certain prior to the vote. </p>
<p>As a consequence of state budget constraints, it would seem reasonable  		to assume that HCBS programs would place considerable emphasis on seeking out  		and serving Medicaid-eligible clients, using available waiver resources that  		can generate federal match payments. This seems to be a priority in Illinois  		and Indiana. How much, and how permanently, such an orientation will alter  		their programs' targeting strategies (as well as other features of the programs  		themselves) is not clear. </p>
<h3>D. Program Operations at the State and Local Levels  		</h3>
<h4>1. Administrative Structure</h4>
<p>While all of the HCBS programs are administered at the state level by  		state units on aging, only two of the four states that have Area Agencies on  		Aging have given them responsibility for both the state-funded and waiver  		programs. In Maine, AAAs manage the major portion of the state-funded  		home-based care program and the Medicaid waiver for older people, and authorize  		and arrange for the delivery of HCBS to eligible clients. However, Maine also  		has two waivers specifically to serve persons with physical disabilities -- one  		limited to persons age 18 through 64 and the other for adults age 18 and older.  		Each of these waivers is being managed by a different statewide administrative  		entity. </p>
<p>In Indiana, AAAs have administrative responsibility for the state's aged  		and physically disabled and medically-fragile children's waivers, working  		directly with clients and authorizing and arranging for waiver or other needed  		HCBS services. For clients eligible for one of the state's three MR/DD waivers,  		AAA care managers also may work with eligible clients directly or, at a  		minimum, participate with regional MR/DD staff from the state's Bureau of  		Developmental Disabilities to develop appropriate care plans. However, in  		either instance, AAAs retain sign-off authority for all waivers as well as  		other HCBS resources. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, AAAs are responsible for administering the state's home  		care support program for persons 60 and older, which is funded by a combination  		of state and federal formula grant resources. In addition, seven of the state's  		eight AAAs are also major direct providers of Medicaid waiver and Medicaid and  		state-funded personal care services. The state's waiver program for people age  		65 and older, however, is administered directly by the state aging agency, with  		outstationed state employees responsible for conducting assessments and  		developing plans of care. </p>
<p>In Illinois, the HCBS program is administered at the substate level by a  		number of different types of community service agencies on a contract basis;  		the state's Area Agencies on Aging have only limited coordinating and  		supporting roles vis-a-vis the HCBS program. North Dakota, which does not have  		AAAs, relies on generic care managers located in the state's county-based  		social services system to perform assessments and arrange for and monitor  		waiver and non-waiver service delivery to eligible clients of all ages. </p>
<h4>2. Eligibility Requirements</h4>
<p><b>(a) Age</b>. In North Dakota and Indiana, the HCBS programs examined  		are available to persons of all ages, whereas Arkansas and Illinois limit their  		services to people 60 and older. In Maine, the situation is less clear cut.  		Waiver services provided through its AAA structure are targeted to older  		adults, but its state-funded home-based care program -- though targeted  		primarily to older adults -- has a small set-aside for younger persons as well.  		</p>
<p><b>(b) Functional Measures</b>. In conjunction with defined age limits  		for specific programs, measures of functional impairment are universal  		determinants of eligibility for HCB services. Four of the five states require  		the use of a single assessment instrument, designed to measure a range of  		functional impairment levels, irrespective of funding stream. Arkansas, on the  		other hand, requires a brief, structured instrument for its waiver program but  		only suggests an assessment instrument -- different from the one used for the  		waiver -- for its home care services program.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> Based on the functional assessment, which also  		generally includes questions relating to cognitive capacity, several decisions  		can be made: Does the applicant fit within the minimum/maximum levels set for  		participation and, if so, for which of the available program/funding streams?  		</p>
<p>In terms of functional eligibility for waiver services, Maine, Indiana  		and Illinois use a minimum of three ADL limitations requiring total or  		significant assistance; Arkansas and North Dakota require a minimum of two ADLs  		for determining eligibility for waiver services. Illinois and Indiana apply the  		same three ADL minimum for both waiver and non-waiver program eligibility.  		Maine's state-funded home care program uses the same assessment instrument but  		applies less stringent functional eligibility criteria for services. North  		Dakota's major state-supported HCBS program actually requires a more severe  		level of functional impairment -- a minimum of four ADLs or five IADLs -- to be  		determined eligible for home care services. In Arkansas, functional eligibility  		for its home care support program is very loosely defined. </p>
<p><b>(c) Income and Assets</b>. For waiver services, Indiana and North  		Dakota use 100% of SSI, and a $2000 ($3000 for a couple) asset limit for  		eligibility. Arkansas and Maine set their maximum income eligibility level at  		300% of SSL Because of the way Illinois operates its program, income is not  		used as an eligibility criterion for participation. </p>
<p>Except for limited SSBG-funded services administered directly by HCBS  		agencies in Arkansas and Indiana, and a small state-funded program in North  		Dakota, none of the major state-funded programs uses income as an eligibility  		criterion, and only two states consider assets in determining program  		eligibility. Illinois uses a $10,000 countable asset limit for participation in  		its Community Care Program, funded by both waiver and state general revenues,  		and North Dakota has established an unusually high liquid asset limit of  		$50,000. </p>
<h4>3. Eligibility Determination Procedures</h4>
<p>Illinois uses a single point of entry for determining eligibility and  		differentiates client status after the fact in order to establish and charge  		the costs of client services to the appropriate funding stream. Within and  		across the other four states there are several variations with respect to  		personnel and procedures for determining eligibility. The differences mainly  		apply to eligibility rules for Medicaid waivers and for state-funded programs.  		</p>
<p>Except in Arkansas and Maine where registered nurses are <b>required</b>  		to perform assessments for potential waiver clients, states use their care  		managers -- mainly social workers, but also some nurses -- to perform  		assessments on all applicants, irrespective of funding stream. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, the RNs are state employees, working within the state  		administrative structure. Assessments for non-waiver clients are performed by  		care managers in AAAs, which are structurally separated from the administration  		of the waiver program. In Maine, the RNs who perform assessments and develop  		preliminary plans of care for potential waiver clients may be on the staff of  		the AAA, but are more likely work on a contract basis through the AAA, which  		then is responsible for care plan implementation and on-going care management  		functions. Assessments for non-waiver applicants are conducted by AAA care  		managers. </p>
<p>North Dakota uses generic care managers based in each of the state's  		county social service offices to conduct assessments of all applicants for its  		coordinated HCBS program. In Indiana, AAA care managers are responsible for  		administering an eligibility screen used to determine eligibility for all  		waiver and non-waiver applicants, except those who are assessed through the  		MR/DD system. Also in Indiana, frequently in the case of families applying for  		services under the waiver for medically-fragile children, local AAAs will use  		an RN -- either on their staff, or through a contract with a home health agency  		-- to conduct the assessment that will then be used to determine eligibility  		for waiver services. </p>
<p>An eligibility characteristic of Medicaid waivers also presents a common  		problem for state HCBS programs: Medicaid approval of financial eligibility  		status (always) and functional eligibility/level of care determinations (often)  		tend to be complex and time-consuming. The time lag for certifying client  		eligibility for Medicaid waiver services -- except in Illinois where the  		payment source decision is made after the fact -- too frequently seems to  		result in losing the potential HCBS client. Especially if the applicant is  		awaiting hospital discharge and has inadequate financial or informal resources  		to bridge the time gap, and other public funding is not available, nursing home  		placement is the most usual outcome upon discharge. </p>
<h4>4. Care Planning and On-Going Care Management</h4>
<p>All five states have established targets or benchmarks for their HCBS  		care plans. Arkansas, Indiana and Maine explicitly use a percentage of their  		nursing home costs; Illinois and North Dakota have set maximum dollar amounts  		which, while they are keyed to nursing home costs, are not directly stated as  		percentages. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, the target is 100% of the state's average intermediate care  		nursing facility costs, and it applies to care plans for waiver services as  		well as Medicaid personal care services. Care plan costs for the state's Home  		Care Support Program are self-regulated at the AAA level. In Indiana, the  		target is 90% of nursing home costs for waiver clients. For its state-funded  		program, rather than applying a percentage, Indiana calculates and uses the  		state match for Medicaid nursing home reimbursement as the basis for  		establishing its care plan benchmarks. Maine, which uses 75% of the average  		state nursing facility rate, is the only state that applies the percentage as  		the care plan target for both its waiver and state-funded HCBS programs. </p>
<p>Regardless of the absolute targets or benchmarks that have been  		established, the average cost of care plans for both waiver and state-funded  		programs in all of the states actually is considerably lower than the targets.  		An estimate of the average care plan costs across all states and programs may  		be as much as two-thirds lower than the average established per person  		expenditure targets. </p>
<p>Once care plans are in place, on-going care management across all  		programs is basically the same. Care managers maintain contact with clients on  		a more or less regular basis, and as-needed. Care plans generally are written  		for a one year period, but can be modified depending on clients' circumstances.  		</p>
<h4>5. Available Services and Service Providers</h4>
<p>All of the states offer basically the same core set of HCB services  		within their waiver and state-funded HCBS programs. Even in the Illinois  		Community Care Program, which technically offers only two services, what it  		calls "homemaker" actually covers a number of in-home service functions --  		housekeeping, shopping, meal planning and preparation -- and also personal care  		tasks such as bathing and grooming, assistance with transferring and range of  		motion, and medication management. </p>
<p><b>(a) Agency Providers</b>. All five states utilize some type of  		contracting mechanism or other form of agreement to create a pool of agencies  		that can be called on to provide services to their HCBS clients. In all but  		Illinois, providers must be certified by the state if they will be providing  		waiver services. (In Illinois, the state agency contracts directly with local  		providers, who compete for contracts on a two-year cycle.) Except for North  		Dakota, which certifies all providers, state certification is not necessary for  		providers of state-funded services. In Arkansas, Indiana and Maine, AAAs -- as  		the designated substate agencies for administering their state's HCBS programs  		-- are responsible for identifying and establishing agreements with local  		providers in their geographic areas for delivering non-waiver services. </p>
<p>The level at which provider payment rates are set varies considerably  		across states and by program within states. Illinois contracts directly with  		provider agencies and establishes the statewide rates it will pay for service  		provision. Arkansas and Maine also establish statewide rates, but only for  		waiver services. Indiana gives its substate administrative units, the Area  		Agencies on Aging, latitude to negotiate rates with each of their providers for  		all services. And lastly, North Dakota, which depends primarily on individual  		contractors for both waiver and state-funded services, sets ceilings but allows  		its contractor agencies (as well as individuals) to actually set their own  		rates, as long as they fall within the established ceilings. </p>
<p><b>(b) Independent Providers</b>. Illinois and Maine do not use  		independent Providers (IPs) for their programs at all, and Arkansas uses them  		only in their nonwaiver Home Care Support Program. In Indiana, independent  		contractors -- identified by clients themselves or selected from a  		"self-declared" registry maintained by AAAs -- are assigned to appropriate  		non-waiver clients, and monitored by an AAA care manager or a staff person  		functioning as a care manager from a regional office of the Bureau of  		Developmental Disabilities. Except under special circumstances, immediate  		family members are precluded from being paid as individual providers. </p>
<p>North Dakota's service delivery system, as noted above, is largely  		dependent on individual "qualified service providers" (QSPs) to provide HCBS  		and assistance to waiver clients and clients of either of the state-funded  		programs -- all but 10% of the state's QSPs are individual contractors.  		Irrespective of funding source, clients are offered the option of selecting an  		individual provider from a list of county residents who have enrolled with the  		state agency, or identifying an individual they would prefer and who is willing  		to sign on as a QSP. </p>
<h3>E. Control Mechanisms Used to Keep Spending Within  		Budget</h3>
<p>Like most other programs that have limited resources with which to  		operate (whether this is an absolutely fixed amount or, in the case of most  		entitlement program environments, an identifiable target figure), all of the  		state programs have established specific policies that limit program  		expenditures. They control participation by setting financial limits and  		functional disability levels. They control costs by limiting the number and  		types of services they offer, and by establishing cost caps on client care  		plans, on specific services, and on provider payment rates for services. They  		use cost-sharing, in part to generate additional program income, but for  		another, frequently stated, reason as well -- to make program participants more  		conscious of the costs of the services they are receiving and, as a result, to  		make them more selective of the types and levels of service they will request.  		And, as a last resort, states rely on waiting lists. </p>
<p>Another mechanism used by some states is to centralize control, or at  		least detailed oversight and review, of those program features that entail  		significant costs. The Illinois program is highly centralized -- the state  		agency contracts directly with all of the providers in its system, signs off on  		all vendor payments, and conducts spot checks or 100% reviews, depending on  		circumstances, of initial care plans and all requests to increase care plan  		services. The other states also exercise fiscal control and oversight, but to a  		lesser degree. </p>
<p>In Indiana and North Dakota, the state agency controls the assignment of  		"slots" -- for waivers in Indiana, and for the state-funded SPED program in  		North Dakota. Even after eligibility is determined, services cannot be  		initiated until a program slot has been assigned to the client. (Since the  		numbers of HCFA-approved waiver slots in Arkansas, Illinois, Maine and North  		Dakota are in excess of the number assigned, there has not been any attempt to  		control waiver costs by introducing controls on waiver slots.) </p>
<p>Maine established a capitated system for its state-funded Home-Based  		Care program, actually contracting for a minimum number of clients who are to  		be served for the contract amount, with either out-of-pocket payments or  		reduced budgets as penalties for non-performance. In Indiana, the trade-off for  		fairly broad eligibility criteria in its state-funded program is a long waiting  		list. </p>
<h3>F. Self-Identified Problems and Attempted Solutions</h3>
<p>In general, the problems raised by state and local program staff were  		very specific to the way their respective state HCBS program is organized and,  		therefore, are not particularly generalizable. One exception, raised in a  		preceding section, relates to waiver programs and the frequent discontinuity  		between an individual's need for HCB services and the time it takes to  		establish eligibility as a pre-condition of receiving needed services. Because  		of the importance and likely relevance of this problem to other states, it may  		be useful to summarize how Arkansas and Maine are trying to resolve it for  		their state. </p>
<p>What is at issue is that agencies cannot be reimbursed for providing a  		Medicaid-reimbursable service unless or until the person they provide the  		service to is determined to be eligible for Medicaid. If the applicant or the  		state has sufficient resources to bridge the waiting period while the financial  		and functional eligibility determination decisions are being made, there is no  		problem. When such resources are not available, the result is that the  		applicant will be lost to a nursing home or return home from a nursing home or  		hospital to an unsustainable environment -- undermining a major purpose of the  		waiver program. </p>
<p>A senior staff person in the Arkansas Division of Aging and Adult  		Services, with an extensive background in Medicaid, asked the question: "Why is  		it that nursing homes, but not waiver service providers, can bill and be paid  		retroactively for days of care for an <b>applicant </b>for Medicaid coverage if  		s/he subsequently is determined to be Medicaid-eligible?" The apparent response  		from HCFA was that there did not seem to be any reason why they could not do  		the same. </p>
<p>Based on this argument, Arkansas recently submitted a waiver  		modification to HCFA requesting that providers be allowed to assume the risk  		and initiate services, and then be able to bill retroactively if the applicant  		subsequently is determined to be Medicaid-eligible. Even though DAAS staff do  		not expect retroactive billing will be utilized in all cases -- either because  		the applicant's eligibility status is not clear and/or providers are not  		willing to risk their own resources -- they do believe it will make a bridging  		option available where none may have existed before. </p>
<p>In Maine, the Medicaid agency has agreed, on a trial basis, to allow  		registered nurses who are already required to conduct functional eligibility  		assessments, to make level of care determinations for one of its waivers for  		physically disabled adults. If it works it will be only a partial answer --  		only for those applicants who are already Medicaid-eligible and therefore do  		not need to establish financial eligibility as well. Nevertheless, this  		approach should alleviate the time lapse problem, at least in some instances.  		</p>
<p>A second issue that has surfaced in Maine but is likely to occur in  		other states as well, relates to the implications for HCBS programs when states  		begin tor narrow eligibility criteria for nursing facility placements. In an  		attempt to better control nursing home costs, Maine recently tightened its  		Medicaid level of care determination criteria for nursing home placements,  		causing a "trickle down" effect on the state's HCBS programs. As a direct  		result of the new policy, the state's waiver-funded programs -- which use the  		same eligibility criteria as those used for nursing facility level of care  		decisions -- are beginning to see people with heavier care needs requesting  		waiver services. Some of these people might actually be better served, and  		served more cost efficiently, in a nursing home setting. </p>
<p>Area Agency on Aging staff in Maine who are responsible for nursing home  		preadmission screening and for administering the state- and waiver-funded  		services programs, are also reporting the same phenomenon one level farther  		down. Persons with significant needs who were qualifying for waiver services  		prior to the new regulations are now seeking assistance from the state-funded  		program, which in the past was focused on serving persons with fewer functional  		needs and, therefore, with lower service costs. The net effect is that AAAs  		that already have waiting lists for state-funded services are not able to serve  		people who actually may have a greater need for assistance, without  		considerable disruption of the existing caseload. </p>
<h3>G. Home and Community-Based Services as Mechanisms for  		Reducing Nursing Home Costs</h3>
<p>In all of the states, the original motivation for initiating home and  		community-based services programs was to provide an alternative to nursing  		homes for those people with functional deficits who preferred and were able to  		remain in their own homes. At the time, concerns regarding nursing home costs  		were at best a secondary issue. While nursing home costs are now at or close to  		the top of states' agendas as they seek ways to rein in spiraling Medicaid  		expenditures, only Maine has a moratorium on nursing home beds and also has  		made an explicit connection between its home-based care and nursing home  		programs. A 1993 statute tightens nursing home eligibility, requires  		pre-screening, limits increases in the bed supply, and supports a diversion  		strategy that would invest anticipated savings into community-based services.  		</p>
<p>Indiana has just recently created a state-level task force to begin  		examining long-term care issues more broadly than simply in terms of nursing  		home care. In Arkansas, Illinois and North Dakota, the prevailing view seems to  		be that nursing home care and HCBS programs are parallel, but distinct, service  		delivery systems. A state official in Arkansas actually suggested that the  		state's HCBS programs are not appropriate alternatives for Arkansas' more  		medically-oriented nursing home system. </p>
<h3>H. State Officials' Opinions Regarding Their Ability to  		Manage a HCBS Program Within a Fixed Budget</h3>
<p>The universal preference for an open-ended entitlement for HCBS was the  		only common response from all five states. In terms of implementing and  		managing a HCBS program with a fixed budget, each state responded differently.  		</p>
<p>In Arkansas, responses of the state Medicaid and aging staff were most  		divided. Medicaid staff were adamant that no matter what the federal government  		said, they believed there would not be sufficient federal resources to cover  		all those who would qualify for services, and it would not be politically  		tenable for them to close intake. Aging staff, on the other hand, said they  		would do whatever it took to make a federally-funded HCBS program work. </p>
<p>Illinois aging staff were concerned about the structural and  		programmatic complexities involved in integrating a fixed budget program into  		their existing entitlement-based Community Care Program; they hoped there would  		be sufficient flexibility to allow this to happen so that they would not have  		to create a new and separate program. </p>
<p>In Maine, the principal concern was the "fit" between a  		federally-mandated and funded HCBS program and the state's plan to move in the  		direction of managed care for Medicaid recipients. While the state intends to  		begin managed care on the acute care side, it anticipates bringing long-term  		care in as well. </p>
<p>Indiana and North Dakota staff had similar reactions to the question of  		their state's ability to manage a significantly broadened HCBS program with a  		fixed budget. In both states, the general feeling was that they already were  		operating within a fixed budget environment, and that other state officials who  		are supportive of their current program are likely to continue to be supportive  		of any expansion effort. </p>
<h2><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion">CONCLUSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS</a></h2>
<p>As noted in the introduction, two interrelated areas of policy interest  		provided the impetus for conducting this exploratory examination of  		state-administered home and community-based services programs. One set of  		questions focused on how the programs are organized to deliver HCBS within  		fixed budgets, and what mechanisms they use to manage available resources and  		to respond to projected or actual budget shortfalls. The second set of  		policy-related questions focused on the administrative and programmatic  		relationships between eligibility determination, assessment, care planning and  		service authorization functions. </p>
<h4>1. Factors Relating to Operating Within Fixed  		Budgets</h4>
<p>What seems clear is that when there is no other option, states can and  		do operate their HCBS programs within the resources they have available. Four  		of the five states that have capped program budgets have developed the  		mechanisms necessary to manage them so that resources are not over-committed.  		Even the Illinois Community Care Program (CCP), which by court order is  		required to operate as an entitlement, includes all but one of the same control  		mechanisms -- and for the same purpose. </p>
<p>All five states limit participation, using age, types and degrees of  		functional disability, and income and/or asset levels in various combinations  		as criteria for eligibility. They also all limit costs by restricting the types  		of services available, and rely on cost caps -- of care plans, caseloads, and  		specific services -- as targets for maximum service expenditures. And, with the  		exception of Arkansas, they use cost-sharing as a client-directed utilization  		control mechanism. </p>
<p>Of course, the one critical difference between the Illinois program and  		the other statewide HCBS programs is that the CCP must provide services to  		applicants who meet its eligibility requirements. If necessary -- as has been  		reported to have been the case five or six times in its twelve year history --  		the state legislature will appropriate whatever funds are required to carry out  		the court order. The use of waiting lists, the last fallback of the other  		states to cap program expenditures, is not an option in Illinois. </p>
<p>States that have more Medicaid waiver slots (and associated earmarked  		match) than they are using, seem to be more relaxed about bringing eligible  		clients onto the caseload. Care plan targets for waiver clients are higher, and  		so too are care plan costs. The explanation offered is that waiver clients  		require more, and more skilled, care than non-waiver HCBS program clients.  		(Beyond the scope of the study, but of some interest, would be a comparison of  		client characteristics and care plan services and costs for waiver and  		non-waiver programs within the same service delivery structure.) </p>
<p>The state agencies managing the HCBS programs that were examined all  		have computerized information systems in place to track program expenditures,  		both by client and by local administering agency. By reviewing actual and  		projected costs against available resources, state staff are able to make  		decisions about the status of the program budget(s), assign client "slots" if  		and when it appears that resources are available to cover needed services, and,  		when necessary, propose appropriate expenditure-limiting changes so that  		program budgets are not over-extended. The bottom line is that if there is a  		bottom line, states and local programs seem to be able to do whatever is  		necessary to ensure that available funding is not exceeded. When there is no  		absolute bottom line, they do the best they can. </p>
<h4>2. Administrative and Programmatic Relationships Between  		Eligibility Determination, Assessment, Care Planning and Service Authorization  		Functions</h4>
<p>In general, non-waiver HCBS programs funded primarily by state and other  		resources have similar administrative and programmatic configurations for  		client assessment and eligibility determination, care planning and services  		authorization. Responsibility for managing these functions is vested in several  		different types of community-based agencies, but all use care managers to carry  		them out. On the other hand, although the same functions occur within Medicaid  		home and community-based waiver programs, responsibility for performing the  		various functions is more fragmented. </p>
<p>While community agency staff assess waiver applicants, and develop and  		implement care plans, authority to determine eligibility for Medicaid waiver  		programs rests with the state Medicaid agency. This is universally true for  		establishing financial eligibility and, with one exception among the waiver  		programs examined in the project, also true for determining functional  		eligibility status. </p>
<p>The single exception is Indiana's aged and disabled waiver. There, the  		locus of authority to determine functional eligibility for Indiana's aged and  		disabled waiver is located in the community at the care management level. In  		all other instances, the ultimate authority of the state Medicaid agency holds,  		even in Illinois where it takes the form of an after-the-fact process and in  		North Dakota where, at least for level of care decisions, a telephone review of  		client status usually suffices for the initial authorization to begin arranging  		for the delivery of waiver services. </p>
<p>Historically, there has been considerable emphasis on separating  		assessment and care planning functions and decision-making from the potential  		special interests of agencies which also provide care plan services. Except in  		Arkansas, where care planning decisions representing tens of millions of  		dollars for personal care services are made by the same agencies that then  		actually provide the services that are authorized in the care plan, this  		separation does seem to be the rule. </p>
<p>When the question was raised with state agency and AAA staff in  		Arkansas, the response was that there was no self-serving motivation involved  		in the care planning decisions that were made. Whatever "profit" margin was  		built into their rate structure was turned back into the budget to pay for  		services for persons who needed help but did not meet the state's Medicaid  		eligibility requirements. Whether or not the care plans are skewed is an  		empirical question beyond the scope of this study. </p>
<p>In the Medicaid Program, where financial and functional eligibility  		decisions are made by the state Medicaid agency, applicants are put on hold for  		Medicaid waiver services, frequently to their detriment. Attempts in several  		states to reduce the time period may help the situation somewhat. However, it  		seems that a major review of the issues and recommendations for dealing with  		the problems would be a worthwhile undertaking. </p>
<h4>3. Other Program Features of Policy Interest</h4>
<p>When there will be another attempt to legislate a federal home and  		community-based services program is difficult to predict. Nevertheless, it may  		be useful to summarize how several key elements of the Administration's  		original HCBS proposals would fit with program features of the operating HCBS  		programs included in the project. </p>
<p><b>(a) Using Functional Impairment Measures for Program Eligibility</b>.  		The principle of using functional impairment levels as the basis for  		establishing program eligibility fits very well with how states currently  		determine client eligibility for program participation. What might be  		problematic: The congruence between federal and state definitions and  		applications of specific ADLs and the number that would be required for  		eligibility (different states have expanded the original list of five ADLS,  		some considerably); whether and which IADLs might also be considered in making  		eligibility decisions; and whether and how a federally-mandated assessment  		instrument can/should substitute for or be incorporated into states' own  		time-tested assessment tools. </p>
<p>A related issue is the concept of choice of setting and the nursing home  		diversion strategy of HCB care. Any federal requirements regarding numbers  		and/or types of ADLS (and IADLs) for HCBS could affect existing state nursing  		facility eligibility rules and, ultimately, resident mix, as well. </p>
<p><b>(b) Not Using Financial Status as a Basis for Eligibility</b>. None  		of the state-funded HCBS programs in the study use income as a basis for  		establishing eligibility, and it is an empirical question to determine how many  		otherwise eligible applicants are turned away because of the asset limits  		imposed in the Illinois and North Dakota programs. (An intuitive guess is that  		the numbers are not so great that some adjustment could not be made.) Of much  		more likely concern to the states would be how much flexibility they would have  		to limit participation. </p>
<p>Both the Administration's and subsequent proposals for a federal HCBS  		program would have allowed states to specify the services that would be  		provided (except for the required personal care assistance services), set  		maximum rates for specific services, cap care plan costs, and use waiting  		lists. What would not have been allowed is perhaps the most powerful mechanism  		of all -- cost-sharing up to 100% above a protected amount to cover care plan  		costs. Without this last type of control as a safety valve, very long waiting  		lists for HCB services could become politically untenable. </p>
<p><b>(c) Requiring All States to Offer Client-Directed Personal Assistance  		Services</b>. Most of the state programs in the project do not include  		client-directed personal assistance services in their benefit packages.  		However, there does not appear to be any obvious evidence to suggest that such  		a service should/could not be developed. In this regard, a more detailed  		examination of North Dakota's use of individual providers -- many of whom are  		client-identified, and most are client-directed -- might prove useful for  		developing reasonable policies and workable recruitment, training, and  		monitoring parameters which could apply to densely populated as well as rural  		areas. </p>
<p><b>(d) Encouraging States to Consider a Generic Approach to HCB Services  		Driven by Functional Needs Rather Than Age</b>. Simply by emphasizing  		functional rather than age-related eligibility criteria in the Administration's  		HCBS proposals, states may be encouraged to pursue economies of scale that can  		result from taking a more generic approach to HCBS delivery. This is especially  		true for HCBS for younger adults with physical disabilities in states where  		there is no service delivery structure beyond the Medicaid system currently in  		place. A generic non-age-related approach may be more problematic in states  		where there are well-established service delivery systems, e.g., for older  		people and the MR/DD population. Political bridges may need to be built, but  		North Dakota and Indiana have created generic HCBS systems that combine the  		aged and adult physically disabled populations, and with apparently  		satisfactory results. </p>
<p><b>(e) Assuring that Eligibility Rules and Procedures Do Not Hinder  		Attaining Program Goals</b>. Although this issue was discussed above, it bears  		repeating. HCBS program staff expressed strong feelings about the time it takes  		to establish Medicaid eligibility and the negative impact these time lags have  		on their ability to assist people who want and are able to continue living in  		the community. Since community-based long-term care services and Medicaid  		waivers were designed primarily for such individuals, the staff frustration  		seems justified. Too frequently, a person has to be placed into a nursing home  		before the eligibility decisions are made. To be effective as a nursing home  		diversion strategy and also to truly offer clients a choice of long-term care  		settings, a program's eligibility rules and procedures must be able to  		accommodate the need for fast track eligibility decisions. </p>
<p>In conclusion, it appears that the major features of the Home and  		Community-Based Services Program included in the Administration's Health  		Security Act are compatible -- allowing for some adjustments -- with the  		existing home and community-based long-term care services programs included in  		this study. </p>
<h2>STATE HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES PROGRAM  		DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
<h2><a name="arkansas" id="arkansas">ARKANSAS</a></h2>
<h3>A. What are the Program Elements and Funding Sources for  		the State's Home and Community-Based Services System?</h3>
<h4>1. Principal Program Elements and Funding Sources</h4>
<p>Three program elements join together to make up Arkansas' home and  		community-based services system for older people: An "ElderChoices" Medicaid  		waiver program; the Medicaid state plan personal care option; and an Area  		Agency on Aging-administered "Home Care Support Program" (HCSP), which combines  		several federal and state funding sources. </p>
<p>The ElderChoices waiver program, first implemented in July, 1991, has a  		projected budget of about $15 million for the current fiscal year to provide a  		range of community-based long-term care services to persons 65 and older who  		meet the financial and medical/functional eligibility criteria for  		participation. The program currently is serving about 3100 clients, a number  		anticipated to increase to an active client census of 4250 by the end of this  		fiscal year. (State agency staff report that the waiver program could be at  		full capacity, utilizing all 9100 of its approved slots, by the end of state  		fiscal year 1996.) Although the state Medicaid agency has ultimate authority  		over the waiver, the Division of Aging and Adult Services has administrative  		responsibility to manage and operate the program at the service delivery level.  		</p>
<p>The second program element, Medicaid-reimbursed personal care services,  		complements the ElderChoices program. Since 1978, Arkansas has included the  		Medicaid personal care option in its state plan as a cost-efficient way to  		expand the availability of home care services for all Medicaid recipients who  		need personal care. </p>
<p>A budget estimate for Medicaid personal care services for the current  		year is not available. However, Medicaid payments last year -- at a  		federal/state match ratio of 75:25 -- were $52.7 million, to provide personal  		care to 16,560 clients. Since three out of four recipients of Medicaid personal  		care services in the state are 65 and older, it might be reasonable to  		extrapolate that perhaps three out of four personal care dollars expended -- or  		somewhere around $46 million (including $6 million for ElderChoices clients) --  		was for personal care services delivered to older adults. </p>
<p>The two principal providers certified to deliver Medicaid-reimbursable  		personal care services in Arkansas are Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and county  		health departments. Together they deliver about 90% of all Medicaid personal  		care benefits in the state.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The third program element in the Arkansas system is the community-based  		Home Care Support Program (HCSP), which provides a range of non-institutional  		home care services to people 60 and older who meet the program's broad  		eligibility requirements. The HCSP is funded by a combination of federal and  		state resources, managed by the Division of Aging and Adult Services (DAAS) and  		administered at the substate level by the Area Agency on Aging network. The  		HCSP budget for the current fiscal year totals $14.2 million, of which $5.65  		million is from Title III of the Older Americans Act; $2.25 million is from the  		Social Services Block Grant (SSBG); and $6.22 million is from state revenues,  		including a dedicated state cigarette tax. </p>
<p>Together, ElderChoices, the Medicaid personal care option, and the Home  		Care Services Program form a linked system that this year will be providing  		services totalling perhaps as much as $87 to $97 million for in-home and  		community-based services to Arkansas' older population.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>2. Other Home and Community-Based Services  		Resources</h4>
<p>One additional resource is "targeted care management" (TCM), another  		optional service under the Medicaid state plan. Despite its apparent potential  		as a resource for home and community-based care, Medicaid payments for targeted  		care management last year is estimated to have been only $400,000. </p>
<p>TCM is available for Medicaid recipients 60 and older who have limited  		functional capacity requiring the coordination of multiple services, or who are  		at risk of abuse, neglect or exploitation. Currently, Area Agencies on Aging  		are the major TCM providers. However, county health departments, which are  		already certified as Medicaid vendors, have recently begun expressing interest  		in offering targeted care management to their Medicaid-eligible clients as  		well. </p>
<p>Arkansas does not have a cost-sharing provisions for its home-based care  		programs. </p>
<h3>B. How are the Program Budgets Established?</h3>
<p>Like state agencies in other states, Arkansas' aging and Medicaid  		agencies prepare budget proposals for state general revenues based on analyses  		of their programs' experiences and growth projections. (Resources from  		formula-derived grant programs as well as dedicated state revenues are  		pre-determined.) After this exercise, however, the budget process itself takes  		over, and politics become the primary basis for deciding how the state budget  		will be constructed. </p>
<h3>C. What are the Principal Issues Affecting Program  		Financing?</h3>
<p>Like many rural states with a relatively low average per capita income,  		Arkansas has had a difficult time producing the revenues it needs to operate  		essential state services and continue to support its human services system,  		including its longstanding commitment to home and community-based services for  		the state's older population. Several years ago, as a way of generating  		additional state match for Medicaid dollars, it instituted a "provider tax" --  		as did a number of other states -- only to have it subsequently declared  		illegal by HCFA. </p>
<p>To compensate, the state legislature placed a small wholesale tax on  		soft drinks, with the proceeds to be used specifically for state Medicaid  		match. Although a statewide referendum mounted by the soft drink industry to  		repeal the "soda pop" tax was voted down in the 1994 election by a margin of  		54% to 46%, the referendum underscores advocates' concerns regarding the  		instability of funding for home care services generally, and Medicaid personal  		care services in particular. As evidence of their concern, they pointed to the  		fact that the referendum received considerable support from cigarette  		manufacturers, whose motivation could very well have been a belief that if the  		soda pop tax could be voted down, they could do the same with the dedicated  		cigarette tax -- which now funds transportation and home-delivered meals  		services for the state's older population. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that while smaller federal and state funding sources  		may or may not experience cutbacks, the very significant Medicaid-funded  		elements of the state's home and community-based services program seem to be  		especially vulnerable. In a situation where state Medicaid match dollars  		frequently tend to be difficult to find, optional state plan services -- even  		if they are viewed very positively -- are likely to be put on the table, at  		least for discussion. Given this review process, they become more susceptible  		to being cut back or, if the budget situation is serious enough, eliminated  		entirely. </p>
<h3>D. How are the Home and Community-Based Services  		Programs Administered at the State and Substate Levels? </h3>
<p>As noted, the structure for organizing home and community-based services  		in Arkansas is comprised of three interrelated service programs. Two of them,  		ElderChoices and the Personal Care Option, while both funded by Medicaid, are  		operationally differentiated and also have some different administrative and  		program eligibility requirements. The third, the Home Care Services Program,  		while managed by the same state agency (DAAS) as ElderChoices, is operated by  		yet a different service delivery mechanism at the substate level. Also, the  		HCSP is actually a composite comprised of multiple funding sources, which --  		while they mainly share common, programmatic and client eligibility criteria --  		still have a few requirements unique to particular funding streams. </p>
<h4>1. Eligibility Requirements</h4>
<p><b>(a) ElderChoices</b>. In order to be eligible for ElderChoices, an  		applicant must be at least 65 years of age; have an income no greater than 300%  		of SSI with no more than $2000 ($3000 for a couple) in countable assets; and  		have medical care and/or functional support needs requiring an intermediate  		level of care that could only be provided in a nursing facility setting if home  		care services were not available. </p>
<p>Arkansas uses informed "professional judgment" rather than numeric  		scoring to grade the severity of an applicant's condition and circumstances in  		order to establish medical necessity for nursing home care. Among the factors  		taken into account are the need for regular nursing care, supervision and/or  		monitoring for medical conditions, in conjunction with the need for assistance  		with two or more ADL functions, i.e., eating, transferring, walking, toileting,  		bathing and grooming. </p>
<p><b>(b) Optional Personal Care Services</b>. Eligibility for Medicaid  		personal care services requires that an individual be a categorically-needy  		Medicaid recipient and have at least two ADL impairments that significantly  		limit their capacity to function independently. </p>
<p><b>(c) Home Care Services Program</b>. In general terms, eligibility  		criteria for the HCSP are fairly broadly deflined. A person must be at least 60  		years of age, be frail and unable to independently perform normal daily tasks,  		and live alone and/or not have a significant support system to provide needed  		assistance. In addition, for services supported by Older Americans Act Title  		III resources, the individual also must exhibit a "social" need, e.g., have a  		low income, be isolated, and/or be a member of a minority group. For SSBG  		services and state-funded personal care services, eligibility requirements make  		the low income measure explicit -- recipients of these services cannot have  		incomes in excess of 200% of SSI. </p>
<h4>2. Eligibility Determination Procedures</h4>
<p><b>(a) ElderChoices</b>. Registered nurses, employed by DAAS and  		deployed around the state in regional offices of the Department of Human  		Services, are responsible for assessing needs and developing care plans for the  		ElderChoices program. If an individual is 65 or older, and either is a Medicaid  		recipient or appears likely to meet ElderChoices'waiver eligibility criteria,  		s/he is usually referred to an ElderChoices nurse for an assessment. Referrals  		come from a variety of sources, e.g., AAAs, hospitals, physicians, social  		service and health departments, and senior centers. </p>
<p>As soon as possible after a referral, the RN makes arrangements with the  		applicant to conduct an assessment of needs, using a standardized instrument.  		Then the assessment form, which also includes a plan of care and a physician's  		sign-off, is forwarded for a level of care determination to the state Office of  		Long Term Care, within the Office of Medical Services, the state Medicaid  		agency. If the applicant is not yet financially qualified, the nurse care  		manager will try to assist in facilitating the application to determine  		eligibility, since it too is necessary for Medicaid reimbursement.  		Unfortunately, all of this takes a great deal of time, including a not  		infrequent time lapse between referrals and client assessments.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>(b) Optional Personal Care Services</b>. To be eligible for personal  		care benefits under the Medicaid state plan, a person must first meet the  		income and age and/or disability criteria for general Medicaid eligibility.  		This part of the process is performed by staff of the state Medicaid agency,  		and is based on information contained in the Medicaid application and  		supporting documents. For Medicaid recipients who may need personal care,  		certified personal care service providers are authorized to assess specific  		needs and develop a plan of care based on the information collected during the  		required assessment process. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, this means that in most cases either the relevant Area  		Agency on Aging or county health department, as certified providers, will  		assign a staff person to conduct the assessment, develop the plan of care and,  		after obtaining a physician's signature, provide the care that is authorized.  		As long as the prescribed hours are within the state cap, no further  		authorization is required. Even though clients have the freedom to choose any  		certified provider s/he prefers, for the time being at least, their choices are  		limited basically to either the AAA or the health department; and it is  		reasonably certain that whichever agency does the assessment will also be the  		agency that delivers the service. </p>
<p><b>(c) Home Care Services Program</b>. Area Agency on Aging care  		managers are responsible for doing intake and developing a services plan for  		non-Medicaid clients in need of home care services. Other than for state-funded  		personal care -- which requires the same standardized assessment, care plan and  		physician sign-off as the optional personal care benefit -- how AAAs go about  		determining client need and arranging for services under the HCSP is much more  		loosely-structured than in either of the other two programs. </p>
<h4>3. Care Planning and On-Going Care Management</h4>
<p>Although on-going care management is essentially the same in the three  		programs, each has somewhat different policies and procedures for care  		planning. For ElderChoices, care plans are developed by registered nurses in  		conjunction with conducting a standardized assessment. Individual client care  		plan costs are capped at 100% of Medicaid's average ICF payment, $1636/month,  		which can be annualized to accommodate periods of heavier care needs. Even with  		the inclusion of Medicaid personal care in the cost calculation, ElderChoices  		care plan costs this fiscal year are averaging only about $500/month. </p>
<p>For Medicaid personal care services, as noted above, the required plan  		of care is prepared by the provider agency. In accordance with the Medicaid  		agency's current policy, the maximum amount of service that can be authorized  		without its prior approval is 72 hours per month. Although AAAs (and county  		health departments) are required to adhere to this policy, it is unclear  		whether residential care facilities, which also are certified to provide  		Medicaid personal care, are also expected to operate within the cap.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Care planning for the Home Care Services Program is done by AAA care  		managers in conjunction with intake and assessment. While the DAAS has  		developed several forms that can be used to collect information and maintain  		client records, they are not required. As long as AAAs adhere to DAAS policies  		for the various funding streams that comprise and support the HCSP, they have  		considerable latitude to specify how the services they make available will be  		organized and delivered. </p>
<p>All clients receiving services from any one of the three programs are  		followed by care management staff, although some more closely than others. For  		ElderChoices, RN care managers are required to maintain contact with clients on  		a regularly-scheduled basis, and reassessments must be completed and a new plan  		of care developed as circumstances change, or no less frequently than once a  		year. For Medicaid personal care services, clients' plans of care must be  		reviewed every 60 days, or when there has been a change in circumstances.  		Ongoing care management for HCSP clients varies in intensity and frequency,  		depending on the particular circumstances of individual clients, but care  		managers attempt to maintain a schedule of monthly contacts and bimonthly home  		visits. </p>
<h4>4. Available Services and Service Providers</h4>
<p><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#exhibitC">Exhibit C</a> displays the home and community-based  		services available through ElderChoices, the Home Care Services Program, and  		the Medicaid state plan. While there is some overlap, the broadest range of  		services is available through the HCSP. In keeping with its philosophy, the  		HCSP services listing includes "emergency assistance" and "other services,"  		which give AAA care managers considerable flexibility to be responsive to  		client needs that do not fit into one of the specified service categories. </p>
<p>For the Home Care Services Program, AAAs can identify and contract with  		providers, including individual contractors who are not family members and who  		they deem to be appropriate to deliver services to AAA clients. However,  		providers of the eight ElderChoices waiver services must be certified by the  		Division of Aging and Adult Services, as well as be approved by the state  		Medicaid agency as qualified Medicaid vendors. In addition, an authorized  		provider for Medicaid personal care and targeted care management must be  		licensed by the state -- either as an all-encompassing home health agency or as  		a limited provider of personal care services. Arkansas does not utilize  		independent contractors for Medicaid-reimbursable services. </p>
<p>Area Agencies on Aging, instrumental in getting the personal care option  		included in the state's Medicaid plan more than a decade ago and in providing  		the personal care workers needed to deliver the service, continue to be the  		primary providers of Medicaid-reimbursable personal care services. As a result,  		Medicare/Medicaid-certified private home health agencies focused their  		attention on Medicare and other Medicaid-related services, but not personal  		care. AAAs, together with county health departments, had essentially put a lock  		on the personal care market. </p>

</tr></table><h3>E. What Budget Control Mechanisms are Used to Ensure  		that Program Spending Remains Within Budget Limits?</h3>
<p>Budget control mechanisms also vary by program. For the HCSP, the budget  		is self-controlling. AAAs develop service plans that identify how much of what  		resources will be dedicated to what services, using funds they receive from  		DAAS through a grant mechanism. Expenditures are then reviewed against  		projections, and adjustments are made as needed; but there is no opportunity to  		overspen4. </p>
<p>For ElderChoices, the active client census is far below the number of  		approved slots and available budget, so the only significant budget control  		issue is whether care plan expenditures are within maximum cost caps. A  		computerized data base for ElderChoices allows DAAS staff to track clients'  		status, services and costs. For Medicaid's optional personal care and targeted  		care management services, the Medicaid agency depends on its MMIS -- as it does  		for all its benefits -- to track client and expenditure data. </p>
<h3>F. What, if any, Aspects or Features of the Programs  		Have Been Problematic, and What Kinds of Solutions are Being Tried or  		Considered to Remedy the Problems?</h3>
<p>One major problem that surfaced in Arkansas -- and may well be universal  		and of significant impact in every state administering a 2176 waiver -- relates  		to the time it takes to process applications for Medicaid eligibility and/or to  		receive responses to requests for level of care determinations. For individuals  		being discharged from a hospital or nursing home, the system, almost by  		definition, does not work. In many instances where services included in a  		cost-effective plan of care would be sufficient to maintain a person in his or  		her own home, by the time the ElderChoices nurse is informed about the  		financial eligibility and/or level of care determination decision(s), the  		person has either died or entered (or chose to remain in) a nursing home. </p>
<p>The DAAS is taking several steps to attempt to remedy this serious  		problem. First, it is in the process of amending the Medicaid waiver to allow  		retroactive reimbursement if a service plan is activated prior to receiving  		confirmation of an applicant's financial eligibility and/or level of need  		determination. While this places the provider at risk, in at least some  		instances it is almost certain that the approvals will be forthcoming, and a  		number of providers already are using stop-gap resources to bridge the time  		period until approval is given to initiate the plan of care. </p>
<p>A second change being undertaken by DAAS is to underwrite the salaries  		of Medicaid income eligibility workers so that they can be outstationed in AAA  		offices to expedite at least the financial eligibility determinations necessary  		for participating in Medicai4. </p>
<p>Another time-related problem has at least been alleviated for the  		short-term with the recent increase of DAAS registered nurses available to  		conduct assessments, develop plans of care and perform the other functions  		associated with effective care management. But there could still be a  		continuing problem, given the projected increases in the ElderChoices active  		caseloa4. State government employee slots, especially in a limited budget  		environment, are difficult to acquire. It is not clear whether the DAAS has  		examined the staffing and, by extension, service implications of retaining the  		ElderChoices program within its operational aegis, when it may continue to have  		great difficulty -- or even be unsuccessful -- in expanding staff slots to  		adequately accommodate a significantly increased ElderChoices caseloa4. </p>
<p>A final issue relates to the potential for conflict of interest when  		personal care providers are also in the position of authorizing the services  		they are providing. In Arkansas, this is a particularly important issue, since  		essentially all of its Medicaid personal care services are delivered within  		this framework. If a federal program were initiated which required the  		separation of services authorization from service provision, Arkansas Area  		Agencies on Aging and county health departments would face a serious problem as  		would the DAAS, the Medicaid agency, and the recipients of Medicaid services  		across the state. </p>
<h3>G. To What Extent are Home and Community-Based Services  		Perceived as Mechanisms for Reducing Nursing Home Costs?</h3>
<p>Although DAAS continues to try and make the case for viewing home and  		community-based services programs as less costly alternatives to nursing home  		care, it has also begun to emphasize the intrinsic value of giving people the  		option to choose which type of care setting they would prefer. One DAAS staff  		person suggested that the latter argument might actually be the more successful  		one anyway, because it was far less likely to enflame nursing home owners, who  		would be formidable foes should home-based care be perceived as a threat to  		their business interests. </p>
<p>With respect to Medicaid, it would appear from even a brief discussion  		with several Medicaid agency staff that they do not see community-based care as  		offering a valid alternative for individuals who need more medically-oriented  		care -- particularly ElderChoices clients who, by definition, must meet nursing  		facility level of need requirements. Given this view, it is not surprising that  		the state's nursing home bed supply is above the national average and continues  		to expan4. Between 1983 and 1993, the ratio of nursing facility beds per 1000  		persons 65 and older increased from 62.5 to 67.1.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>H. How Do State Officials Evaluate Their Ability to  		Manage a Home and Community-Based Care Program within a Fixed, as Opposed to  		Open-Ended Entitlement, Budget?</h3>
<p>Arkansas represents what seems to be the general tenor of opinion in a  		number of states across the country regarding a federally-mandated home and  		community-based services program with a fixed budget. The Division of Aging and  		Adult Services and AAA staff say they would welcome it -- even though they  		obviously would prefer an open-ended budget -- and "deal with anything they  		would have to deal with" if the program would support the expansion of  		community care services in the state. </p>
<p>In contrast, state Medicaid agency staff were adamantly opposed to  		capped funding. Their position was quite clear: (1) No matter what the federal  		government said, they believe there would not be sufficient money in the budget  		to appropriately serve the number of people who would be eligible; and (2) even  		if the program allowed them the flexibility to close intake, it would not be  		possible for them to do so because of the political power wielded by vested  		interests. </p>

<h3>A. What are the Program Elements and Funding Sources for  		the State's Community Care Program?</h3>
<h4>1. Principal Program Elements and Funding Sources</h4>
<p>Illinois Community Care Program (CCP), one of the  		earlier statewide home and community-based care programs in the country,  		provides homemaker and adult day care services to persons 60 and older,  		irrespective of income. Since it began in the late 1970's, the program has gone  		through several iterations. In terms of how it is financed, the most  		significant change resulted from a 1982 court order, following a law suit  		challenging the long waiting lists that the CCP had at the time. The effect of  		the court ruling was to change the nature of the CCP from a limited grant  		program to a statewide entitlement program, supported in part by a Medicaid  		waiver but mainly by state general revenues. </p>
<p>The Community Care Program is administered at the substate level by 62  		"case coordination units" (CCUs) that serve as the single point of entry for  		CCP services. Both structurally and administratively, the CCP functions as a  		unified service delivery system, with no distinctions regarding who is eligible  		to receive services or how the program works. For the current fiscal year, the  		state appropriation for CCP services is $105 million. The Medicaid waiver, with  		a federal/state match ratio of 50:50, has a projected budget of slightly more  		than $60 million to cover about 19,000 approved slots. </p>
<p>Last year, CCP expenditures totalling $100 million served an average  		caseload of 28,000 clients/month -- about one-third of whom were covered under  		the Medicaid waiver. Unfortunately, because no distinction is made between  		Medicaid and non-Medicaid clients at the service delivery level, and even at  		the state level in terms of program management, no figures are readily  		available until the end of each fiscal year to show the actual distribution of  		CCP expenditures across the two funding sources. However, past experience  		suggests that the budget distribution more or less mirrors the distribution of  		program recipients by their eligibility status, and since client needs are not  		weighted more heavily on the Medicaid side, it can be assumed that about  		one-third of CCP expenditures are likely to be covered by the Medicaid waiver  		and the remaining two-thirds by state general revenues.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>2. Other Home and Community-Based Services  		Resources</h4>
<p>Older Americans Act Title III resources, administered at the substate  		level by 13 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), are used primarily to provide  		services to older people who do not meet the level of need and/or assets  		criteria for the CCP.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note12">12</a></font></sup>  		CCP clients have no priority status vis-a-vis these services, which are  		provided on an as-needed and as-available basis, particularly home-delivered  		meals and transportation. Social Services Block Grant funds, administered by  		the state's Department of Public Aid, are negligible with respect to supporting  		community-based services for older people. </p>
<p>The CCP has a cost-sharing provision which it applies to all program  		clients. The amount of participant responsibility is derived by using a  		combination of clients' non-exempt income minus a protected amount (100% of  		poverty) and a complex formula that includes a "client fixed fee share" for  		each unit of service, the number people in the family receiving CCP services,  		and the intensity of nee4. Once determined, client copayments -- which can  		equal 100% of costs -- are paid directly to providers, who then bill the state  		agency if there is any balance due for services rendere4. Cost-sharing actually  		generates very little revenue -- less than 3% of program costs -- which  		suggests that even though program eligibility is not income-related, CCP  		clients are of relatively low income. </p>
<h3>B. How is the Budget Established for the Program?</h3>
<p>Because the Community Care Program functions as an entitlement, the  		budget process operates quite differently than it would under the more usual  		state appropriations scenario. Budget figures are developed initially for each  		budget cycle by the state agency that manages the CCP, the Illinois Department  		on Aging (IDoA). IDoA staff prepare detailed explanations and justifications to  		back up the proposed numbers, which are based on the program's history, growth  		factors and anticipated policy changes for the coming year. There is always  		considerable pressure on the IDoA to come up with its best projection of how  		much state money the program will need for the fiscal year, to reduce the  		likelihood that it will have to go back to the state legislature for a  		supplemental appropriation. </p>
<p>Advocacy groups in Illinois also play a role in the state budget-making  		process. In the early stages they are given an opportunity to meet with Bureau  		of the Budget staff to make their case in support of the Community Care Program  		and the various aspects of its budget, and subsequently, they try to make their  		case again during legislative budget hearings. Historically, however, state  		fiscal constraints have left little room to be responsive, even to what may  		seem to be justifiable requests. </p>
<h3>C. What are the Principal Issues Affecting Program  		Financing?</h3>
<p>As noted above, the fact that the CCP is an entitlement program is the  		principal issue affecting its financing and budgeting process. As long as CCP  		continues to operate under the 1982 court order, the state legislature will  		continue to appropriate whatever resources are necessary to fund the program.  		One effect of this is that the state has a special interest in increasing the  		proportion of CCP clients on Medicai4. Since it pays only 50% of the service  		dollars for Medicaid waiver clients, CCU care managers are expected to  		encourage applicants who might possibly meet Medicaid eligibility requirements  		to apply for Medicaid status. However, at least for the time being, individuals  		who are potentially eligible for Medicaid but choose not to apply are not  		denied CCP services, as long as they meet the functional need and asset  		requirements. </p>
<h3>D. How is the Program Administered at the State and  		Substate Levels? </h3>
<p>The Community Care Program is managed at the state level by the Illinois  		Department on Aging (IDoA), and at the community level by 62 "care coordination  		units" (CCUs), which are housed in a number of different types of community  		agencies, e.g., county health departments, home health, family and social  		service agencies and multi-purpose senior centers.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>CCU agencies are under contract with the IDoA to provide assessment and  		care management services to CCP applicants and eligible clients. In addition to  		these activities, CCUs also are responsible for conducting pre-admission  		screening for Medicaid recipients and other applicants for nursing home  		placement who are likely to spend down to Medicaid eligibility within 60 days.  		Because the same instrument is used for determining the need for nursing home  		and CCP services, CCU care managers are well-positioned to offer  		community-based service alternatives to nursing home applicants who may still  		retain some desire -- and capacity -- to remain in their own homes. </p>
<h4>1. Eligibility Requirements</h4>
<p>Eligibility criteria for the CCP are straightforward: Applicants must be  		at least 60 years of age and certified to have non-exempt assets not exceeding  		$10,000. Income is not an eligibility criterion. Applicants also must  		demonstrate an appropriate level of need for CCP services according to a  		standardized assessment instrument, referred to as the "Determination of Need"  		(DON). The DON includes measures of both cognitive and functional status and  		takes into account available physical and environmental supports provided by  		family, friends, and others in the community in order to determine net nee4.  		</p>
<p>Both ADLs and IADLs are addressed in the DON and, interestingly, are  		given the same weight in the judgments that are made about an applicant's  		functional capacity and extent of nee4. ADL functions included are: eating,  		bathing, grooming, dressing, transferring and incontinence; IADL functions are:  		telephoning, meal preparation, capable of being left alone, managing money,  		taking care of routine and special health needs, going outside the home and  		doing laundry and housework. In addition, the DON includes the mini-mental  		status scale as a measure of cognitive impairment. </p>
<p>DON functional scores are based on two sets of four point scales. One  		set scores level of limitation for each ADL and IADL function, ranging from  		none or only minor impairment to total inability to perform a particular  		function independently. The other set scores level of need for assistance, from  		none to extensive. Taken together, the two scores reflect net functional nee4.  		Additional points reflecting the measure of cognitive impairment are then added  		to the two score total; an applicant whose total is above the established  		minimum cutoff is considered eligible for the CCP. </p>
<h4>2. Eligibility Determination Procedures</h4>
<p>CCU care managers receive applicant referrals from a variety of sources  		and follow up by arranging an appointment to administer the DON and financial  		information forms. Except under special circumstances, usually when an  		applicant is hospitalized or in a nursing facility at the time of the  		assessment, the CCP requires that a CCU care manager conduct a home visit in  		conjunction with performing the assessment. </p>
<p>Eligibility for CCP services is determined at the service delivery  		level. Since the total DON score determines whether an applicant will meet the  		functional requirements for eligibility for CCP services, the functional  		eligibility determination procedure is effectively finished once the DON  		instrument is complete4. Financial information and related documents also are  		collected at the time of the assessment, and as long as the applicant's  		countable assets are within the allowed $10,000, CCP services can be initiate4.  		</p>
<h4>3. Care Planning and On-Going Care Management</h4>
<p>The DON score not only determines whether an applicant is eligible for  		CCP services, but also sets maximum CCP payments for care plan costs, based on  		his or her net level of need score. According to the standardized payment  		scale, CCP responsibility for care plan costs can range from $1 to $1445 per  		month. (Last year's average monthly care plan cost was $302.) </p>
<p>One effect of working with a standardized payment scale reflecting  		relatively narrow ranges of scored need is that for CCP care managers, care  		planning is a much less complicated matter than in other state programs where  		there are more service options to consider and a much wider range of care plan  		dollars to work with. (The IDoA does allow for an "emergency" increase in the  		amount established by the standardized payment scale for client care plans, but  		only for a very limited 15 day period, and only with its approval.) Given these  		structured limits, CCU care managers nevertheless develop care plans that can  		be considered adequate to meet client needs, since each one has to be reviewed  		and signed off on by a physician, registered nurse or other medical  		practitioner. </p>
<h4>4. Available Services and Service Providers</h4>
<p>Technically, only two specific services are offered and can be  		authorized by CCU care managers -- homemaker and adult day care. However,  		because the activities included are extensive, a broader array of need is  		covered than would appear to be the case. For example, adult day care includes  		not only social day care activities, but also rehabilitation and skilled  		nursing services on an optional basis. And homemaker services include not only  		housekeeping, shopping, meal planning and preparation, but also assisting with  		medications, and performing personal care tasks such as bathing and grooming,  		assistance with transferring and range of motion, et3. </p>
<p>In Illinois, the state agency contracts directly with local providers  		for CCP services. IDoA uses a six year procurement cycle, which allows them to  		recompete the contracts of one-third of the providers every two years. Since  		the state establishes a single, statewide unit rate for each of the two CCP  		services, criteria for selecting providers are based on factors other than  		cost, i.e., community knowledge and involvement, offers to provide additional  		optional services, and previous CCP experience. </p>
<h3>E. What Budget Control Mechanisms are Used to Ensure  		that Program Spending Remains Within Budget Limits? </h3>
<p>Even with an entitlement program, in which participation cannot be  		limited on the basis of income, there are several ways the state can try to  		limit costs. One obvious method Illinois has used is to narrow the determinants  		of need and accept only those clients who have significant functional  		limitations and very limited or no outside supports to provide necessary  		assistance. Other cost control measures taken by the state include: limiting  		the services offered by the program, limiting the reimbursement rates, and  		increasing the client burden for cost-sharing.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> While cost-sharing does generate some  		additional resources, it is intended mainly to create a "prudent purchaser"  		approach in the care planning process. </p>
<p>Beyond these programmatic and administrative methods, IDoA retains very  		centralized control of the entire cost and payment system for the CCP. State  		agency staff review and approve initial care plans where costs are in excess of  		a predetermined target, based on the statewide average care plan cost for the  		client's DON score. They also conduct centralized reviews of requests to  		increase care plan services from CCUs with a history of higher than average  		care plan costs, and review and sign off on all vendor invoices submitted for  		payment. </p>
<p>IDoA staff track and compare actual expenditures against projections for  		each service and for care management costs, and generate monthly reports  		comparing the two sets of figures. (The CCP budget has three separate line  		items, one for each of the two services and one for CCU care management.) </p>
<p>After monthly billings are paid for all client services provided during  		the month, IDoA forwards computer tapes, with relevant client and vendor  		information, to the state Medicaid agency, the Department of Public Aid (DPA).  		It is only at this point that the distinction between a Medicaid-eligible  		client and a non-Medicaid-eligible client is made. The DPA runs the CCP vendor  		payment tapes against its records of individuals who are Medicaid recipients.  		This procedure is the sole basis for identifying how many waiver slots have  		been used, and which specific CCP expenditures are chargeable to the Medicaid  		waiver. Should there appear to be an overage, in either the use of slots or the  		budget, the DPA would notify the IDoA so that program adjustments could be  		made. (This is not likely to be a problem for a while at least, since the  		number of approved slots is considerably higher and the projected budget  		figures considerably less than what the CCP program is able to use.) </p>
<h3>F. What, if any, Aspects or Features of the Programs  		Have Been Problematic and What Kinds of Solutions are Being Tried or Considered  		to Remedy the Problems?</h3>
<p>IDoA has been developing and managing the Community Care Program for  		more than a decade, with the same state agency leadership involved with the  		program since its inception. Although the program has gone through a number of  		iterations over the years, with the exception of the shift from a grant to an  		entitlement program, the changes have primarily been refinements of what had  		come before. The one persistent problem is how to project and manage program  		costs so that the state revenue appropriation is on target -- neither too  		little, nor too much. </p>
<p>It was estimated that over the past 12 years since the court order, the  		IDoA had to go to the state legislature for a supplemental appropriation five  		or six times; and during the same period, underspent its budget about the same  		number of times. IDoA staff are constantly looking for ways to refine their  		data and their procedures so that both concerns are lessened, if not completely  		eliminate4. </p>
<h3>G. To What Extent are Home and Community-Based Services  		Perceived as Mechanisms for Reducing Nursing Home Costs?</h3>
<p>Like most states that initiated home-based care programs in the late  		1970's and early 1980's, Illinois' original motivation was to offer  		non-institutional alternatives, primarily for older people who would prefer to  		remain in their own homes rather than being placed in a nursing home setting.  		And similar to most if not all of these states today, Illinois is now viewing  		its Community Care Program as a mechanism for saving money by diverting people  		from nursing facility care if they can be maintained safely and  		cost-effectively in a non-institutional community environment. </p>
<p>On the other side, however, Illinois has not made any significant effort  		to control nursing home bed supply, which has been and continues to be above  		the national average. Between 1983 and 1993, the number of nursing home beds  		per 1000 persons 65 and older increased from 68.1 to 70.0.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> According to state agency  		staff, despite evidence to the contrary, the prevailing assumption seems to be  		that market forces and competition will control prices. </p>
<h3>H. How Do State Officials Evaluate Their Ability to  		Manage a Home and Community-Based Care Program within a Fixed, as Opposed to  		Open-Ended Entitlement, Budget?</h3>
<p>Illinois Department on Aging staff would welcome an expansion of the  		financing base for home and community-based services. However, because of the  		entitlement nature of the program as it stands, integrating a new  		federally-supported home and community-based services program with a fixed  		budget into the state's pre-existing CCP framework would be quite complicate4.  		Even with a considerable amount of flexibility, it would not be easy for the  		state to reconcile the two contradictory approaches in a programmatically sound  		and cost-efficient manner. </p>
<h2><a name="indiana" id="indiana">INDIANA</a></h2>
<h3>A. What are the Program Elements and Funding Sources for  		the State's In-Home Services Program?</h3>
<h4>1. Principal Program Elements and Funding Sources</h4>
<p>In 1992, Indiana consolidated funding from several, previously separate,  		programs and created a new statewide "IN-Home Services Program" (IHSP) to  		provide a "comprehensive, coordinated alternative to institutional placement"  		for all its citizens, based on need and irrespective of age. The nucleus of the  		IHSP is the state-funded "Community and Home Options to Institutional Care for  		the Elderly and Disabled" (CHOICE)<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> and five Medicaid waivers -- one targeted to  		the aged and disabled, three to the MR/DD population with one specifically for  		persons with autism, and the fifth to medically-fragile children. </p>
<p>For the current fiscal year, the total federal and state IHSP funding  		level is projected to be about $90 million. Of this amount, $45 million (50%)  		is the estimated total combined budget for the five waivers;<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> $24.5 million (27%) in state  		funds is budgeted for CHOICE. The balance of $20.5 million (23%) represents  		combined federal and state funding from SSBG, Title III and USDA meal  		supplements, and the "Older Hoosiers" programs for home care-related services  		to assist people who are basically able to care for themselves, but who  		nevertheless could benefit from some help, and also to supplement waiver and  		CHOICE services. </p>
<p>In terms of numbers of people served, projections are that CHOICE  		funding will cover about 5000 non-Medicaid eligible clients, and Title III and  		SSBG will provide one or more of their services to another 70,000 people. For  		the same period, all of the waivers combined are projected to serve just under  		3000 clients. Following is a breakdown of the budgets and numbers of approved  		slots for each waiver: </p>

</tr></table><h4>2. Other Home and Community-Based Services  		Resources</h4>
<p>As noted above, resources from Title III of the Older Americans Act, the  		Social Services Block Grant and several smaller state programs -- together  		totalling about $20.5 million -- are also a significant element of Indiana's  		IHSP. These resources fund a range of community-based services for older people  		and others who are less functionally impaired than waiver or CHOICE clients,  		but who could nevertheless benefit from some home care services and assistance.  		They also are used to provide needed, supplemental services that are not  		covered under a waiver or CHOICE. Although these resources represent the  		smallest proportion of the IHSP budget, they are expected to be the first  		dollar expenditures in terms of developing care plans to meet client needs.  		</p>
<p>The IHSP has a cost-sharing formula for CHOICE-funded services that  		results in expanding CHOICE resources by about 1%. The formula, which  		calculates a client's share of the cost of CHOICE services, is designed to  		protect net income (after Medically-related expenses are deducted) up to 150%  		of poverty adjusted by family size. The client's share, calculated as a  		percentage of service costs, gradually increases up to a maximum of 100% when  		net income exceeds 350% of the adjusted poverty level. </p>
<h3>B. How are the Budgets Established for the IHS  		Program?</h3>
<p>In preparation for the state budget deliberations that occur during each  		legislative session, staff from the state agency responsible for managing the  		IHSP -- the Bureau of Aging and In-Home Services -- work with other  		administration officials to develop the budget proposals for funding CHOICE and  		other related state-supported programs. The numbers that are generated are  		based on the programs' operating experience over the previous year and growth  		projections for the coming year. Budget proposals and justifications are  		reviewed, modified as appropriate, and then included in the Governor's budget  		submission to the legislature. </p>
<p>A Medicaid Waiver Unit within the Bureau of Aging and In-Home Services  		is instrumental in developing budget figures for each of the Medicaid waivers.  		Working closely with the state Medicaid agency, staff from the waiver unit are  		responsible for recommending necessary waiver modifications and preparing the  		documentation needed to submit to HCFA for approval of the modification  		requests. Except for the aged and disabled waiver, state match is drawn from  		the overall state Medicaid match appropriation, which includes Medicaid state  		plan expenditures as well. (Match for the aged and disabled waiver is taken  		from the CHOICE appropriation each year.) </p>
<h3>C. What are the Principal Issues Affecting Program  		Financing?</h3>
<p>Indiana, like every other state, has been operating in a tight budget  		mode resulting from the state's economic downturn over the past decade. As a  		result, the CHOICE budget has remained at level funding since 1991, when it  		more than doubled at the time it merged with the Medicaid waivers and other  		federal and state resources into the IHSP. Despite the fact that CHOICE has not  		received any budget increases since then, an indication of the legislature's  		and the administration's continued support for the program is that its unspent  		funds can be carried over to the following year, a policy that does not apply  		to most other state-funded human service programs. </p>
<h3>D. How are the Programs Administered at the State and  		Substate Levels? </h3>
<p>Responsibility for overall management of the IN-Home Services Program,  		including the five waivers, rests with the state Bureau of Aging and In-Home  		Services (BAIHS), a program unit in the Division of Disability, Aging and  		Rehabilitative Services of the Indiana Family and Social Services  		Administration (FSSA). Administrative authority and management specific to the  		five waivers, including tracking costs and assigning waiver slots as they  		become available, rests with the previously-mentioned Medicaid Waiver Unit  		(MWU) within the BAIHS. </p>
<p>At the substate level, Indiana's sixteen Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs)  		administer all of the various components that together constitute the  		comprehensive IHSP, with sign-off authority for all Medicaid waiver services  		included in IHSP care plans. Area Agencies on Aging also have responsibility  		for conducting pre-admission screening for all nursing home placements for  		Medicaid eligibles and private pays.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> AAA care managers are authorized to approve  		nursing facility placement at the ICF level for both categories of applicants.  		SNF decisions and all denials are made by the Office of Medicaid Planning and  		Policy, the state Medicaid agency located within the FSS1. </p>
<h4>1. Eligibility Requirements<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></h4>
<p><b>(a) Waiver Services</b>. Except for medically-fragile children,  		eligibility for waiver services require that applicants meet at least ICF level  		of care criteria, based on the IHSP assessment screen, and have incomes no  		greater than 100% of SSI.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> To meet the ICF level of care provisions, an  		individual must have a medical need requiring nursing supervision and three ADL  		deficits. </p>
<p>But even if an applicant meets the level of care and financial criteria,  		s/he will not be eligible for any of the waiver slots unless the total Medicaid  		cost of serving the recipient -- including waiver costs plus any other  		Medicaid-reimbursable services -- would not exceed the total cost to Medicaid  		for serving the recipient in an appropriate institutional setting.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>(b) CHOICE Services</b>. CHOICE-funded services are available to  		state residents who are 60 years of age and older or severely and permanently  		disabled because of a physical and/or mental condition, and who are at risk of  		institutional placement. Income is not used as an eligibility criterion.  		However, there is a requirement that if an applicant can meet the Medicaid  		eligibility criteria but chooses not to, the use of CHOICE funds is prohibite4.  		</p>
<h4>2. Eligibility Determination Procedures</h4>
<p>Procedures for determining eligibility for all IHSP services are the  		same, irrespective of funding stream. Care managers use a standardized  		eligibility screen, which includes questions covering financial circumstances,  		medical needs, ADL and cognitive deficits, as a basis for determining  		eligibility for waiver or CHOICE services. The screen also includes questions  		relating to IADL limitations and informal supports. While the latter are not  		criteria for establishing eligibility for waiver or CHOICE services, they are  		used to determine whether the applicant might qualify for services funded by  		Title III, SSBG or other sources. A standardized assessment form, complementing  		information from the eligibility screen, is used for care planning purposes.  		</p>
<p>Based on the functional and financial information generated by the  		screening instrument, the care manager can make an informed judgment about an  		applicant's likely eligibility status -- whether s/he qualifies for waiver  		services or for CHOICE and/or any of the other funding streams that support  		IHSP services.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> AAA  		care managers have the authority to approve functional eligibility for waiver  		services for those applicants who, according to the eligibility screen, meet  		the state's ICF level of care criteri1. However, if the screen indicates that  		the applicant's needs are at the SNF level, the screening information is  		forwarded to the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) for a paper  		review by staff nurses. With few exceptions, their decision supports the  		initial judgment of the AAA care manager. If the applicant is not already a  		Medicaid recipient, an application to establish financial eligibility -- and,  		therefore, eligibility for waiver services -- must be filed with the state  		Medicaid agency. </p>
<p>A fairly common exception to the process outlined above relates to the  		MR/DD population, when someone other than an AAA-based care manager is the  		immediate contact with the applicant to administer the screen and, if  		appropriate, the assessment instrument. Applicants for services covered by one  		of the three MR/DD waivers, who are likely to be known to staff from one of the  		state's regional offices of the Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services  		(BDDS), might prefer to have their applications processed through the BDDS. In  		these cases, BDDS staff assume responsibility for completing the eligibility  		screen and assessment information which, in most instances, also will include a  		"diagnostic and evaluation" review to determine the most appropriate care  		setting. </p>
<p>In this situation, an AAA care manager is brought in to participate in  		the process, which might include a joint case conference to arrive at the  		initial decision regarding eligibility. If it appears that the applicant it  		both eligible and appropriate for waiver services, the necessary paperwork is  		forwarded to OMPP for review and approval. Regardless of the details of the  		eligibility process, however, gaining approval for waiver services does not  		guarantee that services will be initiate4. </p>
<p>Responsibility for tracking and assigning available waiver slots for all  		five waivers resides with the Medicaid Waiver Unit (MWU). After Medicaid  		eligibility has been established, the Area Agency on Aging care manager  		contacts MWU staff to determine whether an appropriate waiver slot is  		available. If so, services can be initiated in accordance with an approved care  		plan. If not, the individual is added to a statewide waiting list maintained by  		the MWU. If there is a need and CHOICE or other resources are available, they  		are used as a bridge until a waiver slot opens up. </p>
<h4>3. Care Planning and On-Going Care Management</h4>
<p>Care planning and care plan targets differ as a function of different  		funding streams, different severity levels and different client groups  		receiving waiver services. For waiver clients, there is an individual care plan  		target that cannot exceed 90% of the costs of care in a health care facility  		setting appropriate to the client's needs, or about $1800/month. For the last  		fiscal year, the average care plan cost for Aged and Disabled waiver clients  		was $579/month. </p>
<p>For CHOICE-funded services, the state has developed caseload benchmarks  		as well as maximum targets for individual care plans. As long as a client's  		care plan stays within the maximum target numbers and the AAA has uncommitted  		CHOICE funds, care managers can authorize services without approval from the  		state agency. For CHOICE clients, the care plan target for persons with  		disabilities under age 60 is a $736/month averaged over a three month period,  		but it can go as high as $5520/quarter for a person who is severely disable4.  		For clients over age 60, there also are two target levels: $561/month, or up to  		$4209/quarter for an older person who is severely impaire4. Last year's monthly  		CHOICE care plan for both age groups also averaged $579. </p>
<p>All care plans, regardless of funding stream, must include the signature  		of a physician, either the client's regular doctor or one who has seen him or  		her within the last thirty days. The purpose of this policy is that physician  		sign-off serves as a "health and safety" assurance -- that the client can  		remain safely and appropriately in the community. </p>
<p>Once a care plan is in place, the assigned care manager monitors the  		client and the services on a regularly scheduled basis -- irrespective of which  		funding stream is paying for client services. For quality assurance purposes,  		AAA supervisory staff as well as state agency staff will conduct home visits  		with IHSP clients on a random basis. </p>
<p>Just as MR/DD applicants have the option to work through BDDS staff for  		determining their eligibility for waiver services, they also can choose who  		they would prefer to have as a care manager -- the Area Agency on Aging care  		manager, a BDDS staff person, or an independent contractor. Whoever is chosen  		would be responsible for developing an appropriate care plan that meets client  		needs and also fits within the IHSP cost guidelines, and providing on-going  		monitoring and care management services. However, if an IFS staff person or an  		independent contract care manager is selected, an AAA care manager still must  		sign off on the care plan, as well as on any subsequent changes to the care  		plan, in order for the services that are provided under the waiver to be  		reimbursed by Medicai4. </p>
<h4>4. Available Services and Service Providers</h4>
<p>In addition to care management, available services include: Homemaker,  		home health (including nursing care and the various therapies), attendant care  		and personal assistance, adult day care, respite care, home-delivered meals,  		transportation, adaptive aids and home repair and modifications. Specialized  		services keyed to various waivers include: Prevocational services and supported  		employment, group and/or individual habilitation, behavior management and  		crisis intervention. <a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#exhibitD">Exhibit D</a> lists all of the  		services available by funding stream. </p>
<p>Providers of Medicaid waiver services all have to be certified by  		BAIHS's Medicaid Waiver Unit so that they can become Medicaid vendors and bill  		the state for the services they provide. On the other hand, providers of CHOICE  		and other IHSP services do not require state certification, unless the service  		they are providing has a statutory state certification requirement. Otherwise,  		Area Agencies on Aging have the authority to negotiate and sign a memorandum of  		agreement with "any willing provider" who the AAA determines is qualified to  		provide the service(s).<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>CHOICE clients also can opt to use individual providers, either from a  		"self-declared" registry maintained in the AAA, or by recommending a person  		they want as a personal assistant. According to IHSP policy, only immediate  		family members are precluded from being paid as individual providers, unless  		unpaid caregiving can be shown to result in financial hardship for the  		caregiver, and the family member completes a formal training program. </p>
<h3>E. What Budget Control Mechanisms are Used to Ensure  		that Program Spending Remains Within Budget Limits? </h3>
<p>Although the IHSP is broad-based and, in principal, is available to  		anyone who applies and is determined to need assistance, the bottom line is  		that it can only offer assistance while it has the resources to do so. Given  		limited resources, a result of the state's decision to maintain fairly broad  		eligibility criteria is that it also maintains a relatively long waiting list  		of eligible clients. The current waiting list for CHOICE services is between  		1700 and 1800 people already determined to be eligible to receive CHOICE  		services. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the waiting list would be even longer, if the state did not  		impose some of the usual mechanisms to control participation, e.g., functional  		eligibility criteria, cost caps on care plans, and cost-sharing provisions  		which may serve as a disincentive to participate, especially for higher income  		individuals. </p>
<p>Except for the waivers, the state agency gives a great deal of latitude  		to each AAA to keep track of and manage its own finances with respect to  		CHOICE, Title III, SSBG and other funding streams. Since the amount of money  		they receive from each of these sources is fixed, it is clearly in their  		interest not to over-commit or over-spend their allocations. They still submit  		cost reports to the state agency on a regular basis, which include service and  		administrative cost data and a comparison of projected and actual spending  		levels across the different line items of their budget. These are carefully  		reviewed by state staff to identify any potential problems. </p>
<p>For tracking Medicaid waiver data, the state uses a centralized system.  		The Medicaid Waiver Unit (MWU) within the Bureau of Aging and In-Home Services  		is the locus for monitoring care plan expenditures and assigning waiver slots  		as they become available. All requests for waiver slots are submitted to and  		retained the MWU until a slot assignment can be made. Since all but the OBRA  		waiver already have waiting lists, these procedures become particularly  		relevant for budget management. </p>
<p>To do this well, the state has developed a computerized data system that  		currently is in place in all but two Area Agencies on Aging. The system is  		capable of documenting and tracking a multiplicity of program, cost and other  		budget data related to the IHSP. The state is now in the process of modifying  		the application to bring on the remaining two AAAs and also to allow the  		programs to work on notebook computers, so that care managers will actually be  		able to input data from the fiel4. </p>
<h3>F. What if any Aspects or Features of the Program Have  		Been Problematic, and What Kinds of Solutions are Being Tried or Considered to  		Remedy the Problems?</h3>
<p>Because Indiana consolidated its various in-home services programs into  		a comprehensive and coordinated system fairly recently, it capitalized on being  		able to examine a number of existing statewide community-based care programs  		and to take the most appropriate elements to incorporate into its own IN-Home  		Services Program. Although there are always some "nuts and bolts" that need  		fine-tuning, the overall judgment is that they are very proud of what they have  		been able to accomplish. </p>
<p>There were two "challenges" rather than problems that were identified by  		the state agency. The first was to pursue a unified quality assurance system  		that could be computerized and applied uniformly across the Area Agency on  		Aging network, instead of the current practice of having a unique set of QA  		procedures for each AA1. The second was to continue working on the developing  		official administrative rules for the CHOICE program that can be inserted into  		the state's administrative code. </p>
<h3>G. To What Extent are Home and Community-Based Services  		Perceived as Mechanisms for Reducing Nursing Home Costs?</h3>
<p>It seems quite clear that a principal motivation of the IN-Home Services  		Program consolidation effort was to create a broad-based home care services  		system that could identify those individuals who could be served appropriately  		but at a lower cost than the cost of nursing home care. The state has put up a  		not insignificant amount of money, as match for its waivers and for the CHOICE  		program, to fund its home and community-based services effort. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the state does not have a moratorium on building  		additional nursing homes or adding more nursing home beds to the existing bed  		supply, which may explain why in 1993, Indiana had the highest ratio of nursing  		home beds/1000 people age 65 and older in the country -- 82:1000.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Recognizing that a more comprehensive approach is needed, the Family and  		Social Services Administration recently announced the formation of a Task Force  		to examine the issues and devise a set of proposals for dealing with the whole  		spectrum of factors that are involved, e.g., the problems related to the  		over-supply of nursing home beds (to the point where neighboring states are  		sending people into Indiana for placement), the very limited availability of  		intermediate types of board and care and other residential, assisted-living  		type facilities, and expanding community-based services. </p>
<h3>H. How Do State Officials Evaluate Their Ability to  		Manage a Home and Community-Based Care Program within a Fixed, as Opposed to  		Open-Ended Entitlement, Budget?</h3>
<p>State agency on aging staff believe the state is well-positioned for  		such an effort, since it already has the structure and procedures in place to  		manage a large, multi-targeted, home and community-based services program. And  		given the support it has received from the state Medicaid agency for the IHSP's  		waiver components, staff are confident that Indiana could be a model for the  		country. </p>
<h2><a name="maine" id="maine">MAINE</a></h2>
<h3>A. What are the Program Elements and Funding Sources for  		the State's Home Based-Care and Elderly Waiver Program?</h3>
<h4>1. Principal Program Elements and Funding Sources</h4>
<p>Maine's statewide "Home-Based Care" (HBC) program and its "Home and  		Community-Based Waiver Services for the Elderly" (WSE) program are both managed  		by the Bureau of Elder and Adult Services (BEAS) at the state level, and  		administered jointly through a single point of entry at the substate service  		delivery level. The waiver program serves eligible adults age 60 and older.  		HBC, in addition to being targeted to the 60 and older population, also  		provides assistance to a small number of younger persons with  		disabilities.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> For  		this fiscal year, the combined budgets for the state-funded and elderly waiver  		programs are projected to total just over $15 million. Assuming that  		expenditures for aged waiver services will meet budget projections, the ratio  		of waiver to HBC resources will be 58:42 percent. </p>
<p>In addition, Maine has two statewide Medicaid waivers, targeted to  		adults with physical disabilities, which also are being managed by the Bureau  		of Elder and Adult Services. One waiver, administered by a well-established  		Independent Living Center that emphasizes the use of personal assistants, is  		targeted to persons 18 and older. The second waiver, limited to adults age 18  		through 59 and employing a more traditional approach for care planning and care  		management, is being administered through a contract recently awarded to a New  		Hampshire rehabilitation foundation which has established an office in Augusta  		to administer the waiver program.<a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note26"><sup><font>26</font></sup></a> </p>
<p>The state-funded HBC Program, established by the legislature in 1980 to  		help older people remain in their own homes, has developed into a statewide  		program with a current operating budget of $6.3 million. HBC provides services  		to an average of approximately 730 clients each month, all but about 5% of whom  		are age 60 and older. </p>
<p>The Medicaid waiver for the elderly, initially approved by HCFA in 1985,  		has a federal/state match ratio of 63:37, and a total projected budget of $8.8  		for this fiscal year. WSE has 1047 approved slots and a current average monthly  		census of 725 clients statewide, just about the same as the HBC active  		caseloa4. </p>
<p>Totally separate from the waiver program, the Medicaid state plan's  		targeted care management benefit is also an integral funding element in terms  		of administering the HBC program. The most recent available data indicate that  		billings to Medicaid for targeted care management services provided to HBC  		clients who are Medicaid recipients represent about 15% of the program's total  		care management costs. Within this group are individuals who do not meet the  		level of care requirements for waiver services but still are determined to need  		services provided through the HBC program. </p>
<h4>2. Other Home and Community-Based Services  		Resources</h4>
<p>Except for home-delivered meals which are provided on an as-needed and  		as-available basis, HBC and WSE clients have no priority status for Older  		Americans Act Title III resources. The same is true for several smaller home  		care-related programs managed by the Bureau of Elder and Adult Services (BEAS).  		Together totalling about $1.4 million for the current fiscal year, they  		include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>SSBG-funded homemaker services, focusing on eligible adults with  			 significant IADL limitations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>state-funded services for older people living in congregate housing  			 facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a state-funded resource to supplement SSBG and Older Americans Act  			 services; and</p>
</li>
<li>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>The cost-sharing provisions of both the HBC and WSE programs are also  		worth noting. Even though cost-sharing often serves more as a mechanism for  		consumer awareness and informed decision-making than for generating significant  		extra program resources, contributions do offset expenditures to some extent.  		The most current estimate is that cost-share income for this fiscal year is  		averaging about 5% of HBC and WSE total program costs. </p>
<p>In Maine, the actual cost of an individual's care plan is not a factor  		in calculating participant cost-sharing amounts. Rather, for the HBC program, a  		complex formula has been developed to derive both income and asset values over  		protected amounts. Then, each value is multiplied by a pre-determined  		percentage and the amounts are combined to arrive at a monthly copayment  		figure. For the WSE program, the formula is much simpler. For a single person,  		all income over a protected $767 "living allowance" becomes the assigned  		copayment amount. For both programs, copayment obligations, once established,  		become the first dollars applied to the cost of the care plan. If care plan  		costs are lower than the cost-share amount, the client pays the full cost; if  		care plan costs are higher, the program picks up the difference. </p>
<h3>B. How are the Budgets Established for the  		Programs?</h3>
<p>For each of the programs managed by BEAS, budget numbers are generated  		by BEAS staff in accordance with a set of marks that have come down from the  		Governor's Office through the Department of Human Services. State agency staff,  		over the past decade, have become accustomed to developing what in their  		judgment are "least harm" budget scenarios to deal with whatever numbers  		ultimately are included in the state's overall annual budget. </p>
<h3>C. What are the Principal Issues Affecting Program  		Financing and Budgets?</h3>
<p>Since the late 1980's, Maine's economy has been experiencing a severe  		downturn, resulting in significant reductions in the amount of money available  		to fund human services and other state programs. HBC was one of many programs  		that fell victim to the state's no growth/budget cutback fiscal policies,  		though it has not been as seriously compromised as some others. Although some  		states have considered or actually utilized a dedicated tax to support  		home-based care, Maine continues to rely on general revenues as the principal  		source of financial support for HBC and state match for waiver services. </p>
<p>A significant programmatic effect of the state's continuing tight fiscal  		policy environment within which the programs have been operating is the  		expectation that more can be done with essentially the same level of resources.  		For example, on January 1, 1994, the state instituted more stringent criteria  		for Medicaid level of care determinations for nursing home placements. It also  		initiated a new pre-admission screening program for all Medicaid recipients and  		other applicants for Medicaid-funded nursing home care. Management  		responsibility for pre-admission screening was given to the state's five Area  		Agencies on Aging -- which also are responsible for administering the HBC and  		WSE programs at the substate level. </p>
<p>Several AAA staff have suggested that these actions are having a domino  		effect on both the waiver and HBC programs. Although the process is still in  		transition, staff from several AAAs believe there has been a noticeable  		increase in the number of heavier care clients for both HBC and waiver  		services. Their particular concern is that HBC waiting lists, which are already  		quite long, will get still longer unless additional resources are found to  		increase available services. </p>
<h3>D. How are the Programs Administered at the State and  		Substate Levels? </h3>
<p>Maine's Home-Based Care and waiver programs for the elderly and younger  		adults with disabilities are administered at the state level by the Bureau of  		Elder and Adult Services (BEAS) which, with the Bureau of Medical Services  		(BMS), is located within the Department of Human Services. At the substate  		level, the state's five Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) are responsible for  		administering both the HBC and WSE programs, in addition to their  		responsibilities for pre-admission screening and serving as the designated  		agencies for implementing Title III of the Older Americans Act and several  		smaller, state-funded activities. </p>
<p>Each AAA has a core staff of care managers, primarily social workers but  		also some nurses, who are responsible for conducting assessments, developing  		and implementing care plans and assuming on-going care management activities  		for clients in both the HBC and WSE programs. AAAs have also been adding nurses  		to their staffs, primarily as consultants, in response to a recent state  		requirement that only registered nurses are authorized to assess medical and  		functional needs for waiver services, as well as for nursing home preadmission  		screening and reassessment. The MED'94 -- a comprehensive eligibility  		assessment and care planning instrument -- has been developed by the state  		agency for this purpose. </p>
<h4>1. Eligibility Requirements</h4>
<p><b>(a) Waiver Services</b>. Waiver services are available to persons 65  		and older and to persons with disabilities 60 to 64, whose income does not  		exceed 300% of SSI ($1338/month) and who have no more than $2000 in countable  		assets. Applicants also must meet the level of care requirements for nursing  		facility placement. To be determined medically eligible, an applicant must be  		determined to need: </p>
<ul><li> hands-on nursing care or care provided under the supervision of a  		  registered nurse, usually on a daily basis; or </li>
<li> extensive assistance or total dependence with three of five  		  expanded, "late loss" ADLs (including "bed mobility" and "locomotion" as well  		  as eating, toileting and transferring); or </li>
<li> hands on nursing care or supervision no less frequently than three  		  days per week, or cognition problems that require active intervention on a  		  regular basis, and also limited assistance with two of five expanded ADLs.  		  </li>
</ul><p><b>(b) Home-Based Care Services</b>. The Home-Based Care program uses  		income and asset levels to determine participant copayments, but not as  		criteria for determining program eligibility. Functional capacity is the basis  		for establishing eligibility for HBC services. In order to be determined  		eligible, an applicant must need "limited" assistance plus hands-on physical  		assistance with at least three ADLs, or a minimum of two ADLs and one IADL, or  		one ADL and two IADLs. </p>
<h4>2. Eligibility Determination Procedures</h4>
<p>The first step in the eligibility determination process is to screen  		applicants in order to make an initial judgment about their service needs. A  		second purpose of the screen is to determine whether an applicant is already a  		Medicaid recipient or appears likely to meet Medicaid's financial eligibility  		requirements. </p>
<p>If an applicant is found potentially eligible, and if funds are  		available, s/he is assigned for an in-depth assessment. However, even though  		the same standardized instrument -- the "Med '94" -- is required by both the  		HBC and WSE programs, and ongoing care management is essentially the same and  		is done by the same care managers for both programs, there are also very  		important differences in addition to the different eligibility criteria  		described above. Who administers the MED '94 and is responsible for  		reassessments, where the authority rests for approving eligibility, what  		services are available, and what the care plan cost targets are, differ across  		the two programs. </p>
<p><b>(a) Waiver Services</b>. In addition to requiring that the MED'94  		eligibility assessment instrument be used to determine functional eligibility  		as well as to provide the basis for care planning, the state also requires that  		the assessment be conducted by a registered nurse, either on the staff of the  		AAA or on a contract basis with the agency. As explained, this requirement is  		mainly to insure that the assessment reflects sufficient knowledge and skill to  		make appropriate judgments a out t e medical condition(s) and medical needs of  		an applicant. </p>
<p>After the assessment instrument is completed, it is forwarded to the  		Bureau of Medical Services for a level of care decision that will determine  		whether the applicant will be certified as medically eligible for waiver  		services. If the person is not currently a Medicaid recipient, final  		eligibility determination will also have to wait for a decision regarding  		financial eligibility from the Bureau of Income Maintenance. </p>
<p><b>(b) Home-Based Care Services</b>. Eligibility determination for  		Home-Based Care services is considerably different from the procedures required  		for the WSE program. Care managers, while they also use the MED '94, are not  		required to be registered nurses. After reviewing the information from the  		assessment form, the care manager, in conjunction with supervisory staff where  		necessary, has the authority to determine a client's eligibility for HBC  		services. As part of the process, care managers also are responsible for  		assessing the financial status of new clients and establishing what their  		monthly cost-sharing commitment will be. </p>
<h4>3. Care Planning and On-Going Care Management</h4>
<p>Following a comprehensive assessment and the necessary decisions to  		establish client eligibility, either for waiver or HBC services, care managers  		have the responsibility to develop and implement care plans that are responsive  		to client need and to care planning guidelines set forth by the state agency.  		</p>
<p><b>(a) Waiver Services</b>. For waiver clients, the recent requirement  		that RNs conduct client assessments has introduced an administrative complexity  		to the care planning and services authorization process. Although the MED '94  		allows space for a care plan, if the RN is not a care manager on the staff of  		the AAA, other than for nursing treatment needs, s/he is less likely to be  		familiar with all of the factors and details that go into developing a workable  		supportive services care plan. As a result, AAAs frequently either send a care  		manager with the RN to complete the assessment, or a care manager will arrange  		a visit with the client as soon as eligibility has been establishe4. According  		to AAA staff interviewed, this was the only way they feel confident that the  		care plan that was developed would effectively and efficiently meet both client  		needs and the cost guidelines of the program. </p>
<p>Although the maximum monthly cost for an individual waiver client's care  		plan cannot exceed 75% of nursing home costs ($2385/month), the average  		caseload cost cap target for services is less, because AAA care management  		costs are also included within an overall caseload cost cap. But even with this  		reduction, monthly care plans for waiver clients are averaging far less than  		the maximum on a statewide basis. For the first ten months of the fiscal year  		ending June 30, 1994, the average services reimbursement/client/month was $683.  		</p>
<p><b>(b) HBC Services</b>. For HBC clients, the care manager who conducted  		the assessment is likely to be the same person who also follows through with  		developing the care plan, using capitation guidelines that were contractually  		agreed to by each AAA and BEAS at the beginning of the fiscal year. </p>
<p>After a person is determined to be eligible, the care manager develops  		and then implements the care plan, brokering some services and authorizing  		others. The current capitation agreement commits each AAA to serving an  		established minimum number of clients at an aggregate average total caseload  		cost per client of $450/month, exclusive of care management costs. (As is the  		case with WSE care plans, the maximum of 75% of nursing home costs --  		$2385/month -- applies to individual HBC clients as well.) For the last six  		months of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1994, the actual average care plan  		<b>service</b> cost/client/month was $447. </p>
<p>Both HBC and WSE client care plans are reviewed and discussed by a  		multi-disciplinary team comprised of AAA staff, providers and other interested  		parties. For WSE clients, care plans also are submitted to the state Bureau of  		Medical Services for review prior to being implemente4. Once the care plan is  		in place, care managers monitor HBC clients on an as-needed basis; WSE clients  		must be seen at least once in a three month period, and all clients are  		reassessed no less frequently than every six months. Care managers conduct  		reassessments of HBC clients; registered nurses are required to reassess WSE  		clients. For monitoring purposes, quality review teams -- which include state  		agency staff -- review client care plans on a randomly selected basis. </p>
<h4>4. Available Services and Service Providers</h4>
<p><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#exhibitE">Exhibit E</a> displays the complement of services  		available from each of the two community-based care programs. While there is  		considerable overlap, the HBC program package does offer several additional  		services, including two that are somewhat innovative. "Consumer payment  		subsidies" and payments for "other goods and services" allow care managers the  		flexibility to arrange for necessary assistance beyond what is specifically  		included on the list of approved services. </p>
<p>Because AAAs have been in business doing care management in their areas  		for almost two decades, they have longstanding relationships with most if not  		all of their providers. While provider rate caps are established at the state  		level, AAAs are responsible for negotiating individual provider rates within  		the cap and managing the billing and payment process, usually depending on  		quarterly cash allocations received from BEAS. </p>

</tr></table><p>AAA care managers, when appropriate, will include personal care  		assistants (PCAs) in care plans, but not as independent providers. In addition  		to using an agency based in Augusta that recruits and trains PCAs for placement  		statewide, some AAAs also arrange for PCAs from local agencies. </p>
<h3>E. What Budget Control Mechanisms are Used to Ensure  		that Program Spending Remains Within Budget Limits? </h3>
<p>Maine uses fairly standard policies and procedures as mechanisms to  		control and track program costs. It limits participation by setting eligibility  		criteria; it limits the types and amounts of services that are available; and  		it uses cost-sharing very effectively as a disincentive for higher income  		people to participate in the program. </p>
<p>For client and caseload management and tracking, each AAA has a  		computerized system that allows them to record and synthesize client and care  		plan information and to compare-estimated cost projections with actual  		expenditures. A similar MIS system is used at the state level, not only to  		track individual AAA client and budget data, but also to compile aggregated  		information about each of the programs it administers. Because the approved  		number of WSE slots is considerably higher than the number of clients currently  		being served by the program, tracking costs relate more to assuring that  		individual care plans are both appropriate and cost-efficient than to concerns  		about exceeding the total available waiver budget. </p>
<p>For the HBC program, the state agency has developed a capitation-type  		contract arrangement that makes maintaining control of the HBC budget of  		particular interest to AAAs at the service delivery level. According to the  		terms of the contract, which specifies a budget amount to serve a minimum  		number of clients, each AAA assumes the risk if either the minimum number of  		clients is not met, or the maximum average annualized cost/client is exceede4.  		In the case of overspending, the AAA has to pick up the difference from any  		unrestricted resources it has available. If an AAA spends up to the limit  		available but does not meet the client numbers, their HBC allocation for the  		following year is reduced by the difference between what they did spend and  		what they would have spent, given the number of clients they actually serve4.  		The downside of this approach is that several of the more cautious AAAs have  		considerably underspent their target allocations in order to be certain they  		are not penalized for overspending. </p>
<h3>F. What if any Aspects or Features of the Programs Have  		Been Problematic, and What Kinds of Solutions are Being Tried or Considered to  		Remedy the Problems?</h3>
<p>Several program features have been identified as problems, especially at  		the service delivery level. In principle, there is considerable support for a  		strategy to divert people from nursing homes into community care settings,  		provided that the community settings are available and appropriate to meet  		client needs. However, Area Agency on Aging staff have expressed some concern  		that the recent introduction of the MED '94, a significantly more  		medically-oriented eligibility assessment instrument intended as a vehicle for  		implementing such a strategy, is premature. They have suggested that current  		resources are not sufficient to pay the higher costs for heavier care clients  		who are no longer eligible for waiver services, and that there has been  		insufficient time to establish appropriate alternative settings, e.g., board  		and care arrangements, for people who might be best served in a sheltered  		environment rather than in their own individual households. </p>
<p>A second, related issue raised by AAA staff was the state requirement  		that nurses administer the MED '94 to potential waiver clients. Again, although  		in principle AAA staff have no objection, they are concerned about the added  		costs of the additional staff time of care managers to fill in necessary  		information for effective care planning. </p>
<p>A final issue that was raised, by both AAA and state agency staff,  		relates to the time lag that too frequently occurs between the assessment of  		WSE applicants and approval of their financial and/or level of need eligibility  		status. In some instances, AAAs have been able to initiate emergency services  		on an interim basis, either from their HBC budget or other sources, e.g., their  		unrestricted funds, from Medicare through a certified home health agency,  		United Way, et3. However, when resources are not available, potential clients  		often fall between the cracks and end up in a hospital or in a position where  		home-based care may no longer be sufficient to safely meet their needs. </p>
<p>To respond to this concern, the Bureau of Medical Services and the  		Bureau of Elder and Adult Services have agreed, on a trial basis, to allow  		level of need determinations to be made by the nurses who are conducting  		assessments for one of the two waivers for persons with physical disabilities.  		Both BEAS and BMS staff have suggested that if the experiment works, they will  		consider expanding the authority to the other waiver programs. </p>
<h3>G. To What Extent are Home and Community-Based Services  		Perceived as Mechanisms for Reducing Nursing Home Costs?</h3>
<p>In Maine the initial motivation for establishing a home-based care  		program was the idea that people should have an alternative to nursing home  		placement. Subsequently, however, this value has been joined by another  		pressing incentive at the state level, i.e., to develop and implement a  		diversion strategy that expands community care options in order to reduce, or  		at least limit, the growth of nursing home beds and associated costs to the  		state's Medicaid program.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> A 1993 law made this strategy very explicit.  		Its major features included the following: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>tightening medical eligibility criteria for nursing home admissions  			 and requiring a pre-admission screening assessment for Medicaid recipients and  			 other applicants who may become Medicaid eligible within six months; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>restricting nursing home interests from increasing the bed supply  			 without legislative approval and actually projecting that the diversion  			 strategy will result in the elimination of 800 nursing home beds across the  			 state; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investing the anticipated savings from the diversion strategy to  			 support additional community-based services, alternative living arrangements,  			 et3. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some of these measures are reflected in actions that are already  		underway in terms of both the HBC and the WSE programs. </p>
<h3>H. How Do State Officials Evaluate Their Ability to  		Manage a Home and Community-Based Care Program within a Fixed, as Opposed to  		Open-Ended Entitlement, Budget?</h3>
<p>Maine has just received notification that it has been awarded a three  		year grant from HCFA to design and begin implementation of a managed care  		system that would focus initially on Medicaid acute care services, but then be  		extended to include long-term care services as well. One state staff person  		expressed concern about whether a federally-supported home and community-based  		services program could provide enough flexibility to fit into a managed care  		framework. If so, this person believed there would not be a problem  		implementing it, with either a fixed or open-ended budget. </p>
<h2><a name="northdakota" id="northdakota">NORTH DAKOTA</a></h2>
<h3>A. What are the Program Elements and Funding Sources for  		the State's Home and Community-Based Services Program for the Elderly and  		Disabled?</h3>
<h4>1. Principal Program Elements and Funding Sources</h4>
<p>North Dakota's statewide "Home and Community-Based Services Program for  		the Elderly and Disabled" (HCBSP) offers a range of non-institutional long-term  		care services and assistance to eligible older people as well as younger adults  		and children living in the community who have severe functional impairments not  		caused by mental illness or mental retardation.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> Administered through a single point of entry  		-- a generic care management system located at the county level -- the program  		has three principal funding streams that define three distinct, but  		structurally and administratively consolidated, program elements. </p>
<p>For the current fiscal year, total funding for the HCBSP is close to  		$5.5 million, the major portion of which is for the "Service Payments for the  		Elderly and Disabled" (SPED) component of the program. Until January, 1994,  		when counties began matching state funds at 5%, SPED was fully state-funde4.  		From a modest $450,000 state appropriation in 1983, its level of funding has  		increased to $3.15 million for this year, representing 57% of the HCBSP primary  		resource base. SPED's monthly census averages 1200 clients, about 40 percent of  		whom are under age 60. </p>
<p>The Medicaid waiver for aged and disabled, with a federal/state match  		ratio of 69:31, is the second principal source of HCBSP funding. Also approved  		initially in 1983, waiver services together with SPED form the nucleus of the  		statewide program. Combined funding for HCBSP waiver services this year is $1.5  		million, representing 28% of HCBSP resources. Although 420 slots have been  		approved, approximately 300 waiver clients are currently being served each  		month. </p>
<p>The third component, referred to as "Expanded SPED" (E/SPED), is a new,  		and considerably smaller, element of the state's HCBSP. E/SPED started serving  		clients only in September, 1994, at an annualized funding level of $780,000, or  		14% of projected HCBSP resources for the fiscal year. Like SPED, it is state  		funde4. However, in contrast to its well-established partner, E/SPED is  		targeted primarily to adults with low incomes who may require some limited ADL  		assistance, but whose primary need is for help with IADLs and/or supervision at  		home or in a more structured environment, i.e., adult foster care. Since at the  		time of the site visit, E/SPED had only been operating for a few weeks, further  		references to it will be made only where information was available.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>2. Other Home and Community-Based Services  		Resources</h4>
<p>Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds, about $2.4 million annually,  		are allocated directly by the Department of Human Services to North Dakota's 52  		County Social Services Boards. Among the services most often available are  		county-employed homemakers, home health aides and drivers to provide in-home  		and personal care, and medical and other necessary transportation. Although the  		primary recipients of SSBG services are county residents who need help but do  		not meet either the financial and/or functional eligibility requirements for  		HCBSP-funded services, the SSBG does serve as an important resource for the  		program -- particularly for providing services to SPED-eligible clients who are  		waiting for slot assignments. </p>
<p>Title III services funds are managed primarily by local senior centers  		to provide outreach, information and referral, home-delivered meals, companion  		visiting, and other services. While coordination is encouraged by the state,  		and care managers help broker Title III services for HCBSP clients, they have  		no special priority status for Older Americans Act resources. Of the $10  		million the state has available in Title III dollars, none is dedicated  		directly to the HCBSP, and only a small proportion is thought to be accessed  		for HCBSP clients. </p>
<p>One additional financial resource of some significance to the HCBSP is  		its cost-sharing provisions. For SPED clients with incomes in excess of the  		established protected amounts, fees are graduated from 10% to 100% of  		HCBSP-authorized care plan costs. For example, the 10% to 100% fee would apply  		to a single person with an income ranging from $641 to $1279/month, and to a  		two-person family income from $857 to $1713/month. Cost-share amounts are  		deducted from the state's monthly payments to providers; clients are  		responsible for paying the balance directly. </p>
<h3>B. How is the Budget Established for the HCBSP?</h3>
<p>During each biennial session of the legislature, the Governor's budget  		forms the basis for hearings and, ultimately, legislative decisions regarding  		what the state budget will look like for the following two years. In the case  		of the HCBSP, budget numbers are generated by its state-level administering  		agency, the Aging Services Division (ASD). ASD develops the budget for each of  		the program elements, including the Medicaid waiver, based on the overall  		program's operating experience over the previous two years and projected  		demographic trends. While incorporating a realistic reflection of need, the  		process also is politically realisti3. </p>
<p>The ASD budget proposals are then reviewed by its parent Department of  		Human Services and, ultimately, by the Governor's staff. This process  		culminates with a budget document that is submitted to the state legislature.  		Historically at least, both the Governors and the legislatures have protected  		and supported the HCBSP. It has not necessarily gotten the full amount  		requested initially by the ASD, but it also has never been seriously threatened  		by severe budget cuts. </p>
<h3>C. What are the Principal Issues Affecting the Financing  		of the Home and Community-Based Services Program for the Elderly and  		Disabled?</h3>
<p>North Dakota recognized fairly early on the importance of  		community-based service alternatives for people needing long-term assistance  		and care. So much so that when, in 1983, the state legislature appropriated  		general revenues to provide match for its first Medicaid waiver for aged and  		disabled persons, it also provided state funds for SPED, which was not  		income-relate4. Since then, for each biennial cycle the HCBSP budget has either  		been increased or remained at current levels, while other human services  		program budgets were being cut.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>D. How is the HCBSP Administered at the State and  		Substate Levels? </h3>
<p>The North Dakota HCBS Program for the Elderly and Disabled is  		administered at the state level by the Department of Human Services Aging  		Services Division (ASD), and at the substate level through 52 County Social  		Services Boards (CSSBs).<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> Generic, county-employed social workers are  		the entry point for potential clients into the consolidated program.  		Functioning as HCBSP care managers, they conduct assessments using a common  		"Multi-Dimensional Assessment" instrument, develop and initiate care plans  		based on the comprehensive assessment, and provide on-going care management for  		all HCBSP clients, irrespective of the particular funding stream that pays for  		the services provide4. Counties bill the ASD on a fee-for-service basis for the  		functions their care managers perform. </p>
<h4>1. Eligibility Requirements</h4>
<p>While the emphasis of the HCBSP is on providing assistance to people  		with functional impairments, specific eligibility criteria vary across its  		three current primary components. </p>
<p><b>(a) Waiver Services</b>. Medicaid waiver services are targeted to  		low-income individuals 65 and older and younger adults who are classified as  		disabled according to SSDI criteri1. The financial eligibility cut-off is 100%  		of SSA. To meet the state's criteria for nursing facility level of care, an  		individual must need medically-related care that requires hands-on nursing and  		supervision or, in terms of ADL limitations, require "human assistance" with at  		least two of four ADLs (transferring, toileting, eating and bathing) for at  		least 60% of the time it takes to perform the specific ADL task. </p>
<p><b>(b) SPED Services</b>. There are no age or income requirements for  		SPED services and, although there is an asset limit, it is very generous -- a  		maximum of $50,000 in countable liquid assets. SPED's functional eligibility  		criteria, however, are very stringent. Persons 18 years of age and older must  		be determined to have impairments in a minimum of four ADILS or five IADLs,  		which are expected to last for at least three months. Persons under the age of  		18 must be certified for nursing home care by the state's utilization review  		organization, which uses the same criteria it applies to Medicaid recipients.  		</p>
<p><b>(c) E/SPED Services</b>. E/SPED, the newly-instituted HCBSP  		component, has yet another set of financial and functional eligibility  		criteri1. Although it is supported solely by state funds and financial  		eligibility does not have to be determined by the state Medicaid agency, E/SPED  		applicants still must meet the same income and asset requirements as Medicaid  		waiver clients. With respect to functional capacity, eligibility focuses on  		adults who are capable of basic self-care (i.e., not severely ADL-impaired),  		but who are seriously limited in three of four specified IADLs and/or who need  		a supervised and structured environment. </p>
<h4>2. Eligibility Determination Procedures</h4>
<p><b>(a) Waiver Services</b>. Since the number of waiver slots that have  		been allocated is (and has been) considerably less than the number approved by  		the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a nursing facility level of  		care determination is currently the only prerequisite to initiating HCBSP  		waiver services for applicants who already are Medicaid recipients. Based on  		the comprehensive assessment, if the applicant appears to meet the level of  		care criteria, the care manager will contact the state's utilization review  		contractor for authorization. More often than not, this contact is by telephone  		and the decision, usually approval, is also given verbally. (In these  		instances, the necessary paperwork is taken care of subsequently.) </p>
<p>If the applicant is not yet on Medicaid -- the necessary precondition  		for requesting a level of care determination -- the care manager will help  		complete the appropriate financial forms and materials. Financial eligibility  		for Medicaid is determined by an Eligibility Specialist from the state Medicaid  		agency, the Medical Services Division of the Department of Human Services. </p>
<p>Although the Medicaid financial eligibility determination process is, by  		its nature, cumbersome, it appears that the process, at least in North Dakota,  		can be expedited somewhat when it is important to do so. Also, except in rare  		circumstances, SPED or SSBG resources have been sufficient to initiate and pay  		for needed services until the approvals are made official. </p>
<p><b>(b) SPED Services</b>. For SPED applicants, care managers technically  		are empowered to make eligibility determination decisions based on information  		from the assessment instrument. Operationally, however -- in contrast to  		Medicaid waiver clients -- even when an applicant meets SPED functional and  		financial (asset level) criteria, care managers cannot activate a care plan and  		authorize services until they request and receive approval for a SPED "slot."  		These approvals come from the state Aging Services Division. </p>
<p>In general, a slot is approved if, at the time of the request, actual  		and projected total SPED expenditures appear to be within its available budget.  		If not, clients are placed on a waiting list until a slot opens up (usually  		within a few weeks to a month). A computerized system is in place to track  		initial care plan costs, care plan changes and SPED client terminations, so  		that accurate budget balances can maintained and slot assignments can be made  		in a timely manner. </p>
<h4>3. Care Planning and On-Going Care Management</h4>
<p>Care plans are developed by HCBSP care managers according to client  		needs and the care plan cost cap guidelines for either waiver or SPED services,  		depending on client status. Other than the cost cap differential, care planning  		requirements are the same for both categories of clients. In either case, care  		managers follow state guidelines that include maximum unit rates and, for some  		services, e.g., homemaker, respite, and family home care, maximum daily or  		monthly total costs. </p>
<p>Even though the average monthly care plan target for SPED clients is  		$700, care plans currently in effect are averaging between $250 and $275 per  		month. For waiver clients, the average monthly care plan target jumps to $1160;  		and actual waiver care plan costs are averaging about $500/month. One possible  		explanation for the cost differences between SPED and waiver care plans may be  		the result of a differential use of individual as opposed to agency providers.  		Agency rates for the same types of service can be as much as one-third higher  		than those of individual service providers. </p>
<p>Once a care plan is in place, a care manager monitors the client and the  		services on a regularly scheduled basis -- irrespective of which program  		component the client is being served under -- and is always available if client  		circumstances change. For monitoring and quality assurance purposes,  		face-to-face contact with clients is required to occur no less frequently than  		every three months; and full reassessments are required annually. Staff from  		ASD also make home visits to clients across the state on a spot check basis.  		</p>
<h4>4. Available Services and Service Providers</h4>
<p><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#exhibitF">Exhibit F</a> displays the HCBSP's complement of  		basic services which, while funded by different funding streams, is available  		to clients irrespective of their eligibility status. SPED services are  		essentially the same as those covered by the waiver. The single exception is  		"family home care," which provides a limited, taxable payment of up to  		$400/month to encourage families to keep a family member at home. And only  		SPED's non-medical transportation and adult day care services are not available  		to E/SPED clients. For care planning and service authorization purposes, state  		guidelines have established some services as mutually exclusive and others as  		complementary to one another. For example, family home care and adult foster  		care are inclusive, 24hour services, so that only respite care (and, under  		certain circumstances, transportation) would be considered appropriate, and  		homemaker, chore or home health aide services would not be authorize4. Also,  		SPED clients under age 19 are eligible to receive only family home care and  		respite services. </p>

</tr></table><p>North Dakota's HCBSP relies very heavily on individual "Qualified  		Service Providers" (QSPs) as the primary providers of service, as much because  		of their flexible availability as for their lower rates for providing personal  		assistance and related services. Of approximately 950 QSPs across the state,  		only 100 are agencies; the remainder are individuals who have applied to and  		received approval from the Aging Services Division to provide assistance in  		accordance with the HCBSP plan of care. </p>
<p>Both individual and agency QSPs establish their own rates for HCBSP  		services, on the basis of the state agency's assumption that this encourages  		free market competition. Care managers, when they develop care plans, identify  		needed services in terms of time-measured units and a maximum dollar value that  		can be paid for those services. To the extent possible, the care plan is  		developed with the client, who is encouraged to select his or her own  		provider(s) from a list of QSPs, which also includes the individual's or  		agency's particular skills and unit rates. Clients can also suggest someone not  		on the list. When this happens, the person must submit an application to the  		ASD to enroll as a QSP. Once enrolled, the QSP can become a Medicaid provider  		simply by filling out the appropriate forms. </p>
<h3>E. What Budget Control Mechanisms are Used to Ensure  		that HCBSP Spending Remains Within Budget Limits? </h3>
<p>Like most other programs that have only a certain amount of money within  		which to operate, the HCBSP has specific policies that establish limits on  		program costs. Participation is controlled by setting financial and functional  		disability levels; it offers a limited number of specified services; and it  		establishes cost caps on client care plans, specific services and even on  		reimbursement rates for specific services. Also like many other programs, the  		SPED component includes a participant cost-sharing provision, to generate  		income, but perhaps even more importantly, to encourage recipients to be more  		cost-conscious and selective of the types and levels of service they request.  		</p>
<p>Cost control functions associated with care planning are performed by  		the county-based care managers on a case-by-case basis. Tracking program  		expenditures is a centralized function that occurs at the state level, in the  		Aging Services Division. </p>
<p>For the Medicaid waiver element of the program, the state has not had to  		exercise any special cost controls, beyond the standard ones liste4. Although  		ASD tracks waiver slots and provider/vendor payments, to date the program has  		not come even close to filling the 420 HCFA-approved slots or using the  		allocated state funds available to draw down Medicaid match. (Interestingly, no  		one suggested the possibility of amending the waiver to reduce the number of  		slots and shift the match appropriation to SPED or E/SPED, or to return it to  		the state general revenue pool.) </p>
<p>Controlling the SPED component budget is a somewhat different matter. As  		described previously, even after an applicant meets the functional and asset  		requirements for SPED and an appropriate care plan is developed, services  		cannot begin until he or she is assigned a SPED slot. The process for  		determining the number of slots that will be available over a specified budget  		period is fairly straightforwar4. </p>
<p>After the Aging Service Division receives the approved SPED budget for  		the next biennium, ASD staff, using historical program data, establish the  		number of "slots" they project the two-year budget will cover. They then use a  		computerized system to track care plan costs and changes, including  		terminations, in order to maintain an up-to-date accounting of SPED  		expenditures and a current budget balance. This system allows for more or less  		constant adjustments in the number of available slots that can be  		assigned.<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note33">33</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Occasionally, there may be a delay, usually lasting two weeks to a month  		or so, before a SPED-eligible client is assigned a slot. When this occurs, the  		care manager will attempt to access SSBG, Title III or other appropriate, if  		limited, services as a bridge until a slot becomes available. Because of a  		relatively rapid turnover in SPED clients -- most frequently due to death or  		placement in a nursing facility -- there has only been one time in SPED's  		eleven year history when it was necessary to institute a waiting list for more  		than a few months. </p>
<p>Self-set QSP rates in North Dakota also have an effect on program costs.  		Rather than using a contract mechanism to line up service providers, the state  		will enroll individuals or agencies that meet a set of established competency  		requirements. Once enrolled, QSPs can set their own hourly rates, as long as  		they do not exceed the rate ceilings set by the state agency. (The hourly rate  		ceiling for provider agencies is somewhat higher than that for individual QSPS,  		$12.84 vs. $9.40.) </p>
<p>ASD staff suggest that market forces and, in North Dakota at least, an  		individual's sense of responsibility are effective in keeping costs down. When  		a care plan is developed, care managers set a maximum cost for care, depending  		on the level of client needs for specific categories of service, tempered of  		course by client eligibility status. QSPs set their rates in order to be  		competitive. A client who selects a low-cost QSP could, in theory, obtain more  		units of service and still remain within the maximum. But in fact it seems that  		clients do not use more service just because the rate is lower, and so the cost  		per client tends to be lower than the set ceiling. </p>
<h3>F. What if any Aspects or Features of the HCBSP Have  		Been Problematic, and What Kinds of Solutions are Being Tried or Considered to  		Remedy the Problems?</h3>
<p>State agency officials, not only from the ASD, but also from other  		Divisions as well as the Executive Office of the Department of Human Services,  		expressed considerable satisfaction with the way the program was operating.  		When asked, they could not identify any particular feature(s) of the HCBSP that  		were seriously problemati3. </p>
<h3>G. To What Extent are Home and Community-Based Services  		Perceived as Mechanisms for Reducing Nursing Home Costs?</h3>
<p>Consumer choice and independence are highly valued in North Dakot1. In  		contrast to many other states that began developing community care options at  		about the same time, and certainly subsequently, there is some evidence to  		suggest that the state's motivation was and continues to acknowledge and be  		supportive of these values, rather than to be driven by budget pressures. On  		the other hand, several other factors may come into play as well. </p>
<p>In a number of communities across the state, nursing facilities are the  		largest employers. With one of the higher ratios of nursing home beds per  		thousand 65 and older population (75:1 000),<sup><font><a href="examination-issues-related-how-hcbs-programs-operate-within-fixed-budgets-and-administrative-linkages-between-eligibility-determination-needs-assessment-and-care-planning-functions.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> a prominent state official suggested that  		the local and state economic and political impacts of a bed-use reduction  		strategy might well be worse than the burden of the state match needed to draw  		down Medicaid dollars for nursing home care. </p>
<p>Also, the nursing home industry -- still referred to by many in the  		state as the 1ong-term care industry -- is an extremely powerful  		lobby. An example is North Dakota's status as one of only two states in the  		country that has a nursing home rate equalization law, requiring state Medicaid  		and private pay rates to be the same. The net effect of this policy is that the  		state has less control over Medicaid payments for nursing home care and, as a  		result, may be paying more per Medicaid day than it otherwise might. </p>
<p>General consensus among state-level staff from the aging and Medicaid  		agencies, as well as executive branch administrators within the Department of  		Human Services, is that home care and nursing home care are considered as  		parallel, but separate and distinct, systems. It may be simply a matter of the  		politics of appeasement, but it seems that as long as the HCBSP does not appear  		to threaten the nursing home industry, it will continue to grow, albeit slowly,  		and nursing homes will continue to be big business as well. </p>
<h3>H. How Do State Officials Evaluate Their Ability to  		Manage a HCBSP within a Fixed, as Opposed to Open-Ended Entitlement,  		Budget?</h3>
<p>The North Dakota HCBSP, designed and administered by the Aging Services  		Division, already operates within a fixed budget. The Medical Services  		Division, which a ministers the Medicaid entitlement program, is supportive of  		ASD's role. Naturally, everyone would prefer an open-ended source of funding,  		but the state seems well-prepared to manage within a capped budget if that were  		the only way it could get additional resources for home and community-based  		services. </p>

<p><a name="note25" id="note25">Since</a> the HBC program was first legislated, 20%  			 of the budget has been earmarked for individuals with physical disabilities who  			 were under age 60 and for adult protective services. To meet legislative  			 intent, BEAS allocates a proportion of the 20% of each year's HBC budget to an  			 Independent Living Center (ILC) that also administers one of the state's  			 waivers for the physically disabled, and the balance to AAAs for services for  			 clients under age 60 who are disabled, and for protective services. Among the  			 relatively few clients under age 60 who are served by AAAs are those referred  			 by the ILC because they require a more traditional care management model to  			 assist in meeting their service needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note26" id="note26">Since</a> both waiver programs are currently  			 administered and operating not only totally separately from one another but  			 also from the elderly waiver, they will not be discussed in any further detail.  			 </p>

<p><a name="note29" id="note29">The</a> state also has an MR/DD waiver, with a  			 separate assessment, care management and services structure, for its eligible  			 MR/DD population. MR/DD care managers, however, do tap into the HCBSP on an  			 as-needed basis to access more traditional in-home services, e.g., homemaker,  			 in addition to the MR/DD services offered through their own program.

<p><a name="note30" id="note30">North</a> Dakota recently received approval from  			 the HCFA for a new Medicaid waiver to cover services for people with traumatic  			 brain injury (TBI), which will be incorporated as still another component of  			 the HCBSP.
