<p>Medicare and Medicaid are important payers of post-acute and long-term  		care. In 2008, the Medicare program spent $49.9 billion on post-acute services  		among fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries (see <a href="post-acute-and-long-term-care-primer-services-expenditures-and-payment-methods.html#table1">Table 1</a>).  		Similarly, Medicaid spent $56.3 billion in 2008 on nursing home care. This  		section of the report reviews the services, expenditures and payment methods  		for care at nursing facilities (NFs) and across the various post-acute care  		sites including skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), home health agencies (HHAs),  		inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), and long-term care hospitals  		(LTCHs).</p>

<p>NFs provide a range of compensatory, rehabilitative, psychosocial and  		social services to residents. In 2008, roughly 16,000 Medicaid-certified NFs  		were in operation in the United States. Roughly two-thirds were for-profit,  		about 60% were chain-owned and approximately 5% were hospital-based.  		Importantly, nearly 85% of Medicaid-certified NFs are also Medicare-certified  		SNFs.</p>
<p>Medicaid is the dominant purchaser of chronic-care (long-stay) nursing  		home services in the United States. Almost half of NF expenditures are paid for  		by Medicaid, while Medicaid recipients constitute 70% of all nursing home bed  		days (Rhoades and Sommers, 2000). Medicaid NF expenditures are shared between  		federal and state governments. In 2007, the Federal Government paid 56.7% of  		Medicaid NF expenditures, and states paid 43.3%. Other public payers of  		long-stay nursing home care include the Veterans Administration (VA) and  		other state and local sources outside of Medicaid. Importantly, Medicare pays  		only for post-acute (short-stay) SNF services (see <a href="post-acute-and-long-term-care-primer-services-expenditures-and-payment-methods.html#SNF">SNF  		section</a> below).</p>
<p>In 2008, Medicaid nursing home expenditures totaled $56.3 billion. In  		2004, the average Medicaid per diem was $131.66 (Grabowski et al., 2008), which  		inflates to $148.62 in 2008, using the SNF market basket update. The average  		length-of-stay for Medicaid-financed nursing home care is about two years, with  		significant variation around this mean.</p>
<p>Medicaid nursing home reimbursement policies vary dramatically across  		states and most states have made changes to their reimbursement system multiple  		times since the onset of the Medicaid program. Over that period of time, most  		states have transitioned from a cost-based, retrospective reimbursement model  		to some form of prospective payment. As of fiscal year (FY) 2002, 39 states  		used purely prospective reimbursement methods to set NF Medicaid payment rates.  		Among states using a prospective system, rates were set using a class or  		flat-rate method in four states, facility-specific in 18 states, resident  		specific in two states, and both facility and resident specific in 14 states  		(Grabowski et al., 2004). Only two states (Maryland and Wyoming) used purely  		retrospective systems in FY 2002, while seven states (North Carolina, Virginia,  		Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, and Texas) used combination  		systems, which combine elements of prospective and retrospective payment  		systems. </p>
<p>In the majority of states, nursing homes are paid a prospective per diem  		rate by the state Medicaid program. The rate is typically calculated based on a  		series of cost centers encompassing direct care services, indirect care  		services, administration and capital.</p>
<p>States have broad discretion in the specific methodology used to  		formulate Medicaid nursing home payment rates. Historically, comprehensive  		change has involved movement from retrospective systems to prospective systems.  		More recent trends, however, include adoption of case-mix systems, which adjust  		payment for patient acuity, as well as the adoption of fair rental approaches  		to reimbursing capital expenses, which permit greater control of rate changes  		and allow less inflation in the valuation of capital than more widely used  		historical approaches. Recent trends also include adoption of wage-pass through  		policies through which reimbursement increases are directed toward wages and  		benefits for direct care workers. In addition, some states have begun to  		experiment with pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives, which provide  		nursing homes with higher levels of reimbursement based on achievement of  		desired outcomes. A recent review found seven active state P4P programs in 2007  		using a range of performance measures such as staffing, certification,  		efficiency, quality indicators, resident/family satisfaction, quality-of-life  		and other outcomes. The payment incentives were relatively modest accounting  		for less than 5% of the Medicaid per diem. Less radical adjustments include  		rate freezes, inflation adjustments, ceiling limitations, cost center  		developments, ancillary service inclusions, efficiency incentives, and cost  		rebasing (to a more recent cost report), just to name a few.</p>
<p>The majority of states with prospective payments systems have a case-mix  		adjustment to compensate nursing homes for the admission and care of more  		disabled (i.e., costlier) patients. Although several case-mix methods are  		currently in practice, the majority of systems classify residents into  		homogeneous categories based on their resource utilization. Associated with  		each of these categories is a case-mix index (CMI), which represents, at least  		relatively, the time or cost of the average resident in the group (Fries,  		1990). A higher CMI indicates a greater degree of complexity and consequently a  		greater need for input resources. Perhaps the best-known methodology of this  		type is the Resource Utilization Groups (RUG) system, which is currently in its  		third version (Fries et al., 1994). The RUG-III system, with 44 distinct  		resource groups, has been shown to achieve 55.5% variance explanation of total  		per diem costs for nursing home residents (Fries et al., 1994). Patient  		characteristics and service use are determined using the Minimum Data Set, a  		patient assessment instrument. As of 2004, Medicaid nursing home case-mix  		reimbursement was available in 35 states, up from 19 states in 1991 and just  		four states in 1981. These states include Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,  		Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,  		Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire,  		North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South  		Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin,  		and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Capital represents a much smaller portion of total NF costs (10%-15%)  		than direct patient care. Most states reimburse for capital on the basis of  		historical costs and usually include actual interest expenses, lease payments,  		and sometimes the payment of a return on equity. By freezing the value of a  		home at its initial construction or renovation costs, however, historical  		methods fail to recognize appreciation in market value, thereby penalizing  		owners of functional, though fully depreciated, assets. This discourages  		long-term ownership and creates incentives for frequent turnover through leases  		or sales at inflated prices attractive to short-term real estate speculators.  		</p>
<p>Cognizant of frequent ownership turnover Congress included measures in  		the Deficit Reduction Act (DEFRA) of 1984 and Consolidated Omnibus  		Reconciliation Act of 1985 in order to limit asset revaluation for Medicaid  		reimbursement purposes. These provisions combined with growing awareness of  		existing problems led states to adopt alternative approaches to reimbursing  		capital. The result has been movement away from historical and market valuation  		methods, which permit less control of rate changes by allowing greater  		inflation in the valuation of capital, to fair rental approaches that pay a  		simulated rent (or return on the appraised value of a facilitys assets)  		that is permitted to change with market conditions, and combination systems  		that combine less inflationary approaches with historical methods. An advantage  		of the fair rental approach is that it accounts for increases in the value of  		nursing home assets without requiring turnover or refinancing to occur before  		owners realize gains on their investments. In the context of health information  		technologies acquisition, a fair rental approach to capital reimbursement would  		likely encourage greater investment in the technologies.</p>
<p>Recent data on state methods for reimbursing capital expenses do not  		exist. However, Harrington and colleagues reported both a marked increase in  		the use of fair rental methodologies from one state in 1984 to 18 states in  		1998, along with a concomitant decrease in the use of other approaches to  		valuing capital during this time period (Harrington et al., 1999; DuNah et al.,  		1994). This includes the use of historical methods, which declined from 35  		states in 1984 to 30 in 1989 and 22 in 1992 before reversing somewhat after  		1993 (to 25 states). By 1998, 26 states used historical approaches, nine fair  		rental methods, and nine fair rental methods combined with other capital  		valuation strategies. Less frequently used were the market valuation approach,  		which bases reimbursement on the price a home would bring on the private  		market, and the imputed value approach, which uses mathematical formulas to  		base reimbursement on a composite of different costing methods or  		calculations.</p>
<p>Under prospective payment, states have two primary means of updating  		payment rates over time. First, they can rebase rates using Medicaid cost  		report data, and second, they can use an inflation factor to adjust payment  		rates in the absence of rebasing. Reimbursement systems that use older cost  		reports are generally considered more cost containing than reimbursement  		systems that use newer cost reports because they are tied less closely to  		nursing homes current costs. States can limit rate increases in a variety  		of ways, including, for example: (1) freezing rates, (2) adjusting rates at  		less than actual inflation, (3) capping the growth in rates so that rate  		increases cannot exceed a certain percentage under a cap, and (4) providing  		monetary efficiency incentives, which typically allow nursing homes with costs  		below a predetermined amount in one or more cost centers to have a portion of  		the difference incorporated into their per diem rates. States that have  		employed efficiency incentives include Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut,  		Illinois, Iowa, North Dakota and Pennsylvania (U.S. General Accounting Office,  		2003). </p>
<h2><a name="SNF" id="SNF">SKILLED NURISNG FACILITIES -- SERVICES, EXPENDITURES, AND  		PAYMENT METHODS</a></h2>
<p>SNFs offer skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services, such as  		physical and occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services, to  		Medicare beneficiaries following an acute care hospital stay. In 2007,  		rehabilitation services accounted for 88% of all Medicare days in freestanding  		SNFs (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), 2009). The supply of SNFs  		in the United States has remained relatively constant over the past few years,  		composed of roughly 15,000 facilities that are two-thirds for-profit and mostly  		freestanding (93%) (MedPAC, 2009). Importantly, the majority (~93%) of SNFs are  		also Medicaid-certified NFs. With the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS) approval, certain Medicare-certified swing bed  		hospitals (typically small, rural hospitals and critical access hospitals) may  		also provide SNF services.</p>
<p>The dominant public payer of SNF services is the Medicare program. A  		small amount of skilled services may also be covered by state Medicaid  		programs, but these services are generally paid for in a manner similar to the  		NF services discussed above. In terms of other public payers, the VA accounts  		for a very small percentage of overall skilled nursing spending. </p>
<p>In 2008, Medicare spent $22.9 billion on 2.56 million covered SNF  		admissions. Thus, the approximate Medicare payment per SNF stay was just under  		$9,000, with an average length-of-stay of 27 days. The cost per day averaged  		approximately $330 and the median was $259. The three most prevalent diagnoses  		among Medicare SNF patients in 2007 were major joint and limb reattachment of  		lower extremity (5.5%), heart failure and shock (3.6%), and simple pneumonia  		and pleurisy with complication or comorbidity (3.4%) (MedPAC, 2009).</p>
<p>Medicares prospective payment system (PPS) for SNF services was  		implemented based on the start of the facility FY on or after July 1, 1998.  		Prior to this date, SNFs were paid on a cost-based basis. Under the Medicare  		SNF PPS, facilities are paid a predetermined daily rate, up to 100 days, but  		only after a qualifying hospital stay of at least three days. The per diem  		prospective payment rate for SNFs covers routine, ancillary, and capital costs  		related to the services provided under Part A of the Medicare program (CMS,  		2010). Certain high-cost, low-probability ancillary services (e.g., radiation  		therapy or cardiac catheterization) are paid separately. </p>
<p>Adjustments to the SNF Medicare payment rates are made according to a  		residents case-mix and geographic factors associated with wage variation  		(MedPAC, 2009). The Medicare SNF payment rate is adjusted for geographic  		differences in labor costs using the hospital wage index. Specifically, 70% of  		the base rate is adjusted for area wages and then added to a non-case-mix  		adjusted component reflecting the costs of room and board, linens and  		administrative services. The SNF payment rate is adjusted for patient case-mix  		using the 53 payment categories in the RUG-III system. Each RUG category has an  		associated nursing and therapy weight that is applied to the base payment rate.  		Patients are assigned to a RUG based on their health status and services  		delivered. Specifically, assignment of a beneficiary to particular RUG is based  		on the number of minutes of therapy (physical, occupational, or speech) minutes  		that a patient used, the need for certain services (e.g., respiratory therapy  		or specialized feeding), the presence of certain conditions (e.g., pneumonia or  		dehydration), an index based on the patients ability to perform  		independently four activities of daily living (eating, toileting, bed mobility  		and transferring), and in certain instances, signs of depression. Patient  		characteristics and service use are determined using the Minimum Data Set, a  		patient assessment instrument.</p>
<p>Medicare updates SNF payment rates each year based on the projected  		increase in the SNF market basket index, a measure of the national average  		price level of goods and services. Over the last five years, the market basket  		updates have been around 3%. The MedPAC advises Congress each year on the  		adequacy of the SNF market update, and the Congress can adjust the payment  		update upwards or downwards based on this recommendation and other factors.  		Under the recently passed health reform legislation, the SNF market basket  		update will be reduced by a productivity adjustment beginning in FY 2012. The  		productivity adjustment will be set at the 10-year moving average of non-farm  		business productivity. The application of this productivity adjustment may  		result in a negative market basket adjustment (i.e., lower Medicare payment  		rates).</p>
<h2><a name="HHA" id="HHA">HOME HEALTH AGENCIES -- SERVICES, EXPENDITURES, AND  		PAYMENT METHODS</a></h2>
<p>HHAs provide limited part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care  		(from a nurse, physical, or speech therapist) to Medicare beneficiaries in  		their homes. The Medicare HHA population uses a range of services including  		home health aide services (18% in 2008), skilled nursing care (55%), physical,  		occupational and speech therapy (26%), and medical social services (1%) (NAHC,  		2010; MedPAC, 2009). In 2008, Medicare HHA users numbered 3.2 million,  		constituting roughly 9% of Medicare beneficiaries (MedPAC, 2010). The total  		number of HHAs in the United States was 9,283 in 2009, with over 99% of  		Medicare beneficiaries having access to at least one HHA in their service area  		(MedPAC, 2009; CMS, 2009).</p>
<p>The major public payer of home health care services is the Medicare  		program. However, every state Medicaid program is mandated to offer home health  		services to individuals who qualify for federal income maintenance payments  		(e.g., Social Security Income and Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and  		are categorically needy. Services must include visits by registered  		nurses, credentialed home health aide services and medical supplies and  		equipment. In addition, states may choose to cover physical, occupational, and  		speech therapies and audiology services. States reimburse agencies using  		various methodologies including FFS, prospective and cost-based methodologies  		(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2004).</p>
<p>Medicare expenditures on HHA services totaled $16.9 billion in 2008 over  		3.2 million beneficiaries and 6.1 million episodes (MedPAC, 2009; MedPAC 2010).  		The average Medicare payment per HHA episode in 2008 was roughly $2,800. In  		2006, Medicaid home health expenditures totaled $4.6 billion (Kaiser Commission  		on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2009). The average Medicaid payment per visit in  		2008 was $73.30 (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2009).</p>
<p>Prior to the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, HHAs were paid by  		Medicare on the basis of their costs, up to pre-established per-visit limits.  		The 1997 BBA changed Medicare home health eligibility and coverage rules and  		reformed the payment methodology by instituting a PPS for home health care  		reimbursement. Implemented on October 1, 2000, Medicare pays HHAs a set payment  		rate for each 60-day episode of care.</p>
<p>Medicare payments to HHAs are packaged in 60-day blocks referred to as  		episodes, which begin as soon as the beneficiary is enrolled at an  		HHA. The majority of patients are discharged after a single 60-day payment  		episode. However, if the patients care is not complete in 60 days, then  		the patient may start another episode without a break in care, assuming the  		patient remains eligible for services (MedPAC, 2009).</p>
<p>Medicare HHA payments are adjusted according to the patients  		clinical and functional severity, the episodes timing in a sequence of  		episodes and the use of therapy during the 60-day episode (MedPAC, 2009).  		Patient characteristics are determined using the Outcome and Assessment  		Information Set, a patient assessment instrument. Payments are also adjusted  		for differences in local prices. Other adjustments that can occur under special  		circumstances include an outlier payment (when costs exceed payment by a  		certain amount), low utilization payment adjustment (&lt;5 visits in the  		episode), a change-in-condition adjustment and a partial episode adjustment to  		account for transfers across agencies (MedPAC, 2009).</p>
<p>For the purposes of case-mix adjustment, Medicare beneficiaries are  		grouped into 153 home health resource utilization groups based on their  		clinical and functional status, and according to the types of services they  		will require (MedPAC, 2009). Payment rates are adjusted for geographic factors  		using the hospital wage index. Specifically, 77% of the base payment rate is  		adjusted for area wages and then added to the remaining non-labor portion (23%)  		of the rate. Capital is part of the non-labor portion of the rate, but it only  		accounts for a small portion (&lt;3%) of the overall HHA payment rate.  		Depreciation, interest, and other measures of capital related costs are used to  		estimate prices for capital inputs. The local area adjustment for wages is  		determined by the beneficiarys residence. When a patient receives fewer  		than five visits during the 60-day episode, the HHA receives payments on a  		per-visit basis. When a patients care becomes too costly or requires a  		large number of visits, an outlier payment can sometimes be made to an HHA. In  		order to be eligible for this outlier payment, imputed episode costs must be  		65% greater than the payment rate. When this occurs, the HHA receives a payment  		equal to 80% of the difference in addition to the standard episode payment.  		Medicare outlier payments comprise less than 10% of HHA total PPS payments  		(CMS, 2009).</p>
<p>Medicare updates HHA payments each year based on the projected increase  		in the HHA market basket index, a measure of the national average price level  		of goods and services. Over the period 2006-2010, the market basket updates  		have ranged between 2% and 3.6%. The MedPAC advises Congress each year on the  		adequacy of the HHA market update, and the Congress can adjust the payment  		update upwards or downwards based on this recommendation and other factors. For  		example, the DEFRA of 2005 eliminated the home health payment update for 2006,  		effectively freezing home health payment rates at the 2005 level.  		Under the recently passed health reform legislation, the HHA market basket  		update will be reduced by a productivity adjustment of one percentage point in  		FY 2011 and FY 2012. Beginning in FY 2015, the productivity adjustment will be  		set at the 10-year moving average of non-farm business productivity. The  		application of the productivity adjustment may result in a negative market  		basket adjustment (i.e., lower Medicare payment rates).</p>
<h2><a name="IRF" id="IRF">INPATIENT REHABILITATION FACILITIES -- SERVICES,  		EXPENDITURES AND PAYMENT METHODS</a></h2>
<p>An IRF is a hospital that provides rehabilitation services such as  		physical, occupational, and speech therapies (CMS, 2010). In 2008, more than  		332,000 FFS beneficiaries were enrolled in an IRF, which constituted nearly 1%  		of all FFS enrollees in the Medicare program during that year (MedPAC, 2010).  		To qualify for Medicare payment, an IRF must have a preadmission screening  		process; use a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach to therapy; have an  		experienced medical director of rehabilitation; and have no fewer than 60% of  		all patients admitted with at least 1 of 13 conditions (60% rule) (MedPAC,  		2009). As of January 1, 2010, CMS issued new admission requirements for  		Medicare-eligible IRF patients: (1) they should require interdisciplinary care;  		(2) they should be medically stable enough to participate in intensive therapy;  		(3) they should require supervision by a physician; and, (4) they should  		require and expected to benefit from three hours of therapy at the least five  		times a week (MedPAC, 2010).</p>
<p>In 2008, just over 1,200 IRFs were in operation nationwide. Although an  		IRF was located in every state and the District of Columbia, some geographic  		variation exists in the supply of IRFs. An IRF may be a specialized unit with  		an acute care hospital (roughly 80% of facilities) or a specialized, larger  		freestanding facility.</p>
<p>The Medicare program is the dominant payer of IRF services, accounting  		for roughly 60% of all IRF cases nationwide. In 2008, Medicares aggregate  		expenditures for IRFs were $5.84 billion and the average payment per case was  		$16,649 (MedPAC, 2010). Some of the most common types of IRF cases were stroke  		(20.4%), hip fracture (16%), major joint replacement (13.1%), debility (9.1%),  		and neurological disorders (8%). The average length-of-stay for a Medicare IRF  		patient was 13.3 days in 2008.</p>
<p>Prior to 2002, IRFs were paid by Medicare on their average costs per  		discharge subject to a facility-specific limit that was adjusted annually. In  		January 2002, the IRF PPS was implemented under which IRFs are paid a  		predetermined per-discharge rate based primarily on the patients  		condition. The PPS payment rate covers all operating and capital costs that  		IRFs are expected to incur in the provision of intensive rehabilitation  		services.</p>
<p>The unit of payment under the IRF PPS is the discharge episode. Patients  		are assigned to one of 92 intensive rehabilitation categories called case-mix  		groups (CMGs) according to the primary condition for which the patient was  		admitted, afterwards the patients fall into tiers based upon secondary  		diagnosis and comorbidities (CMS, 2009). Patient characteristics are determined  		using the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument.  		Payments are also adjusted for differences in local prices.</p>
<p>For 87 of the CMGs, patients are assigned to a group based on their  		primary reason for intensive rehabilitation care (e.g., a stroke or burns),  		their age, their levels of functional and cognitive impairments and their  		comorbidities. The remaining five CMGs are for individuals discharged before  		the fourth day--termed short-stay outliers--and for those who die in the  		facility. Additionally, IRFs may also receive lower Medicare payments when the  		beneficiary transfers to another facility and when the length-of-stay is less  		than the standard for patients with the same condition. The base rate under the  		IRF PPS--$12,958 for FY 2009--is adjusted using a version of the hospital wage  		index. Specifically, 75% of the base payment rate is adjusted for area wages  		and the result is then added to the non-labor portion (25%) of the base  		rate.</p>
<p>Medicare payment rates are increased for IRFs located in rural markets,  		those that treat low-income patients, and those that are teaching institutions.  		Because rural IRFs tend to have fewer cases, longer lengths of stay, and higher  		average costs per case, payments to rural facilities are increased by 21.3%.  		Payments for IRFs treating low-income patients are adjusted based on the sum of  		the proportion of total Medicare days furnished to beneficiaries eligible for  		Supplemental Security Income benefits and the proportion of total patient days  		furnished to Medicaid patients not covered by Medicare. An IRFs payments  		are adjusted if they are teaching institution according to the ratio of their  		residents to their average daily census. </p>
<p>Medicare has two outlier payment policies for IRFs. Once again, patients  		with short-stays (&lt;4 days) are paid lower rates. The other policy is for  		high-cost patients when costs exceed a fixed-loss threshold. In these cases,  		IRFs are paid their regular rate plus 80% of their costs above the fixed-loss  		threshold. Outlier payments are estimated to account for roughly 3% of overall  		IRF spending by Medicare (MedPAC, 2009). </p>
<p>Medicare updates IRF payments each year based on the projected increase  		in the IRF market basket index, a measure of the national average price level  		of goods and services. Over the period 2006-2010, the market basket updates  		have ranged between 2.5% and 3.6%. The MedPAC advises Congress each year on the  		adequacy of the IRF market update, and the Congress can adjust the payment  		update upwards or downwards based on this recommendation and other factors.  		Under the recently passed health care reform legislation, the IRF market basket  		update will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points in FY 2010 and FY 2011 and 0.2  		percentage points for FY 2012 through FY 2019. Beginning in FY 2012, a  		productivity adjustment will be set at the 10-year moving average of non-farm  		business productivity. The application of the productivity adjustment may  		result in a negative overall market basket adjustment (i.e., lower Medicare  		payment rates).</p>
<h2><a name="LTCH" id="LTCH">LONG-TERM CARE HOSPITALS -- SERVICES, EXPENDITURES, AND  		PAYMENT METHODS</a></h2>
<p>LTCHs provide treatment for patients who stay more than 25 days on  		average and suffer from clinically complex problems, such as multiple acute or  		chronic conditions (CMS, 2010; MedPAC, 2009). To qualify for Medicare payment,  		a LTCH must meet Medicares conditions of participation for acute care  		hospitals; have an average length-of-stay greater than 25 days for its Medicare  		patients; and have an adequate screening process. The largest groups of  		beneficiaries to receive treatment in a LTCH include those with respiratory  		ailments (28%), skin ulcers (5.2%), and degenerative nervous system disorders  		(2.6%) (MedPAC, 2009). No prior acute care hospitalization is required for  		Medicare admission to an LTCH, although roughly 80% of Medicare LTCH patients  		are admitted from an acute care hospital.</p>
<p>In 2008, there were 386 LTCHs nationwide with 26,578 Medicare-certified  		beds. The majority of LTCHs were freestanding facilities (62%), and for-profit  		owned (73%) and located in urban areas (92%). LTCHS are not distributed evenly  		across the country, with a strong concentration in northeastern (e.g.,  		Massachusetts, Rhode Island) and southeastern (e.g., Louisiana) states.</p>
<p>Medicare is the predominant payer of LTCH services, accounting for  		roughly two-thirds of all discharges. In 2008, Medicare spent $4.6 billion on  		130,869 LTCH cases. The Medicare payment per case was $35,200, with an average  		length-of-stay of 26.7 days. LTCHs were historically paid by Medicare on the  		basis of their average costs per discharge, as long as they did not exceed a  		facility-specific limit that was adjusted annually. In October 2002, Medicare  		adopted the LTCH PPS that pays a predetermined per-discharge rate based  		primarily on the patients diagnosis and market area wages. </p>
<p>The Medicare unit of payment under the LTCH PPS is the discharge  		episode. Medicare sets per-discharge payments for LTCHs according to different  		CMGs based on the Medicare severity long-term care diagnosis related group  		(MS-LTC-DRG). Patients are assigned to a MS-LTC-DRG based on their principal  		diagnosis, up to eight secondary diagnoses, up to six procedures performed,  		age, sex, and discharge status. The MS-LTC-DRGs correspond to the DRGs used in  		the acute inpatient PPS, but the relative weights are specific to LTCH  		patients. The PPS payment rate covers all operating and capital costs. The  		initial payment level (base rate) for a typical discharge is $39,897 in 2010.  		The labor portion of the base rate (76%) is adjusted for differences in market  		area wages using a version of the hospital wage index and then the result is  		added to the non-labor portion (including capital).</p>
<p>The LTCH PPS system accounts for both short-stay and high-cost outliers.  		Short-stay outliers are episodes with a length-of-stay up to and including  		five-sixths of the geometric average length-of-stay for the specific  		MS-LTC-DRG. For these cases, LTCHs are paid the least of: (1) 100% of the cost  		of the case; (2) 120% of the MS-LTC-DRG specific per diem amount multiplied by  		the length-of-stay for that episode; (3) the full MS-LTC-DRG payment; or (4) an  		amount that is a blend of the inpatient PPS amount for the MS-DRG and the 120%  		of the LTCH per diem payment amount. High-cost outliers are identified by  		comparing episode costs to a threshold that is the MS-LTC-DRG payment for the  		episode plus a fixed-loss amount. In 2010, the fixed-loss amount is $18,425,  		and Medicare pays 80% of the LTCHs costs about the threshold.</p>
<p>LTCH patients that are discharged to an inpatient acute care hospital  		(for &lt;9 days), an IRF (for &lt;27 days), or a SNF (for &lt;45 days) and then  		return to the same LTCH--termed interrupted stay patients--generate  		a single Medicare LTCH payment. Any LTCH patient readmitted within 3 days is  		also considered an interrupted stay.</p>
<p>LTCHs are regulated by the 25% rule, which reduces payments  		for LTCHs that exceed percentage thresholds for patients admitted from certain  		referring hospitals during a cost reporting system (MedPAC, 2008). After the  		threshold is reached, the LTCH is paid the lesser of the LTCH PPS rate or an  		amount equivalent to the inpatient hospital PPS rate for patients discharged  		from the host acute care hospital. Basically, this rule is in place to help  		ensure that LTCHs do not function as units of acute care hospitals. When the  		rule was first implemented, it applied only to LTCH hospitals within hospitals  		(HWHs) and satellites. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007  		rolled back the implementation of the 25% rule for HWHs and satellites and  		prevented application of the rule to freestanding LTCHs for three years.</p>
<p>Prior to the recently passed health care reform legislation, the statute  		did not specify a mechanism for updating payments to LTCHs. In recent years,  		CMS has used the Rehabilitation, Psychiatric, and Long-Term Care (RPL) market  		basket index. However, CMS has adjusted the RPL market basket increase downward  		to account for improved coding practices that have resulted in higher CMIs  		without corresponding increases in patient severity of illness. For example,  		the market basket increase of 2.5% in 2010 was adjusted downward to 2% to  		account for improved coding practices. Under the recently passed health care  		reform legislation, the LTCH market basket update will be reduced by 0.25  		percentage points in FY 2010 and FY 2011 and 0.2 percentage points for FY 2012  		through FY 2019. Beginning in FY 2012, a productivity adjustment will be set at  		the 10-year moving average of non-farm business productivity. The application  		of the productivity adjustment may result in a negative overall market basket  		adjustment (i.e., lower Medicare payment rates).</p>
