<p>The market for professional liability insurance for nursing facility  		operators is in a state of flux, and the cost of professional liability  		insurance for nursing home owners has increased substantially in all areas of  		the country, though much higher in some states than in others. At the same  		time, the number of insurance carriers offering liability coverage for nursing  		homes has decreased dramatically, as many admitted insurance carriers incurred  		substantial losses in this product line in the late 1990s, and consequently  		decided to get out of the market altogether. Those carriers that decided to  		stay in the market have changed the terms and conditions of liability coverage,  		taking on less risk at higher prices.<sup><font><a href="#notea">a</a></font></sup> Consequently, in some areas of the country,  		many nursing facility owners have been forced to operate without any  		professional liability insurance coverage whatsoever.</p>
<p>A contributing factor to increased cost and reduced availability of  		professional liability insurance for nursing homes has been increased  		litigation. However, the nature of the link between nursing home litigation and  		the cost and availability of professional liability insurance is a matter of  		considerable debate. </p>
<p>This report is one of five case studies prepared as part of a larger  		study sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on trends  		and issues in the nursing facility liability insurance market. Additional case  		studies were conducted on the nursing facility liability insurance market in  		California, Florida, Ohio and Texas. The case studies are designed to provide  		greater insight into the dynamics of the liability insurance market by  		examining the experiences of states with differing long-term care, economic,  		political, legal and insurance landscapes. This report presents the case study  		on nursing facility litigation and insurance issues in Georgia.</p>
<p>The case study draws largely upon a week long site visit conducted by  		contractor staff in January 2004. The case study offers a brief background on  		the Georgia nursing home industry, nursing home quality, and litigation and  		liability insurance trends in Georgia. The report draws on in-person,  		telephone, and email discussions, in addition to published and unpublished  		literature. Discussions were conducted with a broad range of stakeholders  		including consumer advocates, representatives of for-profit and non-profit  		nursing homes, plaintiff and defense attorneys, nursing home regulators, state  		Medicaid rate setting officials, nursing home ombudsmen, insurance carriers,  		and insurance brokers. Numerous follow-up calls were made, and additional  		background materials collected, during the spring of 2004 to augment the  		information obtained during the conduct of the site visit.</p>
<h2><a name="state" id="state">STATE ENVIRONMENT</a></h2>
<p>In 2002, the American Medical Association identified Georgia, as a  		crisis state based on: (1) loss of access to medical care by  		exceptional numbers of people; and (2) physicians making major career changes  		due to excessive medical liability insurance premiums.<sup><font><a href="#ref1">1</a></font></sup> That same year, an Aon Risk Consultants  		liability insurance actuarial analysis reported that the frequency and severity  		of nursing home claims in Georgia were increasing at an alarming  		rate.<sup><font><a href="#ref2">2</a></font></sup> In addition, there  		were anecdotal reports that the nursing home liability crisis was spreading  		from Florida north into Georgia, as plaintiff attorneys with specialized  		expertise in nursing home litigation were looking for new markets to enter. For  		these reasons, Georgia was selected as one of the five case study states. </p>
<h3>Georgia Nursing Home Industry</h3>
<p>Georgias nursing facility environment is distinctive in many ways  		that may affect liability trends, facilities ability to respond to the  		insurance crisis, and the reform debate more generally. First, regional and  		national chains, both for-profit and non-profit, have a larger market share in  		Georgia than anywhere else in the country. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of the  		states 361 nursing facilities are part of a chain. The percentage of  		for-profit providers in the state has decreased from 76% in December 2001 to  		66% in June 2005. The current figure is equal to the national  		average.<sup><font><a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Second, the supply of nursing facilities and nursing home utilization  		rates are slightly above average. The state has 40,026 certified nursing  		facilities beds, 47 for every 1,000 people age 65 or older. This ratio is close  		to the national average of 46. However, the state has a relatively small  		population of people age 85 and older, the age group most likely to use nursing  		facility care. Georgias ratio of 420 beds per 1,000 people age 85 or  		older is 22% above the national average of 345.<sup><font><a href="#ref4">4</a></font></sup> Georgias occupancy rate (90%) is greater  		than the national average (86%).<sup><font><a href="#ref5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Third, both public and private reimbursement rates are among the lowest  		in the nation. In 2002, the state Medicaid program paid an average of $91 per  		day. This rate was 43rd among 46 states that responded to a survey of Medicaid  		payment policies.<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a></font></sup> The  		2003 average private pay rate in urban areas, $129, ranked 39th among the 50  		states and DC.<sup><font><a href="#ref7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, nursing facilities in Georgia are more dependent on Medicaid  		than in other states. Medicaid is the primary payer for 76% of all residents in  		certified facilities, the fourth highest rate in the country and much higher  		than the national average (66%). Medicare is the primary payer for 10% of  		residents, less than the national average of 12%.<sup><font><a href="#ref8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Fifth, the vast majority of Georgias nursing facility beds are  		certified for Medicare, Medicaid, or both programs. Less than 0.1% of beds are  		non-certified, compared to the national average of 5%. The percentage of  		Medicare-certified beds increased from 68% in December 2001 to 90% in June  		2005. This increase reflected the national pattern during the same time after  		changes in Medicare reimbursement. The national average increased from 60% to  		82% over the same time period. The percentage of Medicaid-certified beds  		remained constant during this time (99%, most of which are also  		Medicare-certified). Nationally, 91% of nursing facilities are  		Medicaid-certified.<sup><font><a href="#ref9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Quality and Oversight in Georgia</h3>
<p>Data from Medicare and Medicaid certification surveys indicate Georgia  		facilities have more deficiencies, on average, than nursing facilities across  		the country. In 2004, surveys identified 10.0 deficiencies per Georgia  		facility, compared to the national average, 9.2. A small proportion of these  		quality concerns led to actual harm to residents or put residents at risk of  		death or serious injury (i.e., immediate jeopardy). Georgia was close to  		average in the percentage of facilities with these most serious deficiencies  		(15%, compared to the national average of 15.5%).<sup><font><a href="#ref10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>State surveys are frequently criticized for being an unreliable source  		of information for measuring nursing home quality, however. A 1999 U.S. General  		Accounting Office (GAO) report offered strong criticism of the nursing facility  		enforcement system, and noted large variations among states in the survey  		process.<sup><font><a href="#ref11">11</a></font></sup> Although a  		more recent GAO report noted improvements, it identified continued nursing home  		oversight shortcomings in several states. In Georgia, for example, more than  		half the surveys were predictable because they occurred in the last month of a  		15-month period in which a survey is required.<sup><font><a href="#ref12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nursing home staffing levels in Georgia are below the national average.  		Georgia facilities employed 3.4 licensed nurse and certified nursing assistant  		staff per resident day in 2004, compared to the national average of  		3.7.<sup><font><a href="#ref13">13</a></font></sup> In 2002, Georgia  		ranked as one of ten states having the highest percentage of facilities with  		deficiencies in one or more of the top ten U.S. Survey Deficiency  		Categories.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, the Georgia Nursing Home Association has  		spent over $1 million on a quality improvement initiative. Directed by an  		independent contractor--My InnerView--the program promotes evidence-based  		management practices through monthly data collection, management training, and  		resident, family and employee satisfaction surveys.<sup><font><a href="#ref14">14</a></font></sup> Nursing facilities sign a  		quality pledge and pay $2,300 to join the program. These payments are  		reimbursed if a facility pays the entire fee, submits monthly data, and  		facility staff attend the programs training sessions. The data  		contributed by the participating facilities are used to identify weakness  		indicators, solve individual facility problems, and promote friendly quality  		competition among facilities. Since the projects inception, improvements  		have been seen in bed sore rates, restraint usage, and other quality indictors.  		Supervisory and management skills training are emphasized. The American  		Association of Retired Persons, the Georgia Council of Community Ombudsmen, and  		the Alzheimers Association provide financial support for this quality  		project. The goal is to eventually make city or regional nursing facility data  		publicly available. There was some concern among the program participants,  		however, that if individual facility-level data were made available to the  		public, plaintiff attorneys might use it to pursue litigation against the more  		poorly performing nursing facilities.</p>
<h3>Nursing Home Litigation and Liability Insurance Trends  		in Georgia</h3>
<p>Most publicly available data and research studies on professional  		liability in Georgia focus exclusively on medical malpractice costs and  		litigation claims for individual physicians and do not include long-term care  		facilities. However, two national studies provide a limited view of nursing  		home liability trends in Georgia. In addition, the Georgia Nursing Home  		Association also supplied summary data on the costs of liability insurance.</p>
<p>In a national study of nursing home general and professional liability  		costs, Aon Risk Consultants estimated that the frequency of nursing home claims  		in Georgia to be slightly below the national average (see <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). In 2003, Aon estimated that there were 14.0  		liability claims per 1,000 beds in Georgia, compared to a national average of  		15.3 claims per 1,000 beds.<sup><font><a href="#noteb">b</a></font></sup> However, in terms of claim severity, Aon  		estimated that the average award made in Georgia (either through a negotiated  		settlement or a jury award) was significantly higher than the national average.  		In 2003, Aon estimated average claim severity in Georgia at $220,000, almost  		50% higher than the national average of $149,000 per claim. As shown in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, average claim severity in Georgia was below the  		national average in the mid to late 1990s, but starting in 1999, claim severity  		started to increase dramatically. Both plaintiff and defense attorneys  		interviewed during the Georgia site visit indicated that settlement amounts had  		increased in Georgia after a number of jury trials had ended with multi-million  		dollar awards being made to the plaintiff. While very few liability cases go to  		jury trial, award amounts granted in jury trials drive negotiated settlement  		amounts.</p>
<p>As also shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, due to Georgias  		low Medicaid reimbursement rates, liability costs represent a higher percentage  		of Medicaid revenue in Georgia than in most other states. In Georgia, per diem  		loss costs averaged 7.6% of the average daily Medicaid reimbursement rate in  		2004, compared to a national average of 5.0%. In 2001, the Georgia legislature  		appropriated an $18 million supplement to cover increased liability insurance  		costs for facilities whose costs had risen more than 25%. However, this was a  		one-time supplemental payment, and both state officials and nursing home  		representatives did not expect any additional supplemental payments in the  		future.</p>
<p>In 2005, Aon issued an annual update to its actuarial analysis of  		professional liability costs in the nursing home industry.<sup><font><a href="#ref15">15</a></font></sup> In its 2005 report, Aons  		estimates of average loss costs in Georgia increased dramatically. For example,  		estimated lost costs in 2001 increased from $1,910 per bed to $5,110 per  		bed.<sup><font><a href="#notec">c</a></font></sup> Aon attributed  		this increase to a 2000 claim occurrence that eventually led to a payout of  		over $10 million in 2004. This payout amount had a significant effect on  		settlement amounts in 2001, as insurers were forced to negotiate higher  		settlements in order to avoid the risk of a trial. These data demonstrate how  		individual cases that go to jury trial can have a large impact on average loss  		costs for outstanding claims. On the other hand, the 2005 Aon study also  		estimated that over half of all claim amounts are settled for less than  		$50,000.<sup><font><a href="#ref16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Aon study sample is dominated by data contributed by multi-facility  		chain operators that are self-insured. A 2002 study, conducted by the Insurance  		Services Office (ISO), provides liability claims data for nursing homes that  		purchase professional liability insurance from commercial insurers.<sup><font><a href="#ref17">17</a></font></sup> Although the study samples are  		different, the ISO study findings are fairly consistent with the 2004 Aon  		estimates. The ISO study, which represented approximately 41.1% of all beds in  		Georgia and 26.7% of all nursing homes beds nationwide, also found Georgia  		outpacing the national average in terms of claim severity, and about equal to  		the national average in claims per 1,000 beds (see <a href="#table2">Table  		2</a>). Between 1998 and 2000, Georgias claim frequency was slightly less  		than the national average (1.4 per thousand beds and 1.5 per thousand beds  		respectively). Average severity per claim for Georgia at $170,000 was in excess  		of the national average of $139,000. Pure premium costs in Georgia exceeded the  		national average as did the loss ratio (see <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>).  		</p>
<p>Both the ISO and Aon studies indicate that while Georgia may not be  		outpacing the national average in frequency of claims made, the average  		severity per claim exceeds the national average in recent years.</p>
<p>Data from a Georgia Department of Insurance Survey (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>) showed a huge increase in insurance premium costs  		from 2001 to 2002. Insurance costs rose 123% for Georgia nursing facilities  		while projected payments also increased dramatically (160%) over the same  		period.</p>
<h3>Nursing Home Liability Insurance Market in Georgia</h3>
<p>The number of admitted insurance carriers writing liability policies for  		nursing facilities had decreased in Georgia, leading nursing facilities to seek  		alternate insurance arrangements. The Atlanta Business Chronicle reported in  		2001 that many insurers had stopped writing liability policies for nursing  		facilities altogether, shrinking the pool of would be insurers from 15 to  		less than five.<sup><font><a href="#ref18">18</a></font></sup>  		According to insurance industry brokers interviewed during the Georgia site  		visit, by 2004 there were no admitted insurance carriers (i.e., those which  		comply with state insurance regulations) operating in Georgia, but only direct  		carrier subsidiary surplus lines extending liability insurance coverage to  		nursing facilities (e.g., AIG is using Lexington to write policies, CNA is  		using Columbia, Great American is using American Empire). Admitted carriers are  		required to file financial statements, audit statements, actuarial reports,  		rate justifications and form filings with the state. Admitted carriers are also  		subject to examination by the Georgia Commissioner of Insurance. Additionally,  		should an admitted carrier become insolvent, there is a state reserve (in  		Georgia--$100,000 per policy) to pay claims. Surplus line carriers do not  		comply with state insurance regulations and claims are not covered by the state  		reserve in case an insurer becomes insolvent.</p>
<p>Nursing facilities reported during site visit interviews that they had  		opted to seek coverage through: (1) alternative risk transfer programs such as  		surplus line carriers; (2) forming captives; and (3) joining risk retention  		groups (RRGs). A surplus line carrier is unregulated and handles risks that  		admitted carriers are unwilling to write and although recognized as an  		insurance carrier, is licensed in another state. The advantages of being a  		surplus line carrier, rather than an admitted carrier, include the ability to  		set rates without oversight of the department of insurance and to operate in a  		less regulated environment. </p>
<p>Captive insurance programs are an external funding mechanism  		whereby a provider (or group of similarly related providers or a trade  		association) creates a separate legal entity, typically a subsidiary or sister  		corporation, to act as the providers limited purpose insurance  		company.<sup><font><a href="#ref19">19</a></font></sup> A  		captive can write insurance or reinsurance and is required to file financial  		statements, audit reports, and actuarial reports, but not rate justifications  		and form filings. Captives are also not covered under the state reserve fund.  		Self-insurance funds can be formed by a group or an organization and are  		arrangement(s) whereby a provider contributes monies to a self-insurance  		reserve that is held by an independent entity and specifically dedicated to the  		payment of anticipated professional liability claims. Advantages of  		alternative insurance arrangements include potentially lower premiums and  		control over how claims are paid or contested. </p>
<p>Similar to captives, RRGs are member-owned business associations that  		are formed specifically for the purpose of pooling and sharing similar business  		risks. RRGs are effectively exempt from state law except that the states can  		still collect premium and surplus taxes, force compliance with unfair claim  		settlement practices, and follow a few other requirements common to insurance  		companies. States may not, however, dictate rates, coverages, forms, methods of  		operations or investment activities, loss control or claims. RRGs are often  		used in conjunction with captives to insure various levels of risk. The Georgia  		Department of Insurance reported that in 2002 there were 48 registered RRGs in  		the state, increasing to 61 registered RRGs by February 2004. There were also  		16 licensed captives as of the end of 2001. While current data on captives are  		not available, nursing facility organizations and insurance brokers estimated  		that over 50% of Georgia facilities were in some form of self-insured captive  		arrangement in 2004.</p>
<p>Georgia nursing facilities are not required by law to have liability  		insurance and there is no state oversight or data collection policy for  		determining if insured facilities are meeting carriers requirements. </p>
<h3>Legal and Legislative Environment in Georgia</h3>
<p>The Tort Reform Act of 1987 and the Medical Malpractice Reform Act of  		1987 represent early efforts at tort reform by the Georgia Legislature. These  		two Acts established standards for the award of punitive damages for all tort  		cases, including product liability cases. The main components of the Acts which  		impacted nursing facility liability tort cases include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Claimants were required to support their claim with an expert  		  affidavit.</li>
<li>Punitive damages had to be specifically requested in the complaint  		  and not awarded automatically. Juries had to decide whether punitive damages  		  would be awarded and the amount. </li>
<li>Punitive damages were awarded only to penalize or deter a defendant  		  and not to compensate a plaintiff. </li>
<li>Punitive damages were only to be awarded when there is clear evidence  		  of willful misconduct, and not in cases of simple negligence. </li>
<li>In cases which do not arise from product liability, if it is found  		  that the defendant acted, or failed to act with the intent to cause harm (or  		  under the influence of alcohol or drugs) there is no limitation regarding the  		  amount which may be awarded for punitive damages. The damages are the liability  		  only of the defendant who acted (or failed to act) and not of the other  		  defendants in the case.</li>
<li>For cases where there is no product liability and the defendant was  		  not found to act with the intent to do harm, punitive damages shall be limited  		  to a maximum of $250,000.</li>
<li>Collateral source payments (expenses covered by another party such as  		  an insurer) can be admitted as evidence.</li>
<li>The rule of joint and several liability is barred in the recovery of  		  all damages when a plaintiff was assessed a portion of the fault.</li>
<li>In subsequent court cases, the U.S. District court declared several  		  of the provisions of the Acts which were related to product liability cases to  		  be unconstitutional. (<b>Georgia Power v. Falagan, No. S90A1245, April  		  1991</b>)<sup><font><a href="#ref20">20</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Starting in 2003, the Georgia Legislature proposed a number of bills  		that furthered efforts at tort reform. The main issues addressed in these bills  		included: caps on non-economic damages, expert witness qualifications, issues  		of joint and several liability and comparative negligence, collateral source  		requirements and periodic payments. On November 15, 2004, Senator Preston Smith  		(R-Rome) along with other members of the Senate Republican Caucus filed tort  		reform legislation Senate Bill 3.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 3 (S.B. 3) was enacted by the Georgia General Assembly on  		February 14, 2005 and signed into law by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue on  		February 16th. The focus of the legislation was on medical malpractice reform,  		but many provisions of the bill also affect nursing home liability issues.  		Specific provisions of S.B. 3 which apply to nursing facility liability and  		medical malpractice cases are: </p>
<ul><li><b>Venue</b>: If defendants who are residents of a venue are  		  discharged from liability and any remaining defendants are not residents of  		  that venue, the remaining defendants can request the case be transferred to an  		  appropriate venue. For medical malpractice claims, a non-resident defendant can  		  ask for the case to be transferred to the county of his/her residence (if that  		  is where the act occurred). If the court determines that a different state or  		  county will be more convenient to the parties involved, the court can transfer  		  the case. This provision was intended to address the fact that many times  		  plaintiffs would join a dummy defendant in order to establish venue  		  in a more plaintiff-friendly county. </li>
<li><b>Expert witness qualifications</b>: In medical malpractice cases,  		  experts (at the trial and in pre-trial affidavits) must have practiced or  		  taught for three of the five years preceding the case in the appropriate area  		  of specialty. The judge determines if the expert has the proper qualifications  		  to testify regarding the diagnosis and treatment at issue in the case. </li>
<li><b>Offers of settlement</b>: When an offer of monetary settlement is  		  made and rejected and the offeror has a favorable verdict (at least 25% more  		  favorable than the offer), the offeror is entitled to collect litigation costs.  		  The costs would be calculated from the day the settlement was offered and would  		  include attorneys fees.</li>
<li><b>Statements of apology</b>: Statements of apology or sympathy made  		  by health care providers to patients or their families can not later be  		  admitted as evidence of the providers liability. </li>
<li><b>Liability in emergency departments</b>: For emergency care, health  		  care providers are not liable unless clear and convincing evidence of gross  		  negligence is provided. This is not applicable once a patient is stabilized or  		  if care is not related to the medical emergency. </li>
<li><b>Apparent agency</b>: This provision clarifies when a hospital is  		  liable for the negligence of a health care provider that is not an employee.  		  </li>
<li><b>Proportional Share Liability</b>: Each defendant is only  		  responsible for their proportional share of the damages. This provision  		  abolishes joint and several liabilities which makes all parties equally  		  responsible for any damages.</li>
<li><b>Non-economic damages</b>: Non-economic damages are limited to a  		  total of $1,050,000, with a cap of $350,000 per individual health care provider  		  or medical facility. For multiple facilities, non-economic damages are capped  		  at $700,000. </li>
</ul><p>The provisions of S.B. 3 imposing caps on non-economic damages are those  		which have the greatest potential impact on the nursing home liability  		insurance market. The caps imposed in S.B. 3 are not as hard or as low as those  		imposed in the tort reform legislation recently enacted in Texas, so it remains  		to be seen what impact S.B. 3 will have on both claim frequency and claim  		severity in nursing home liability cases.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Georgia experienced a rise in nursing home liability claims in the late  		1990s and early 2000s that led to the exit of virtually all admitted insurance  		carriers in the state. Many attribute the increase in litigation activity in  		Georgia to the spread of nursing home litigation from neighboring  		Florida, and the expansion of plaintiff attorneys who had developed specialized  		expertise in nursing home litigation into new markets. As in many other states,  		the debate on nursing home liability reform in Georgia was caught up in a  		larger debate around medical malpractice reform. The medical malpractice crisis  		in Georgia led to the enactment of S.B. 3 in February 2005, which although  		focused on bringing stability back to the medical malpractice insurance market,  		is also expected to impact the nursing home liability insurance market,  		particularly in relation to the placement of hard caps on non-economic damages.  		However, as in other states that have recently enacted tort reform legislation,  		pricing stability in the insurance market has not been immediate. Insurers  		generally take a wait and see approach to tort reform legislation,  		and closely monitor actual impacts on claim severity and frequency before  		re-entering a market and/or reducing prices. Thus, stability in the nursing  		home liability insurance market in Georgia may still be several years away.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary">GLOSSARY</a></h2>
<p><b>Admitted Carriers</b> are commercial insurers whose nursing home  		liability insurance products are regulated by state departments of insurance.  		These carriers enjoy some advantages over non-admitted carriers. They can  		participate in state guaranty funds, which help protect policyholders in the  		case of insurer insolvency. Also, they have a marketing advantage over  		non-admitted carriers because some brokers, facility providers and lenders  		value state oversight and participation in the guaranty fund.</p>
<p>The <b>Alternative Market</b> to nursing home liability insurance is  		composed of various forms of self-insurance, meaning the risk is borne by the  		participants and not an insurance company. The different forms of  		self-insurance include risk retention and risk purchasing groups (RPGs),  		captives, rent-a-captives, and sponsored captives (Joint Underwriting  		Associations).</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Agreements</b> are contracts, the terms of which are  		determined by an arbitrator, entered into by opposing parties. An arbitrator is  		a person or panel of people who are not judges and may be: (1) agreed to by the  		parties; (2) required by a provision in a contract for settling disputes; or  		(3) provided for under statute. Arbitration is designed to be a fair and  		equitable means of dispute resolution agreed to by both parties to avoid a  		court trial and the associated expenses and time investment.</p>
<p><b>Capitalization</b> means funding the reserves of an insurance or  		self-insurance program to pay claims.</p>
<p>A <b>Cell Captive</b> is a captive in which member providers share  		administrative expenses but not risk.</p>
<p>A <b>Captive</b> is a self-formed pool of providers who share risk among  		themselves, thus acting as their own insurance company. Members do their own  		underwriting, meaning they decide among themselves which providers to admit to  		the captive. Members will share liability risk with the providers they admit.  		</p>
<p><b>Claims Made Policies</b> provide coverage for insured events that  		both occur and <i>for which a claim is made</i> during the term of the policy.  		Thus, if an incident occurs, but the policy is terminated before a claim is  		made, liability for the incident is not insured.</p>
<p><b>Claims Occurrence Policies</b> provide coverage for all incidents and  		events that occur during the term of the policy, regardless of when a liability  		claim is made, or when a lawsuit is settled.</p>
<p><b>Collateral Damages</b> are damages incurred by the plaintiff that are  		already covered by other sources of payment. Collateral source  		offset rules reduce awards by denying plaintiffs compensation for  		losses that are recouped from other sources, such as health insurance. These  		rules aim to prevent plaintiffs from double dipping by  		recovering for losses for which the plaintiff has already been remunerated  		through other sources of payment.</p>
<p><b>Deductibles</b> are initial amounts of claims incurred by the  		policyholder not covered by the insurance policy. Insurance coverage begins  		only for losses incurred above the deductible amount.</p>
<p><b>Economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for financial losses caused by the wrongful actions of another party  		(e.g., awards for the medical bills of a nursing home resident caused by an  		abusive employee).</p>
<p><b>Estimated Liability Costs</b> are approximate calculations of  		expenses for damages to which a nursing home is exposed. Because estimates are  		derived from information provided by nursing homes and the cost of settlements  		of lawsuits is confidential information known only to the insurance carrier,  		plaintiffs attorney and defense attorney, these calculations are only  		estimates and are subject to change.</p>
<p><b>General Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages to a plaintiff due to  		bodily injury or property damage. </p>
<p>A <b>Joint Underwriting Association</b> is a state-sponsored  		organization that creates insurance pools and functions as an insurer in  		markets without a significant number of licensed insurers. It has the power to  		sell insurance policies, collect premiums, and purchase reinsurance and it can  		usually guarantee a certain level of premium rates to its members. It can also  		levy surcharges on policyholders and, in some cases, on licensed insurers  		selling liability insurance, to create reserves to pay claims.</p>
<p><b>Joint and Several Liability</b> in civil litigation is a situation in  		which the concurrent acts of two or more defendants bring harm to the  		plaintiff. Such acts need not occur simultaneously, but must contribute to the  		same event. In such a case, the damages may be collected from one or more of  		the defendants. If the court does not apportion blame in specific shares, the  		damages may be collected from any and all defendants. If a defendant does not  		have the financial wherewithal to pay, the others must make up the  		difference.</p>
<p><b>Non-admitted Carriers</b>, also called <b>Surplus Line Carriers</b>,  		are commercial insurers whose nursing home liability insurance products are not  		regulated by state departments of insurance. These insurers enjoy some  		advantages over admitted carriers. They have greater flexibility in designing  		and pricing products. Because they are not subject to state regulation, they  		can also change coverage forms and application protocols more quickly. However,  		they must pay an excess and surplus lines tax that is not levied on  		admitted carriers. They cannot participate in state guaranty funds, which help  		protect policyholders in the case of insurer insolvency</p>
<p><b>Non-economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for intangible harms (e.g., pain and suffering).</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Liability Insurance</b> is indemnification of nursing  		home providers against damages for negligent care and abuse.</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Residents Rights Statutes</b> are state and  		federal laws to protect each nursing home residents civil, religious and  		human rights.</p>
<p><b>Offshore Captives</b> are captives located outside the United States.  		The most popular host states for offshore captives include Bermuda, Guernsey  		and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p><b>Premium</b> is the charge paid by a policyholder for insurance  		coverage.</p>
<p><b>Professional Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages and associated claims  		and defense expenses to a plaintiff due to a negligent act, error or omission  		in a nursing home providers rendering or failure to render professional  		services.</p>
<p><b>Punitive damages</b> in civil litigation means monetary compensation  		awarded by a judge or jury which exceeds the losses suffered by the injured  		party in order to punish the defendant.</p>
<p><b>Regulated Insurance Carriers</b> are admitted carriers (see  		definition above).</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance</b> is the practice of insurance carriers ceding risk to  		other firms, called reinsurance companies, in order to limit their liability  		exposure. Reinsurance companies essentially provide insurance to insurance  		companies. Instead of assessing the risk of individual policyholders,  		reinsurance companies assess risk on a broader scale, such as on the basis of a  		particular product-line (nursing home liability insurance) or a geographic  		region.</p>
<p>A <b>Rent-A-Captive</b> is a captive, usually formed by an insurance  		company, broker or captive manager, and rented out to users (in this case  		nursing home providers) who avoid the cost of funding their own captive. The  		user provides some form of collateral so that the rent-a-captive is not at risk  		from any underwriting loss suffered by the user.</p>
<p><b>Risk Management Programs</b> are structured approaches to  		purposefully limit liability risk. They include systematic efforts to improve  		and maintain high standards for care quality, but can also include additional  		management techniques to minimize liability exposure, such as improving written  		documentation. They are often formalized within the management structure of  		nursing home providers in the form of Risk Management Committees, and/or a  		designated Director of Risk Management along with formal Risk Management plans  		that are implemented and monitored by senior management.</p>
<p>A <b>Risk Retention Group (RRG)</b> is an insurance company that is  		owned by its members. The members of an RRG come from the same industry. For  		instance, nursing home providers can form an RRG in order to obtain nursing  		home liability coverage.</p>
<p>A <b>Settlement</b> is an agreement reached between the legal counsel of  		the plaintiff and the defendant that terminates a civil litigation before a  		verdict is reached by the court.</p>
<p><b>Tort Reform</b> generally means a movement intended to curb  		litigation and damages in the civil justice system. With respect to nursing  		home liability insurance, many states have enacted tort reform through  		legislation and it has changed the legal framework under which residents and/or  		family members can seek damages for negligent or abusive care practices. States  		also placed limits on the amount of damages that could be awarded to plaintiffs  		and/or their family members, particularly non-economic damages for pain and  		suffering. </p>
<p><b>Underwriting</b> is the process by which an insurer assesses the risk  		of insuring a particular applicant for coverage. Risk retention groups also  		underwrite by assessing the risk of accepting a prospective member.</p>
