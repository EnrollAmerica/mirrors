<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Controlling health care costs has become an enormous policy  			 challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In examining drivers behind health care costs, researchers have  			 found that individuals with chronic conditions account for a significant amount  			 of health care spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistics showing that one half of the U.S. population has at least  			 one chronic condition and represents more than 80 percent of the health care  			 spending fail to discriminate among those who place a particularly high burden  			 on the health system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chartbook examines the combination of chronic conditions and  			 functional limitations as a potentially better predictor of high health care  			 utilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with functional limitations and chronic conditions need more  			 health care services and help with activities of daily living, placing heavy  			 demands on service delivery, social supports, and public budgets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although nearly half of the persons living in the community have at  			 least one chronic condition, less than a third of those with chronic conditions  			 have any functional limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the chartbook details, the co-occurrence of chronic conditions  			 and functional limitations has wide-reaching consequences for the health care  			 system, individuals, and the economy. Providing individuals who have both  			 chronic conditions and functional limitations with delivery of effective  			 treatment and coordination across health care and social service systems may  			 offer a high yield strategy to improve lives and control spending.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Data and Definitions</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Data</b> -- The analyses rely on the 2006 Medical Expenditures  			 Panel Survey (MEPS) which represents the non-institutionalized U.S. population.  			 Having only information on the non-institutionalized is an important limitation  			 for studying chronic disease and disability spending because the nearly two  			 million nursing facility residents not included in the analysis would add close  			 to $200 billion to the $1.03 trillion represented by the population presented  			 here. Health spending includes the following services: inpatient stays,  			 physician offices or outpatient visits, emergency room visits, prescription  			 drugs, and home health care.<sup><font><a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chronic Conditions</b> -- A chronic condition lasts or is  			 expected to last 12 months or longer and either places limitations on normal  			 functioning or requires ongoing care. The analysis relied on a list of 180  			 diagnosis classifications<sup><font><a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> determined to be chronic by a panel of five  			 internists for a prior study for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  			 (AHRQ).<sup><font><a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> This analysis  			 focuses on the conditions included in the list defined by AHRQ as  			 chronic.<sup><font><a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Functional Limitations</b> -- Limitation in one or more of the  			 following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Physical activity, such as difficulty walking, bending, or  				  stooping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normal life activity, such as work, housework, or  				  school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Received assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADL):  				  bathing, eating, dressing, transferring (i.e., from bed to chair), toileting,  				  and walking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Received assistance with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living  				  (IADL): doing housework, preparing meals, taking medications, shopping,  				  telephoning, and managing money.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Top 5% of Spenders</b> -- People who had health care expenditures  			 greater than $14,600 in 2006 represented the top 5 percent of  			 spenders.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Appendix Tables</b> -- Each table in the <a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#append">Appendix</a> provides data used in developing the corresponding  		  figure or chart in this report. For example, <a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#exhibitA-3">Exhibit  		  A-3</a> provides the amounts paid for each type of service listed in the bar  		  chart <a href="individuals-living-community-chronic-conditions-and-functional-limitations-closer-look.html#exhibit3">Exhibit 3</a>.</li>

<h3>People with Chronic Conditions and Functional  		Limitations Use More Health Care Services than Those with Chronic Conditions  		Only</h3>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="exhibit1" id="exhibit1"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/70091/closerlook-exh1.JPG" alt="See Table A-1 for data used to develop this Pie Chart. Out of the 299 million individuals in the U.S. in 2006, 143 million, or 48 percent, had no chronic condition and no functional limitation. 108 million, 36 percent, had only chronic conditions and 5.5 million or 2 percent had functional limitations only. 42 million, or 14 percent, had both a chronic condition and functional limitation. Out of those with both chronic conditions and functional limitations, 14 million or 5% of the U.S. population received help with an ADL or IADL, and 28 million or 9% had other functional limitations only. Out of the $1.03 trillion spent on healthcare in 2006, $146 billion, or 14% of total spending, was spent by those with no chronic conditions and no functional limitations. $395 billion or 38% was spent by those with only chronic conditions, and $18 billion or 2% was spent by those with only functional limitations. $473 billion or 46% was spent by those with both chronic conditions and functional limitations. Out of those with both chronic conditions and functional limitations, $236 billion or 23% of all U.S. spending was spent by those who received help with an ADL or IADL, an $238 billion or 23% of spending was spent by those with other functional limitations only." /></a></div>
<ul><li>
<p>Fourteen percent of U.S. community residents had both chronic  			 conditions and functional limitations. This 14 percent accounts for 46 percent  			 of all health care spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the 42 million people with both a chronic condition and a  			 functional limitation, 14 million also received help with an ADL or IADL. This  			 14 million represents 5 percent of the population and 23 percent of all  			 spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two percent of the population report functional limitations,  			 including some receiving assistance with ADLs or IADLs, but no chronic  			 conditions. Injuries and infections account for most of the non-chronic  			 conditions among those with functional limitations only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with chronic conditions and functional limitations spent  			 three times as much as people with only chronic conditions. </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>People who did not receive assistance with ADLs or IADLs, but still  			 had some functional limitations, spent considerably more than people with  			 chronic conditions only. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>People with functional limitations and chronic conditions need more  			 health care services and help with activities of daily living, placing heavy  			 demands on service delivery, social supports, and public budgets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional limitations, ADLs, and IADLs, in combination with chronic  			 conditions, appear to serve as a more promising indicator than chronic  			 conditions alone for the small group of individuals with a heavy concentration  			 of health care spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Key Findings from this Chartbook:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>People with both chronic conditions and functional limitations  				  who received help with an ADL or IADL represented 5 percent of the population  				  and 23 percent of all spending. This group spent at least four times the  				  overall average annual health expenditures for all community  				  residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People under age 65 with chronic conditions and functional  				  limitations represent nine percent of younger adults but account for one-third  				  of health care expenditures for the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost half of older adults had chronic conditions and  				  functional limitations and accounted for over two-thirds of all health spending  				  for that age group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among those with one chronic condition, people who received help  				  with ADLs or IADLs spent almost four times what people with only one chronic  				  condition spent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those with chronic conditions and who received help with ADLs or  				  IADLs spent nearly $2,000 on home health, about 19 times the overall  				  average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with at least one chronic condition who received help  				  with ADLs or IADLs were over six times as likely to be in the top 5 percent of  				  spenders as the general population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The $493 billion spent on health care by 5 percent of the U.S.  				  population represented half of health care spending by the entire  				  community-based population in 2006 ($1 trillion). Among the top 5 percent of  				  spenders, a majority-61 percent-had a chronic condition and functional  				  limitation, which represented 64 percent of spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the top 5 percent of spenders, people with chronic  				  conditions and functional limitations spent more on prescription drugs and home  				  health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most dual eligibles had chronic conditions and functional  				  limitations, and correspondingly higher expenditures.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>The data presented here support continued study of emerging new  			 models to better manage chronic conditions and functional limitations, as well  			 as other strategies to prevent or delay functional limitation among those with  			 chronic conditions only. </p>
