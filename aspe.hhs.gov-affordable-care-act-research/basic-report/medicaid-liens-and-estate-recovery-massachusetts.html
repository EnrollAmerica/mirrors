<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Massachusetts, like many states, is contending with the dilemma of  		ever-increasing Medicaid costs in times of increased fiscal constraint. And  		like many states, Massachusetts is looking at a variety of cost-saving measures  		to contain the growth in Medicaid expenditures. Approximately one of every six  		people in Massachusetts is served by its Medicaid program,  		MassHealth,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> and  		approximately 18% of the Medicaid budget (state and Federal) is spent on  		long-term care in nursing homes,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> serving approximately 3% of MassHealth  		members.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> The  		significance of long-term care to the States Medicaid and overall budget  		creates an inherent incentive to restrain spending on these services. Liens and  		estate recoveries are among the tools the State is using to achieve this  		goal.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">

</ul></div>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>Current Medicaid regulations in Massachusetts<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> require recovery from the probate estates of  		MassHealth members who received Medicaid while age 55 or over and those who,  		regardless of age, received Medicaid while institutionalized. All MassHealth  		expenses incurred for such members, with certain exceptions<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note7">7</a></font></sup>, are counted toward the total  		recovered amount. An exception from estate recovery is made in cases where  		recovery would cause hardship,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> and only partial recovery is required from the  		estate of members who had long-term care insurance policies that met the  		Massachusetts Division of Insurance requirements.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> Estate recovery is deferred while there is a  		surviving spouse or child who is blind, permanently and totally disabled, or  		under age 21. </p>
<p>Passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA 1982)  		gave states the option of placing a TEFRA or pre-death lien on the  		real property of permanently institutionalized Medicaid recipients to prevent  		them from giving away a home in which they no longer reside before the equity  		in that home can be used to offset long-term care expenses paid on their  		behalf.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> In  		Massachusetts, TEFRA liens are referred to as living liens because  		they cannot be placed on the property of a MassHealth member once he or she has  		died. They give the State authority to recover Medicaid payments for a  		members long-term care expenses if his or her property is sold while the  		member is alive. Living liens are placed on any real property<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> that is located in  		Massachusetts in which an institutionalized member has a legal interest (i.e.,  		the applicant is the sole owner of the property, he or she owns it jointly with  		another, or he or she holds a life estate<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> in the property), with certain exceptions  		(shown below).<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Living liens are not placed on the property of  				an institutionalized MassHealth member when:</b></p>
<ul><li>The property is occupied by certain protected relatives -- a  				  spouse, a child under the age of 21, a blind or permanently disabled child of  				  any age, or a sibling with a legal interest in the property who has lived in  				  the house for at least 1 year prior to the members admission to a medical  				  institution; or </li>
<li>The institutionalized member is expected to return home within  				  6 months.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The lien gives the State authority to recover Medicaid payments that  		have been made if the property is sold while the member is alive. Only partial  		recovery is required from property owners who have long-term care insurance  		policies that meet the Massachusetts Division of Insurance requirements.  		Further, recovery is deferred during the members lifetime if a sibling or  		adult caretaker child is living in the property<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note14">14</a></font></sup>. The deferral lasts as long as these  		relatives live in the property and it ceases to apply once the member dies.  		</p>
<h2>ROLE OF THE MASSHEALTH ENROLLMENT CENTER IN THE LIVING LIEN  		PROCESS</h2>
<p>In Massachusetts, the living lien process is initiated at one of four  		regional MassHealth Enrollment Centers, which are responsible for Medicaid  		eligibility determinations. At these offices, workers who perform eligibility  		functions are assigned to teams, where they function as either  		intake or ongoing workers. Intake workers process  		applications for persons aged 65 or older and persons of any age needing  		long-term care.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note15">15</a></font></sup>  		Ongoing workers perform periodic re-determinations and case maintenance  		activities for these populations and for MassHealth members who are under 65  		and not institutionalized.</p>
<p>Most workers are college graduates who must pass a civil service  		examination as a condition of employment. They receive extensive on-the-job  		training in all facets of eligibility determination and the estate  		recovery/lien processes, as well as continuing education on new state  		regulations and procedures. Team managers evaluate the workers skills on  		an ongoing basis, and recommend remedial training whenever necessary. </p>
<p>Applicants for Medicaid services receive a package<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> containing the MassHealth  		application, the Long-Term-Care Supplement, and a comprehensive informational  		booklet that explains MassHealth eligibility rules, income and asset  		standards,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> and lien  		and estate recovery requirements. The application (which is usually completed  		by a third party -- typically an adult child or an attorney) is submitted,  		together with necessary verifications, to the enrollment center for  		processing.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<h2>INITIATING THE LIEN</h2>
<p>Intake workers are randomly assigned applications by a computerized  		program and are responsible for all activities associated with the application  		until they make a determination of eligibility. Upon receipt, they review the  		application to see if there is information requiring further verification. They  		also determine if the applicant owns any real property that may be considered a  		countable asset or on which the State may place a living lien at a later  		date.</p>
<p>If an applicant for Medicaid long-term care services owns real property,  		the intake worker must determine whether the property is the applicants  		former home and, if that is the case, whether the spouse or another protected  		relative lives there. If a protected relative lives in the home, a lien may not  		be placed against the property. At this point, or at any time while the  		applicant/member is alive, the member's ownership interest in the property may  		be transferred to that relative without penalty (i.e., the transfer will not  		adversely affect the members eligibility, and the State will be prevented  		from any future estate recovery on the property). There is, however, no  		formalized process to inform the members relatives of regulations  		governing estate recoveries in these cases.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> If the home is not occupied by a protected  		relative, workers must then determine if the applicant intends to return  		home.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<p>If the applicant indicates he or she does not intend to return home, no  		lien is placed against the property, which is then regarded as a countable  		asset for purposes of the Medicaid eligibility determination. However, its  		value is disregarded for up to 9 months, provided the applicant/member signs an  		agreement to sell the property<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note21">21</a></font></sup> for fair market value.</p>
<p>If the applicant/member indicates he or she intends to return home, and  		a protected relative does not live in the home, a form<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> is mailed to the applicants physician  		asking if there is a reasonable expectation that the applicant will return home  		within the following 6 months. If the physician answers affirmatively, no  		further action is taken at application. However, an ongoing worker will review  		the members status after 6 months and, if the member is still  		institutionalized, ask his or her physician to fill out another form that  		indicates if there is a reasonable expectation that the member will return home  		at that time. </p>
<p>If the physicians assessment is that the applicant is not expected  		to return home within 6 months, a notice<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> is mailed to the applicant that restates the  		Medicaid lien rules, regulations and exemptions, and informs him or her that a  		lien will be filed unless the determination is appealed.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> Once all other conditions of eligibility  		have been met and the application for Medicaid is approved, the MassHealth  		Lien<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> and a copy of  		the deed are sent to the Lien Coordinator at the States Estate Recovery  		Unit. </p>
<h2>THE ESTATE RECOVERY UNIT</h2>
<p>The Estate Recovery Unit (ERU) is staffed by the Center for Health Care  		Financing (CHCF), a unit within Commonwealth Medicine, a consulting division of  		the University of Massachusetts Medical School. CHCF works with state and local  		government agencies to identify ways to increase the value of healthcare  		expenditures while reducing the net cost of health care service delivery. </p>
<p>ERU staff are all professionals -- attorneys or paralegals<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> -- with backgrounds in real  		estate law, probate law, and/or Medicaid and estate planning. Staff regularly  		attend professional seminars and take courses to update their knowledge of  		current real estate and probate law.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note27">27</a></font></sup> In addition, the Estate Recovery Unit  		contributes to the training of enrollment center workers by periodically  		updating current information on the estate recovery process, while reinforcing  		workers' roles in this process.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Primary functions of the Estate Recovery  				Unit:</b></p>
<ul><li>Filing the living lien against the property of a permanently  				  institutionalized MassHealth member with the appropriate Registry of  				  Deeds;</li>
<li>Filing a Notice of Claim<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> against the probate estate of a deceased  				  MassHealth member; and</li>
<li>Recovering all monies in compliance with state and Federal  				  statutes.</li>
</ul></div>
<p> It is important to note that, although Medicaid gives states authority  		to place post-death liens, in Massachusetts a lien is only filed while the  		member is still alive. A lien is never placed on any kind of property -- real  		or personal -- once the member has died. After the member's death, the Estate  		Recovery Unit will recover MassHealth costs from the member's probate estate. A  		probate estate includes property that a person possesses at the time of death  		and that descends to the heirs (with or without a will) subject to the payment  		of debts and claims. The probate estate may include real property on which a  		living lien was filed. However, the lien is no longer valid after the member's  		death and must be released upon the request of the administrator/executor. </p>
<h2>ROLE OF THE ESTATE RECOVERY UNIT LIEN COORDINATOR</h2>
<p>After intake workers at the enrollment center determine that an  		applicant/member owns property subject to placement of a living lien, they send  		the lien and the deed to the Lien Coordinator of the Estate Recovery Unit, who  		is responsible for filing all living liens at the appropriate Registry of  		Deeds.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> The lien is  		recorded in the county and district where the real estate is located. In FY  		2003 (July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003), 665 living liens were filed.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> During that same time period,  		applications for MassHealth were approved for approximately 6,500  		institutionalized persons.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note31">31</a></font></sup> If a deed is not attached to the MassHealth  		Lien,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> the Lien  		Coordinator will attempt to access the deed on the website of the Registry of  		Deeds and verify the accuracy of the information (spelling of name as recorded  		on the lien, address, deed book and page number, etc.). The Lien Coordinator  		then waits at least 30 days before taking further action to allow the member  		(or members family) to appeal the intent to place a lien. If the action  		is appealed, the Lien Coordinator will wait until notified of the appeal  		decision by the Board of Hearings.</p>
<p>When the 30 days have passed, the Lien Coordinator will verify that the  		real estate has not been transferred<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> and the member has not died before recording  		the lien at the Registry of Deeds. Once the lien is filed, the Lien Coordinator  		enters the case on the ERU database with a status of open lien  		inactive. The Lien Coordinator also follows up with the Registry of Deeds  		on-line to ensure that the lien has been properly and accurately recorded  		(faulty recording can prevent recovery at a later date). Presence of the lien  		will prevent sale or transfer of the property until the Medicaid claim is  		either paid or the lien is released without payment. After the living lien is  		properly recorded, no further action is necessary until there is a need to  		release the lien. The release may or may not trigger recovery actions,  		depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h2>RELEASING THE LIVING LIEN WITHOUT RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Although living liens may be released without recovering MassHealth  		costs paid on the members behalf, the number of actual releases has been  		negligible, with only 13 liens released in FY 2003.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> There are four instances in  		which the living lien may be released. The reasons for release and number of  		occurrences in FY 2003 are as follows:</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>A living lien is released without recovery  				if:</b></p>
<ul><li>The MassHealth member returned to the home against which the  				  lien had been filed -- 2 occurrences;</li>
<li>The property is permissibly transferred -- 5  				  occurrences;<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></li>
<li>The lien was placed in error -- 6 occurrences; or</li>
<li>New information is provided that an exempting relative resided  				  in the property -- 0 occurrences.</li>
</ul></div>
<p> Massachusetts regulations require long-term care facilities to send a  		written notice<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note36">36</a></font></sup> to the  		Enrollment Center when a member is discharged from the facility for any reason.  		If the centers ongoing workers learn of any other changes in the  		circumstances of a member from his or her family that might impact an existing  		lien, they will request whatever supporting documentation is needed to confirm  		the changed circumstances. Usually this consists of verifying the family  		relationship of an exempting relative or the duration of residence in the  		members home.</p>
<p>Having received verification of the members changed circumstances,  		the ongoing worker completes an Authorization to Release a MassHealth  		Lien<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note37">37</a></font></sup> and sends the  		form and applicable verifications to the ERU Lien Coordinator. In the case of a  		permissible transfer of property, the ongoing worker will also send a doctor's  		note (if applicable), proof of residency, and a copy of the recorded  		transferred deed. The Lien Coordinator then releases the lien from the property  		at the Registry of Deeds and updates the ERU database to indicate that the lien  		has been released. A copy of the release is forwarded to the Enrollment Center.  		Although no recovery is made at this point, the estate may still be subject to  		recovery at the time of the members death. </p>
<h2>RELEASING THE LIVING LIEN WITH RECOVERY DURING THE MEMBERS  		LIFETIME</h2>
<p>There are two circumstances under which a living lien is released  		following recovery of the Medicaid claim -- when the property is sold or  		transferred, or the property is refinanced. Both of these occur while the  		member is still alive. </p>
<p>The Estate Recovery Unit is contacted, usually by an attorney, when a  		potential buyer or mortgagor discovers a Medicaid lien on a property during the  		title search. ERU staff then order a medical billing history report from the  		State's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). All MassHealth expenses  		incurred after April 1, 1995, with certain exceptions,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note38">38</a></font></sup> are counted toward the total claim. If the  		member has long-term care insurance, indicated by a code on the MMIS Third  		Party Liability screen, long-term care services are also subtracted when  		calculating the total claim amount. The attorney is asked to provide  		information on the current assessed value<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note39">39</a></font></sup> of the property and is informed as to the  		amount of the claim. </p>
<p>At a real estate closing, the amount of the lien is indicated on the HUD  		Settlement Statement. It must be paid as a condition of sale or transfer. If  		the lien amount is greater than the sale amount, a reduced amount will be  		accepted to satisfy the lien. The order of payment of debt is established under  		Massachusetts General Laws.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note40">40</a></font></sup> Mortgages, taxes, amounts due to public  		utilities, and child support arrears are paid before the Commonwealths  		lien and may further reduce the amount that is actually recovered.</p>
<p>Massachusetts uses the living lien to prevent MassHealth members from  		giving away the home in which they no longer reside before its equity can be  		used to offset long-term care expenses paid on their behalf. The number of  		liens released with recovery represents only a small amount of total dollars  		recovered and claims settled in FY 2003. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Recovery from Living Liens in FY  				2003:</b><sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>Recoveries from transfer or sale of property during members'  				  lifetimes = $2,900,000 (approximately 10% of total dollars recovered from both  				  living liens and probate estates)</li>
<li>Total number of liens on file with Registries of Deeds = 2338  				  (approximately 7% of the MassHealth Long-Term-Care population)</li>
<li>Number of liens released with recovery = 80</li>
<li>Average amount of recovery = $32,500</li>
<li>Claim values = $340-$140,983</li>
</ul></div>
<p> The lien is released when the Estate Recovery Unit receives a  		settlement check. The Estate Recovery Unit then forwards a copy of the release,  		the check, and the HUD statement to the Enrollment Center, where the  		members eligibility may be re-determined based on any net proceeds that  		may have been received from the sale of the property after satisfying all other  		claims.</p>
<h2>MEDICAID ESTATE RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Estate Recovery Unit may learn of a members death informally  		-- i.e., they may be contacted by the decedents family, nursing home, or  		Enrollment Center. Formally, Massachusetts law<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note42">42</a></font></sup> requires that a copy of any petition for  		admission to probate of a decedent's will or for administration of a  		decedents estate be provided to the Estate Recovery Unit, along with a  		copy of the death certificate, whether or not the decedent was a MassHealth  		member. </p>
<p>Upon notification of a persons death, the Estate Recovery Unit  		screens MMIS data to determine if the decedent was a MassHealth member. If so,  		a case is created in the ERU database and a claim will be made against the  		members probate estate to recover the amount of payment for medical  		benefits correctly paid under the following conditions:</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>The Estate Recovery Unit processes claims to  				recover for services provided:</b></p>
<ul><li>On or after the members 65th birthday;</li>
<li>On or after October 1, 1993 while the member was aged 55 or  				  older; and </li>
<li>If the member (regardless of age) was permanently  				  institutionalized on or after March 22, 1991.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The Estate Recovery Unit files a Notice of Claim<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> with the Probate Court, and a copy of the  		claim is sent to the administrator or executor of the probate estate with a  		cover letter<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note44">44</a></font></sup> that  		outlines the laws governing estate recovery and the exceptions to recovery. The  		Estate Recovery Unit is legally bound to communicate only with the  		administrator/executor or estate attorney unless given permission by them to  		communicate with someone else. The administrator/executor has 60 days from the  		date the notice of claim was filed in the probate court to object to the  		validity of the claim or request a waiver or deferral of the claim (as shown  		below). </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>During the 60-day period:</b></p>
<ul><li>The claim may be reduced or discharged entirely due to an  				  objection to its validity.</li>
<li>A deferral may be granted if there is a surviving spouse or  				  dependent relative -- i.e., a child who is blind, permanently and totally  				  disabled, or under 21 years of age. (The estate is given the opportunity to  				  settle when the deferral is granted, but is not in any way coerced to do so.)  				  The deferral will last until the death of the spouse or loss of exempt status  				  of the dependent relative.</li>
<li>A waiver may be granted if hardship is established.  				  Documentation must be provided to demonstrate that all of the hardship waiver  				  requirements<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note45">45</a></font></sup> have  				  been met. If review by the Estate Recovery Unit indicates that these waiver  				  requirements continue to be met during the following 2-year period, recovery is  				  then permanently waived.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>In FY 2003, approximately 10% of initiated claims were subsequently  		contested during the 60-day period. The actual numbers are as follows:</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Claims that were adjusted, waived or deferred in  				FY 2003:</b><sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note46">46</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>Number of claims initiated = 1703 (703 of which included real  				  property)</li>
<li>Number of claims contested = 170</li>
<li>Number of claims reduced as a result of being contested = 30  				  (partial recovery only)</li>
<li>Number of claims discharged in full as a result of being  				  contested = 0</li>
<li>Number of hardship waiver requests = 70</li>
<li>Number of hardship waivers granted = 41</li>
<li>Number of deferred claims = 20</li>
</ul></div>
<p> If the validity of the claim is contested or there is a request for a  		waiver or deferral and satisfactory documentation is not provided to enable  		MassHealth to resolve the issue during that timeframe, the case is referred to  		the MassHealth Legal Division for resolution and, if necessary, court action to  		protect the claim. </p>
<p>If the claim is not contested during the 60-day period (i.e., the claim  		is valid and no request is made to object to the validity of the claim, waive  		or defer recovery), the actual collection process is initiated, and payment is  		expected in full. If appropriate documentation is provided to prove that the  		estate contains insufficient assets to pay the claim in full, the Estate  		Recovery Unit will accept less than the full claim amount. In such cases the  		Estate Recovery Unit will request asset information to determine the value of  		all the assets owned by the decedent. </p>
<p>There are two types of property in probate estates -- real property and  		personal property, the value of which is found on the Probate Inventory filed  		at the court. If the estate includes real property, the fair market value of  		the property must be established. The estate administrator/executor may do so  		by submitting copies of the current tax bill or most recent tax assessment  		showing the assessed value of the property and a written appraisal of the fair  		market value of the value from a knowledgeable source, such as a real estate  		broker, certified appraiser, or official from a bank or savings and loan  		association. </p>
<p>Once the total value of the real estate and other property has been  		established, all allowable expenses are deducted from that amount and the  		remainder must be paid to the Commonwealth. In FY 2003, $25,937,456 was  		recovered from the probate estates of MassHealth members. As in the case of  		living liens, the order of payment of debt is established under Massachusetts  		General Laws.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note47">47</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Upon payment, both the claim and any living lien that had been placed on  		the members real property are released. If there was a living lien on the  		member's real property, the Estate Recovery Unit must release it after they  		have received notification of the member's death and a copy of the death  		certificate<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note48">48</a></font></sup>.  		Generally the lien and the Notice of Claim are released at the same time. If an  		attorney representing the members estate requests release of the lien  		prior to settlement of the estate, the Estate Recovery Unit releases it, since  		a living lien is no longer valid when the member is deceased. However, in the  		absence of such a request, the lien is not released until the Estate Recovery  		Unit determines whether the members estate will be probated. If the  		estate is not probated within 1 year after the members death, the Estate  		Recovery Unit will forward a request to probate the estate to the Public  		Administrator in the county where the deceased member lived. </p>
<p>Interest on the claim begins to accrue 6 months after the appointment of  		the estate administrator/executor at a rate of 12% per annum. On rare  		occasions, if the estate administrator/executor still refuses to settle the  		claim, the Estate Recovery Unit may file a motion in court to compel payment.  		</p>
<h2>CLAIMS PROCEEDS AND COLLECTIONS</h2>
<p>Having adopted a Medicaid estate recovery program in 1969, Massachusetts  		has had ample opportunity to refine and streamline its decision-making and  		administrative processes. All recoveries are treated equally, and priority is  		not established based on the size of the claim. Up to $70 million in combined  		proceeds from estate recovery, casualty recovery, provider recovery, and drug  		rebate programs is deposited in the State's retained revenue account and is  		used to offset Medicaid costs. Proceeds in excess of the $70 million are  		deposited in the State's General Fund and are not designated specifically to  		offset Medicaid costs.</p>
<p>Massachusetts estate recovery amounts have increased every year since  		1999, and have ranged from $22,910,573 million in FY 1999 to $28,837,456 in FY  		2003.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note49">49</a></font></sup> These amounts  		represent total claims from both estate recoveries and living liens. In FY  		2003, Massachusetts was only surpassed in total collection amounts by the  		demographically larger states of California and Ohio.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note50">50</a></font></sup> While impressive, this figure is modest when  		compared to the total MassHealth nursing home expenditures during the same year  		 $1,415,305,950 (Federal and state dollars).<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Of the $28.8 million collected in 2003, $26 million (over 90%) was  		recovered from real property, although only about 41% of the total number of  		probate claims processed included real property.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note52">52</a></font></sup> This supports the contention that the home  		represents a Medicaid recipients most significant remaining asset. </p>
<h2>PROPOSED CHANGES TO MASSACHUSETTS LAW</h2>
<p>Since July 2003 Massachusetts has debated proposed changes to its  		Medicaid estate recovery laws and eligibility rules for institutionalized  		persons. The first change would allow recovery from both probate and  		non-probate estates of MassHealth members. The second would allow  		implementation of an 1115 waiver proposal that would make it more difficult for  		individuals to qualify for Medicaid after transferring assets.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note53">53</a></font></sup> Both proposals have been  		endorsed by the State's Republican Governor, Mitt Romney, who views them as a  		way to recover Medicaid dollars spent on behalf of MassHealth members at a time  		when the States rising Medicaid costs dictate the need for cutbacks in  		existing programs. However, the proposals have met opposition from the largely  		Democratic legislature,<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note54">54</a></font></sup> whose members have been deluged with the  		concerns of their constituents.</p>
<h2>EXPANDED ESTATE RECOVERY</h2>
<p>In July 2003, the state adopted legislation<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note55">55</a></font></sup> that expanded its estate recovery program to  		recover not only from assets that pass through a members probate estate,  		but also from a members interest, immediately prior to death, in assets  		that pass outside of his or her probate estate.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note56">56</a></font></sup></p>
<p>MassHealth officials explained that this change would level the playing  		field for all members, regardless of whether or not they had taken steps to  		circumvent estate recovery by changing or modifying the ownership of their  		property. Advocates countered that the change might cause financial devastation  		of surviving spouses by preventing them from acquiring a loan to pay for  		necessary repairs to their home and/or making future sale of the property  		difficult. In response to these concerns, the Estate Recovery Unit has  		reiterated its policy not to attempt recovery from any portion of a  		members estate owned by a surviving spouse or impede refinancing of the  		members real property during the lifetime of a surviving  		spouse.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p>New estate recovery regulations were promulgated in November 2003, and  		the State initiated recoveries from non-probate estates under the new rules  		until March 2004, at which time the legislature voted to delay enactment of the  		controversial law until July 1, 2004. In response to the March vote, the Estate  		Recovery Unit was forced to notify representatives for affected estates of the  		change, and to refund any monies collected from non-probate estates. </p>
<p>Legislation subsequently submitted to repeal the expanded estate  		recovery provision was vetoed by the governor. On July 23, 2004, the  		legislature overrode the governors veto and amended Massachusetts General  		Laws<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note58">58</a></font></sup> to restore the  		original prohibition against recovery outside of probate. Unless the political  		makeup of the legislature is substantially changed and the concerns of  		advocates are alleviated, it is unlikely that Massachusetts will succeed in  		expanding its estate recovery program to include recovery from non-probate  		estates.</p>
<h2>MASSACHUSETTS SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION WAIVER</h2>
<p>Current Federal and state eligibility regulations impose a penalty on  		persons applying for long-term care services if they transferred assets for  		less than fair market value within a specified look-back period. In  		August 2003, MassHealth submitted a section 1115 waiver proposal<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note59">59</a></font></sup> to the Secretary of Health and Human  		Services to change Medicaid eligibility rules for institutionalized persons by  		extending the look-back period for homes and trusts and changing the penalty  		period start date.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-liens-and-estate-recovery-massachusetts.html#note60">60</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Legislation has been adopted to allow MassHealth to submit the waiver  		proposal which, as of this writing, is still pending with Health and Human  		Services. However, as in the case of the estate recovery legislation, it can  		still be amended or rejected by the legislature in response to constituents'  		concerns. </p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts lien and estate recovery processes are sophisticated  		ones that are implemented by a staff of legal professionals. They are supported  		by state laws and regulations that delineate in detail both the rights and  		responsibilities of MassHealth and those MassHealth members whose real property  		is subject to a living lien and/or a claim in their estate. State law requires  		that MassHealth be notified of all petitions for admission to probate. However,  		MassHealth must send written notice to survivors of their rights to dispute a  		Medicaid claim or request that recovery be waived or deferred. MassHealth must  		also send written notification to members whenever the living lien process is  		initiated. Protections are afforded MassHealth by the order of payment of debt,  		ensuring its rights to recover from members who sell their property and from  		the probate estate of deceased members. This same hierarchy of payment likewise  		protects members and estates by ensuring that other debts, such as mortgages,  		are paid before MassHealth may collect on its claim. This protection is also  		given to living members whose homes have been liened </p>
<p>Despite their long history in the Massachusetts Medicaid program and  		protections afforded to MassHealth members by state regulations, liens and  		estate recovery remain controversial. They go to the heart of the fundamental  		and much debated question of how much should individuals be expected to pay for  		their own long-term care and how much should be financed by the taxpaying  		public. </p>

See Massachusetts regulations at 130CMR 520.016 for  			 personal needs and other deductions and 130CMR 520.005(A) and 520.016(B)(2) for  			 asset allowances at:  			 <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/masshealth/regs_member/regs_memb_520.pdf">http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/masshealth/regs_member/regs_memb_520.pdf</a>.</p>

<p><a name="note18" id="note18">Massachusetts</a> does not have a face-to-face  			 interview requirement, so the vast majority of applications are submitted by  			 mail. Intake workers attribute this to one or both of the following: 1) the  			 fact that there are only four regional Enrollment Centers in the State, which  			 necessitates a lengthy commute for many, and 2) most applicants have already  			 received information about Medicaid eligibility requirements and the MassHealth  			 application process from a hospital social worker, community advocate, Medicaid  			 consultant, or attorney. This advice, along with the information contained in  			 the MassHealth booklet and accessibility to intake workers by phone, gives the  			 applicant sufficient information to apply for Medicaid by mail and eliminates  			 the need to travel to an office to apply in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note19" id="note19">Anecdotal</a> information from intake workers  			 indicates that their perception of their job description is to determine an  			 applicants eligibility for MassHealth, not to advise applicants on how to  			 circumvent estate recovery. They will, however, explain the transfer rules and  			 regulations to persons who ask about them.</p>

<p><a name="note20" id="note20">The</a> <i>Long-Term-Care Supplement</i> asks if  			 the applicant intends to return home and explains that the home will be treated  			 as a countable asset if he or she does not intend to return home. If the  			 question is not answered, the applicant is asked to fill out a <i>Statement of  			 Intent to Return Home</i> (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/MAliensA.pdf">Appendix</a>), which again  			 asks about the applicants intent. According to eligibility workers, some  			 applicants owning homes and not having at-home spouses indicate they have no  			 intention of returning home and prefer to sell the home rather than retain and  			 maintain it. This is attributed to the burden imposed on adult children who  			 must use their own money for taxes, insurance, utilities, and home  			 maintenance.</p>
