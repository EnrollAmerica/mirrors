<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Individuals with disabilities of all ages have greater access to  		publicly-funded, self-directed home and community-based services and supports  		than ever before (Flanagan, 2001). Some self-directed support service programs  		offer service recipients the option of being the common law (e.g., household)  		employer of their personal assistance service (PAS) workers. However, with  		greater choice and control come individual responsibilities and risk of  		liability. One possible risk of liability is associated with a PAS worker being  		injured on the job. One way publicly-funded self-directed support service  		programs can reduce the risk of liability for workplace injury for themselves  		and service recipients who are common law employers of PAS workers is by  		arranging and paying for workers compensation insurance.</p>
<p>Workers compensation in the United States is essentially a  		combined government and private no-fault, social insurance program,  		mandated by state or territorial law, administered by one or more state or  		territorial agencies and paid for entirely by employers. It provides medical,  		disability and other benefits (e.g., death and burial) for most workers whose  		injuries and illnesses arise out of and in the course of employment  		(Lencsis, 1998).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>All 50 states, the District of Columbia and the five territories have  		enacted workers compensation insurance laws and administer systems. These  		laws and systems are specific to each state and territory and can be complex to  		understand and administer. A basic objective of workers compensation is  		that coverage under the law should be virtually, if not completely, universal.  		In most states, coverage is compulsory for employers with penalties for those  		who do not comply. However, for various historical, political, economic and  		administrative reasons, no state law covers all forms of employment. The most  		common classes of exempt employees are casual workers who work only  		occasionally or intermittently for a given employer such as domestic servants  		(U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2002).</p>
<p>Many states and territories, at least informally, include PAS workers  		under the domestic service employment classification for workers  		compensation purposes. However, the majority of state and territory  		workers compensation agency staff report that the final determination of  		whether a service recipients PAS worker falls into the domestic service  		classification in a jurisdiction is often made by an administrative law judge  		when a workers compensation claim is disputed. Thus, public programs  		administering self-directed support service programs and service recipients  		enrolled in these programs face great uncertainty when trying to assess the  		obligation to provide workers compensation insurance coverage for PAS  		workers who work for service recipients in and around their homes.</p>
<p>This report focuses on workers compensation laws and systems as  		they pertain to domestic service workers, and in particular, PAS workers in 50  		states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories and one tribal  		government<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> and  		addresses the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>How do workers compensation programs work?</li>
<li>What states and territories afford individuals with disabilities who  		  are household employers the opportunity to purchase workers compensation  		  insurance coverage for their domestic service workers, and in particular for  		  PAS workers?</li>
<li>How accessible is workers compensation insurance coverage for  		  household employers who hire domestic service, and in particular, PAS workers  		  directly?</li>
<li>How does the cost of workers compensation insurance premiums  		  vary for household employers hiring domestic service/PAS workers across  		  jurisdictions and markets?</li>
<li>What issues and challenges have been reported by state workers  		  compensation agency staff and insurance carriers regarding the administration  		  of the workers compensation systems and the provision of insurance for  		  domestic service and PAS workers?</li>
<li>What promising practices have been implemented by jurisdictions to  		  facilitate public programs arranging and paying for workers compensation  		  insurance for service recipients who hire domestic service/PAS workers, thereby  		  reducing the risk of liability related to workplace injury for state program  		  agencies and service recipients?</li>
</ul><p>Workers compensation laws and regulations, program material and  		related literature and published reports pertaining to domestic service, and in  		particular to personal assistance, were reviewed for each of the 57  		jurisdictions. In addition, follow-up calls were conducted with key state and  		territorial worker compensation agency, insurance company and agent staff  		as needed to obtain information not readily available in the secondary  		information reviewed.</p>
<p>Key study findings include:</p>
<ul><li>All 50 states and five U.S. territories have enacted workers  		  compensation laws and administer systems, however, they are specific to each  		  jurisdiction and can be complex.</li>
<li>Twenty-five states and two U.S. territories completely exempt and 22  		  states, the District of Columbia and two territories partially exempt domestic  		  service workers from their workers compensation laws.</li>
<li>All jurisdictions, except for Wyoming, allow household employers to  		  elect coverage for domestic service workers who are exempt from workers  		  compensation laws.</li>
<li>The majority of jurisdictions workers compensation laws  		  and employment classification codes do not clearly define domestic service or  		  reference PAS workers in the definition.</li>
<li>The majority of jurisdictions reported that PAS workers fall under  		  the domestic service employment classification for workers compensation  		  purposes.</li>
<li>The majority of jurisdictions also reported that the final  		  determination of whether a service recipients PAS worker falls into the  		  domestic service classification is often made by an administrative law judge  		  when a workers compensation claim is disputed. </li>
<li>Publicly-funded self-directed support service programs and service  		  recipients who are the common law employers of their PAS workers face great  		  uncertainty when trying to assess the obligation to provide workers  		  compensation insurance coverage for PAS workers. </li>
<li>Publicly-funded self-directed support service programs can  		  reduce/eliminate the risk of liability for workplace injury for themselves and  		  service recipients who are the common law employers of their PAS workers and  		  the uncertainty regarding coverage by arranging and paying for workers  		  compensation insurance.</li>
<li>In the majority of jurisdictions, access to workers  		  compensation insurance through the voluntary insurance market is extremely  		  limited for publicly-funded self-directed support service programs and service  		  recipients (e.g., household employers), and in some jurisdictions it is  		  non-existent. This is due in part to insurance agents and carriers  		  having little incentive to broker/write policies for household employers due to  		  small fees/premiums, significant administrative burden and costs and the  		  perceived high risk of domestic service and PAS worker injury.</li>
<li>Workers compensation claims experience for the Massachusetts  		  Medicaid Personal Care Attendant Program and the New Jersey Personal Preference  		  Program have challenged widely held assumptions regarding the perceived high  		  risk of domestic service and PAS worker injury over the past three years.</li>
<li>Household employers access to workers compensation  		  insurance typically is greater through exclusive or competitive State Insurance  		  Funds or through residual insurance markets (e.g., jurisdictions Assigned  		  Risk Plans or Insurers of Last Resort).</li>
<li>Eighteen states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories  		  offer household employers the opportunity to purchase a workers  		  compensation insurance rider on a conventional homeowners and  		  tenants insurance policy for occasional domestic service workers with at  		  least three states reporting that the option is mandated by law. However, there  		  is a concern that filing a claim for workers compensation through a  		  homeowners insurance policy could jeopardize the status of the household  		  employers homeowners insurance policy (e.g., could be cancelled)  		  and thus jeopardize their mortgage which may have homeowners insurance as  		  a requirement. </li>
<li>The cost of workers compensation insurance varies significantly  		  by jurisdiction, with the residual insurance market premiums, in general, being  		  the most costly. This insurance market is often the only option for household  		  employers to purchase workers compensation insurance for their domestic  		  service (e.g., PAS) workers.</li>
<li>The most frequently reported issues/challenges reported by  		  jurisdictions workers compensation agency staff regarding the  		  administration of workers compensation systems and providing insurance  		  for domestic service and PAS workers included:
<ul><li>Difficulty classifying PAS workers for workers compensation  				purposes (e.g., are they under domestic service or not; if not, what  				classification are they in?),</li>
<li>Limited access to the voluntary workers compensation  				insurance market for household employers,</li>
<li>Premiums for domestic service workers tend to be low and often do  				not cover the cost of losses incurred,</li>
<li>Workers compensation agency staff reported they do not many  				policies or claims related to domestic service so are not knowledgeable  				regarding the issues (e.g., PAS) and often do not have good premium and claims  				data to make policy with, and </li>
<li>In many jurisdictions, workers compensation insurance  				premiums have gone up for all employers including household employers.</li>
</ul></li>

This clarifies the classification  			 for PAS in the state workers compensation law for household  			 employers, PAS workers, publicly-funded self-directed support service programs  			 and workers compensation hearing officers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Including PAS In The Employment Classification For Domestic  			 Service -- North Dakota</b></p>
<p>North Dakota includes the term personal assistance in its employment  			 classification under domestic service for workers compensation purposes  			 as those individuals performing home help services or providing personal  			 assistance or home care for persons who are convalescent, aged or acutely or  			 chronically ill or disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Developing An Employment Classification For PAS Under Domestic  			 Service -- Massachusetts</b></p>
<p>Massachusetts has developed an employment classification code,  			 specifically for PAS workers (0918, Domestic Service, Inside, Physical  			 Assistance) that clearly describes the tasks performed while keeping the  			 classification under domestic service. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Developing A Workers Compensation Program Specifically For  			 Domestic Service -- Pennsylvania</b></p>
<p>Pennsylvanias State Workmens Insurance Fund (SWIF) has a  			 program and a workers compensation insurance policy (Domestic Service  			 Exemption Policy) that is specific to household employers who employ domestic  			 service workers to work in and around their homes. It also has a designated  			 staff who is well trained and knowledgeable regarding domestic service issues  			 and SWIF policies and procedures. The application process has been streamlined  			 and staff is easy to access for assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Accessing Workers Compensation Insurance Through The  			 Voluntary Insurance Market -- Massachusetts</b></p>
<p>Massachusetts has successfully recruited an insurance agent and a  			 voluntary insurance carrier to broker and write insurance policies for over  			 9,000 persons with disabilities enrolled in the States Medicaid Personal  			 Attendant Care Program rather than purchasing policies from the residual  			 insurance market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Accessing Workers Compensation Insurance Through The  			 Residual Market -- Arizona and New Mexico</b></p>
<p>Arizona and New Mexico both have residual insurance markets that  			 consist of both insurers/markets of last resort and Assigned Risk  			 Plans. Having both options appear to increase small and moderate sized  			 employers access to workers compensation insurance at more competitive  			 prices. This approach has the potential of providing increased access to  			 household employers who wish to purchase workers compensation insurance  			 for their in-home domestic service workers including personal assistance  			 workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Accessing Workers Compensation Insurance For Domestic  			 Service Through Homeowners And Tenants Insurance Policies -- New  			 Jersey</b></p>
<p>New Jersey provides the most comprehensive system for accessing  			 workers compensation insurance through homeowners and tenants  			 insurance by requiring all homeowners and tenants insurance  			 policies to include an endorsement for workers compensation insurance for  			 occasional domestic service workers. Homeowners and tenants can then purchase  			 an endorsement for full-time domestic service workers. Workers  			 compensation service endorsements for domestic service are available in both  			 the voluntary and residual insurance markets in New Jersey. One concern  			 regarding household employers accessing workers compensation insurance  			 coverage through homeowners insurance policies is that a workers  			 compensation claim could cause the insurance carrier to either significantly  			 raise the household employers homeowners insurance premium or  			 cancel the homeowners insurance policy, which often is a requirement for  			 a mortgage. New Jersey covers this issue by providing workers  			 compensation insurance coverage for occasional and full-time workers in both  			 the voluntary and residual insurance markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rate And Premium Setting Methods -- Massachusetts, Maryland and  			 Washington State</b></p>
<p>Massachusetts and Maryland use the per $100 payroll and  			 per household policy method to compute workers compensation  			 insurance rates and premiums, respectively. These methods reduce the level of  			 administrative burden for the household employer, his or her Fiscal/Employer  			 Agent and the insurer, particularly when the household employer hires multiple  			 PAS workers.</p>
<p>Washington State uses the per hour and per  			 household method to compute workers compensation insurance rates  			 and premiums, respectively. The per hour method more accurately  			 measures the risk of workplace exposure for multiple workers. However, to work  			 effectively, good time reporting must be available for all workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Using Minimum Premium Data To Develop Benchmarks For  			 Workers Compensation Premiums -- New Jersey, Idaho And Maryland</b></p>
<p>The minimum premium data presented in <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>,  			 <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a>, and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a> demonstrates  			 the variability of workers compensation insurance rates by market and  			 jurisdiction for similar employment classifications (e.g., domestic service).  			 Jurisdictions can use this information to develop benchmarks to compare their  			 workers compensation premiums and learn from other states  			 experience. For example, the jurisdiction that has the lowest actual premiums  			 for a standard domestic service workers compensation insurance policy  			 from the voluntary and residual insurance markets is New Jersey. The actual  			 premium for a standard workers compensation insurance policy for all  			 occasional domestic service workers in a household is $16.00/household/year.  			 The actual premium for a standard workers compensation insurance policy  			 for a full-time domestic service worker is $76.00/year for the first worker and  			 an additional $60/year for each additional full-time worker hired. Under the  			 homeowners or tenants insurance workers compensation  			 endorsement the premium is $1.00/policy/year for all occasional domestic  			 service workers working in the home and $61/year for the first full-time worker  			 and $60/year for each additional full-time worker working in the home. The  			 premiums for the standard workers compensation insurance policy and the  			 homeowners/tenants workers compensation endorsement for  			 domestic service are the same for both the voluntary and residual insurance  			 markets. </p>
<p>Idaho and Maryland also offer low minimum premiums through a State  			 Insurance Fund (e.g., $150 per capita for 0908-occasional and $175.00 per  			 capita for 0913 -- full-time and $175 per household policy for 0913 -- part or  			 full-time, respectively (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>). However,  			 Idahos minimum premiums for the residual insurance market are almost  			 twice as much as the State Insurance Fund, whereas Marylands minimum  			 premiums are the same in the State Insurance Fund as they are in the residual  			 insurance market (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>).</p>

<li>
<p><b>Using Fiscal/Employer Agents To Facilitate Purchasing  			 Workers Compensation Insurance, And Invoicing and Processing Claims --  			 Massachusetts, New Jersey And Pennsylvania</b></p>
<p>In Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Fiscal/Employer  			 Agents participating in the State s self-directed support service program  			 (e.g., MA Personal Attendant Care Program, NJ Personal Preference Program, and  			 PA Attendant Care Program) will not process a payroll check for a worker unless  			 the service recipient has a current workers compensation policy for his  			 or her PAS worker(s). Thus, the Fiscal/Employer Agent ensures the  			 publicly-funded self-directed support service program that workers  			 compensation insurance coverage has been obtained for all service recipients  			 and renewed annually.</p>
<p>In each state, the Fiscal/Employer Agent(s) is the key contact that  			 communicates with either the insurance agent, or the voluntary insurance  			 carrier/State Insurance Fund/residual market administrator or both making sure  			 initial policies are implemented and that policies are renewed in a timely  			 manner. In addition, each states Fiscal/Employer Agent(s) is responsible  			 for completing the Wage Statement Form that the insurer needs to accurately  			 compute a benefit for an injured worker.</p>
<p>In all three states, the Fiscal/Employer Agent(s) is responsible for  			 paying the service recipients workers compensation premiums out of  			 their public benefit. In Massachusetts, the insurer bulk invoices the four  			 Fiscal/Employer Agents for the service recipients they represent, reducing the  			 insurers invoicing efforts from 10,000 to four invoices per  			 year.</p>

<p><b>Allowing Household Employers To Elect Workers Compensation  			 Insurance Coverage For Family Members Who Are Paid Domestic Service Workers,  			 Including PAS Workers -- Hawaii </b></p>
<p>Many states workers compensation laws are silent on  			 whether family members who are paid domestic service workers, including PAS  			 workers, may be considered covered workers. For the purpose of this study it  			 was determined that these states allowed household employers to elect  			 workers compensation insurance coverage for family members who are paid  			 domestic service workers including PAS workers.</p>
<p>Hawaii exempts family members who provide paid domestic services,  			 including personal assistance services from its workers compensation law,  			 but allows household employers to elect coverage for these workers. States  			 should consider clarifying their workers compensation laws to allow  			 household employers to elect workers compensation insurance coverage for  			 family members who are paid domestic service workers including PAS  			 workers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="sectionI" id="sectionI">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Over the past decade, individuals with disabilities and chronic  		conditions have had greater access to publicly-funded, self-directed home and  		community-based services and supports than ever before (Flanagan, 2001). Under  		the self-directed service delivery model, individuals have increased choice and  		control over the services they receive and the individuals who provide them. In  		some cases, service recipients have the option of being the common law  		(household) employer of their PAS workers and managing many, if not all, of the  		employer-related responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, with greater choice and control come individual  		responsibilities and risk of liability, particularly when the service recipient  		is the common law (household) employer of his or her PAS worker. One possible  		risk of liability is associated with a PAS worker being injured on the job. One  		way public programs can reduce the risk of liability for workplace injury for  		themselves and service recipients who are household employers of PAS workers is  		by arranging and paying for workers compensation insurance.</p>
<p>Workers compensation in the United States is a combination  		government and private no-fault, social insurance<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> program that provides medical,  		disability and other benefits (e.g., death and burial) for most workers whose  		injuries and illnesses arise out of and in the course of employment  		(Lencsis, 1998). All 50 states, the District of Columbia and the five U.S.  		territories have enacted workers compensation laws and administer  		systems, however, they are specific to each jurisdiction and can be complex to  		understand and administer (U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2002). </p>
<p>A basic objective of workers compensation is that coverage under  		the law should be virtually, if not completely, universal. In most states,  		coverage is compulsory for employers with penalties for those who do not  		comply. However, for various historical, political, economic and administrative  		reasons, no state law covers all forms of employment (U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  		2002).</p>
<p>Whether non-business employment (e.g., domestic service) should be  		covered for workers compensation is a subject for debate. From a social  		policy perspective it has been argued that the ultimate goal of workers  		compensation should be protection for all employees since the losses due to  		injury for a non-business or domestic worker is no less serious that for an  		industrial worker. Others argue that workers compensation insurance is a  		business expense and as such, the cost of insurance should be  		passed along to the customer in the price of the product. In the case of  		non-business or domestic service, the workers employment is not in  		the course of the trade, business, profession or occupation of the household  		employer.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> As  		such, the household employer must assume the total cost of insurance  		directly.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> Larson, a  		national expert on workers compensation law, argues that non-business or  		domestic service employment should be exempt from workers compensation  		laws (Larson, 2002). </p>
<p>There are a number of barriers that can affect a publicly-funded  		self-directed support service programs ability to manage the risk  		associated with a PAS worker being hired by service recipients being injured on  		the job and arrange and pay for workers compensation insurance on behalf  		of service recipients who hire PAS workers directly. The first is the lack of  		clarity in jurisdictions workers compensation laws and employment  		classification code language regarding the employment status of PAS workers  		hired directly by service recipients. </p>
<p>The majority of state and territorial workers compensation agency  		staff reported informally that PAS workers who work for household employers  		(e.g., service recipients) are included in the domestic service employment  		classification (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). These workers are also  		considered in the domestic service classification by the U.S. Department of  		Labor<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> and Internal  		Revenue Service.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note7">7</a></font></sup>  		However, the majority of jurisdictions workers compensation laws  		and employment classification codes poorly define domestic service and often do  		not specifically reference support service workers such as PAS workers (See  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). Thus, the final determination of whether a  		service recipients PAS worker falls into the domestic service employment  		classification for workers compensation purposes, is often made by an  		administrative law judge when a workers compensation claim is disputed.  		If an employers worker is found to be covered (non-exempt) under the law  		and the employer is determined to be out of compliance with the law,  		significant penalties can be levied and the employer may be liable for tort  		liability (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table2">Table 2</a>).</p>
<p>The second is cost. The household employer, or in the case of  		publicly-funded self-directed support service programs, the program agency must  		assume the full cost of insurance.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> This is because the service recipient, as  		household employer, is not engaged in a trade, occupation or  		business and this cannot pass the cost of insurance on to the customer  		through the price of the product (Larson, 2002). In addition, the cost of  		workers compensation insurance varies significantly by jurisdiction. They  		also can be significant, particularly if the service recipient hires multiple  		PAS workers and the jurisdiction uses a per capita methodology to establish  		rates and premiums for domestic service workers (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table  		4</a>, <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>).</p>
<p>The third is the concept and procedures related to workers  		compensation are not easy to understand and manage. Some experts in the field  		recommend using an insurance agent/producer that is familiar with a  		jurisdictions workers compensation law and insurance related  		administrative procedures in order to obtain appropriate access to the  		insurance and at a reasonable cost. Others, in particular state workers  		compensation agency staff, have reported that agents may not have an incentive  		to broker workers compensation insurance policies for household employers  		with voluntary or residual market insurance carriers. This is due, in part, to  		the size of the administrative fee they receive (e.g., $15-20/policy) and the  		amount of paperwork that is required to quote a policy and manage policy  		renewals with an insurance carrier.</p>
<p>The fourth is insurance carriers in the voluntary workers  		compensation insurance market often do not have an incentive to write  		workers compensation insurance policies for household employers due to  		low premiums, significant administrative burden and associated costs and  		perceived high risk of liability (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table3">Table 3</a>).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> The voluntary markets  		disinterest in writing workers compensation insurance policies for  		household employers often results in the residual market being the only source  		of workers compensation insurance to them and public agencies operating  		self-directed support service programs. The residual market is considered the  		market of last resort and is the primary source of insurance for  		employers that are considered poor risks or have limited and/or poor claims  		experience. Workers compensation premiums can be significantly higher in  		the residual market than in the voluntary market or state insurance funds (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>, <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a> and  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>).</p>
<p>So the key question for publicly-funded self-directed support service  		programs and service recipients is: What is the best way to address the  		potential risk of liability associated with a PAS worker being injured on the  		job when the service recipient is the common law employer of the  		worker?</p>
<h3>A. Scope of This Report</h3>
<p>This report focuses on workers compensation laws and systems as  		they pertain to domestic service workers, and in particular, PAS workers in 50  		states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories and one tribal  		government<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> and  		addresses the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>How do workers compensation programs work;</li>
<li>What states and territories afford individuals with disabilities who  		  are household employers the opportunity to purchase workers compensation  		  insurance coverage for their domestic service workers, and in particular for  		  PAS workers;</li>
<li>How accessible is workers compensation insurance coverage for  		  household employers who hire domestic service, and in particular, PAS workers  		  directly;</li>
<li>How affordable are workers compensation insurance policies for  		  household employer hiring domestic service/PAS workers;</li>
<li>What issues and challenges have been reported by state workers  		  compensation agency staff and insurance carriers regarding the administration  		  of workers compensation systems and the provision of insurance for  		  domestic service and PAS workers; and</li>
<li>What promising practices have been implemented by jurisdictions to  		  facilitate public programs arranging and paying for workers compensation  		  insurance for service recipients who hire domestic service/PAS workers, thereby  		  reducing the risk of liability related to workplace injury for state program  		  agencies and service recipients?</li>
</ul><h3>B. Methodology</h3>
<p>The methodology for this analysis involved the review of a variety of  		secondary information sources related to workers compensation laws  		pertaining to domestic service workers, and in particular, PAS workers in 50  		states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories and one tribal  		government. Materials reviewed for each of the 57 jurisdictions included, but  		were not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Workers compensation laws and regulations,</li>
<li>Workers compensation program and insurance carriers  		  materials, and</li>
<li>Related literature, including published reports.</li>
</ul><p>Follow-up calls were conducted with key state workers  		compensation, insurance company and agent staff in each jurisdiction as needed  		to obtain information not readily available in the secondary information  		reviewed.</p>
<h3>C. Limitations of This Report</h3>
<p>The information presented in this report is the most accurate  		information available from both primary and secondary sources at the time it  		was collected. Efforts were made to cross-check the validity of the information  		presented whenever possible. </p>
<p>Secondary information related to workers compensation systems and  		how they apply to domestic service and PAS workers in state publications,  		including state web sites, was limited. As a result, agency staff in each of  		the jurisdictions had to be contacted on an as needed basis to  		fill in the blanks. When contacted, state workers  		compensation agency and private insurance agency staffs interpretation of  		workers compensation law related to the domestic service classification,  		PAS workers and related policy and procedures was inconsistent. This was due,  		in part, to how the domestic service workers were include (e.g., either exempt  		or partially exempt) in the law in many jurisdictions. In addition, the percent  		of household employers who actually purchase workers compensation  		insurance in a jurisdiction is often small.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the accuracy of some secondary information varied. This was  		due in part to frequent changes in state workers compensation laws and  		policy from 1990 to the present and the timing of published reports.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. WHAT IS WORKERS COMPENSATION?</a></h2>
<p>Workers compensation in the United States is a combined government  		and private insurance program mandated by state or territorial law,  		administered by one or more state or territorial agencies and paid for entirely  		by employers. It is a no-fault social insurance concept, similar to no-fault  		automobile insurance, that mandates the payment of statutorily defined medical,  		disability<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> and other  		benefits (e.g., death and burial) to most workers whose injuries and illnesses  		arise out of and in the course of employment (Lencsis, 1998). In  		general, workers compensation is compulsory for employers and significant  		penalties may be levied for those who do not comply with the law (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table2">Table 2</a>).</p>
<p>All fifty states, the District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories  		have enacted workers compensation insurance laws and systems. They are  		specific to each jurisdiction and can be complex. A basic objective of  		workers compensation is that coverage under the laws be virtually, if not  		completely, universal. However, for various historical, political, economic,  		and/or administrative reasons, no state or territory law covers all forms of  		employment (U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2002). </p>
<p>Exempt (non-covered) employees represent a relatively small percent of  		total employees, but they are important, especially with regard to  		employers liability insurance. The most common classes of non-exempt  		employees are casual workers who work only occasionally or  		intermittently for a given employer such as domestic servants and agricultural  		workers, minor employers who employ less than three, four or five workers, and  		domestic service workers. Currently, 16 states and one U.S. territory exempt  		minor employers with less than two three, four or five workers from mandatory  		coverage.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> Thirty-four  		states, the District of Columbia and one territory exempt casual  		employers or any employee whose employment is not in the trade, business,  		profession or occupation of the employer or both.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> Twenty-five states and two U.S. territories  		exempt domestic service from their workers compensation laws (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>). In addition, 22 states and the District of  		Columbia and two territories partially exempt domestic service based on  		specific criteria (e.g., the number of hours worked or payroll for a certain  		period of time) (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>). Finally, two states and  		one U.S. territory consider domestic service workers as non-exempt workers  		under each jurisdictions workers compensation law.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most state workers compensation laws use similar language to  		describe injuries that are covered under law. Such injuries must be caused by  		accidents arising out of and in the course of employment, means  		that the accident must be caused by a risk that is closely,  		directly, or distinctly associated with the  		employment.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> If the  		risk is not associated with the employment but with the employees own  		personal activities, it is considered a personal risk and the accident is never  		compensable (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<h3>A. U.S. Workers Compensation System: A Historical  		Overview </h3>
<p>The current workers compensation insurance system in the U.S.  		developed as a result of the late 1800s industrial expansion and the  		subsequent push to protect injured workers who were left with little recourse  		following accidents but to sue their employer for workplace negligence.  		Lawsuits rarely were successful due to the significant cost of litigation and  		the difficulty proving employer negligence (National Conference of Insurance  		Legislators, 2002).</p>
<p>States developed workers compensation laws in the early twentieth  		century as a means of providing prompt and certain financial relief for workers  		who suffer employment-related injuries or diseases. These laws established no  		fault compensation systems for injured workers covering expenses for medical  		treatment and lost wages. In 1911, Wisconsin enacted the first permanent  		workers compensation law (a 1910 New York statute had been declared  		unconstitutional). By 1949, each state had adopted its own, state-specific,  		workers compensation system. Currently, all 50 states, the District of  		Columbia and the six U.S. territories have enacted workers compensation  		laws (National Conference of Insurance Legislators, 2002).</p>
<p>The decades since the enactment of these laws have witnessed expansion  		of the workers compensation coverage across the country, including the  		establishment of self-insurance programs, state funds, and federally<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> provided coverage. In addition,  		there has been a broadening of the kinds of injuries workers compensation  		covers, (e.g., soft tissue claims in addition to amputations and other related  		injury claims) (National Conference of Insurance Legislators, 2002).</p>
<p>In 1972, the National Commission on State Workmens Compensation  		Laws, created through the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, issued a  		report offering 19 recommendations for improving workers compensation  		coverage, including increasing the benefit levels. The recommendations led to a  		number of states revising their laws and to a significant increase in costs. By  		the late 1980s, the residual effects of the 1970s statutory  		changes, combined with other market influences, resulted in soaring loss ratios  		and costs that rose between 10-15 percent annually (American Academy of  		Actuaries, 2000).</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, the workers compensation system was in  		crisis and the crisis lasted for nearly ten years. During this time,  		workers compensation costs rose much faster than general inflation. In  		state after state, insurers costs increased at a much faster rate than  		the premiums they took in, creating an instability that could not continue  		(Hager, 1995). </p>
<p>Reforms throughout the 1990s addressed many aspects of the state  		workers compensation systems, including decreasing benefit levels,  		opening competition, instituting workplace safety incentives, and allowing for  		dispute resolution. The most significant changes addressed were related to  		medical cost containment (National Conference of Insurance Legislators,  		2002).</p>
<p>Rather than overhauling workers compensation statutes, many state  		legislatures are evaluating and modifying the reforms currently in  		place.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note18">18</a></font></sup>  		Simultaneously, the voluntary insurance market is tightening. Some  		report this tightening is due in part to the industry struggling to recoup from  		a series of years marked by high combined ratios, and more recently, the  		fallout of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (National Conference on  		Insurance Legislators, 2002). Others report the tightening is due in part to  		the fact that in the mid-1990s, workers compensation insurers cut  		premiums and engaged in an all-out price war to win market share, feeding off  		high investment returns. Then the stock market crashed and, simultaneously  		medical costs rose dramatically (LRA, 2003).</p>
<p>In 1986, 870 private commercial insurers actively wrote workers  		compensation insurance in the U.S. In 2003, 791 commercial insurers actively  		wrote workers compensation insurance, a nine percent reduction in total  		carriers (A.M. Best, 1997 and 2003). One result of the tightening of the U.S.  		workers compensation insurance market reported by workers  		compensation and insurance agency staff has been an increase in the number of  		employers obtaining workers compensation insurance through  		jurisdictions residual markets.</p>
<p>There has been a recent increase in the number of household employers  		electing to cover their domestic service workers, and in particular, PAS  		workers, for workers compensation. Twenty-five states and two U.S.  		territories workers compensation laws exempt domestic service  		workers (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>). All but one state (Wyoming) allow  		household employers to elect to cover their domestic service workers. State  		workers compensation agency staff recently reported:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Five years ago I could not tell you what the employment  		  classification codes for domestic service were or what tasks were included  		  under the codes. Now we are seeing an increase in household employers electing  		  workers compensation insurance coverage for their domestic service  		  workers. If this trend continues, we need to make sure the policies and  		  procedures for classifying and rating domestic service, and in particular,  		  personal assistance service workers accurately reflect the tasks performed and  		  the associated risk.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some state workers compensation agency staff reported that some  		insurance agents/producers are reluctant to broker workers compensation  		insurance for household employers with voluntary and residual carriers. This is  		due, in part, to low administrative fees (e.g., $15-20 per policy) and  		significant administrative burden and related costs.</p>
<p>It also was reported that the majority of voluntary insurance carriers  		are reluctant to write policies for household employers due to small payrolls,  		low premiums, significant administrative burden and related costs and perceived  		high risk of worker injury. As a result, state workers compensation and  		insurance agency staff are seeing an increase in the number of domestic service  		policies written by the states residual workers compensation  		insurance market.</p>
<p>A market conduct examination of the statistical reporting and experience  		rating procedures of the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc.  		(NCCI) under the examination authorities of the Oregon Insurance Division and  		twelve other participating insurance departments<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> was performed by Arthur Andersen, LLP in  		2001. Two findings of the review, (1) questionable classification code  		assignments and (2) employee misclassification, were attributed, in part, to  		the current employment classification code system being confusing and difficult  		for employers and insurers to use (Arthur Andersen, LLP, 2001).</p>
<p>As a result of the Arthur Andersen review, NCCI has implemented a new  		Classification Assurance Department that is focused on systematic  		research, analysis and maintenance of NCCIs classification system to  		ensure it remains healthy, viable and responsive to the needs of the industry  		(NCCI, 2003). NCCIs research plan includes a review of codes related to  		personal care services. This review is forthcoming according to NCCI staff as  		of December 2003.</p>
<h3>B. What Are Workers Compensation Laws?</h3>
<p>Workers compensation laws define the responsibilities of the  		employer to provide prompt medical, disability and other benefits (e.g., death  		and burial) for injuries sustained on the job by workers, resulting in partial  		or total incapacity or death. In return, the employer is shielded from tort  		liability for those injuries (Lencsis, 1998). All 50 states, the District of  		Columbia, the five U.S. territories and the Navajo Nation have enacted  		workers compensation laws (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p>Workers compensation laws are either <i>compulsory</i> or  		<i>elective</i>. Under an elective law, the employer may accept or reject the  		law, but if rejected, the employer looses the three common law defenses --  		contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and negligence of fellow  		employees. Practically, this means that all laws, in effect, are  		compulsory<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>) (US.  		Chamber of Commerce, 2002). </p>
<p>A compulsory law requires each employer within its scope to accept its  		provisions and provide for benefits specified (U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2002).  		The majority of jurisdictions workers compensation laws are  		compulsory and in general, employers are required to purchase insurance at no  		cost to the employee. Employers who do not obtain insurance for their  		non-exempt employees are considered out of compliance with the law and may be  		subject to penalties and at risk of tort liability (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table2">Table  		2</a>).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Twenty-three states permit employers to waive their inclusion in the  		states workers compensation law under certain circumstances by  		obtaining a waiver.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note22">22</a></font></sup>  		In addition, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories  		allow household employers to elect to provide workers compensation  		coverage for their domestic service workers if they are considered exempt  		employees (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>1. What are the Basic Objectives and Underlying Premise of  		Workers Compensation Laws?</b></p>
<p>There are six basic objectives underlying workers compensation  		laws:</p>
<ul><li>To provide sure, prompt and reasonable medical and disability  		  benefits to work-accident victims or income benefits to their dependents,  		  regardless of fault;</li>
<li>To provide a single remedy and reduce court delays, costs and  		  workloads arising out of personal injury litigation;</li>
<li>To relieve public and private charities of financially draining  		  incidents associated with uncompensated industrial accidents;</li>
<li>To eliminate payment of fees to lawyers and witnesses as well as time  		  consuming trials and appeals;</li>
<li>To encourage maximum employer interest in safety and rehabilitation  		  through appropriate experience-rating mechanisms; and </li>
<li>To promote frank study of the causes of accidents (rather than  		  concealment of fault), thereby reducing the number of preventable accidents and  		  consequent human suffering (U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2002).</li>
</ul><p>An underlying premise of workers compensation laws is that the  		costs of industrial accidents and diseases, like other costs of doing business,  		should be borne by the enterprise that engendered them. (King, 1988).  		Accordingly, the right to workers compensation benefits depends on the  		relationship of the injury to the victims work. There is no requirement  		that the employer have been at fault. (King, 1989). </p>
<p>There are two benefits for employers under workers compensation law.  		First, the remedies available (and the amount of the employers liability)  		under the workers compensation statutes are generally limited to medical,  		disability, death and burial benefits. There is no right to damages for pain  		and suffering or punitive damages in most states. In addition, workers  		compensation disability, death and burial benefits are typically subject to  		ceilings limiting potential recovery. Workers compensation benefits are  		usually paid periodically, as compared to lump sum recoveries in tort cases.  		Second, an employees right to workers compensation is usually the  		<i>exclusive remedy</i> against the employer for accidental injuries and  		occupational diseases falling within the coverage formula of the workers  		compensation act (King, 1988). </p>
<p>There are some situations where the worker may maintain a tort action.  		First, the immunity granted to the employer is not absolute. The employer is  		not immune when he intentionally injures an employee. In addition, some  		jurisdictions permit a tort action when an employer acts in a dual  		capacity with respect to an employee (Haas, 1989).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Second, should the workplace injury involve a person other than the  		employer, that victim is entitled to sue the third party in tort. Although  		there are variations, the general rule is that the tortfeasor pays the entire  		judgment to the victim and the employer is reimbursed for any workers  		compensation he has paid so that the victim does not receive a double  		recovery. So, even when the employer can be shown to have been negligent,  		he may not have to pay anything for the work-related injury (Haas, 1989).</p>
<p><b>2. How Do Workers Compensation and Tort Law Differ?</b></p>
<p>Some consider workers compensation a historic outgrowth of tort  		law. The two systems have similar goals, but there are significant differences  		between them in both their substantive and procedural rules. They also interact  		in various ways, most notably in the immunity from tort liability that  		workers compensation statutes grant employers (Haas, 1987).</p>
<p>There are three primary differences between workers compensation  		and tort law: </p>
<ul><li>First, unlike tort law, workers compensation is a no fault system. As  		  long as the injury occurs from his/her employment and occurs in the course of  		  work, a worker is entitled to compensation. Compensation does not depend on  		  demonstrating that the employer was at fault, nor is it denied because the  		  worker was at fault, except in extreme cases (Haas, 1987).</li>
<li>Second, unlike tort law, workers compensation does not try to  		  compensate the accident victim for the full value of his loss and does not try  		  to make the worker whole. Instead, workers compensation replaces  		  pecuniary losses incurred by the victims of work-related injuries.  		  Workers compensation insurance fully covers the injured workers  		  medical expenses, but only partially covers lost wages. In addition, it does  		  not include any amounts for the injured workers pain and  		  suffering nor does it include amounts for the loss of  		  consortium<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> suffered  		  by the workers spouse or children. Assuming the workers injury  		  entitled him/her to recovery in tort, it is generally true that the tort  		  judgment would be significantly higher than the workers compensation  		  award (Hass, 1987).</li>
<li>Third, the two systems differ in response time. Workers  		  compensation is designed so that the qualifying victim receives payment soon  		  after his/her injury. In a tort action, it can be months and perhaps years  		  before the plaintiff can receive a judgement (Haas, 1987).</li>
</ul><p>Regardless of the differences, the basic goals of the two systems are  		similar. Both systems goals are to compensate victims of accidents and  		both place the cost of such compensation, at least in the first instance, on  		the entity with a close causal relation to the injury. To the extent that the  		payer is able to modify the work situation that gave rise to the injury, the  		payment has a deterrent effect. It provides the payer and potential payers with  		an incentive for taking safety measures (Haas, 1987).</p>
<p><b>3. How Does an Employer Come Into Compliance With Workers  		Compensation Laws?</b></p>
<p>Compliance with workers compensation laws is a special  		term that refers to activities that an employer must do or refrain from doing  		under the law, other than paying benefits for compensable accidents. First, the  		employer must comply by either purchasing insurance to cover the entire  		liability under the law or qualifying as a self-insurer under the applicable  		rules. The latter option is rarely, if ever, available to household employers  		(Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Second, in many states, employers must post a prescribed notice in a  		conspicuous place such as an employee bulletin board, in each place of  		employment. The notice usually advises the workers of the name of the  		employers current carrier and provides further information about how to  		make a claim (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Third, employers often are required to file a written report to the  		workers compensation administrative agency for every significant employee  		injury. Fourth, employers are often obligated to refrain from discriminating in  		any way against an employee who has claimed compensation or has been a witness  		in a compensation case. Finally, many laws provide that an employer may not  		enter into any agreement with an employee regarding a waiver or surrender of  		compensation benefits (any such agreement will be unenforceable) (Lencsis,  		1998).</p>
<p><b>4. Should Non-business Employment be Covered Under Workers  		Compensation? The Case of Domestic Service</b></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, whether non-business employment (e.g., domestic  		service) should be covered for workers compensation is a subject for  		debate. From a social policy perspective it has been argued that the ultimate  		goal of workers compensation should be protection for all employees since  		the losses due to injury for a non-business or domestic worker is no less  		serious than for an industrial worker (Larson, 2002). Moreover, the 1993 Social  		Security Bulletin Annual Statistical Supplement goes as far as to say,  		Workers compensation was the first form of social insurance to  		develop widely in the United States. </p>
<p>Others argue that workers compensation insurance is a  		business insurance and that the associated costs are a  		business expense. As such, the cost of insurance should be passed  		along to the customer in the price of the product. In the case of non-business  		or domestic service, employees do not perform tasks in the course of a trade,  		business, profession or occupation of their employer. As a result, the  		household employer must assume the total cost of insurance directly.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> Larson, a national expert on  		workers compensation law, argues that non-business or domestic service  		employment should be exempt from workers compensation laws (Larson,  		2002). To date, many jurisdictions have followed this logic, exempting many  		categories of non-business employment including domestic service (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>). </p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty some employers face in determining whether  		certain employees are truly exempt from the law,<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note27">27</a></font></sup> all states and territories, with the  		exception of Wyoming, allow employers to elect to provide coverage for  		employees who are considered exempt. When an employer elects to provide  		coverage, states often require coverage be provided for all employees and that  		the employer formally notify the jurisdictions workers compensation  		administrative agency of his/her intent to provide or terminate coverage for  		exempt employees. </p>
<p><b>5. How are Domestic Service and Personal Assistance Service Defined  		Workers Compensation Laws?</b></p>
<p>In general, domestic service and personal assistance services are not  		well defined in workers compensation laws. Forty-five states and five  		territories do not define domestic service in the definition section of their  		workers compensation laws (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). These  		jurisdictions basically rely on the definitions included in the NCCI and  		state-specific domestic service employment classification codes to define the  		occupations and tasks included under domestic service including personal  		assistance services. For the six states who specifically define domestic  		service in their workers compensation law<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>), two  		states make no mention of PAS workers (NV and MI) in the law, two states  		include personal assistance in the domestic service definition (HI and OR) and  		two states specifically exclude personal assistance from the definition of  		domestic service if the services are provided to persons with disabilities (New  		Hampshire and Minnesota). </p>
<p>Hawaiis workers compensation law §381-1(6), for  		example, defines domestic service to include attendant care and day care  		services authorized by the Department of Human Service. Oregons  		workers compensation law §656.026(1), in contrast, defines domestic  		service to include home health workers. New Hampshires  		workers compensation laws define domestic service to not including  		workers employed by individuals with disabilities.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> In the case of Minnesota, individuals with  		disabilities whose workers receive payment for services rendered directly from  		the Department of Human Services are considered the employees of the state and  		not the household employer.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>6. Are Family Members Considered Covered Workers Under  		Workers Compensation Laws?</b></p>
<p>A key feature of self-directed support service programs is that certain  		family members may be permitted to be paid support service workers for elders  		and individuals with disabilities.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note31">31</a></font></sup> However, a family member, performing as a  		paid PAS worker, could be injured while providing personal assistance to their  		disabled or aged relative the same as a non-related worker. Therefore, a key  		question for self-directed support service programs is, under what  		circumstances are family members considered covered workers under  		workers compensation laws?</p>
<p>Workers compensation laws in 38 states, the District of Columbia  		and four U.S. territories are silent regarding the status of family members as  		covered employees (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). Therefore,  		it is assumed in those jurisdictions that family members are  		covered employees under the respective laws. State workers  		compensation laws in California, Hawaii and Idaho specifically exempt certain  		family members from coverage. In California, household employers may not elect  		to provide coverage for exempt family members, however, in Hawaii and Idaho,  		household employers may elect to cover exempt family members.</p>
<p>Nine jurisdictions have specific provisions for certain types of family  		members (<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). For example:</p>
<ul><li>In Connecticut, if, in any contract of insurance, the wages or salary  		  of a member of the employers family dwelling in his or her home is  		  included in the payroll on which the premium is based, then that person will be  		  deemed an employee and compensated in accordance with the statute if they  		  sustain an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note32">32</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Iowa workers compensation law exempts members of the  		  household from coverage. The State defines a member of the  		  household as a spouse or relative of the employer, or a relative of  		  the spouse residing in the household of employment.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> These individuals are  		  ineligible to be covered under workers compensation in Iowa. Staff could  		  not confirm if household employers could elect coverage for these  		  individuals.</li>
<li>In Kansas, no wages paid to an employee who is a member of the  		  employers family by marriage or consanguinity can be used in the  		  computation of gross annual payroll for workers compensation  		  purposes.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> In Maine, a  		  parent, spouse or child of a sole proprietor, partner or bona fide owner of 20  		  percent of the voting stock may waive in writing all the benefits provided by  		  workers compensation.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Michigans workers compensation law §118(1) states  		  that no household domestic servant shall be considered an employee if the  		  person is a wife, child or other member of the employers family residing  		  in the home. </li>
<li>Missouri Revised Statutes §287.030(3) states an  		  employee who is a member of the employers family within the third degree  		  of affinity or co-sanguinity shall be counted in determining the total number  		  of employees of such employer. Domestic service workers, including paid  		  family members, are exempt from the workers compensation law in Missouri.  		  However, household employers may elect to cover these workers, including family  		  members who are paid employees. In addition, Missouri Division of Workers  		  Compensation staff volunteered that if a household employer elected to cover  		  their domestic service workers for workers compensation, and had family  		  members as paid employees, the insurance company would probably require that  		  the family member be covered under the policy along with any other non-related  		  employees.</li>
<li>North Dakota specifically prohibits spouses and children under the  		  age of 22 from being considered a covered employee for the purpose of workers'  		  compensation.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note36">36</a></font></sup> In  		  Oklahoma, an employee with five or less employees, all of whom are related by  		  blood or marriage to the employer are exempt from the State's workers'  		  compensation law. However, employers have the option of electing to provide  		  coverage for these employees.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note37">37</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Vermont does not consider members of the employers family  		  dwelling in his/her house to be employees under the States workers  		  compensation law. However, if in any contract of insurance, the wages or  		  salaries of a member of the employers family dwelling in his house is  		  included in the payroll on which the premium is based, then such person must,  		  in the event of his or her sustaining injury arising out of and in the course  		  of his/her employment, be deemed an employee and compensated  		  accordingly.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note38">38</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>When designing self-directed support service programs that allow family  		members to be paid support workers, it is important for jurisdictions to  		understand how family members are treated for workers compensation  		purposes so that the service recipients risk of liability for worker  		injury can be minimized. In jurisdictions that exempt family members from the  		workers compensation law but allow employers to elect coverage,  		self-directed support service program administrators may want to consider  		arranging and paying for workers compensation insurance for these  		workers. In jurisdictions that exempt family members from the workers  		compensation law with no option for electing insurance coverage, this could  		result in a potential risk of liability for worker injury in the tort system.  		</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. HOW DO WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS  		WORK?</a></h2>
<p>It is important to have a basic understanding of how workers  		compensation programs work in order to assess how they apply to household  		employers of domestic service and PAS workers of individuals enrolled in  		self-directed support service programs. The following describes the key  		characteristics of workers compensation programs.</p>
<h3>A. What Organizations Administer Workers  		Compensation Systems?</h3>
<p>The functions associated with operating workers compensation  		systems often are disbursed across a number of public and private entities and  		the number can vary significantly by jurisdiction. For example, in  		Alabama,<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note39">39</a></font></sup> two state  		agencies administer the workers compensation systems, whereas in Oregon,  		at least seven public entities and one private entity participate in  		administering the states workers compensation system.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are two primary functions that public and/or private entities  		perform related to the operation of workers compensation systems,  		administration and rating setting. The administrative function may be broadly  		divided into administering the law and system (e.g., making sure that all  		covered employers have obtained workers compensation insurance for their  		workers) and conducting hearings for the resolution of both claims and  		insurance disputes. Industrial commissions or divisions of workers  		compensation usually administer the law and system. In some instances, two  		state agencies may manage the administrative functions separately, one agency  		administers the law and system, making sure covered employers have insurance  		and overseeing and/or disbursing benefits, and the other resolves conflicts  		(e.g., initial claims disputes and appeals) (e.g., Oregon). These state  		agencies often have concurrent jurisdiction over claims, with the adjudicating  		board having superior power. In Alabama and Tennessee, courts administer the  		claims appeal function (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table8">Table 8</a>) (Nackley, 1989).</p>
<p>Evidence rules for workers compensation administrative hearings  		are different from those applied in courts, and the scope of judicial review is  		often narrow. Court review generally is limited to determinations of whether  		the administrative agency abused its discretion, made factual findings without  		evidentiary support, or made an error in law. In those few states that permit  		<i>de novo</i> review in court, the court rules of civil procedure usually  		obtain, but the issues that may be appealed are often limited to allowance of  		claims or of medical conditions (Nackley, 1989).</p>
<p>Wisconsin is a good example to illustrate the process some states use to  		resolve claims disputes and appeals. In Wisconsin, the administrative law  		judges for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Workers  		Compensation Division first review and render a decision on a particular issue  		when a claim is disputed. If the decision is appealed, it is first heard by the  		Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission. In the event of a second  		appeal, the case goes to the State Circuit Court. The State Circuit Court  		decision may then be appealed to the State Appeals Court and then finally to  		the State Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The rate setting function may be performed by a State Insurance Fund or  		department of insurance (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table8">Table 8</a>). The primary  		responsibility of state departments of insurance is to regulate the insurance  		industry in a particular jurisdiction. Tasks may include, but are not limited  		to, enforcing insurance laws, in particular as they pertain to workers  		compensation, and overseeing, regulating, licensing, investigating and auditing  		insurance companies to ensure they remain solvent and meet their obligations to  		policyholders and for licensing and investigating insurance agents/producers.  		State insurance departments also are responsible for reviewing and approving  		insurance carriers policies and procedures, forms, and other filings  		including workers compensation loss cost multipliers and rates. They may  		also be responsible for reviewing and approving rating agencies rate  		analyses and filings, conducting hearings, assisting in the resolution of rate  		disputes and complaints from consumers about insurance companies and agents and  		providing educational information and assistance to consumers and other  		interested parties. </p>
<p>Some insurance departments delegate the data analysis and rate setting  		function to rating bureaus or advisory organizations. These entities collect  		and analyze data and prepare and rate information and rate filings to the  		insurance agency for review and approval. The insurance department often  		conducts regulatory hearings on the proposed rate filings as part of its  		approval process (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>The largest rating bureau/advisory organization in the United States is  		the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), Inc. NCCI operates as a  		not-for-profit rating, statistical and data management service  		organization.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note41">41</a></font></sup> NCCI  		products and services assist insurers, regulatory officials, lawmakers, and  		other industry stakeholders in making informed decisions that support the  		efficient economic functioning of the workers compensation system (NCCI,  		2003). NCCI currently has approximately 900 affiliates and performs rating and  		other functions<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note42">42</a></font></sup> for  		approximately 40 states and the District of Columbia. NCCI does not provide  		services to any of the U.S. territories. Despite its name, NCCI is not  		associated with the federal government and does not operate in all states  		(NCCI, 2003).</p>
<p>There are eleven states that operate independent (e.g., single state)  		rating or advisory organizations and perform similar functions as  		NCCI.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> Because of the  		structure of the States rating laws, Texas has no rating or advisory  		organization nor do the seven jurisdictions that operate exclusive (e.g.,  		monopolistic) state insurance funds where private workers compensation is  		not available (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<h3>B. What Benefits are Provided to Injured Employees Under  		Workers Compensation?</h3>
<p>There are a number benefits provided to injured employees under  		workers compensation. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Medical, </li>
<li>Disability (income to replace lost wages),</li>
<li>Scheduled Awards for Selected Injuries,</li>
<li>Rehabilitation</li>
<li>Survivor Benefits, and</li>
<li>Funeral Expenses.</li>
</ul><p><b>1. Medical Benefits</b></p>
<p>All workers compensation laws have one feature in common: they  		provide medical benefits that are unlimited in dollar amount and in time. They  		provide full compensation for employee injuries. As a result, medical benefits  		can be a very costly component of the claim from the insurers or  		self-insured employers perspective (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Although the term medical might strictly mean only services  		provided by physicians and hospitals, medical benefits in most jurisdictions  		include the services of dentists, chiropractors, podiatrists, psychologists,  		and other health care professionals. Medical benefits include not only  		reimbursement for professional service and hospital stays, but also items of  		expense associated with various kinds of health care, such as diagnostic tests,  		wheelchairs and crutches, prosthetic devices, other medical appliances, and  		medications (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>In approximately half the jurisdictions, in order to reduce fraud, there  		are restrictions regarding the health care provider an employee can choose. In  		some jurisdictions, the employer is entitled to designate the provider at all  		stages of treatment, and in others, the employer may initially designate  		providers, subject to the employees right to change providers later  		during the course of treatment, for personal or other reasons. In a number of  		jurisdictions, medical benefits are further restricted by the use of fee  		schedules for physicians and other practitioners (Lencsis, 1998). </p>
<p><b>2. Disability Benefits</b></p>
<p>The second most important benefit is the disability<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note44">44</a></font></sup> benefit. The worker is entitled  		to cash benefits to replace his or her lost income, generally for an indefinite  		period if the disability lasts that long. However, not all workers will receive  		this type of compensation because disability benefits are always subject to  		maximum amounts, which provide more than a subsistence level of income in many  		cases, but do not fully replace workers income in other cases. Disability  		benefits are usually calculated at 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of pre-accident wages,  		subject to a maximum that varies by jurisdiction. In most states, the maximum  		is a function of an average wage that is derived from labor statistics. In some  		states (e.g., New York), the maximum is a fixed dollar amount (Lencsis,  		1998).</p>
<p>Disability benefits may be payable for total disability (usually defined  		as a complete loss of wage-earning capacity, not just with reference to medical  		or physical incapacity) or for partial disability (e.g., reduction in  		wage-earning capacity due to the injuries sustained). Benefits are further  		categorized as <i>temporary</i> when an end to the period of disability is  		foreseeable and as <i>permanent</i> when the disability is expected to endure  		indefinitely or for the employees remaining lifetime (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p><b>3. Scheduled Awards for Selected Injuries</b></p>
<p>Scheduled awards for selected injuries are fixed amounts payable to the  		injured worker for the loss or loss of use of certain body parts and functions.  		They represent payment for a presumed permanent disability, regardless of any  		actual lost wages, and they include some component of an award for pain and  		suffering, or the closet thing to such a component that exists in the  		workers compensation field (Lencsis, 1998). </p>
<p>Maximum scheduled awards vary by jurisdiction. Some  		jurisdictions<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note45">45</a></font></sup> do not  		used scheduled awards and pay benefits according to the actual degree of  		impairment of the injured worker in each case. Some laws provide for the award  		to be paid in a lump sum under some circumstances, but it is more common that  		the award is paid out over a number of years. Finally, jurisdictions differ in  		their treatment of temporary disability together with schedule award. Depending  		on the jurisdiction, the temporary disability benefit can be paid in addition  		to the scheduled award with or without limitation, or it may be deducted from  		the scheduled award (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p><b>4. Survivors and Funeral Benefits</b></p>
<p>Since workers compensation represents a substitute for tort  		remedies, it provides benefits to surviving spouses and dependent relatives of  		workers who die as a result of work-related accidents. Benefits are usually  		paid at the same rate as would apply if the worker were totally disabled.  		Payment to a spouse may be for as long as the spouses lifetime, but it is  		very common for spouses benefits to terminate with a lump-sum payment of  		two-years compensation upon his/her remarriage. Benefits to surviving  		children usually end at age 18 or 19 with an extension to age 23, 24, or 25 if  		the child is still a full-time student. Different jurisdictions provide for  		different adjustments when a spouse and one or more children survive the  		deceased worker. Finally, each jurisdictions law provides a funeral  		expense or burial allowance for a deceased worker that varies by jurisdiction  		(Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p><b>5. Rehabilitation Benefit</b></p>
<p>Rehabilitation of injured workers is normally divided into two  		categories: physical or medical rehabilitation and vocational rehabilitation.  		Physical or medical rehabilitation refers to the regaining of full use of the  		body. Vocational rehabilitation refers to retraining and counseling in  		connection with the resumption of employment. The costs of rehabilitation of  		injured workers are frequently compensable in addition to medical benefits per  		se (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions specifically require insurance carriers to provide  		one or the other, or both types of rehabilitation. Many jurisdictions also  		impose an obligation upon an injured employee to accept certain rehabilitation  		services as a condition to the continued receipt of full compensation benefits.  		Jurisdictions vary in their requirements related to the rehabilitation benefit  		(Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p><b>6. Non-Taxability of Benefits and Protection From Creditors</b></p>
<p>Medical and disability benefits have traditionally been exempt from  		federal income taxes. This approach anticipates the fact that the payment is a  		reduced amount compared to what a worker would have received if they were on  		the job receiving full wages. In some cases these benefits are also exempt from  		personal income taxes in a given jurisdiction (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>One of the social purposes of workers compensation is the  		prevention of destitution. As a result, workers compensation income  		benefits are invariably made exempt under state laws from creditors of the  		worker. These exemptions usually only apply to creditors who obtain a money  		judgment for contractual debts or for other reasons such as negligence in an  		accident situation (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<h3>C. What Insurance Markets Provide Workers  		Compensation Insurance?</h3>
<p>The insurance markets from which an employer can obtain workers  		compensation insurance are:</p>
<ul><li>Voluntary insurance market (private insurers),</li>
<li>State insurance funds (both exclusive and competitive), </li>
<li>Residual insurance market, </li>
<li>Self-insurance, </li>
<li>Workers compensation endorsements on homeowners and  		  tenants insurance, and</li>
<li>Alternative workers compensation plans.</li>
</ul><p>However, most household employers do not meet jurisdictions  		requirements to self-insure for workers compensation. The following  		describes the key features of these markets and the self-insurance and the  		homeowners insurance options for providing workers compensation to  		household employers.</p>
<p><b>1. Voluntary Insurance Market</b></p>
<p>The voluntary insurance market is comprised of private insurers who may  		volunteer or decline to write policies for employers based on their own  		underwriting criteria. In 2002, there were 791 private commercial insurers  		actively writing workers compensation insurance in the U.S. (A.M. Best  		Co., 2003). The number of active carriers was down from 870 in 1996, a nine  		percent reduction in industry capacity. The tightening of the voluntary  		insurance market is due, in part, to some mergers in the industry (e.g., Zurich  		Insurance Group and Farmers Insurance) and a number of economic and  		industry-related issues. Five states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note46">46</a></font></sup> reported that access to voluntary  		workers compensation insurance was non-existent for household  		employers in their states.</p>
<p>Companies writing workers compensation insurance may be organized  		as a stock, mutual or a reciprocal insurer (Lencsis, 1998). <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table9">Table 9</a> includes a list of the top 25 commercial insurers  		writing workers compensation based on 2002 premiums. The leading  		workers compensation insurer in 2002 was the State Compensation Insurance  		Fund (SCIF) of California. The SCIF in California is a non-profit, public  		enterprise fund that operates much like a mutual insurance carrier and competes  		in the voluntary workers compensation insurance market. In California  		workers compensation insurance for domestic service workers (outside a  		homeowners insurance policy), can only be purchased from the SCIF.</p>
<p>Forty-five states, the District of Columbia and three U. S. territories  		have a voluntary market for workers compensation insurance and in many  		jurisdictions the number of insurers authorized to write workers  		compensation is significant (<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table3">Table 3</a>).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note47">47</a></font></sup> However, the majority of  		jurisdictions reported that access to the voluntary market for small employers,  		and in particular household employers who employ domestic service workers, is  		limited (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table3">Table 3</a>).</p>
<p>Writing workers compensation in jurisdictions voluntary  		market usually involves three distinct activities:</p>
<ul><li>Writing policies voluntarily,</li>
<li>Participating in the states residual market as an assigned  		  carrier or as a member of a pool that reinsures assigned risks, and</li>
<li>Possibly participating in the residual market as a volunteer service  		  carrier (Lencsis, 1998). </li>
</ul><p>In the simplest case, an insurance carrier will write a certain amount  		of voluntary premium and pay assessments based on its market share to cover  		losses generated by the insured included in the states assigned risk  		pool. As an alternative, the carrier might agree to accept direct assignments.  		Many large insurers may wish to participate as servicing carriers, where they  		earn a fee for issuing policies and paying claims that are completely reinsured  		by a pool consisting of all licensed carriers in the state (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Included in the voluntary insurance market is a default  		market that has emerged over the past ten years in response to concerns that  		small and moderate sized employers had limited access to workers  		compensation insurance outside the residual market. Some are competitive state  		insurance funds and others may be mutual insurance companies developed  		specifically to service this population. For example, the State of New Mexico  		funded the initial development of New Mexico Mutual Insurance Company. An  		objective of the Company is to service small and moderate sized employers.  		Operationally, the State made the initial investment to start the mutual  		insurance company. Then New Mexico Mutual Insurance Company reimbursed the  		State for its initial investment over a five-year period. Although many have  		either an explicit or implicit mission to serve small to moderate sized  		business, their willingness to serve household employers varies by  		organization.</p>
<p><b>2. State Insurance Funds</b></p>
<p>State Insurance Funds are quasi-governmental insurance entities that  		provide either the sole or an optional source of workers compensation in  		a jurisdiction. State Insurance funds are either exclusive (some call  		monopolistic) or competitive (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table10">Table  		10</a>).</p>
<p>Currently, five states and two U.S. territories have Exclusive State  		Insurance Funds.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note48">48</a></font></sup> They  		are called exclusive because they are generally the only permitted source of  		workers compensation insurance in a jurisdiction (e.g., private carriers  		may not write policies in these jurisdictions). In these jurisdictions the  		state insurance funds act more like a government benefit program than a  		business insurance program (Lencsis, 1998). Wyoming is the only state that  		operates an exclusive state fund that does not allow an exempt employer (e.g.,  		household employer of domestic service workers) to elect to purchase  		workers compensation insurance for his or her workers.</p>
<p>Competitive Insurance Funds are primarily governmental or  		quasi-governmental entities that write workers compensation insurance in  		competition with private insurers (Lencsis, 1998). Nine jurisdictions have  		Competitive State Insurance Funds.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note49">49</a></font></sup> Some State Insurance Funds are not permitted  		to refuse coverage to an employer, no matter how undesirable the risk, so long  		as past and current premiums are paid (e.g., PA State Workers Insurance  		Fund). Others often have an explicit or an implicit mandate to serve small or  		moderate sized employers (e.g., AZ, OR) but may be able to refuse coverage in  		accordance with approved policies (e.g., State Compensation Fund of Arizona).  		For example:</p>
<ul><li>The State Compensation Fund of Arizona can refuse to write a policy  		  for an employer based on approved policies and procedures. In this case, the  		  employer has to go to the states Assigned Risk Plan to obtain coverage  		  where they cannot be refused coverage. </li>
<li>The Pennsylvania State Workmens Insurance Fund (SWIF) has a  		  program and an insurance policy specifically for domestic service workers (PA  		  Domestic Service Exemption Policy). The PA SWIF has streamlined the application  		  process and has delegated a knowledgeable and customer-oriented staff person to  		  address issues pertaining to the Domestic Service Exemption Policy.</li>
<li>In California, the State Compensation Insurance Fund is the only  		  insurer that writes standard workers compensation insurance policies for  		  the domestic service classification. However, the Fund can require a household  		  employer to demonstrate that he/she was unsuccessful in obtaining coverage  		  through his/her homeowners insurance policy first before the Fund will  		  provide coverage under a standard workers compensation policy. </li>
</ul><p>Often competitive state insurance funds refer to themselves as the  		insurer or market of last resort. In some cases, they operate as  		the sole insurer for the residual market (e.g., Pennsylvania SWIF). Other  		times, a Fund may operate in addition to the jurisdictions Assigned Risk  		Plan (e.g., State Compensation Fund of Arizona as described above and the  		Arizona Assigned Risk Plan administered by NCCI).</p>
<p>Historically, state insurance funds typically did not sell or service  		policies through agents/producers and allowed employers to make applications  		directly. This eliminates a barrier for household employers to access insurance  		if agents/producers truly have little or no incentive to broker insurance  		applications with private or residual market insurers on behalf of household  		employers. Recently, this policy has begun to change with at least two state  		insurance funds (e.g., ID and MT) recommending that household employers  		consider using an agent to access insurance through the state insurance fund.  		Of all the competitive state insurance funds and mutual insurance companies  		currently acting as markets/insurers of last resort, the California  		State Compensation Insurance Fund reported the use of agents as  		optional. Six other states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note50">50</a></font></sup> recommend that household employers use an  		insurance agent/producer while three other states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note51">51</a></font></sup> require the use of an insurance  		agent/producer to access workers compensation insurance through the  		organization (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table10">Table 10</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table  		11</a>). </p>
<p><b>3. Residual Insurance Market</b></p>
<p>In general, the residual insurance market is a mechanism established by  		individual jurisdictions to ensure that employers can obtain workers  		compensation insurance even if insurance carriers are not willing to write such  		insurance on a voluntary basis. Jurisdictions residual markets operate  		either through Assigned Risk Plans or specific insurers operating as  		insurers/markets of last resort (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table  		11</a>). </p>
<p>The basic concept underlying any Assigned Risk Plan (sometimes referred  		to as the Pool) is the sharing, in an equitable manner among all  		licensed insurers within a jurisdiction, of the pool or residue of risk that  		individual carriers do not wish to insure through the voluntary market because  		of their undesirable underwriting characteristics. In the case of workers  		compensation insurance, these characteristics may include, but are not be  		limited to, (a) a lack of or poor claims history, (b) deficient safety  		conditions in workplaces, (c) the small size of the business to be insured, and  		(d) the low level of approved rates generally in effect for the line of  		business (referred to as rate inadequacy) (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Assigned Risk Plans are generally authorized by statute and are filed  		with and subject to approval by the jurisdictions regulatory authority.  		Key components of these plans include: (a) assigning applicants to carriers,  		(b) plan administration, (c) determining whether employers are eligible for  		coverage under the law, and (d) developing and implementing policy issuance  		requirements (NCCI, 2003).</p>
<p>In jurisdictions that have an Assigned Risk Plan, every insurance  		company that writes voluntary insurance in the state must participate in the  		Assigned Risk Plan by assuming a proportionate share of the cost of providing  		for a market of last resort. This can be done through a variety of mechanisms,  		such as participating as a direct assignment carrier or participating in a  		reinsurance pool as a servicing carrier (NCCI, 2003). </p>
<p>A reinsurance pool is an agreement among carriers to share in the  		operating results (e.g., revenues and expenses) arising from the plan  		assignments to servicing carriers. In some jurisdictions the relationship is  		voluntary, whereas in others, it is mandated by statutes or regulation. The  		largest of these pooling arrangements is the National Workers  		Compensation Reinsurance Pool (NWCRP) (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>)  		(NCCI, 2003). </p>
<p>Forty-five states and the District of Columbia have some type of  		residual market available to employers. However, none of the U.S. territories  		have residual workers compensation markets available to employers (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>). </p>
<p>Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have Assigned Risk  		Plans. Twenty are administered by NCCI. The remainder are administered by  		various state rating bureaus or advisory organizations that have a contract  		with the states insurance department to manage the plan (e.g., TN-Aon  		Risk Services, FL-Florida Workers Compensation Joint Underwriting  		Association, Inc. and MI-the Compensation Advisory Organization of Michigan)  		(see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>).</p>
<p>Often, employers must obtain a certain number of refusals (e.g.,  		declination letters) from carriers in the voluntary market in order to access  		the jurisdictions Assigned Risk Plan. This could be considered a barrier  		to the residual market for household employers. Currently, Michigan, North  		Carolina and Wisconsin do not require any refusals to access their Assigned  		Risk Plan and Minnesota and Oregon require one refusal. In addition, 18  		states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note52">52</a></font></sup> and the  		District of Columbia require two refusals, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and  		New Jersey require three. Finally, Georgia requires four refusals to access the  		Assigned Risk Plan (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>). </p>
<p>Some jurisdictions require an employer to use an insurance  		agent/producer to access workers compensation insurance through their  		Assigned Risk Plans. Some may see the use of agents as a way to facilitate  		access to an Assigned Risk Plan while others may see the requirement as a  		barrier. One reason why using an agent may be a barrier for household employers  		to access workers compensation insurance through an Assigned Risk Plan is  		that agents often have a disincentive to broker policies for individual  		household employers due to small fees and significant administrative effort.  		Twenty-two states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note53">53</a></font></sup> and the District of Columbias Assigned  		Risk Plans require employers to use an agent in order to access their Assigned  		Risk Plans. The majority of these Plans are administered by NCCI. Alaska,  		Arizona, and Delaware recommend using an agent, while Michigan, North Carolina,  		Wisconsin do not require an insurance agent be used to access the states  		Assigned Risk Plan (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>).</p>
<p>Residual markets also may be implemented through an insurer or  		market of last resort. These entities often are competitive state  		insurance funds or mutual insurance companies that have a contract with the  		state to administer the residual market (e.g., MO and PA-SWIF). Twenty-one  		states have insurers/markets of last resort that perform as the  		residual market for jurisdictions (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>). These  		entities provide insurance to all applicants and may assume the total risk of  		loss for the residual market up to some pre-determined amount. In the case of  		Missouri, Travelers Insurance is the agent, administrator and service carrier  		for the States residual market. Travelers Insurance assumes all of the  		residual market risk up to a 100 percent loss ratio. Any additional losses are  		distributed across all of the insurers authorized to write workers  		compensation in the State.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note54">54</a></font></sup> Five states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note55">55</a></font></sup> have both an Assigned Risk Plan and a  		default voluntary carrier (insurer of last resort) that  		provides coverage to small and moderate-sized businesses (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>).</p>
<p><b>4. Self-Insurance</b></p>
<p>Under the self-insurance option, large employers, usually upon  		depositing a surety bond, are allowed to pay directly the claims filed by their  		own workers and are given a great deal of discretion in administering their own  		risks. Self-insured employers are required to pay their workers the same  		benefits as workers would receive under private insurance or the state  		insurance fund. Self-insurance is not an option for household employers due, in  		part, to payroll size and the significant fiscal and due diligence requirements  		imposed by state and territorial governments.</p>
<p><b>5. Workers Compensation Endorsements On Homeowners And  		Tenants Insurance Policies</b></p>
<p>Some jurisdictions provide household employers with the option of  		purchasing workers compensation coverage for their domestic workers  		through an endorsement on their homeowners, or, in some cases,  		tenants insurance policies (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table12">Table 12</a>).  		Nineteen states,<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note56">56</a></font></sup> the  		District of Columbia and two U.S. territories (AS and NMI) reported that  		household employers could obtain workers compensation for their domestic  		service workers through this option (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table12">Table 12</a>). A  		least three states, (CA, NH, NJ) reported that availability of the  		homeowners/tenants insurance option was mandated by law.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p>NCCI endorsements fall into two major categories: general and state  		endorsements. General endorsements are broken down into federal, maritime  		miscellaneous coverage, and exclusion, premium and retrospective rating. State  		endorsements relate to matters such as deductibles, cancellation and  		non-renewal, special rating plans, and employee leasing. An important  		endorsement within the miscellaneous category is the Voluntary Compensation and  		Employers Liability Coverage for Residence Employees Endorsement (WC 00 03 12  		[Ed. 4-84]) (<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>). The endorsement was developed  		for use with Insurance Service Organization (ISO) homeowners insurance  		policies, comprehensive personal liability policies or other policies that  		provide similar personal liability coverage. The endorsement provides voluntary  		compensation and employers liability coverage for domestic service when not  		covered by a standard workers compensation policy.</p>
<p>NCCI has filed this endorsement for use in 39 states and the District of  		Columbia (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table12">Table 12</a>). However, 31 states (79.5%)  		reported either the endorsement was not being used or staff could not confirm  		that the endorsement was available for use. A number of states reported that  		property and casualty insurers (e.g., who typically write homeowners and  		tenants insurance) would be reluctant to write the endorsement,  		particularly if they did not have experience with workers compensation  		insurance. Moreover, they knew of very few carriers that actually wrote this  		endorsement with any frequency.</p>
<p>Some states have their own statutes that mandate the availability of  		workers compensation coverage for domestic service workers through a  		homeowners (or in some states, tenants) insurance policy. New  		Jersey Statutes Annotated Section 17:36-5.29, mandates that all  		homeowners and tenants insurance policies include workers  		compensation endorsement for occasional domestic service workers. The premium  		is $1.00/policy/year and covers occasional help (e.g., those who work less than  		40 hours/week) working in and around the home. The endorsement also covers  		workers who may have occasional driving duties (e.g., taking the person to the  		store or doctor). A homeowner must inform their insurance carrier if they hire  		one or more full-time workers under the endorsement. </p>
<p>The annual policy fee for full-time domestic service workers under the  		homeowners/tenants insurance option is $1 plus $60/full time person  		hired /policy/year. The endorsement may be purchased from a voluntary insurance  		carrier or the residual market. Household employers also have the option of  		purchasing a standard workers compensation insurance policy from the  		states voluntary or residual markets.</p>
<p>California, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York and American  		Samoa mandate the availability of workers compensation coverage for  		domestic service. Section 11590 of the CA Insurance Code mandates the  		availability of a workers compensation endorsement for domestic service  		workers in a homeowners insurance policy if coverage is not already  		available through a separate policy covering domestics. Carriers must submit  		their rating for this endorsement to the State Department of Insurance for  		approval. Carriers are permitted to modify the endorsement and the criteria for  		coverage (e.g., define the number of hours worked in order for a worker to be  		covered). The cost of the endorsement varies by carrier and carriers may choose  		not to write or renew an endorsement for a household employer based on specific  		policies. </p>
<p>In Nevada, Title 53, Chapter 616B, Section 32 of the Nevada Revised  		Statutes permits a private carrier to provide industrial insurance  		(workers compensation) as a part of a homeowners insurance policy  		to a person who employs a domestic service worker. A covered domestic service  		worker is defined as an individual who is employed more than 20 hours per week  		or earns $150/month if he/she is not employed more than 20 hours per week.  		Private carriers may, with approval of the commissioner, determine and fix the  		premium rates.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, Title XXII, Section 281-A:6 mandates that all  		insurance companies authorized to provide comprehensive personal liability,  		tenants or homeowners insurance must, in connection with such  		insurance, provide workers compensation insurance covering domestics  		unless the employer has a separate policy covering his/her workers. Premiums,  		rates and policy forms or endorsements used by a company to provide  		workers compensation insurance in accordance with the statute are subject  		to the approval of the insurance commissioner. The annual premium was quoted to  		be $3.00/policy. One drawback of the New Hampshire law is that individuals with  		disabilities can not take advantage of this option because the states  		workers compensation law prohibits a person with a disability from  		classifying his/her PAS worker as a domestic service worker. One state  		workers compensation agency staff person reported this feature was part  		supported by the states home health industry which has not supported the  		state implementing a self-directed support service model that allows individual  		service recipients to be the common law employer of their workers. Currently,  		New Hampshire only allows the Agency with Choice model to be used to implement  		self-directed support services where the agency and the service recipient have  		a joint employment relationship.</p>
<p>Since 1985, NY Insurance Law §3420(j) mandates that every  		homeowners insurance policy that provides comprehensive personal  		liability insurance on a one-; two-; three-; or four- family owner-occupied  		dwelling, must make available compensation coverage for employees who work less  		than 40 hours a week in and around the home, if and only if, they are covered  		employees under the law. The major shortfall of this provision is that domestic  		service workers are exempt from the states workers compensation law  		if the employee works less than 40 hours a week. Therefore, household employers  		who hire occasional domestic/PAS workers can not use this option and must  		purchase a standard workers compensation insurance policy to provide  		coverage for these workers (Stogel, 1998).</p>
<p>Colorado permits insurance carriers to provide workers  		compensation coverage through a homeowners insurance policy for  		occasional workers. Insurers can modify the endorsement to provide more  		coverage than insurance law requires. No statute or rate information was  		available from state agency staff.</p>
<p>With the exception of California, Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, New  		Jersey and New York, it is not clear how jurisdictions that reported the  		availability of workers compensation insurance coverage through  		homeowners and tenants insurance policies are administering the  		option and what it costs to purchase such an endorsement. Moreover, it is not  		clear how many carriers are writing the endorsement and how may household  		employers are purchasing it to cover their workers for workers  		compensation. Overall, the majority of state workers compensation and  		insurance agency staff contacted appeared to be not well versed regarding the  		availability and use of this option or the status of the endorsement filed with  		the state for use by NCCI for that purpose. </p>
<p>In the jurisdictions where the option is technically available, many  		workers compensation and insurance department staff reported that they  		knew of very few, if any, insurance carriers currently writing an endorsement  		for workers compensation for domestic service (outside of New Jersey,  		California and New Hampshire). It was reported that this was due, in part, to  		insurance carriers inexperience with workers compensation insurance  		and their perception that the domestic service classification group is high  		risk.</p>
<p>Finally, it may be risky for homeowners and tenants to have  		a workers compensation claim filed on his/her homeowners or  		tenants insurance policy that includes an endorsement for workers  		compensation insurance. Recently, there have been a number of articles in the  		press (both newspaper and television news), regarding the tightening of the  		homeowners insurance market and the difficulty that some homeowners have  		had filing insurance claims and subsequently having their homeowners  		insurance premiums significantly increased or their policies cancelled. For  		example, some insurance companies recommend that homeowners and tenants not  		file insurance claims under $500 to avoid either having their homeowners  		or tenants insurance premiums increased substantially or their policies  		cancelled. Although the prevalence of workers compensation claims for  		consumer-directed personal assistance has been low,<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note58">58</a></font></sup> one claim could be for a  		significant sum, depending on the nature of the injury. Homeowners may not want  		to risk having their homeowners insurance premiums substantially  		increased or policies cancelled (since homeowners insurance is usually a  		requirement of a mortgage) by having a workers compensation claim filed.  		Once a homeowners or tenants insurance policy containing a  		workers compensation insurance endorsement is cancelled, it may be  		difficult or impossible for the consumer to find a workers compensation  		endorsement for domestic service available through a states residual  		workers compensation insurance market.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note59">59</a></font></sup> Thus, publicly-funded self-directed support  		service programs and program participants who are common law employers of their  		personal care workers may prefer to obtain a separate standard workers  		compensation policy for their personal assistance workers, and either a  		homeowners or tenants insurance policy.</p>
<p><b>6. Alternative Workers Compensation Plan</b></p>
<p>The final option available to household employers to access  		workers compensation insurance for their domestic service workers is an  		Alternative Workers Compensation Plan. Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana  		provide employers, including householders, the option of purchasing an  		Alternative Workers Compensation Plan. The Plan is commercial insurance  		purchased in the voluntary market from life-health insurance companies. It may  		consist of any combination of life, disability, accident, health, or other  		insurance provided that the coverage insures without limitation or exclusion  		all of the workers compensation benefits as defined in the States  		workers compensation law. Sometimes the coverage is sold together with  		employer liability policies issued by affiliated or non-affiliated liability  		insurers. In the absence of an affiliation, the liability insurer would  		normally be a joint venturer, or involved in a strategic alliance  		or similar group enterprise with the life insurer (Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>Alabama was the only jurisdiction that reported the availability of  		Alternative Workers Compensation Plans for employers. However, there was  		a reference to the availability of Alternative Workers Compensation Plans  		for employers in Louisiana and Georgia, but, no further details could be  		obtained.</p>
<h3>D. What are Employment Classification Systems?</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental tasks in pricing workers compensation  		insurance is developing a system for classifying different workplace exposures  		into a system of codes, each one with a rate commensurate with the associated  		risk. For example, the classification of a clerical worker should carry a  		significantly lower rate than the code for a roofer, because the average  		workplace exposures of the two types of employment are quite different  		(Advanced Insurance Management, 2003).</p>
<p>In approximately 40 states and Guam, the classification system used is  		the one originally developed and currently maintained by the National Council  		on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). NCCI has  		developed and maintains approximately 600 classification codes covering a  		variety of workplace exposures including domestic service. NCCI publishes these  		codes in their manual, <i>National Scopes Manual</i> (NCCI, 2003). </p>
<p>In addition, a small number of jurisdictions either use a  		jurisdiction-specific code(s) that is included in the NCCI manual (e.g., MA,  		NV) or jurisdiction-specific codes that are maintained in jurisdiction-specific  		classification manuals (e.g., Puerto Rico) (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table  		7</a>).</p>
<p>In general, the NCCI classification system seeks to classify the overall  		business enterprise of an employer, not the particular work performed by  		specific employees. For that reason, a janitor working at a manufacturing plan  		will be assigned to the overall manufacturing classification used by the plant,  		not to a janitorial classification. However, the NCCI classification system  		makes an exception to this approach for construction-type classifications. For  		these employers, multiple classifications may be assigned to employees,  		depending on the actual work done (e.g., a clerical worker versus a  		construction worker) (Advanced Insurance Management, 2003).</p>
<p>A basic tenet of an employment classification systems is, the more  		credible the data used to develop a classification, the better the  		classification will reflect the risks of workplace exposure associated with the  		business enterprise and the better the rates and premiums will cover the risk.  		When accurate and credible data are available, the classification system can be  		self-correcting, and codes can be updated as needed to reflect the new risk  		information.</p>
<p>Some might argue that developing codes solely based on the overall  		business enterprise, without considering the tasks performed by specific  		employees, does not accurately measure the risk of workplace exposure. For  		example, under the code 0913, Domestic Service, Inside (Full-time), the  		business enterprise provided in and around a residence is defined in broad  		terms.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note60">60</a></font></sup> However, the  		terminology used to define domestic service may not accurately measure the risk  		of workplace exposure, particularly for PAS workers. For example, the risk of  		workplace injury for a housekeeper providing chore services may be different  		than for a PAS worker providing both chore and personal assistance  		services.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note61">61</a></font></sup></p>
<p>However, focusing solely on specific workers tasks, to the  		exclusion of the overall business enterprise, also may not accurately measure  		risk of workplace exposure. For example, workplace exposure for a domestic  		service worker providing chore and PAS for one household employer may be  		different than a PAS worker working for an agency-based provider who sends the  		worker out to multiple clients in different home-settings on a daily basis.  		This may be due in part because the agency-based PAS worker is serving more  		clients and traveling more, thus having more opportunity for injury.</p>
<p>In developing and maintaining employment classification codes,  		jurisdictions must address at least two issues. First, are a sufficient number  		of employers included in the employment classification code to provide  		meaningful risk information and to spread the risk and associated costs?  		Second, how should the jurisdiction balance the employer classification  		codes ability to predict risk of workplace exposure with the time, effort  		and costs required to collect and analyze the required data to maximize the  		codes predictive ability?</p>
<p><b>1. Are Personal Assistance Services Included Under the Domestic  		Service Classification?</b></p>
<p>Developing and maintaining employer classification systems and  		determining what the proper employment classification code is for a particular  		employer is not always an easy task. It is particularly difficult for household  		employers who employ PAS workers.</p>
<p>There are four NCCI employment classification codes that specifically  		apply to domestic/personal assistance services activities:</p>
<ul><li>0908   Domestic Workers  Inside   		  Occasional,</li>
<li>0913   Domestic Workers - Inside (Full-time),</li>
<li>0909   Domestic Workers  Outside   		  Occasional  Including Occasional Private Chauffeurs, and</li>
<li>0912   Domestic Service  Out-Side  		  (Full-time).</li>
</ul><p>There is also code 0917, Domestic Service Contractor, which applies to  		employers furnishing employees under contract for domestic service performed  		inside a customers residence and includes operation of training schools.  		Since this category is not applicable for household employers, it was not  		included in the study.</p>
<p>The two codes that are primarily used for PAS workers are 0908 Domestic  		Workers  Inside  Occasional and 0913 Domestic Workers  Inside  		(Full-time). The two worker categories within these codes cited by  		workers compensation program and rating staff as reflecting personal  		assistance services are nurse and companion. Although  		the majority of state agency staff reported that personal care fell under  		domestic service primarily due to the nurse and  		companion categories they also reported that the final  		determination of a workers employment classification would be based on  		the results of a workers compensation claim appeal.</p>
<p>There are three tasks that may be performed by a PAS worker that are  		particularly troublesome for workers compensation program and rating  		staff to reconcile when determining what classification code PAS workers should  		fall into. These are:(1) assisting with the administration of prescription  		medication that would be administered by the individual in the absence of the  		disability, (2) providing occasional transportation, and (3) assisting with  		bowel and bladder and related health needs. The majority of jurisdictions  		reported that if a worker assists with the administration of medications, the  		worker would automatically move out of the domestic service classification  		category.</p>
<p>Jurisdictions were mixed regarding their approach to managing occasional  		driving. Workers compensation insurance staff in Maryland and Nebraska  		reported that occasional driving was included in classification code 0913.  		However, New Jersey Rating Bureau staff reported that if occasional driving was  		provided, the worker should be classified as 0912 Private Residences   		Outside, Full-time (<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>), to reflect the  		increased risk associated with driving even though 90 percent of the  		workers tasks fall under Domestic, In-servant.</p>
<p>Some workers compensation agency staff reported being concerned  		with the potential risk associated with a PAS worker assisting with  		bowel/bladder and related health needs but had no clear policy on how they  		would address it except to say that they would review each situation on a  		case-by-case basis. Again, the final determination of what workers  		compensation employment classification a PAS worker assisting with  		bowel/bladder and related health needs would fall into, would be based on the  		result of a workers compensation claims appeal decision.</p>
<p>However, only classification codes 0918 Domestic Service Workers   		Inside  Physical Assistance (MA), 9002 Domestic (ND), and 0912-011  		Domestic Service and Housekeepers (PR) specifically include personal  		assistance/attendant care services (<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>). In  		addition, Wisconsin has developed policy separating PAS workers (e.g., home  		care providers hired by household employers) from domestic service. However,  		both domestic service and home care providers are exempt from the states  		workers compensation law and both types of workers are rated under the  		domestic service classification codes (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). </p>
<p>New Hampshires workers compensation law states that  		household employers with disabilities who have PAS workers cannot consider  		their workers as domestic servants (See <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). New  		Hampshire Title XXIII §281-A:2 V-b(a) states Domestic labor or  		domestic services mean the performance of such duties as housekeeping,  		childcare, gardening, handy person work, and serving as a companion or  		caregiver for children or others who are not physically or mentally  		infirmed. This law was supported by the states home health services  		industry that was opposed to the state implementing self-directed support  		service programs where the service recipient or his or her representative was  		the common law employer of the PAS worker.</p>
<p>Minnesota workers compensation law states that if funding for  		services comes directly from the State commissioner of human services, then the  		worker is an employee of the state for workers compensation purposes (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). Minnesota Statute 2002 §176 subd. 9(17)  		states that a worker who renders in-home attendant care services to a  		physically handicapped person, and who is paid directly by the commissioner of  		human services for these services, shall be the employee of the state within  		the meaning of this subdivision (workers compensation) but for no other  		purpose. This corresponds with an unemployment law in Minnesota stating that  		individuals with disabilities who receive public funds for their service may  		not be considered the employer of their workers. The Minnesota law was enacted  		in response to an unfavorable experience the encountered in treating PAS  		workers as independent providers (e.g., independent contractors).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Massachusetts has successfully blended aspects of both the overall  		business enterprise (e.g., domestic service) and employee-specific tasks for a  		PAS worker in developing classification code 0918 Domestic Service Workers  		 Inside  Physical Assistance (both part and full-time). The State  		has left the code under the domestic service classification (09) (which applied  		to household employers) while effectively describing the occupation of a PAS  		worker and the tasks he/she might perform for a household employer who may have  		a functional disability (<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>). </p>
<p><b>2. Workers Compensation Case Law Related to Domestic Service  		and Personal Assistance Service Workers</b></p>
<p>Ambiguities in workers compensation statutes frequently are  		resolved in favor of coverage and otherwise valid claims frequently are not  		denied on the basis of a technicality (Nackley, 1989).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note63">63</a></font></sup> This was seen a number of times in the case  		law reviewed for this study, in particular when a worker not covered under the  		statute filed a workers compensation claim when no insurance was  		available to cover the claim.</p>
<p>This study reviewed workers compensation cases that were related  		to domestic service and PAS workers decided in 16 jurisdictions<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note64">64</a></font></sup> (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>). Five of them specifically involved  		publicly-funded support service programs.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note65">65</a></font></sup> A number of themes emerged from the cases  		reviewed.</p>
<p>The majority of the cases reviewed involved whether there is an  		employer-employee relationship<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note66">66</a></font></sup>  a pre-requisite to the obligation to  		provide workers compensation insurance coverage  or the nature of  		the employees services<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note67">67</a></font></sup>  which are sometimes partially or  		fully exempted if they are considered domestic services or do not meet minimum  		weekly hours worked. The decisions are often fact-specific or rest on creative  		legal theories not likely to be known to or anticipated by household employers,  		service recipients or self-directed support service staff. Workers with  		professional licenses, in some cases, are considered independent contractors  		(e.g., registered nurse, licensed therapist), not employees, and are therefore  		are deemed outside the protection of the workers compensation  		system.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note68">68</a></font></sup> If the  		services are deemed to be for an individual rather than for the household in  		general<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note69">69</a></font></sup> or include  		sufficient practical nursing<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note70">70</a></font></sup> then coverage might be found because it is  		determined that the common domestic service exemption does not apply.</p>
<p>The tendency of a workers compensation law judge to attempt to  		find coverage for an injured worker under the workers compensation system  		is sometimes counterbalanced by concern for household employers who face great  		uncertainty about their obligations to provide coverage and their inability to  		pass on their coverage costs to some type of customers.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note71">71</a></font></sup> On the other hand, sometimes courts and  		administrative agencies go to great lengths to find an employer that will  		afford coverage, stretching employment concepts to find a dual  		employment relationship with employers that do not benefit from relevant  		exclusions from coverage. For example, decision makers might find that a  		domestic service exclusion applies to protect a household employer from the  		obligation to provide coverage but nevertheless find an obligation for a state  		agency to be an employer by virtue of its role in funding or other aspect of  		the workers employment.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note72">72</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, in one state, it appears that the state workers  		compensation hearing officers were confused about the role of the  		Fiscal/Employer Agent operating under section 3504 of the IRS code for  		publicly-funded self-directed support service programs. In both Pennsylvania  		workers compensation settlements, the workers compensation hearing  		officer required the Fiscal/Employer Agent to provide workers  		compensation insurance coverage for the worker even though the service  		recipients had separate workers compensation insurance policies executed  		through the States Domestic Service Exemption Program for this  		purpose.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note73">73</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The only thing that one can say with <i>certainty</i> after reviewing  		the cases cited in this study is that a household employer faces great  		<i>uncertainty</i> when trying to assess the obligation to provide  		workers compensation insurance coverage for a worker providing personal  		assistance services to a member of that household. One way to address this  		uncertainty is for the household employer, or in the case of publicly-funded  		self-directed support service programs, the program agency, to arrange and pay  		for workers compensation insurance for personal assistance workers who  		work directly for service recipients in and around their homes. However, state  		self-directed support service program staff must make sure that states  		workers compensation agency staff, including the division responsible for  		claims adjudication, are fully briefed on the key features of the program and  		the Fiscal/Employer Agent function. Hopefully, this will prevent issues such as  		those that occurred in Pennsylvania from occurring in the future.</p>
<h3>E. Establishing Workers Compensation Rates and  		Premiums</h3>
<p>A number of methods are used by jurisdictions to establish workers  		compensation rates and premiums. The following describes the key methods  		used.</p>
<p><b>1. Establishing Standard Rates </b></p>
<p>Jurisdictions reported using two basic pricing methods for setting  		workers compensation rates for employment classification codes for the  		voluntary market: administered and competitive pricing. Administered pricing is  		the setting of full manual rates by a rating organization subject to insurance  		department approval, for use by all insurers that come under the jurisdiction  		of the rating organization. Manual rating is a process by which historic  		insurance statistical information is compiled, analyzed and projected into the  		future by trained actuarial professionals in order to produce manual premium  		rates (Lencsis, 1998). Eleven states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note74">74</a></font></sup> use administered pricing methods to  		establish rates for the voluntary workers compensation insurance  		market.</p>
<p>Competitive pricing, in contrast, is the setting of advisory rates or  		loss costs by a rating bureau or an advisory association (NCCI), often subject  		to a jurisdictions department of insurance approval, on behalf of its  		member insurers. Under competitive rating laws, insurers may be allowed to file  		for deviations from advisory rates, be required to file their own rates based  		on the advisory loss costs, or be allowed to file their own independent rates  		or loss costs with or without using advisory indications, depending on the  		state (American Academy of Actuaries, 2000). Thirty-nine states, the District  		of Columbia and three U.S. territories use competitive pricing methods to  		establish rates for the voluntary insurance market (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table3">Table  		3</a>).</p>
<p>In a competitive pricing environment, the role of the rating bureau or  		advisory organization is to collect historical (actual) loss information, to  		apply actuarial techniques called loss development and loss  		trending to loss information and to produce either advisory loss costs  		(NCCI states) or advisory pure premiums (e.g., MD) for each  		employment classification code. Loss costs or a pure premium are the part of  		the premium rate attributable only to losses and loss adjustment expense. There  		are no general expenses, taxes or profits included in these costs. This  		information is usually filed with the states department of insurance  		annually for review (e.g., including conducting rate hearings) and approval  		(Lencsis, 1998).</p>
<p>After the loss costs or pure premiums are approved and published, each  		individual insurer must make a filing with the state department of insurance  		adopting them with or without modification. In addition, they must file, their  		own specific proposed loss cost multiplier(s) for each employment  		classification code (and for each risk tier the state permits insurers to  		generate deviated standard rates). General expenses, taxes and profit are  		included in the loss costs multiplier (Lencsis, 1998). A standard premium is  		computed by multiplying the advisory loss costs by the loss costs multiplier  		for each classification code (and risk tier, if applicable). Then other factors  		may be applied to the standard premium based on state insurance rules and the  		insurers policies and procedures. Even in competitive rating states,  		standard premium rates for policies under the residual market (e.g., Assigned  		Risk Plans) are usually the result of a separate administered pricing system  		whereby the rating organization files final rates for use by all assigned risk  		carriers. </p>
<p>Once workers compensation rates are computed and approved by a  		state insurance department, they are compiled in manuals (and often published  		on state insurance agency web sites). One important resource is the multi-state  		<i>Basic Manual of Workers Compensation and Employers Liability  		Insurance</i>, prepared and published by NCCI. The NCCI manual applies to  		jurisdictions that do not have independent rating bureaus or have exclusive  		state insurance funds.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note75">75</a></font></sup> The manual has three major parts, Rules,  		Classifications, and Rate and State Exceptions. It is updated on an ongoing  		basis as rate revisions and other changes occur (Lencsis, 1998). Household  		employers should be careful when reviewing standard rates for carriers since  		they only reflect a portion of the total premium he or she will be paying for  		his/her domestic service workers.</p>
<p><b>2. Establishing Premiums </b></p>
<p>In order to determine a premium for a classification code a number of  		other constants, adjustments and assessments may be computed and applied to a  		standard rate. An expense constant frequently is applied to the standard  		premium. It was reported that in some states the expense constant is included  		in the loss costs multiplier. This constant reflects the administrative costs  		to the insurance carrier if the policy were cancelled prematurely by the  		consumer-employer. The expense constant can be mandated by a state or vary by  		insurer and the amount can very significantly by state. For example, the  		expense constant in Montana was reported to be $115 whereas, in New York it was  		reported to be $180.</p>
<p>Often experience rating is applied to a standard premium rate. It is an  		adjustment to the standard premium rate for a current policy based on the  		insureds claims experience during earlier periods of coverage (Lencsis,  		1998). Whether or not experience rating is applied to a standard premium rate  		depends on the size of an employers total premiums over a one-to-two year  		period. For example, in Mississippi, an employer must have $4,500 in premiums  		annually, whereas, in Kentucky an employer must have $10,000 in premiums over a  		two-year period. As a result, experience rating may or may not be applied to a  		premium for domestic service and its application will vary by state.</p>
<p>Schedule rating is another adjustment that may be applied to the  		standard premium rates. This is a discretionary premium adjustment based on the  		underwriters evaluation of special characteristics of a risk not  		reflected in experience rating (Advanced Insurance Management, 2003). Whether  		or not schedule rating is applied to a standard premium rate often depends on  		whether the employer is experience rated. Some states do not allow schedule  		rating, particularly in the residual market while other states leave it to the  		discretion of the insurance carrier.</p>
<p>A number of special assessments may be applied to the standard premium  		rate to compute a premium for employer. They include, but are not limited  		to:</p>
<ul><li>Second, Subsequent and/or Multiple Injury Fund assessments;</li>
<li>Assessments to fund the States Workers Compensation  		  System; and </li>
<li>Terrorism assessments (as a result of the terrorism attack of  		  9/11/01).</li>
</ul><p>Some states may apply a special assessment to premiums used by carriers  		servicing the Assigned Risk Plan. For example, Idaho applies a 30 percent  		Assigned Risk Premium Surcharge to the premiums used for the states  		Assigned Risk Plan.</p>
<p>A small number of states allow insurers to establish tiered  		rates (e.g., deviations from the standard rates within a classification  		code, Maine and Utah). For example, Utah uses a three-tier system, Nonstandard,  		Standard and Preferred. State staff reported that household employers would  		fall in the nonstandard tier if he or she was a new employer or had a 100  		percent loss ratio. The only way a household employer can get into the  		Preferred tier is if he/she had a loss ratio of 50 percent or less. </p>
<p>States reported that standard rates and premiums for the domestic  		service classification codes are expressed per capita, per $100 payroll, per  		hour worked, or per household policy (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>,  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a>, and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>). The per  		capita method is used most frequently by jurisdictions for domestic service  		classification codes. Forty states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note76">76</a></font></sup> and the District of Columbia express  		standard rates for domestic service in per capita terms. The per capita method  		is good for insurers because each worker has a premium computed that hopefully  		covers the risk of workplace exposure. It should be noted, however, that a  		number of insurers in various states reported that because domestic service  		premiums tend to be low in comparison to other business enterprises, one large  		claim can often use up all the premiums paid and then some.</p>
<p>The per capita approach also can result in significant tracking and  		paperwork activities, and related expense, for household employers and  		insurers. Domestic service workers, and in particular, PAS workers, often work  		part-time and turnover of staff can be significant. Under the per capita  		approach, premiums often are computed for each worker employed by the household  		employer. In addition, employers and insurers must keep track of the number of  		employees working in the home on an ongoing basis to make sure that the proper  		coverage has been obtained and premiums charged. Some states (e.g., PA) and  		NCCI have tried to streamline the rate and premiums setting process and to find  		economies for premiums by developing a part-time rate/premium setting  		methodology. Under such methods, an employer may have three part-time workers  		who work in a total of 40 hours. Instead of paying three premiums, the employer  		would pay two premiums (e.g., 40/20 (the part-time threshold figure) = 2). A  		problem identified regarding the part-time methodology was not all NCCI states  		and NCCI regional staff reported that they were aware of this methodology or  		used it. Rather, they reported establishing rates and premiums on a per  		capita (e.g., per worker) basis.</p>
<p>The per $100 payroll method streamlines the process for  		establishing rates and premiums for household employers because the employer no  		longer needs to count heads and premium covers all workers employed  		in the household under the particular classification code for the policy. This  		is a beneficial feature for the household employer however, it could introduce  		added risk of workplace exposure for the insurer. For example, a household  		employer might hire one worker and have an annual payroll of $10,000. Then the  		worker stops working for the employer and the employer replaces the worker with  		two workers at the same payroll amount ($10,000). Insurers feel the risk of  		workplace exposure now is greater because there are two workers who could be  		injured on the job versus one. However, the premium remains the same. Nine  		states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note77">77</a></font></sup> and five U.S.  		territories<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note78">78</a></font></sup> reported  		using the per $100 payroll method for computing standard rates  		which resulted in premiums that were per household policy for  		household employers who hired domestic service workers (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>, <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>). It should be noted that at least two states,  		(e.g., CA and TX) use both approaches to establishing rates and premiums. They  		use the per capita approach when computing rates and premiums for occasional  		domestic service workers and they use the per $100/payroll and the per  		household policy approach when computing full-time rates and premiums,  		respectively.</p>
<p>Washington State is the only state that uses the per hour  		worked and per household policy approach to establish rates  		and premiums, respectively. The theory behind the per hours worked approach is  		that the more hours worked by domestic employees for a household employer the  		greater the possible risk of workplace exposure, resulting in premiums that  		effectively reflect the potential risk of workplace exposure for all workers  		employed. However, this method is dependent on good time sheet data. This  		typically would be readily available from the Fiscal/Employer Agent, however,  		its unclear if household employers paying their domestic service workers  		out-of-pocket would be able to provide accurate hours information on a  		consistent basis.</p>
<p>New Jersey is the only state that establishes both rates and premiums  		based on an all inclusive (for the classification code) per household policy  		method for occasional domestic service workers. They use the per capita method  		to compute rates and premiums for full-time domestic service workers.</p>
<p>Finally, workers compensation insurance is initially written based  		on estimated premiums. This is because it is not possible to know ahead of time  		exactly how many workers will be employed by or what the exact payroll will be  		for an employer. Thus, once a policy year ends, there is normally some kind of  		effort made by the insurance carrier to determine actual number of  		workers/total actual payroll for the policy period. Depending on the size of  		the premiums, an insurance carrier might send a premium auditor to determine  		actual number of workers/total payroll. After this information is collected,  		the insurance carrier will compute and issue an audited premium to  		the employer (Advanced Insurance Management, 2003).</p>
<p><b>3. What are Minimum Premiums?</b></p>
<p>A minimum premium is the lowest premium required to provide insurance  		under a standard policy in a particular insurance market and jurisdiction. For  		the household employer, this means the minimum premium amount is the least  		he/she will pay for a premium in the state. Minimum premiums can vary by market  		(voluntary, state fund and residual) and by jurisdiction, however actual  		premiums vary by insurer and employer in the voluntary insurance market.  		Therefore, it was decided to report premium information using minimum premiums  		in order to assess the affordability of workers compensation insurance  		for household employers who employ domestic/PAS workers in a consistent manner  		by the insurance market (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>, <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>).</p>
<p>A number of jurisdictions reported minimum premiums based on an employer  		hypothetically having no payroll. They advised household employers  		to purchase at least this level of coverage so they can demonstrate they have a  		basic level of coverage should their worker be injured and file a claim.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIV" id="sectionIV">IV. WHICH JURISDICTIONS AFFORD HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYERS  		ACCESS TO WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR THEIR DOMESTIC SERVICE/PERSONAL  		ASSISTANCE SERVICE WORKERS? HOW DOES ACCESS VARY BY INSURANCE MARKET AND  		JURISDICTION?</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of factors that affect a household employers  		access to workers compensation insurance for their domestic and PAS  		workers. The factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Statutory requirements;</li>
<li>Insurance agents/producers willingness to process household  		  employers applications with voluntary carriers;</li>
<li>Insurance carriers willingness to write policies for household  		  employers;</li>
<li>The requirement to use an insurance agent/producer;</li>
<li>The requirement to obtain refusals (declination letters) from the  		  voluntary market to access the residual market; and</li>
<li>The cost of workers compensation insurance premiums.</li>
</ul><p>Except for Wyoming, all states, the District of Columbia and the five  		U.S. territories<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note79">79</a></font></sup>  		allow household employers of domestic service workers to elect to provide  		workers compensation coverage for their worker (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table1">Table 1</a>). </p>
<p>The following discusses the level of access to workers  		compensation insurance for household employers by insurance market sector.</p>
<h3>A. Voluntary Insurance Market</h3>
<p>State workers compensation agency staff in the majority of  		jurisdictions reported that access to workers compensation insurance for  		household employers in the voluntary market is extremely limited and in some  		cases, non-existent (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table3">Table 3</a>). The major  		reasons reported were small payrolls with small premiums, significant  		administrative paperwork and related costs, and perceived risk of liability  		related to the domestic service classification and, in particular, related to  		PAS workers (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table3">Table 3</a>). </p>
<p>Using an insurance agent/producer could be seen as both an advantage and  		a barrier to accessing the voluntary market. Conventional wisdom says that  		using an insurance agent/producer facilitates a household employers  		accessing workers compensation insurance since the agent understands the  		insurance business and can provide the voluntary carrier with the information  		it needs to process a household employers application in an efficient  		manner. However, state workers compensation agency staff reported that  		using an insurance agent can be a barrier for a household employer accessing  		the voluntary market for a number of reasons. First, not all agents are  		familiar with workers compensation insurance. If he or she is not  		knowledgeable regarding workers compensation laws and policies for  		household employers in his or her jurisdiction, access could be more difficult  		and the policy more costly.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note80">80</a></font></sup> Second, insurance agents may have little or  		no incentive to process a household employers application with a private  		insurer due to the low fee they receive and the administrative burden and  		associated costs related to processing policies for individual household  		employers. Insurance agents typically receive $15-20 for each policy they  		broker. Insurance agents reported that their administrative fee does not cover  		the cost of managing the administrative paperwork and does not provide a  		reasonable return.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note81">81</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Twenty-four states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note82">82</a></font></sup> and the District of Columbia require and 10  		states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note83">83</a></font></sup> recommend  		household employers use insurance agents/producers when accessing workers  		compensation through the residual workers compensation insurance market.  		In California, using and insurance agent/producer is optional (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table10">Table 10</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>). One  		insurance agent in Massachusetts suggested a minimum number of policies (3,600)  		and premiums ($1.3 million) that might provide an insurance agent and a  		voluntary insurance carrier with the incentive to write workers  		compensation insurance policies for a group of household employers such as  		those enrolled in publicly-funded self-directed support service programs that  		use Fiscal/Employer Agents.</p>
<h3>B. Exclusive and Competitive State Insurance Funds</h3>
<p>Household employers had the best success accessing workers  		compensation insurance from exclusive state insurance funds, with the exception  		of Wyoming (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table10">Table 10</a>). The primary reason for this  		was that the Fund was the only source of workers compensation insurance  		in a state and, in general, accepted all comers. Household employers had  		moderate success accessing workers compensation insurance from  		competitive state insurance funds. In fact, a number of competitive state  		insurance funds provided a high level of access (CA and PA). </p>
<p>For example, in California, the State Compensation Insurance Fund is the  		only source of workers compensation insurance for household employers  		hiring domestic service workers, however, they are supposed to make an attempt  		to cover their workers through an endorsement for workers compensation on  		their homeowners policies first. In addition, Pennsylvania has developed  		a streamlined Domestic Service Exemption Policy for household  		employers guaranteeing access to workers compensation insurance at a  		relatively affordable price.</p>
<p>Not all competitive State Insurance Funds are enthusiastic about proving  		workers compensation insurance to household employers. During an economic  		slowdown in 1989, the Oregon SAIF reportedly cancelled policies for  		approximately 10,000 small employers. This resulted in a significant outcry  		across the State that the SAIF was no longer a main street insurer  		(Oregonians for Accountability, 2003). In addition, SAIF staff reported that  		they were concerned about household employees being a high risk for  		work-related injury but did not provide any specific examples or  		statistics to support their argument.</p>
<h3>C. Insurers/Markets of Last Resort</h3>
<p>Although many Insurers/Markets of Last Resort, have an  		explicit or implicit mandate to serve small and moderate sized employers,  		overall they were less likely than exclusive and competitive state insurance  		funds to provide workers compensation insurance coverage for household  		employers who hire domestic servants (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>). For  		example, staff at the Minnesota State Mutual Fund Company reported that even  		though they focus on small to medium-sized employers, they probably would not  		write a policy for a household employer. In addition, an agent/producer (which  		is required to be used to access the company) probably would not approach the  		company with a household employers application due to low fee ($15-20 per  		policy) compared to the paperwork burden. Thus, the household employer would  		have to go to the States Assigned Risk Plan to access workers  		compensation insurance (which also requires that an agent be used).</p>
<p>Arizona and New Mexico are examples of states that more effectively  		focus the mission of their insurer/market of last resort towards small to  		moderate sized employers. This approach provides small and moderate sized  		employers with an alternative to purchasing workers compensation  		insurance other than the states residual market (e.g., Assigned Risk  		Pool). However, it is to be determined exactly how useful this option will be  		for household employers residing in Arizona and New Mexico who wish to purchase  		workers compensation insurance for their in-home domestic service  		workers, including personal assistance workers.</p>
<h3>D. Residual Insurance Market</h3>
<p>Household access to workers compensation insurance through  		residual markets in the majority of jurisdictions is at least moderate,  		particularly in states that have both insurers/markets of last  		resort and Assigned Risk Plans (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>).  		However, the key to access in this market depends on: (1) whether an employer  		must use an agent, (2) how many declination letters must be obtained, and (3)  		the price of the premiums. Twenty-four states and the District of  		Columbias Assigned Risk Plans and or market/insurer of last resort  		require that an employer use an insurance agent/producer to access the residual  		market (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table11">Table 11</a>). The majority of states that  		require declination letters require at least two.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note84">84</a></font></sup> Michigan and North Carolina do not require  		any declination letters. Georgia requires four declination letters. Insurance  		agents willing to broker workers compensation insurance for a household  		employer often can facilitate the receipt of declination letters from the  		voluntary insurance market.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether a household employer in states where domestic  		service is exempt from a states workers compensation law can access  		an Assigned Risk Plan administered by NCCI. At first NCCI staff reported this  		was not be possible. Subsequently, it was reported that it would be up to the  		state workers compensation agency (all of which said householders could  		access coverage through the States Assigned Risk Plan) and the direct  		assignment or servicing carrier that NCCI assigned the application. The only  		case reported where an application from an employer in an exempt classification  		(domestic service) was denied by a direct assignment or serving carrier was in  		Vermont related to its self-directed support service programs. According to  		NCCI staff, Vermont is currently working with NCCI (the States Assigned  		Risk Plan administrator) to develop an effective process to cover  		consumer-employers who are enrolled in the various self-directed support  		services programs operating in the State.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionV" id="sectionV">V. HOW DOES THE COST OF WORKERS COMPENSATION  		INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYERS VARY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND  		MARKETS?</a></h2>
<p>The workers compensation insurance premiums for household  		employers who employ domestic service workers, including PAS workers, vary  		significantly by insurance market and jurisdiction (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table  		4</a>, <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a> and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>).  		Minimum premium information from the various jurisdictions and markets was  		analyzed as a proxy for actual premiums in the various insurance markets  		because minimum premiums represent the lowest premiums that would be paid by an  		employer in order to provide insurance under a standard policy. </p>
<p>It should be noted that jurisdictions that establish workers  		compensation insurance rates and premiums on a per capita basis may cost the  		household employer more in total premiums paid due to the fact that rates and  		premiums are per employee versus per household.  		Moreover, it also should be noted that minimum premiums for the occasional  		worker classifications often cover up to two part-time workers.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note85">85</a></font></sup> The following discusses the  		affordability of workers compensation insurance for household employers  		of domestic service/PAS workers by insurance market and jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>A. Voluntary Insurance Market</h3>
<p>It was not possible to analyze workers compensation insurance  		premiums in the voluntary insurance market since they vary by insurance  		carrier. However, it was possible to evaluate minimum premiums for the  		administered pricing states (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a>). Minimum  		premiums for Domestic Service, Inside, Occasional (Classification 0908) for  		states that use administered pricing ranged from a low of $16.00 per year per  		household policy in New Jersey (actual premium rather than minimum premium) to  		a high of $427.00 per capita per year in Florida. If a Floridian has more than  		two part-time domestic/personal care workers, the cost of workers  		compensation insurance can become prohibitive very quickly.</p>
<p>The minimum premiums for Domestic Service, Inside, Full-time,  		(Classification 0913) ranged from a low of $76.00 per year per household policy  		(actual premium in NJ) to $750 per capita per year in Florida. Moreover, if a  		Floridian had more than two full-time domestic/personal care workers, the cost  		of workers compensation insurance could become prohibitive very quickly.  		New Jersey was found to offer the most affordable workers compensation  		premiums of all the jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>B. State Insurance Funds</h3>
<p>In general, minimum premiums for states and U.S. territories with State  		Insurance Funds were less than residual workers compensation insurance  		market<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note86">86</a></font></sup>. They also  		tended to use the per $100/payroll and per household policy methods to  		establish rates and premiums more often (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>).  		Minimum premiums for state insurance funds for Domestic Service, Inside,  		Occasional (Classification 0908) ranged from a low of $130.88 per year  		household policy in New York to a high of $400 per year per capita in Utah.  		Minimum premiums for state insurance funds for Domestic Service, Inside,  		Full-time (Classification 0913) ranged from a low of $175 per household policy  		per year in Maryland to a high of $505 per year per capita in Pennsylvania.</p>
<h3>C. Residual Insurance Market</h3>
<p>In general, minimum premiums for the residual insurance market were the  		highest for household employers and used the per capita rate and premium method  		most often (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>). Minimum premiums for the  		residual market for Domestic Service, Inside, Occasional (Classification 0908)  		ranged from a low of $130.88 per year household policy in New York to a high of  		$664 per year per capita in Florida. Minimum premiums for the residual  		insurance market for Domestic Service, Inside, Full-time (Classification 0913)  		ranged from a low of $175 per household policy per year in Maryland to a high  		of $1,542 per year capita in Florida.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionVI" id="sectionVI">VI. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES REGARDING THE  		ADMINISTRATION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEMS AND PROVIDING INSURANCE  		FOR DOMESTIC SERVICE AND PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICE WORKERS</a></h2>
<p>Workers compensation agency staff and insurance carriers in  		reported a number of issues and challenges regarding the administration of  		workers compensation systems and providing insurance for domestic service  		and PAS workers (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table13">Table 13</a>). The most frequently  		reported issue or challenge was related to classifying personal assistance  		under domestic service. Forty-five states, the District of Columbia and two  		territories (Guam and the Virgin Islands) reported that final determination of  		whether a PAS worker is included in the domestic service classification code  		for workers compensation purposes could only be determined based on the  		results of a claim appeal decision. This represents significant uncertainty for  		household employers, particularly those living in states where domestic service  		workers are exempt from the workers compensation law. A decision that a  		worker is nonexempt not only means that the household employer would have to  		incur the expense of workers compensation insurance but also additional  		expenses related to penalties for non-coverage and risk of possible tort  		liability.</p>
<p>Another issue reported was that household employers access to the  		voluntary insurance market is very limited. Of the 28 states that reported  		limited access to the voluntary market for household employers, five  		states<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note87">87</a></font></sup> reported that  		the voluntary market was non-existent for household employers.  		Workers compensation agency staff in Kentucky reported it was  		virtually impossible for household employers to access the  		voluntary insurance market. The major reason reported was that voluntary  		insurers carriers have little financial incentive to write policies for small  		(household) employers due to small payrolls and premiums; and significant  		burden and cost of paperwork; and the perceived risk related to household  		employers.</p>
<p>Maryland, New Jersey and the District of Columbia workers  		compensation agency staff reported that insurance agents/producers may not have  		a financial incentive to broker workers compensation insurance with an  		insurance carrier for household employers. The primary reason given was the  		amount of paperwork and cost related to processing a large number of individual  		employer applications compared to the small fee ($15-20.00/policy) agencies  		receive to broker workers compensation insurance with insurance carriers  		for this type of employer. The insurance agent that brokers workers  		compensation insurance policies for service recipients enrolled in the New  		Jersey Personal Preference Program, for example, stopped performing this  		function in the Fall of 2003 because of the costs associated with processing  		large numbers (500) of initial individual policies and policy renewals.  		Workers compensation agency staff in Maryland added that it is very  		important to use an insurance agent who is familiar with workers  		compensation insurance, otherwise it could limit access to insurance and be  		more costly for the household employer. </p>
<p>Four states workers compensation agency staff<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note88">88</a></font></sup> reported that the premiums for household  		employers tended to be low and may not cover the cost of losses incurred.  		Moreover, staff at the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation reported  		occasional users of domestic services should not be allowed to avoid tort  		liability at a cost unfairly low for the employer, and because of low premiums,  		unreasonably high to the State workers compensation system.</p>
<p>Workers compensation agency staff in Montana, South Carolina,  		Tennessee and Virginia indicated that determining who is included under  		domestic service and who is not is a particular challenge, especially  		determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.  		Virginia workers compensation agency staff reported that they consider  		the majority of domestic service workers to be independent contractors,  		contrary to IRS policy. Workers compensation staff in Montana reported,  		its difficult to verify that workers are performing the duties that  		are included in the domestic service classifications.</p>
<p>Two states with self-directed support service programs (MA and NJ)  		reported low and no workers compensation claims, respectively since  		workers compensation policies were purchased for all service  		recipients workers three years ago. For the period 2001-2002, Atlantic  		Charter received approximately $2,380,620 in audited premiums. For that same  		period, the insurer paid out $489,900 for 68 claims based on a total payroll of  		$119,385.197.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note89">89</a></font></sup> As of  		March 31, 2004, no workers compensation insurance claims had been filed  		for PAS workers working for service recipients enrolled in the New Jersey  		Personal Preference Program. However, less than a dozen workers have filed  		disability insurance claims with the state.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note90">90</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, Maine Employers Mutual Insurance Company (MEMIC)  		reported experiencing significant losses related to household employers who had  		purchased workers compensation for their domestic service workers. MEMIC  		is the insurer for one state-funded and two Medicaid-funded self-directed  		support service programs administered by Alpha One in South Portland, Maine.  		Staff at the Louisiana Workers Compensation Corporation added there  		may be a higher risk of injury for PAS workers than for traditional domestic  		service workers so the NCCI classification codes 0908 and 0913 may not always  		be appropriate for PAS workers.</p>
<p>Workers compensation agency staff in Missouri, Washington State  		and Wisconsin indicated that workers compensation insurance premiums have  		gone up for all employers, including household employers. Workers  		compensation agency staff in Wisconsin similarly reported that a few years ago,  		premiums were affordable, but they have gone up significantly for household  		employers.</p>
<p>Workers compensation agency staff in Kansas, New York and Rhode  		Island purported that they do not see a lot of household employer polices or  		claims. As a result, workers compensation agency and insurance carriers  		do not address issues regarding household employers and domestic service very  		often. In addition, workers compensation agency staff in Kansas and  		Montana reported that small numbers of claims make it difficult for states to  		compile meaningful loss data and fairly assess the risk of workplace exposure  		for domestic service workers.</p>
<p>Minnesota and New Hampshire restricted employers with disabilities from  		including their workers under the domestic service classification. Minnesota  		workers compensation insurance staff noted that individuals who have  		disabilities and receive public funding to pay for their services may not be  		considered as employers in Minnesota according to state unemployment laws. In  		addition, Minnesota Statute 2002 §176 subd. 9(17) states, a worker  		who provides in-home attendant care services to a physically disabled person  		and who is paid by the Department of Human Services for services rendered is  		considered an employee of the State and not the person with the  		disability.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire Title XXIII, Section 281-A:2 Definitions V-b.(a) states  		that domestic employee or domestic worker means a  		person performing domestic services in a private residence for children or  		others who are not physically or mentally infirmed. Moreover, state  		workers compensation insurance staff noted that they could not identify  		what classification the worker would fall into. All employees, including  		domestic service workers, must be covered for workers compensation  		insurance.</p>
<p>Massachusetts reported a number of operational issues related to  		workers compensation insurance for household employers. First, the  		traditional NCCI classification codes did not properly classify PAS workers for  		workers compensation purposes. As a result, the State developed a  		domestic service code specific for personal assistance services (0918) (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#sectionVII">Section VII</a> - Promising Practices in this report). In  		addition, per capita-based premiums were problematic because of difficulty in  		estimating the number of employees working in a residence at any given period  		of time due to worker turnover. Moreover, per capita premiums represent  		significant paperwork burden and costs for both household employers and  		insurance carriers. As a result, rates for classification 0918 are computed on  		a per payroll basis and premiums are per household policy (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#sectionVII">Section VII</a> - Promising Practices in this  		report).</p>
<p>The agent brokering workers compensation polices for the  		Massachusetts Personal Care Attendant program reported that there may be a  		minimum number of household employers needed to provide a voluntary carrier  		with the financial incentive to write policies for individual household  		employers. The insurance agent for the State suggested a minimum number of  		3,600 policies that reflect approximately $1.3 million in premiums. The  		insurance agent in Massachusetts also reported that the Commonwealths  		Rating Bureau finally has accumulated significant loss data based on three  		years of experience. This data showed that the risk of workplace exposure for  		PAS workers in self-directed support service programs may not reflect the high  		risk perception of many rating bureau and insurance company staff. However,  		this information was not reflected in the new rates for FY 04 for  		classification code 0918 since the rate went up $0.10/$100/payroll.</p>
<p>The voluntary carrier writing policies for Massachusetts Personal Care  		Attendant Program participants cited two areas where Fiscal Employer Agents  		have facilitated obtaining and maintaining workers compensation insurance  		policies for program participants and processing support service workers  		claims. The Fiscal Employer Agent is the primary contact for the insurance  		carrier and provides the information necessary to initiate new policies and  		renew existing ones for the consumer-employers it represents. In addition, the  		burden and related expense of billing 10,000 consumer-employers has been  		reduced by allowing the insurance carrier to issue four invoices, one to each  		Fiscal Employer Agent for the consumer-employers they represent. Finally, the  		Fiscal Employer Agent is responsible for completing Wage Statement forms and  		submitting them to the insurer in a timely manner so the insurer can issue  		accurate benefits checks to the injured workers in the required time  		period.</p>
<p>Oregon workers compensation agency staff reported that under the  		law pertaining to domestic service, if a home health agency has five or fewer  		clients registered with the Department of Human Services at a foster care site,  		the agency does not have to provide workers compensation insurance  		coverage for the workers. This means the agency could have a chain of foster  		care sites, with many employees and still not have to purchase workers  		compensation insurance for their workers. This was reported as a significant  		issue for state workers compensation agency staff and local labor  		unions.</p>
<p>California State Insurance Fund staff reported that if a household  		employer hires a spouse, parent or child, they can never be covered by  		workers compensation insurance either through a standard workers  		compensation insurance policy or homeowners insurance endorsement.</p>
<p>The U.S. territories reported the following issues/challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Making sure that employers have the proper coverage is a challenge  		  (AS, GU, PR, and VI);</li>
<li>Dont know of any household employers who have purchased  		  workers compensation insurance for their workers (GU and NMI); and </li>
<li>Obtaining accurate reporting of domestic service workers actual  		  duties and hours worked (NMI).</li>
</ul><p>Finally, the majority of state and territory workers compensation  		insurance staff recommended that household employers purchase some type of  		workers compensation insurance coverage for their workers, even in states  		where domestic service is exempt from the law. Wisconsin workers  		compensation staff explained, I wish all household employers would cover  		their workers for workers compensation. Staff noted that having  		some coverage would protect the household employer from the uncertainty and  		risk of finding out they should have had coverage after the fact, when  		penalties for noncompliance are applied.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionVII" id="sectionVII">VII. PROMISING PRACTICES</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of promising practices that have been identified in  		this study. The following describes them by topic and jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>A. Workers Compensation Laws That Include Personal  		Assistance Services in the Definition of Domestic Service  Hawaii</h3>
<p>Hawaiis workers compensation law includes the term  		attendant care in the definition of domestic service. Hawaii  		Workers Compensation Law §381-1(6) Domestic, includes attendant care  		and day care services authorized by the Department of Human Service under the  		Social Security Act, as amended, performed by an individual in the employ of a  		recipient of social service payments (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>).  		Hawaii partially exempts domestic service workers from its workers  		compensation law.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note91">91</a></font></sup> By  		including attendant care in its definition of domestic service for  		workers compensation insurance purposes, it has removed a significant  		amount of uncertainty for state self-directed support service program agencies  		and household employers, including service recipients who hire their attendant  		care workers directly. However, the Hawaii uses the standard NCCI domestic  		service classifications for rating purposes which is not clearly describe the  		duties performed by a personal assistance (attendant care) worker (see  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>). </p>
<h3>B. Including PAS in the Employment Classification for  		Domestic Service  North Dakota</h3>
<p>North Dakota Century Code 65-01-02.17(b), Definitions, states that  		any person whose employment is both casual and not in the course of the  		trade, business, profession, or occupation of that persons  		employer.. is not covered under the States workers  		compensation law. According to workers compensation agency staff, this  		language exempts domestic service workers from the law. The states  		employment classification for Domestics (9002) includes those individuals  		performing home help services or providing personal assistance or home care for  		persons who are convalescent, aged or acutely or chronically ill or  		disabled under the domestic service classification (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table7">Table 7</a>). Thus, PAS workers hired by a household employer to  		work principally inside the employers home is exempt from the  		States workers compensation law (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendA">Appendix  		A</a>). </p>
<p>State workers compensation hearing officers, primarily look to the  		law when making a decision regarding a claims dispute. Although it is a  		positive step for states to include personal assistance in its employment  		classification under Domestics, it does not eliminate the risk of a  		hearing officer determining that a PAS worker does not fall under the domestic  		service classification. To make sure that personal assistance falls under  		domestic service by law, domestic service needs to be clearly defined in a  		states workers compensation law and include PAS workers hired by  		household employers. Then if a state chooses to exempt domestic service workers  		from coverage under its workers compensation law, it should allow  		household employers to elect coverage for their domestic service workers  		including personal assistance workers. </p>
<h3>C. Developing a Classification Code for Personal  		Assistance Services  Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Massachusetts has created an employment classification code specifically  		for personal assistance service. It is listed as 0918, Domestic Service  		Workers, Inside, Physical Assistance, and it is included in the <i>National  		Scopes Manual</i> (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>). This code applies to  		domestics who provide physical assistance in activities of daily living  		principally inside the insureds residence. In addition, it includes  		activities such as (1) assisting with bowel and bladder needs, (2) providing  		transportation, (3) assisting with health related needs, and (4) assisting with  		taking medications prescribed by a physician that otherwise would be  		self-administered (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>). </p>
<p>What would reduce a household employers risk of liability further  		would be if a state defined Domestic Service in its workers  		compensation law and included personal assistance in the definition. Having the  		law and the employment codes consistent with each other would reduce  		subjectivity of hearing officers when making decisions in workers  		compensation claims appeals. In the case of Massachusetts, personal assistance  		workers is not explicitly included under domestic service in the states  		workers compensation law. However, staff from the Medicaid Personal Care  		Attendant Program<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note92">92</a></font></sup> and  		the states Division of Health Care Financing and Policy have worked  		closely with the States Rating Bureau and Workers Compensation  		Agency to develop the classification so all the stakeholders are in agreement  		with its application. Moreover, all services recipients enrolled in the  		Medicaid Personal Attendant Care Program have executed workers  		compensation insurance policies for their personal care attendants.</p>
<h3>D. Developing a Program Specifically Targeted for  		Domestic Service  Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Pennsylvanias State Workmens Insurance Fund (SWIF) has a  		program and a workers compensation insurance policy, (e.g., Domestic  		Service Exemption Policy), specific to household employers who employ domestic  		service workers to work in and around their homes. It also has designated SWIF  		staff who are well trained and extremely knowledgeable regarding domestic  		service issues and SWIF policies and procedures. The application process for  		domestic service has been streamlined and SWIF staff is easy to access and  		extremely helpful.</p>
<h3>E. Accessing Workers Compensation Insurance  		Through the Voluntary Insurance Market  Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Massachusetts successfully recruited an insurance agent<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note93">93</a></font></sup> and voluntary insurance  		carrier<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note94">94</a></font></sup> to broker and  		write workers compensation insurance policies for over 9,000 persons with  		disabilities enrolled in the States Medicaid Personal Attendant Care  		Program rather than obtaining insurance through the more costly residual  		insurance market. The insurance agent for service recipients enrolled in the MA  		Medicaid PCA Program suggested that a minimum number of 3,600 policies that  		reflect approximately $1.3 million in premiums would provide an agent and  		voluntary carrier with an incentive to broker/write workers compensation  		insurance policies for household employers enrolled in a self-directed support  		service program.</p>
<h3>F. Accessing Workers Compensation Insurance  		Through the Residual Market  Arizona and New Mexico</h3>
<p>Arizona and New Mexico both have residual insurance markets that consist  		of both insurers/markets of last resort and Assigned Risk Plans.  		Having both options appear to increase small and moderate sized employers  		access to workers compensation insurance at more competitive prices. This  		approach has the potential of providing increased access to household employers  		who wish to purchase workers compensation insurance for their in-home  		domestic service workers including personal assistance workers.</p>
<h3>G. Accessing Workers Compensation Insurance for  		Domestic Service Through Homeowners and Tenants Insurance Policies  		 New Jersey</h3>
<p>New Jersey provides the most comprehensive system for accessing  		workers compensation insurance for part-time and full-time domestic  		service workers, including PAS workers at the lowest rates of any jurisdiction  		and through both standard workers compensation insurance  		policies<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note95">95</a></font></sup> and  		workers compensation insurance endorsements on homeowners and  		tenants insurance policies. By requiring all homeowners and  		tenants insurance policies to provide comprehensive personal liability  		insurance including workers compensation insurance for domestic service  		workers, the State has addressed the following issues:</p>
<ul><li>The State has limited insurance carriers workers  		  compensation insurance exposure only to domestic service workers. This is  		  important because most property and casualty insurers may not feel capable of  		  writing workers compensation insurance policies for all occupations.  		  </li>
<li>By requiring all homeowners and tenants insurance  		  policies to include workers compensation insurance endorsements for  		  domestic service, the State has spread the costs of insurance over a large  		  number of homeowners and tenants, achieved economies of scale and kept the cost  		  of the endorsement low.<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note96">96</a></font></sup> In addition, New Jersey is an administered  		  pricing state so the premium rates for the workers compensation  		  endorsement on homeowners and tenants insurance policies are the  		  same. </li>
<li>Purchasing workers compensation insurance coverage through a  		  homeowners or tenants insurance policy reduces the administrative  		  burden for household employers who employ domestic service workers.</li>
</ul><p>There are a number of potential disadvantages in providing workers  		compensation through homeowners and tenants insurance policies.  		They include:</p>
<ul><li>The cost of the workers' compensation insurance claims, if in  		  significant number and size, could eventually drive up the cost of  		  homeowners and tenants insurance overall for all policyholders,  		  regardless of whether they employ domestic service workers. </li>
<li>The majority of States workers compensation insurance  		  endorsements are meant to cover occasional domestic service  		  workers. In the case of New Jersey, household employers must report if they  		  hire one or more full time workers. Then, rather than paying the $1.00 premium  		  for the endorsement for occasional domestic service workers, the household  		  employer is charged $61.00/year for the first full-time worker employed and  		  $60/year for each additional full-time worker employed. If a household employer  		  does not accurately report the work status of his/her domestic workers, he or  		  she could be underinsured and increase the costs to the system. </li>
</ul><p>Some homeowners and tenants may not want to include coverage for  		workers compensation insurance in their homeowners or tenants  		insurance policies due to the fear that filing a workers compensation  		claim might jeopardize their homeowners insurance either due to  		significant premium increases or cancellation. (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#sectionIII">Section III</a> C (5) in this report).<sup><font><a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#note97">97</a></font></sup> It may be more prudent for a  		homeowner or tenant to obtain a separate, standard, workers compensation  		insurance policy in addition to his or her homeowners tenants  		insurance policy to address the potential risk of liability of job-related  		injuries for their PAS workers.</p>
<h3>H. Rate and Premium Setting Methods -- Massachusetts and  		Washington State</h3>
<p>Massachusetts uses the per $100 payroll method to compute workers  		compensation rates and the per household policy method for workers  		compensation premiums. The per $100 payroll method reduces the paperwork burden  		and related expense for both the household employer and insurer compared to the  		per capita method. In addition, the per household policy method for  		establishing premiums can represent a significant cost savings for household  		employers, particularly those who hire multiple part-time and/or full-time PAS  		workers.</p>
<p>However, using a per $100 payroll method may not project the risk of  		workplace exposure accurately/adequately for the insurer. For example, a  		household employer may have a payroll of $10,000 and have one worker. The  		worker may quit and the household employer may replace the worker with two  		part-time workers. Thus, the potential risk for injury has increased due to an  		increase in workers on the job site. However, the payroll amount and associated  		premium remains the same.</p>
<p>Washington State uses a per hour method for computing  		workers compensation rates and the per household policy  		method for computing workers compensation premiums. The per hour method  		more accurately measures the risk of workplace exposure for multiple workers  		since the number of hours worked is a good measure for projecting the risk of  		workplace exposure, especially if workers wages are allowed to vary.  		However, the key to making this method work is the availability of  		accurate hours worked information. These data can be collected  		using a standard time sheet and time sheet collection, processing and data  		reporting can be facilitated by using a Fiscal/Employer Agent. However, it may  		be more difficult to get consistent timesheet information from self-pay  		household employers who are not receiving services through a publicly-funded  		self-directed support service program that uses one or more Fiscal/Employer  		Agents. </p>
<h3>I. Using Minimum Premium Data to Develop Benchmarks for  		Workers Compensation Premiums  New Jersey, Idaho and Maryland</h3>
<p>The minimum premium data presented in <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>,  		<a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table5">Table 5</a>, and <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a> demonstrates  		the variability of workers compensation insurance rates by market and  		jurisdiction for similar employment classifications (e.g., domestic service).  		Jurisdictions can use this information to develop benchmarks to compare their  		workers compensation premiums and learn from other states  		experience. For example, the jurisdiction that has the lowest actual premiums  		for a standard domestic service workers compensation insurance policy  		from the voluntary and residual insurance markets is New Jersey. The actual  		premium for a standard workers compensation insurance policy for all  		occasional domestic service workers in a household is $16.00/household/year.  		The actual premium for a standard workers compensation insurance policy  		for a full-time domestic service worker is $76.00/year for the first worker and  		an additional $60/year for each additional full-time worker hired. Under the  		homeowners or tenants insurance workers compensation  		endorsement the premium is $1.00/policy/year for all occasional domestic  		service workers working in the home and $61/year for the first full-time worker  		and $60/year for each additional full-time worker working in the home. The  		premiums for the standard workers compensation insurance policy and the  		homeowners/tenants workers compensation endorsement for  		domestic service are the same for both the voluntary and residual insurance  		markets. </p>
<p>Idaho and Maryland also offer low minimum premiums through a State  		Insurance Fund (e.g., $150 per capita for 0908-occasional and $175.00 per  		capita for 0913  full-time and $175 per household policy for 0913   		part or full-time, respectively (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table6">Table 6</a>). However,  		Idahos minimum premiums for the residual insurance market are almost  		twice as much as the State Insurance Fund, whereas Marylands minimum  		premiums are the same in the State Insurance Fund as they are in the residual  		insurance market (see <a href="accessing-workers-compensation-insurance-consumer-employed-personal-assistance-service-workers-issues-challenges-and-promising-practices.html#table4">Table 4</a>).</p>
<h3>J. Using Fiscal/Employer Agents to Facilitate Purchasing  		Workers Compensation Insurance, and Invoicing and Processing Claims  		 Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>In Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Fiscal/Employer Agents  		participating in the states self-directed support service program (e.g.,  		MA Personal Attendant Care Program, NJ Personal Preference Program, and PA  		Attendant Care Program) will not process a payroll check for a worker unless  		the service recipient has an executed workers compensation policy for  		his/her PAS worker(s). Thus, the Fiscal/Employer Agent ensures the state  		self-directed support service program agency that workers compensation  		insurance coverage has been obtained for all service recipients and renewed  		annually.</p>
<p>In each state, the Fiscal/Employer Agent is the key contact that  		communicates with either the insurance agent, voluntary insurance  		carrier/residual market administrator or both making sure initial policies are  		executed and that policies are renewed in a timely manner. In addition, each  		states Fiscal/Employer Agent is responsible for completing the Wage  		Statement Form that the insurer needs to receive to accurately compute a  		benefit for an injured worker. The Fiscal/Employer Agent, in all three states  		is responsible for paying the service recipients workers  		compensation premiums out of their public benefit. In Massachusetts, the  		insurance carrier bulk invoices the four Fiscal/Employer Agents for the service  		recipients they represent, reducing the insurers invoicing effort from 10,000  		to four invoices per year.</p>
<h3>K. Allowing Household Employers to Elect Workers  		Compensation Insurance Coverage for Family Members Who are Paid Domestic  		Service Workers, Including PAS Workers  Hawaii </h3>
<p>Many states workers compensation laws are silent on whether  		family members who are paid domestic service workers, including PAS workers,  		may be considered covered workers. For the purpose of this study it was  		determined that these states allowed household employers to elect workers  		compensation insurance coverage for family members who are paid domestic  		service workers including PAS workers.</p>
<p>Hawaii exempts family members who provide paid domestic services,  		including personal assistance services from its workers compensation law,  		but allows household employers to elect coverage for these workers. States  		should consider clarifying their workers compensation laws to allow  		household employers to elect workers compensation insurance coverage for  		family members who are paid domestic service workers including PAS workers.</p>

<p><a name="note58" id="note58">Massachusetts</a> and New Jersey's Medicaid  			 self-directed support service programs have had very low (MA) or no claims  			 experience (NJ) since they started providing workers' compensation insurance  			 for all workers three years ago. Actual loss experience for two Medicaid-funded  			 self-directed support service program has not supported the insurance  			 industry's perception of workplace risk for personal assistance service  			 workers. The MA Medicaid PCA Program (9,291 consumer-employers in 2003-2004)  			 has had a low number claims since workers' compensation insurance policies have  			 been required of all consumer-employers in 1999. In 1999-2000 there were 4,581  			 consumer-employers and 70 claims, all closed as of 6/30/03. In 2000-2001 there  			 were 5,666 consumer-employers and 52 claims, all closed as of 6/30/03. In  			 2001-2002 there were 6,938 consumer-employers and 68 claims, with 5 claims  			 still open as of 6/30/03. In 2002-2003 there were 8,144 consumer-employers with  			 80 claims, with 22 open as of 6/30/03. For the period 2001-2002, McCarthy  			 Insurance Agency reported that Atlantic Charter, the voluntary insurance  			 carrier for consumers enrolled in the MA Medicaid PCA Program, received  			 approximately $2,389,620 in audited premiums and paid out approximately  			 $489,900 for 68 claims based on approximately $119,385,197 in total payroll.  			 Program staff for the NJ Personal Preference Program (500 consumer-employers in  			 2003) reported there have been no claims filed from the date consumers started  			 receiving services in May 2000 to the present (9/30/03).</p>

<h3>California</h3>
<p><b><i>In Home Supportive Services v. Workers Compensation Appeals  		Board</i></b>, 152 Cal. App. 3d 720, 199 Cal. Rptr. 697 (3d App. Dist.  		1984)</p>
<p>This case involved a worker injured while providing in-home support  		services designed to enable frail elders and persons with disabilities and  		sight-impairments to remain in their own homes. The services were provided in a  		private home but were paid for by a state agency called the In-Home Support  		Services Program. The State argued that the controlling employment relationship  		for purposes of workers' compensation coverage was between the recipient of the  		services and the worker--a relationship that did not include enough wages or  		hours to require coverage under the California law. The Court found that there  		was a "dual employment" relationship that included the state agency as an  		employer, in addition to the recipient as employer. Moreover, the Court called  		it a concept that has long been recognized in situations of general and special  		employment where a general employer furnishes an employee to another person  		with both employers having some right of control during the engagement. The  		Court found that there was sufficient direction and control by the State to  		make it at least a dual employer regardless of how the actual payments were  		made to the worker providing services, (in this case by a state agency although  		in some cases the state pays the recipient of services directly, who, in turn  		pays the worker),. The Court very strictly construed a statutory exception for  		limited coverage of domestic service to apply only as to the employment  		relationship with the recipient of services and not to the employment  		relationship with the State. The Court found that implicit in the legislative  		history of the California domestic service exclusion was a legislative purpose  		to impose the obligation of providing workers compensation coverage for  		household domestic employers only when the risk spreading mechanism of  		insurance is available, as it might be in a case such as this where dual  		employment could be found. </p>
<p>The Court struggled to find coverage for the injured worker in this  		case, looking for an employment relationship that would afford that coverage  		where the relationship between the recipient employer and worker would have  		been excluded as domestic service.</p>
<p><b><i>McCallister v. Workers Compensation Appeals Board</i></b>,  		61 Cal. App. 3rd 524, 132 Cal. Rptr. 527 (1976)</p>
<p>In this often-cited case, the Court found that services provided in a  		private home solely to care for and wait upon a frail elder and that included  		no duties in connection with the maintenance or functioning of a household, was  		not domestic service excluded from coverage under the California Workers'  		Compensation Act. The Court noted the dearth of authority distinguishing  		between what it referred to as "the lower echelons of health care services  		provided in the home to a member of the household." It found that cases such as  		this each must be determined on their own facts. Based on the record in this  		case that the Court characterized as showing that the injured worker performed  		only those duties directly related to the care and comfort of the frail elder  		and not to the general operation and maintenance of the household, the Court  		held that the exclusion for "household domestic service" did not apply.</p>
<p>This case draws a distinction between services provided for an  		individual within a household as opposed to services provided to the household  		in general. While the latter might be excluded as "household domestic service,"  		by state workers compensation hearing officers while the former are not.  		</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that domestic service employment  		classifications described in Appendix B and used by states do not distinguish  		between services provided to one or all of the individuals residing in or  		around a private residence. Thus, one could argue the basis of the decision in  		<b><i>McCallister v. Workers Compensation Appeals Board</i></b> and other  		similar cases (<b><i>Viola v. Workmens Compensation Appeal Board</i></b>,  		549 A.2d 1367,121 Pa. Commw. 47 (1988) saying that both should have qualified  		under the classification of domestic service.</p>
<p><b><i>Bonnette v. California Health and Welfare Agency</i></b>, 704 F.  		2d 1465 (Ninth Cir. 1982)</p>
<p>This federal court decision involved the employment relationship and  		minimum wage requirements where state and county agencies provided domestic  		in-home services to aged, the blind and the disabled enabling them to remain in  		their own homes. The Court found that the agencies exercised considerable  		control over the nature and structure of the employment relationship along with  		complete economic control and, hence, were held to be employers for purposes of  		minimum wage requirements. This was not altered by the fact that the agencies  		delegated to the recipients of the services various employer responsibilities;  		that merely made them joint employers. This is similar to the logic that  		applied in the <i>In-Home Support Services</i> decision discussed earlier where  		"dual employment" led to a finding of coverage under the state workers'  		compensation system.</p>
<p>Cases like this illustrate the use of liberal construction of a statute  		in order to achieve beneficent effects of a statutory scheme.</p>
<p><b><i>Bue v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board</i></b>, 43 Cal. Comp.  		Cas 396 (3rd App. Dist. 1978)</p>
<p>This case involved a daughter injured while lifting her invalid mother  		from a wheelchair. The Workers Compensation Judge concluded that lifting  		the wheelchair was incidental to the daughter's performance of normal routine  		domestic services and therefore she was not an employee entitled to workers'  		compensation benefits. The reviewing Court upheld the Workers' Compensation  		Judge's decision. </p>
<h3>Colorado</h3>
<p><b><i>Melnick v. Industrial Commission of the State of Colorado</i></b>,  		656 P. 2d 1318 (Colorado Ct. of Appeals, Div. Two 1982)</p>
<p>This case involved penalties imposed under the Colorado Workers'  		Compensation Act when a household employer failed to file a notice of contest  		or admission of coverage when notified that a nurse's aide was injured while  		performed services for the household employer's wife. The Court upheld the  		hearing officer's determination that the injured aide was covered by the  		Workers' Compensation Act and which penalties were appropriate. The Court  		held that the hearing officer's finding that the injured nurse's aide was an  		employee rather than an independent contractor was supported by the evidence.  		The hearing officer had found that the nurse's aide was not a licensed  		professional nurse, she was paid an hourly wage, there was no contract  		regarding duration of services and the family hired her and continually gave  		her instructions. </p>
<h3>Connecticut</h3>
<p><b><i>Smith v. Yurkovsky</i></b>, Case No. 4324 CRB-3-00-12, Conn, WC  		Comm. Comp. Rev. Bd (Dec. 2001).</p>
<p>This case involved a worker injured while providing nursing services in  		a private home. At issue was an exclusion from the definition of employee in  		the Connecticut workers compensation law for any person working in  		a private residence provided he is not <i>regularly employed</i> by the owner  		or occupier over 26 hours per week. Under the facts of the case, the  		injured workers hours per week varied during the course of the year. Some  		weeks her hours exceeded 26; while other weeks she did not. The Compensation  		Review Board found that an average of hours worked over the 26 weeks prior to  		the date of injury should be used to determine whether the threshold was  		reached. In the absence of a statutory definition of regularly  		employed the Board reasoned that the legislature introduced the works  		regularly employed into the WC law. The Board noted that the term  		must be given meaning that allows employers to predict when WC insurance will  		be necessary  and to do so requires some ascertainable boundaries rather  		than case-by-case determinations. Otherwise, it would be unfair to household  		employers trying to determine their legal obligations to provide coverage.</p>
<p>This case emphasizes the important of household employers collecting and  		maintaining accurate hours worked information for all workers, preferably using  		a standard time sheet format that is signed by the employer and employee for  		each time period.</p>
<h3>Florida</h3>
<p><b><i>Smith v. Ford</i></b>, 472 So. 2d 1223 (1985, FL 1st Dist. Ct.  		App.)</p>
<p>The court held that the claimant was ineligible for workers  		compensation benefits under the Florida law because she was a "domestic servant  		in a private home" which is excluded by Section 440.02(13(c)1.</p>
<p>The deputy commissioner at the administrative level had determined the  		facts to be that the claimant's normal duties were both domestic and personal  		care of her employer in a private home. Reversing the lower administrative  		decision which held that her duties as a "personal or home attendant" at least  		50 percent of the time afforded her coverage under the Florida law, the Court  		in this decision reversed and ruled that the claimant's duties result in her  		being a domestic servant in a private home, regardless of the mixture of duties  		which included those of a personal attendant which arguably were non domestic.  		</p>
<p>The Court cited the intent of the workers compensation law, as  		articulated by Larson in his treatise, that the costs be placed on the industry  		involved and ultimately on the consumer through the medium of insurance, whose  		premiums are passed on in the cost of the product. Citing Larson, it appeared  		willing to strictly construe the exclusion from coverage in the Florida law  		because of the difficulty facing householders in determining whether and to  		what extent they face liability when directly hiring workers to perform  		tasks in their households, as opposed to in their trades or businesses. </p>
<h3>Maryland</h3>
<p><b><i>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Rhodes</i></b>, 732 A. 2d 388, 127 Md. App.  		231 (1999) (Exerpt)</p>
<p>The court held that a homeowners insurer had no duty to defend a claim  		for workers compensation coverage because the household employer's policy  		it issued excluded any potentiality for workers compensation liability.  		The claim involved a home health aide.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the homeowners insurer <i>did</i> defend the  		policyholder against a negligence claim for the same injuries brought in tort.  		However, the insurer refused to defend a workers compensation claim that  		ultimately succeeded, the latter claim resulting in coverage under the Maryland  		Uninsured Workers' Compensation Fund because the household employer did not  		carry workers' compensation insurance. </p>
<p>The excerpt from this case is instructive insofar as it discusses the  		many potential areas of coverage for injuries to someone performing domestic  		services or personal assistance in a private home directly for the household  		employer. There were potential claims in tort, workers compensation and  		contractually under the Medical Payments to Others section of the household  		employers policy. In this case dealing with a home health aide, coverage was  		ultimately found under Maryland workers' compensation and, more specifically,  		in the Maryland Uninsured Workers' Compensation Fund. </p>
<p>This case deals with the obligations of the homeowners insurer to  		defend a household employer against a workers compensation brought by a  		directly employed home health aide. It was decided <i>after</i> it was  		determined by another court that there was coverage under Maryland workers'  		compensation so it does not go into any detail about the basis for that  		underlying finding.</p>
<p>Another interesting sidelight of this case is that it illustrates that,  		aside from actual liability and coverage, whole cases can involve the liability  		for the legal costs incurred to determine where that coverage and liability  		lies. This duty to defend against liability and coverage is a little recognized  		but very significant coverage afforded in insurance policies. Household  		employers do not want to incur this cost any more than the cost of insurance or  		ultimate liability but it should be addressed.</p>
<h3>Nebraska</h3>
<p><b><i>Dunagan v. Folkers</i></b>, Nebraska Workers' Compensation Court,  		Doc: 195 No: 2116, 1996</p>
<p>This decision addressed the issue of whether a "private duty nurse" was  		a "household domestic servant" and therefore exempt from coverage under the  		Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act. The Court found that the injured plaintiff  		devoted most of her time to the special needs of a quadraplegic patient in her  		private home although some of plaintiff's time was spent performing household  		tasks such as cleaning, cooking, laundry and child care for another. It also  		noted that the worker was injured while transferring the patient from her  		wheelchair, a duty within her function as a nurses assistant. The Court cited  		the oft-stated rule of construction that the Workers' Compensation Act should  		be liberally construed, and exceptions strictly construed, in order to obtain  		the beneficient purposes of the Act. The Nebraska Court looked to decisions in  		Oklahoma, <i>Nelson v. Bradshaw</i>, 791 P.2d 485 (Okl. App. 1990), California,  		<i>McCallister v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board</i>, 61 Cal. App. 3rd 524,  		132 Cal. Rptr. 527 (1976) and Pennsylvania, <i>Viola v. Workmen's Compensation  		Appeal Board</i>, 549 A. 2d 1367 (Penn. 1988) to find coverage in close factual  		questions. The Court embraced Larson's treatise argument that "Even if the  		employment is within a private household, it may be distinguishable from  		domestic service if its essence is not that of performing household duties, but  		is rather that of practical nursing--for example, the care of an elderly  		invalid." The Court was not swayed by the fact that the injured worker was  		placed in the private home by an agency. Neither was the Court persuaded by the  		argument that the household employers were not engaged in a "trade, business  		profession or vocation." Instead, the Court found that they employed several  		licensed nurses and nurse care providers, withheld taxes and social security,  		provided vacation time and had an employer ID number; the Court said that they  		were in the "business of providing the services necessary to maintain [the  		patient's] quality of life."</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the Court found that the services at issue in  		this case were more those of a practical nurse than a household domestic  		servant under the facts presented to it. However, it is somewhat surprising  		that the Court found that the frail elder and her relative who hired people to  		care for the frail elder were in a business and, therefore, were required to  		provide workers' compensation coverage.</p>
<p><i>Pettit v. State Of Nebraska Department of Social Services</i>, 249  		Neb. 666 (1996, SC, No. S-94-797)</p>
<p>The issue in this case was whether Donna Pettit, a chore provider of an  		aged and disabled individuals who received services under the Nebraska Medicaid  		Waiver Program was an employee of the Nebraska Department of Social Services  		(DSS) when she injured her lower back while providing chore services. The  		worker had been engaged to provide personal assistance services by a Medicaid  		waiver recipient. State DSS staff had informed Pettit that she was an  		independent contractor and that she would not receive sick leave, vacation  		leave or insurance. Staff further informed Pettit that the Medicaid waiver  		recipient was her employer and that she was not covered by workers  		compensation. Pettit received an IRS Form W-2 that reflected withholding for  		FICA by DSS (acting as the recipients agent under Section 3504 of the IRS  		code and IRS Revenue Procedure 80-4). </p>
<p>The Workers Compensation Court found that Pettit did not prove  		that she was a DDS employee. Upon appeal, the Nebraska Court of Appeals  		reversed the Workers Compensation Court and held that, as a matter of  		law, Pettit was a DSS employee when she was injured (<i>Pettit v. State </i>95  		NCA No. 28, case No. A-94-797 (not designated for permanent publication). The  		Court found that the record failed to reflect that there was a clear inference  		as to whether Pettit was an employee or an independent contractor when she was  		injured. It held that there was sufficient competent evidence in the record to  		support the Workers Compensation Courts determination that Pettit  		was not an employee of DSS. The Nebraska Supreme Court reversed the holding of  		the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>This case did not address any potential liability due to work place  		injury for the Medicaid waiver recipient as the common law employer of the  		chore provider. It only finds that the State is not the employer of the chore  		worker. Facts in the case include DSS staff informing Pettit that the Poels  		(Medicaid recipient) were her employer and boss. In addition,  		Pettit received an IRS Form W-2 from the State, as employer agent for the Poels  		not an IRS Form 1099. However, potential liability for the Medicaid recipient  		related to work place injury appears to be minimal since Missouri workers  		compensation law exempts employers with fewer than five workers and employers  		of domestic service workers from the law. If the worker truly performs only  		chore-related duties, he or she would fall under the states definition of  		domestic service. However, if the chore worker performed also personal  		assistance-related tasks, final determination of whether the worker falls under  		the domestic service employment classification would be based on the results of  		a workers compensation claims appeal decision </p>
<h3>Nevada</h3>
<p><b><i>Sullivan v. Second Judicial District Court</i></b>, 331 P. 2d 602,  		74 Nev. 334 (1958, S.Ct.)</p>
<p>This case involved the sole issue of <i>voluntary</i> coverage under  		Nevada Industrial Insurance (that is, workers compensation insurance) for  		a nurse employed directly by a household employer. More specifically, the case  		concerned voluntary coverage for two nurses when the household employer had  		voluntarily elected coverage for three domestic servants but failed to elect  		coverage for the nurses. Did the election for the domestic servants constitute  		acceptance of the Nevada law for all of the household employer's employees,  		including the two nurses?</p>
<p>It was admitted in pleadings that the nurses were employees of the  		household employer and coverage under the Nevada workers' compensation was  		compulsory as to them. Domestic servants are expressly excluded from the law  		although an employer can voluntarily elect coverage for them. The Court had to  		decide whether a voluntary election as to domestic servants (which the  		household employer in this case made) constituted acceptance of the law as to  		nurses he also employed directly in his household. Procedurally, this issue had  		to be resolved to determine whether the claimant nurse could continue to  		proceed in his action in tort for negligence; under Nevada law, an injured  		employee can proceed in tort if the employer fails to provide coverage where it  		is required. The court held that the workers compensation that was  		admittedly required for the nurse was <i>not</i> accepted by the household  		employer by virtue of his voluntary election to cover the domestic servants,  		therefore the nurse could continue to proceed with his tort action against the  		household employer/employer.</p>
<p>This case illustrates the interplay between the workers  		compensation system and the tort system. A finding of exclusion or non-coverage  		in one can open up remedies in the other for the injured worker and  		corresponding liabilities for the household employer/employer.</p>
<h3>New Hampshire</h3>
<p><b><i>Appeal of Richard Routhier</i></b>, 143 N.H. 404, 725 A.2d 665 (NH  		S. Ct., 1999)</p>
<p>This case involved whether a sole proprietor of a cleaning business was  		entitled to workers compensation benefits under mandatory household  		employers insurance coverage of domestics under the New Hampshire workers  		compensation law or, alternatively, under the language of the household  		employers insurance policy affording the mandatory coverage. The petitioner had  		been injured when he fell from a ladder after washing an outside window at a  		private household. The New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the New Hampshire  		Compensation Appeals Board decision that the injured plaintiff was not entitled  		to workers compensation benefits.</p>
<p>The New Hampshire Supreme Court analyzed the language of RSA 281-A:6,  		which requires all comprehensive personal liability, tenants and  		household employers insurance policies in New Hampshire provide  		workers compensation insurance covering domestics. The petitioner argued  		that he was a domestic because he was performing household duties and  		maintenance for a household employer at the time of his injury. The household  		employers insurance carrier responded that the petitioner was not a  		domestic because he was not an employee of the household employer. Petitioner  		agreed that he was not an employee but countered that the statute negated the  		usual statutory requirement that the injured party be an employee. The Supreme  		Court disagreed with petitioner.</p>
<p>The petitioner caused the Court to look closely at legislative history  		that demonstrated that at least one state senator assumed that coverage of  		domestics would extend to individuals hired on a very short term basis  		who are injured while working around the house, mowing the lawn, washing  		windows and so forth. Absent more formal legislative history, however,  		the Court found that a domestic must be an employee of the household employer  		to receive workers compensation benefits. The Court did, however,  		encourage the legislature to define the term domestic rather than require  		courts to define it on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The Court also analyzed the language of the household employers  		insurance policy. It found that the policy language, like the statute itself,  		required that the injured party be an employee in order to receive  		workers compensation coverage. The petitioner did not contest that he was  		not an employee of the household employer so there was no coverage.</p>
<h3>New York</h3>
<p><b><i>McCrory v. Thomas</i></b>, 40 Misc. 2d 904, 244 N.Y.S. 2d 111 (S.  		Ct., Kings County 1963)</p>
<p>This case involved injury to a licensed practical nurse while rendering  		services in a private home. The Court dismissed the injured LPN's claim based  		on failure to provide workers' compensation coverage because there was no  		evidence that the relationship of master-servant existed which is a  		pre-requisite to coverage under the Act. Quoting another New York decision, it  		said "a trained nurse called in on a special case is not in the service or the  		servant of the employer. She is a professional person like a physician,  		employed to exercise her calling to the best of her ability according to her  		own discretion." This case points out the critical distinction in employment  		relationship that can arise when the injured party is operating under a  		professional license. </p>
<h3>Oklahoma</h3>
<p><b><i>Nelson v. Bradshaw</i></b>, 791 P. 2d 485, 1990 Ok. Civ. App. 29  		(1990)</p>
<p>This case involved an injured worker who testified that she was hired to  		provide services to an individual in his home "in a nursing capacity" despite  		the fact that she also performed incidental household chores. The Court found  		that out of state legal authority was both scarce and in conflict on the issue  		of whether a nurse such as the injured worker in this case was a domestic  		servant. The Oklahoma Court did not think that the Oklahoma legislature  		contemplated a person engaged in practical nursing for which a professional  		license is required to be the same as a domestic servant. Noting that any  		employment is covered under the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Act unless it is  		specifically excluded, the Court found that the claimant's employment as a  		private or practical nurse was not excluded by the Oklahoma Workers  		Compensation Act exception for domestic servants. </p>
<h3>Oregon</h3>
<p><b><i>Gunter v. Mersereau</i></b>, 7 Ore. App. 470; 491 P. 2d205 (Ore.  		App. Ct., 1971)</p>
<p>This appeal, in the words of the Court, raised the sole issues of  		whether a person employed to care for an invalid in the invalids home  		comes within the exclusion from workmens compensation coverage for  		domestic servants. The injured worker cared for a stroke victim who  		required round-the-clock care involving food preparation and clean-up,  		administration of medication, and assistance with bathing, dressing and  		transferring. The worker injured her back while transferring the person from  		her wheelchair. The Court rejected the claimants argument that she was  		not a domestic servant because domestic service connotes care of the home  		rather than the person. In addition, the Court rejected the claimants  		argument that occasional administration of medication changed the nature of her  		duties to those of a nurses aide rather than a domestic servant.  		The true test is the nature of the work actually done said the  		Court as it affirmed the lower court holding that the domestic servant  		exclusion applied to her based on the work she actually performed so that  		coverage was denied.</p>
<p><b><i>Kerns v. Guido-Lee</i></b>, 813 P. 2d 578, 107 Or. App. 721  		(1991)</p>
<p>At issue in this case was the exclusion from Oregon workers'  		compensation of a housekeeper employed by a referral service under a former  		version of the Oregon law that excluded domestic servants without qualifying  		the nature of the employer. The housekeeper was paid by the household employers  		but paid a portion of the money to the employer agency that was the defendant  		in this case. </p>
<p>The Court strictly construed the statutory exclusion that applied at the  		time, noting that the Oregon legislature had limited the exclusion for  		agricultural workers with the phrase "in or about the private home of the  		person employing the worker," whereas the domestic servant exclusion had no  		similar qualifier. The Court concluded that the legislature clearly intended  		that the exclusion for domestic servants apply to the entire class of workers  		regardless of the identity of their employer.</p>
<p>As noted above, the Oregon legislature later amended the domestic  		servant exclusion of apply only to service "by private employment contract." As  		in the case described in the digest above, presumably the outcome of this case  		would be different if it arose under the new statute.</p>
<p><b><i>Matter of Lewis</i></b>, WCB Case No. 91-10026 (Oregon Workers'  		Compensation Board, 1992)</p>
<p>This administrative decision by the Oregon Workers' Compensation Board  		followed the reasoning in <i>Kerns v. Guido-Lee</i>, 813 P. 2d 578, 107 Or.  		App. 721 (1991) and held that a former Oregon workers compensation law  		exclusion for a "domestic servant in or about a private home" applied because  		of the nature of the work regardless of the identity of the persons arranging  		for, supervising, controlling or benefiting from the service. The underlying  		facts are not fully developed in the reported decision, however, a footnote  		alludes to the injured claimant as one who "works for an employer engaged for  		profit in the business of housekeeping." One can infer from this description,  		that the injured worker was employed by a housekeeping agency, not directly by  		the household employer. The Board concluded that the nature of the employer was  		irrelevant to the exclusion and the employee was excluded from workers'  		compensation because of the nature of the work as a domestic servant in a  		private home.</p>
<p>This a very strict and draconian reading of the then-applicable Oregon  		statute. One gleans from Larson's treatise that the domestic service exclusion  		<i>is</i> designed to protect the household employer who directly employs help  		in his/her home rather than the agency that employs and places employees in  		private homes for a fee.</p>
<p>Note that the applicable provision of the law (ORS Section 656.027 (1))  		was subsequently amended and now defines domestic servant to mean "any worker  		engaged in household domestic service <u>by private employment contract</u>,  		including, but not limited to, home health workers." (<u>Underline</u> added.)  		Presumably, this would change the result in a case involving similar facts that  		arose today.</p>
<p><b><i>McFarland v. SAIF Corporation</i></b>, 89 Ore. App. 184; 748 P. 2d  		150 (Ore. App. Ct., 1988)</p>
<p>This Court of Appeals decision involved a worker injured while employed  		as a domestic servant in a household job that she got through the OR Department  		of Human Resources Division of Senior Services (the Division). The  		Court found that the duties performed were those of a domestic servant   		meal preparation and clean-up, assisting the individual with bathing, dressing,  		eating and positioning in bed  regardless of the claimants  		certification as a nurses aide. The Court also cited a provision in the  		law applicable at the time that said domestic servants of persons receiving  		public assistance from the Division were not subject to the States  		workers compensation law even if the workers were paid directly by the  		Division (as the injured worker was) rather than by the person receiving the  		services. The Court concluded that the Board had not erred in its underlying  		decision by denying workers compensation coverage for the claim. </p>
<h3>Pennsylvania</h3>
<p><b><i>Viola v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board</i></b>, 549 A. 2d  		1367, 121 Pa. Commw. 47 (1988)</p>
<p>This case involved a worker injured while employed by an individual to  		care in his home for his wife who was disabled and confined to a wheelchair.  		The evidence showed that the injured worker did not serve the needs of the  		household, rather, her duties related solely to the unique needs of the wife  		who was disabled. In this case, the injured worker was found not to have  		performed housework nor domestic or maid services. The Court held that because  		the injured workers job involved duties similar to a nurses aide  		and did not involve household duties, she was not an excluded domestic  		servant.</p>
<p>The Court struggled to find coverage for the injured worker in this  		case, looking for an employment relationship that would afford that coverage  		where the relationship between the recipient employer and worker would have  		been excluded as domestic service. In a conversation with State Workmens  		Insurance Fund (SWIF) staff, she strongly disagreed with the decision of the  		Workmens Compensation Appeal Board in this case. She reported that  		domestic service covers a worker providing chore/personal assistance services  		to a elder or person with a disability in his/her home, regardless of the work  		performed for the general household. SWIF staff also reported that the employer  		was allowed to buy workers compensation insurance coverage through the  		SWIFs domestic service exemption policy.</p>
<p><b><i>Dorothy Stock v. Abilities in Motion</i></b>, PA Department of  		Labor and Industry Bureau of Workers Compensation Claims Settlement  		(August 20, 2001)</p>
<p>This case is a settlement that involved a program participant of the  		Pennsylvania Attendant Care Program, a Center for Independent Living (Abilities  		in Motion) that acts as the fiscal intermediary for the program participant and  		a personal care worker who reported being injured on the job. Abilities in  		Motion requires that all program participants participating in the  		self-directed portion of the PA Attendant Care Program purchase and have a  		current workers compensation insurance policy (domestic service exemption  		policy) for their personal care workers either through a private insurer or the  		SWIF. Abilities in Motion will not pay any wages to a personal care worker  		hired by the program participant until a program participant has workers  		compensation coverage for his or her workers. The program participant in this  		case had a current and fully executed workers compensation policy at the  		time the claimant (Dorothy Stock) reported being injured (back sprain) as a  		result of assisting the program participant with activities of daily  		living.</p>
<p>The claimant lived with her father. He owned his own home and had  		homeowners insurance. At the time of the injury, the father thought the  		workers claim would go against his homeowners insurance and was  		afraid his homeowners insurance would be cancelled as a result of the  		claim. For some reason, he did not understand that his daughter was fully  		covered through her own, Domestic Service Exemption Policy obtained through the  		SWIF.</p>
<p>The claimant retained an attorney and made a claim against Abilities in  		Motions workers compensation policy claiming that the organization  		was her employer. Abilities In Motion countered this claim by saying it was  		just the fiscal intermediary for the program participant for payroll purposes  		and that the program participant was the employer of the claimant. Thus, the  		claim should be processed against the program participants executed  		workers compensation insurance policy.</p>
<p>Two things went against Abilities in Motion in this decision. First,  		Abilities in Motion provides direct care services in addition to fiscal  		intermediary services. As a result, the hearing officer highlighted their  		direct care employer status. Second, the program participant, on direct </p>
<p>examination, reported that she was not her workers employer even  		though she directed and controlled all aspects of her workers activities  		with the exception of payroll.</p>
<p>The hearing officer then passed over the consumers executed  		workers compensation insurance policy and held that Abilities in Motion  		was the employer of the claimant for workers compensation and the claim  		should be processed against Abilities in Motions workers  		compensation insurance policy. A settlement was agreed to, however, the terms  		were a bit peculiar. First, the injured worker had to agree to voluntarily  		resign from employment and execute a document evidencing the workers  		intent to resign effective immediately, waiving any rights, remedies and/or  		causes of action to which the worker may be entitled under the Americans with  		Disabilities Act. The Agreement also could not be construed as an admission of  		liability on the part of Abilities in Motion or their insurer. Finally, the  		claimant had to keep the settlement confidential.</p>
<p>This case emphasizes the need for fiscal intermediaries to clearly  		define their roles and responsibilities and not to perform any activities that  		would give the perception that they are the employer of an individuals  		personal care worker. In addition, individuals enrolled in a self-directed  		support service program such as the PA Attendant Care Program, and their  		representatives, should be thoroughly educated regarding their roles and  		responsibilities related to the personal care workers they recruit, hire and  		manage and the workers compensation insurance coverage they have.  		Finally, the PA Workers Compensation Hearing Officers should be educated  		regarding the role and responsibilities of fiscal intermediaries versus an  		employer of direct care workers.</p>
<p><b><i>Community Resources for Independence, Erie PA, Settlement with the  		PA Department of Labor and Industry Bureau of Workers  		Compensation</i></b>, (2001).</p>
<p>This case is a settlement that involved a program participant of the PA  		Attendant Care Program, a Center for Independent Living (Community Resources  		for Independence that acts as the fiscal intermediary for a participant in the  		PA Attendant Care Program and a personal care worker who reported being injured  		on the job. </p>
<p>Community Resources for Independence (CRI) requires all program  		participants participating in the self-directed portion of the PA Attendant  		Care Program purchase and have a current workers compensation insurance  		policy (domestic service exemption policy) for their personal care workers  		either through a private insurer or the SWIF before CRI will pay any wages to a  		personal care worker hired by the program participant. The program participant  		in this case had a fully executed workers compensation insurance policy.  		The worker filed a claim against CRI rather than the program participant. The  		hearing officer, passed over the program participants workers  		compensation policy and allowed the claim to be made against CRIs policy  		even though CRI made the case that they were the program participants  		fiscal intermediary. CRI staff reported that during the hearing the hearing  		officer did not understand the concept of a fiscal intermediary and the IRS  		designation of being an agent on behalf of the common law employer (the program  		participant) and made it clear that he was confused. The hearing officer also  		demonstrated his bias against persons with disabilities by stating he did not  		understand how a person with a disability could ever be considered an employer.  		Finally, CSRI workers compensation insurance carrier made very little  		effort to argue CSRIs position. Once again, this case emphasizes the  		importance of fiscal intermediaries clearly articulating and executing its role  		and responsibility as the program participants agent rather than the  		common law employer of the personal care workers the program participant  		recruits and hires directly. </p>
<p>As mentioned in the case above, the Pennsylvania Workers  		Compensation hearing officers should be educated regarding the role and  		responsibilities of Fiscal/Employer Agents versus an employer of personal  		assistance service workers.</p>
<h3>Texas</h3>
<p><b><i>Finch v. Texas Employers' Insurance Association</i></b>, 564 S.W.  		2d 807 (5th Dist. Ct. Civ. App., 1978)</p>
<p>This case involved a workers' compensation award to a paraplegic husband  		who was injured in the course of his employment. The principal issue was the  		amount of the award to him for the value of certain nursing services rendered  		by his wife. A lower court jury had ordered the couple $25 per month for the  		wife's nursing services after the insurer refused to pay anything under its  		original settlement wherein it had agreed to pay all medical and hospital  		expenses incurred by the husband as a result of his work injury. This court  		rejected the couple's argument that the lower court jury should have included  		the value of the wife's usual domestic services in awarding an amount for her  		nursing services to the husband. This Court upheld the lower court's jury  		instruction that permitted the jury to weigh the evidence and determine how  		much of the wife's services were extraordinary services rendered because of the  		husband's disability (compensable nursing services) and how much were services  		usually rendered as part of the marital obligation (non-compensable). This  		Court could not say that the lower court jury award of $25 per month was  		against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, therefore it  		affirmed the decision.</p>
<p>This case is interesting insofar as it illustrates the difficulty of  		determining an appropriate amount to compensate a spouse who provides services  		to a work-injured spouse. In this case, there was a distinction between  		extraordinary nursing services and usual domestic services that were viewed as  		part of a marital obligation. </p>
<p>Note that this case did not involve injury to a person providing  		domestic service, personal or physical assistance. The injured husband worked  		on an oil rig. As stated above, the issues in this case revolved around the  		central issue of the value of certain services provided to him by his wife.  		</p>
<h3>Washington State</h3>
<p><b><i>Linda J. Bromley</i></b>, Docket Nos. 93 3892 &amp; 93 5100; Claim  		No. N-071072; Washington State Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals  		(1995).</p>
<p>The injured worker in this case was providing home care service to a  		frail elder in her private home. The elder was a program participant in the  		Washington State Medicaid Community Options Entry System (COPES) Program. Under  		the COPES Program a program participant has the choice to either recruit and  		hire an individual home care provider or receive services provided by a  		contracted home agency. The choice of provider is entirely up to the program  		participant consistent with federal requirements that also require that payment  		be made directly to the provider. All COPES Program providers sign a written  		agreement that explicitly states that the contractor is NOT an employee of the  		Department of Social and Health Services (the Department) and will  		not file any claims as a civil service employee, including workers  		compensation claims. Nevertheless, the injured worker contended that she was  		hired and employed by the Department and that would allow her to avoid the  		domestic service exclusion that would otherwise apply if her employer were the  		elderly person. The Department contended that it lacked authority to be the  		injured workers employer and, alternatively, it did not exercise  		sufficient control over the injured worker for her to believe that she was an  		employee of the Department. The Judges found, based on their review of the  		facts, that the injured worker could not have reasonably believed that she was  		an employee of the Department. A strongly worded dissent agreed with the  		outcome, but argued that cases like this should not turn in the belief of the  		injured worker; rather, they should be decided solely on the basis that the  		Department lacks statutory authority to become an employer under these  		circumstances. The majority rejected the dissenting approach and ruled on the  		basis of the injured workers reasonable belief about who is the employer,  		a basis affirmed in the Odell B. Henderson case decided by the Board later that  		same year (see below).</p>
<p><b><i>Odell B. Henderson</i></b>, Docket No. 93 4609; Claim No.  		N-390500, Washington State Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (1995)</p>
<p>This administrative decision involved the exclusion from coverage under  		the Washington Workers Compensation Law for "any person employed as a  		domestic servant in a private home by an employer who has less than two  		employees regularly employed 40 or more hours a week in such employment." The  		injured worker contended that she was employed by the Washington Department of  		Social and Health Services that would allow her to avoid the domestic servant  		exclusion. The Judges found that the injured worker's reasonable belief that  		she was an employee of the state agency was a fact material to the existence of  		an employment relationship with the state agency. The Judges remanded the case  		to the hearing process for a factual determination of whether the injured  		worker's belief was reasonable.</p>
<p><b><i>Everist v. Department of Labor and Industries</i></b>, 789 P. 2d  		760, 57 Wn. App. 483 (Wash. Ct. of App. Div. Two 1990)</p>
<p>The injured worker in this case worked as an in-home helper for a  		husband and wife although her primary responsibility was caring for the wife  		who was disabled. The Court discusses two traditional reasons for excluding  		domestic servants. These included: 1) where a non-business entity is an  		employer, as is often the case with domestic service, the assumption that the  		costs of workers' compensation are passed on to the ultimate consumers of the  		employer's product fails, and 2) given the variety and number of different  		types of workers hired by household employers, it would unduly increase the  		systematic administrative costs and unduly increase the financial and  		administrative burdens on household employers. The Court cited decisions in  		other jurisdictions as holding that a person charged with performing domestic  		duties is a domestic servant even though a significant percentage of the  		person's activities involve care-taking for a particular individual in the  		household. The Court liberally applied the state's domestic servant exclusion  		to find that the injured worker was excluded as a domestic servant because she  		performed duties traditionally performed by a domestic servant. The Court noted  		that the holding comports with the reasons mentioned above underlying the  		domestic servant exclusion.</p>
<h3>West Virginia</h3>
<p><b><i>Weatherford v. Arter</i></b>, 135 W. Va. 391, 63 S.E. 2d 572 (S.  		Ct. of Appeals 1951)</p>
<p>This case concerned a person injured while nursing and attending to a  		sick husband in a private home. The Supreme Court of Appeals focused on the  		provision in the West Virginia Act that defines employers as "All persons,  		firms, associations and corporations regularly employing other persons for the  		purpose of carrying on any form of industry or business in this State." It  		found that the terms "industry" and "business" as used in the quoted language  		relate to an occupation or employment engaged in for the purpose of obtaining a  		livelihood or for profit or gain, and that neither word embraces or applies to  		a residence occupied by a person as a home. Therefore, the defendant in the  		case was not required to provide coverage to the injured worker. The Court said  		that the purpose of the Workmen's Compensation Statute in West Virginia is to  		require industry to bear the burden of injury to employees and the conduct of a  		home is not industry or business within the meaning of the statute. Although  		the question of domestic service had been raised in earlier proceedings, it was  		not addressed in this case. </p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><b><i>Joyce Ambrose (Applicant) v Harley Vandeveer Family Trust  		(Employer) and Northwestern National Insurance Company (Insurer)</i></b>, WI  		Workers Compensation Decision, Claim No. 86-39393 (December 14, 1988)</p>
<p>The issue of this case is whether the applicant, Joyce Ambrose, was an  		employee of the respondents, Vandeveer Family Trust or Marine Trust  		Company within the meaning of section 102.07(4), Stats.</p>
<p>The applicant sustained injuries on December 10, 1983, when she slipped  		and fell in the home of her sister, who suffered from a disabling disease. In  		his last will and testament, the applicants father established the  		Vendeveer Family Trust, which provides for the continuing care of the  		applicants disabled sister. Marine Trust Company was the trustee on  		December 10, 1983. The applicant attempted to obtain workers compensation  		coverage for her fall through Marine Trust Companys Insurance Carrier,  		Northwestern National Insurance Company.</p>
<p>Neither the statutes nor any Wisconsin case law provides a definition of  		domestic servant. The Commission concluded that a reasonable interpretation of  		the term domestic servant would not include an individual who is  		hired to provide primary care to a person with a disability. The Commission  		found this to be true even though the primary care giver may assist in the  		preparation and clean up of meals, because such activities would be incidental  		to the primary care duties. This interpretation is in accord with the holding  		of a California Court of Appeals care that addressed a similar issue, <b><i>Mc  		Callister v. Workers Compensation Appeals Board</i></b>, App., 132 Cal.  		Rptr,. 527 (1976). The Commission also believed it was in accord with a  		long-standing admonition of the WI Supreme Court that workers  		compensation statutes must be liberally construed in favor of including all  		services that can reasonably be said to come within the statute (See  		<b><i>Grant County Service Bureau, Inc. v. Industrial Commission</i></b>, 25  		Wis. 2d 579, 52, 131 N.W. 2d 293 (1964). If the applicant had been hired for  		the specific purpose of performing regular cooking, cleaning or other duties  		commonly associated with the meaning of the term domestic servant,  		her employment would have come within the exclusion of section 102.07(4),  		Stats. The Commission believed she was employed exclusively as a primary care  		giver for her disabled sister, not as a cook, cleaning person or other form of  		domestic servant. However, it is believed that the Commission missed the fact  		that the state uses two classification codes (0908 and 0913) for domestic  		service that specifically include  cook, housekeeper, laundry worker,  		butler, companion, nurse and babysitter. Companion and nurse services would  		certainly cover the tasks performed by the applicant but the Commission failed  		to recognize this.</p>
<p>The question remaining for the Commission was, who was the employer of  		the applicant, the Vandeveer Family Trust or the sister (e.g., what was the  		employer  employee relationship)? The primary test used by the Commission  		for determining the existence of an employer employee relationship is  		whether the alleged employer has the right to control the details of the work,  		and among the secondary test to be considered are: (1) the direct evidence of  		the exercise of the right of control; (2) the method of payment compensation,  		(3) the furnishing of equipment or tools for the performance of work; and (4)  		the right to fire or terminate the relationship (See <b><i>Kress Packing  		Company v. Kottwitz</i></b>, 61 Wis. 2d 175, 182, 212 N. W. 2d 97 (1973). The  		Commission found that the sister administered her own affairs and at all time  		she reserved the right to control the details of the applicants  		employment. She hired the applicant, arranged for her payment by requesting and  		authorizing wages from the Trust, and retained the right to terminate the  		employment relationship. The Trust merely acted as conservator and manager of  		the trust funds. The Commission found that neither the Trust nor Marie Trust  		Company was the applicants employer. The Commission dismissed the case  		against Vandeveer Family Trust and Marine Trust Company. However, this would  		not preclude the applicant from filing an application naming her sister as the  		employer.</p>
<p><b><i>Shirley Nickell (Applicant) v. County Kewaunee Other, (Employer)  		and Firemans Fund Insurance of Wisconsin (Insurer)</i></b>, WI Workers  		Compensation Decision Claim No. 94064155.</p>
<p>The main legal issue in this case was whether the relationship of  		employee and employer exists and between which parties (e.g., the applicant and  		the county or the applicant and the program participant, Ms Kostichka. The  		domestic service exception would only apply if the applicants  		employer was Ms Kostichka and not the county.</p>
<p>The record indicated that some eligible program participants under the  		Community Options Program choose their own personal care workers and then apply  		to the county for payment. In this case, Ms. Kostichka had chosen the  		applicants predecessor but when that worker left, she simply asked the  		county for a referral. In addition, the applicant herself went to the county to  		find placement as a personal care worker, and the county required her to be  		trained, and placed her in assignments with many different eligible program  		participants over a period of several years, and the county employs individuals  		to act as supervisor of personal care workers. In addition, the  		applicants rate of pay was established by the county, and she was paid,  		through a fiscal intermediary, from funds it received from the county. The  		Commission found that while it is true that the personal care workers are paid  		through a fiscal intermediary, they are paid by a single check with fund the  		fiscal intermediary receives from the county, regardless of the number of  		eligible program participants to who the worker provides services. Further the  		county itself selected the fiscal intermediary for Ms Kostichka and numerous  		other eligible individuals.</p>
<p>The applicant testified that the county instructed her to do whatever  		the eligible program participants wanted her to do. Moreover, the countys  		witness testified that the county would not fire the personal care workers. In  		addition, the county did not provide equipment or tools to the applicant,  		though that would hardly be expected under this arrangement.</p>
<p>Finally, the legislature enacted changes to the state unemployment  		compensation law to establish a statutory scheme designed to exclude counties  		from the definition of employer under unemployment compensation  		law, while ensuring that unemployment taxes or contributions would be made by  		fiscal intermediaries on behalf of the eligible program participant (See  		sections 46.27(5)(I) and 108.02 (13)(k), Stats. Prior to the changes, the  		Commission consistently concluded that counties were the employers for  		unemployment purposes, of personal care workers or similar workers providing  		services to eligible program participants under the Community Options Program.  		No similar changes have been enacted into the workers compensation  		statutes.</p>
<p>This case considers the petition and positions of the parties, and it  		reviewed the evidence submitted by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Based on  		its review, the Commission agreed with the ALJ decision that the county is the  		applicants employer under sec. 102.07(1), Stats., and that the domestic  		servant exclusion under sec. 102.07(4)(b), Stats., does not apply. Thus the  		county is liable for payment of workers compensation benefits and medical  		expense.</p>
<p><b><i>Winkler v. Smith</i></b>, Claim No. 1998059089, Wis. Labor and  		Industry Review Commission, (2000).</p>
<p>This administrative decision involved a worker injured in the course of  		performing various "companion" services for an Alzheimer's patient in the  		patient's home. The dispositive issue in the Commission's decision was whether  		the injured worker was an employee as the term was used in the Wisconsin  		workers compensation law. Relying on typical employment standards (e.g.  		direction and control) articulated in <i>Kress Packaging Co. v. Kottwitz</i>,  		61 Wis. 2d 175 (1973) the Commission found that the worker was an employee and  		would be covered unless one of two exceptions in the Wisconsin law applied; (1)  		domestic servant or (2) a person whose employment is not in the trade,  		business, profession or occupation of the employer, unless the employer opts to  		voluntarily cover them. Citing dicta in two of its other decisions but with  		little other discussion, the Commission found that a person providing personal  		care to a person with a functional disability is not a domestic servant. It  		went on, however, to find that an invalid or a relative arranging for health  		care has not developed or established a trade, business, occupation or  		profession, even if they frequently hired the same individuals to provide the  		health care. Therefore, the Commission concluded that the injured worker was  		not an employee and hence was not entitled to workers' compensation  		coverage.</p>
<p>This case, like the Florida case discussed earlier (<i>Smith v.  		Ford)</i>, relies on an exclusion that recognizes the difficulty household  		employers face knowing when and to what extent they face potential liability if  		they hire persons to perform services for them in their private homes as  		opposed to their trades or businesses.</p>

<ol><li><font>NCCI stands for National Council on  				  Compensation Insurance</font></li>
<li><font>Maine allows tier rating (e.g., deviations from  				  standard rates). </font></li>
<li><font>State agency and insurers reported that the  				  homeowner's/tenant's endorsement should only apply to occasional (not  				  full-time) domestic service workers. However, the statute is silent on this.  				  Persons with disabilities that hire a personal assistance worker can not  				  consider their worker under the domestic service (Title XXIII, Section 281-A:6)  				  and can not take advantage of the homeowner's/tenant's endorsement for workers'  				  compensation coverage option. </font></li>
<li><font>Domestic service employers may also access WCI  				  for occasional workers through a mandatory homeowners/renters insurance  				  endorsement. Premium is $1.00/policy/year. Occasional workers may also be  				  covered through a standard policy under code 9010 for $16.00/year. </font></li>
<li><font>The minimum premium includes the terrorism  				  assessment charge. </font></li>
<li><font>Utah allows tier rating and the State Insurance  				  Fund uses three tiers, Nonstandard, Standard and Preferred. A household  				  employer would fall into the nonstandard tier if he/she was a new employer or  				  had a 100% loss ratio. The only way a household employer can get into the  				  preferred tier is if he/she has a loss ratio of 50% or less. </font></li>
<li><font>American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of  				  Northern Mariana Islands all use the per $100 payroll method to establish rates  				  and the per household method to establish premiums. No rate information was  				  available, however, in American Samoa it was estimated that a premiums in the  				  voluntary market would be approximately ½% of inside workers' and 1% of  				  outside workers' annual wages. </font></li>
<li><font>American Samoa and the Commonwealth of Northern  				  Mariana Islands do not use classification codes of any kind. They determine  				  employer status for rating purposes on a case-by-case basis. </font></li>
<li><font>Effective 8/03 Guam has adopted the NCCI codes  				  0909, 0912 and 0913. Minimum voluntary market premiums are #36.00, $36.00, and  				  $28.00, respectively and these minimum are the premiums when the employer has  				  no payroll. </font></li>

<li><font>Minnesota Statutes 2002 §176 subd. 21  				  "Household worker" means one who is a domestic, repairer, groundskeeper, or  				  maintenance in, for, or about a private home for, or about a private home or  				  household, but the term shall not include independent contractors nor shall it  				  include persons performing labor for which they may elect workers' compensation  				  under §176.041, subdivision 1a. </font></li>
<li><font>Minnesota Statutes 2002 §176 subd. 9 (17)  				  a worker who renders in-home attendant care services to a physically  				  handicapped person, and who is paid directly by the commissioner of human  				  services for these services, shall be an employee of the state within the  				  meaning of this subdivision, but for no other purpose. The workers'  				  compensation language is reflective of the MN Unemployment Insurance Law  				  Section 268.035 Definitions subd. 14(5) that states: "Employer means any of the  				  following..any nonprofit organization or government agency providing or  				  authorizing the hiring of home workers, personal care attendants, or similar  				  worker whether the organization or agency pays the employee directly or  				  provides funds to the recipient of the service to pay for the services."  				  </font></li>
<li><font>Missouri Revised Statutes §287.030  				  Employer Defined: (3) Any of the above-defined employers must have five or more  				  employees to be deemed an employer for the purposes of this chapter unless  				  election is made to become subject to the provisions of this chapter as  				  provided in subsection 2 of section 287.090An employee who is a member of  				  the employer's family within the third degree of affinity or co-sanguinity  				  shall be counted in determining the total number of employees of such employer.  				  Domestic service workers, including paid family members, are exempt. But  				  household employers may elect workers' compensation insurance coverage for  				  these workers. </font></li>
<li><font>NRS §616B.032 For purposes of determining  				  a homeowner's insurance policy, "Domestic worker" is a person who is engaged  				  exclusively in household or domestic service performed inside or outside of a  				  person's residence. The term includes, without limitation, a cook, housekeeper,  				  maid, companion, babysitter, chauffeur or gardener. </font></li>
<li><font>RSA §281-A:2 Definitions, V-a "Domestic",  				  "Domestic employee", or "domestic worker" means a person performing domestic  				  services in a private residence of the employer, where the employer is an  				  individual, family, local college club, or local chapter of a college  				  fraternity or sorority and not an agency or other entity engaged in the  				  business of providing domestic workers to the public and the person is not  				  defined as an independent contractor under RSA 281-A:2, V-b (a) "Domestic  				  labor" or "domestic services" means the performances of such duties as  				  housekeeping, childcare, gardening, handy person work, and serving as a  				  companion or caregiver for children or others who are not physically or  				  mentally infirm. (b) "Domestic labor" or "domestic services" shall also include  				  the services rendered by paid roommates or live-in companions who provide  				  fellowship, care, and protection for persons who because of advanced age, or  				  physical or mental infirmity cannot care for their own needs, regardless of  				  whether the paid roommate or companion is employed by an agency or entity other  				  than the person using such services </font></li>
<li><font>The state uses NCCI classification codes for  				  domestic service but they do not match the statutory definition of domestic  				  service. </font></li>
<li><font>A person with a disability can not classify  				  their personal assistance worker under domestic service but state insurance  				  department staff could not say what classification the personal assistance  				  worker would fall under. </font></li>
<li><font>Domestic service classification includes "those  				  individuals performing home help services or providing personal assistance or  				  home care for persons who are convalescent, aged, or acutely or chronically ill  				  or disabled. </font></li>
<li><font>North Dakota Century Code 65-01-02. Definitions  				  (17)(b)(3) For purposes of this paragraph and section 65-07-01, "child" means  				  any legitimate child, stepchild, adopted child, foster child, or acknowledged  				  illegitimate child. But employers may elect coverage by obtaining an optional  				  policy, standard policy not available. Premium for optional policy is the  				  maximum rate for the rate class. </font></li>
<li><font>ORS 656.026(1) A worker employed in or about a  				  private home. For the purposes of this subsection, "domestic servant means any  				  worker engaged in household domestic service by private employment contract,  				  including, but not limited to, home health workers." </font></li>
<li><font>Pennsylvania State Workers' Insurance Fund  				  reported that domestic service is not just "maids." It also includes "a person  				  hired by another person to work inside the home." Representative from SWIF  				  stated that this includes working for a disabled person in their home, doing  				  their laundry, helping them with personal needs, making them meals, etc." In  				  <i>Viola v. Workmen's Compensation Appeals Board</i>, 549A. 2d 1367, 121 Pa.  				  Commw. 47 (1988) the court found that the worker's duties were related solely  				  to the unique needs of the disabled individual rather than the needs of the  				  household and the duties were similar to a nurse aide and did not include  				  household duties and held that the worker was not an exempt domestic servant.  				  </font></li>
<li><font>Department of Insurance staff reported that as  				  long as they were working for a household employer, personal care workers would  				  fall under the domestic service classification. </font></li>
<li><font>Vermont Statutes §601(4)(D). </font></li>
<li><font>Home care provider tasks include providing  				  primary-care to an individual such as helping walking, bathing, preparing meals  				  and special diets, supervising use of medications and exercise therapy, and  				  other duties commonly associated with the meaning of primary-care gives.  				  Housekeeping duties should be incidental to primary-care duties.</font></li>
<li><font>Family members are "covered" if they are hired  				  as a domestic service workers to work in the house of the employer and the  				  worker does not reside in the same household as the employer. </font></li>
<li><font>Definition includes "attendants." </font></li>

However, this option is not available to persons with disabilities who hire  				  persons to provide chore and personal supports because they can not consider  				  their workers under the state's definition of domestic service (Title XXIII,  				  Section 281-A:2 V-b(a). he/she can not consider his/her worker a domestic  				  service worker and the homeowner's policy would not apply to them. </font></li>

<ul><li><font>Per capita-based premiums are problematic  				  because it is difficult to estimate the number of workers working at the  				  consumers residence at any given period of time due to significant worker  				  turnover. This type of premium represents a high level of administrative effort  				  and expense for the insurer and the consumer-employer. </font></li>
<li><font>Per payroll-based premiums cover all  				  workers in the class working at the residence thus reducing the administrative  				  burden and possibly the costs for the insurer and the consumer-employer.  				  However, the per payroll method could under estimate the risk of worker injury  				  for the insurer (e.g., if a household employer has one worker with a payroll of  				  $10,000, and is replaced by two workers at the same payroll amount, the  				  potential risk of injury is more for two workers than one but the premium may  				  not fully reflect the increase). </font></li>
<li><font>It is important that the employment  				  classification code accurately reflects the risk of workplace exposure for the  				  group. The domestic service classes 0908 and 0913 (part-time and full-time  				  in-servants) do not accurately reflect the activities of personal assistance  				  workers. That is why MA developed and implemented Class 0918 for personal  				  assistance workers. </font></li>
<li><font>It is important to find a way to streamline the  				  administrative process for writing, renewing and invoicing workers  				  compensation policies for large numbers of household employers (e.g., that may  				  be enrolled in a self-directed support service program). A Fiscal Employer  				  Agent (FEA) can facilitate these activities and MA FEAs do. For example,  				  Atlantic Charter bulk invoices the FEAs (e.g., one bill issued by insurer to  				  FEA that represents all of the policies for the consumers that the FEA  				  represents) can reduce administrative paperwork and related expenses.  				  </font></li>
<li><font>There may be a minimum number of  				  household employers that a voluntary carrier would need to write policies for  				  in order provide the insurer with an adequate financial incentive to write  				  workers compensation policies for this classification group. The MA  				  insurance agent for the MA Personal Care Attendant Program reported a minimum  				  number might be 3,600 polices that reflect $1.3 million in premiums. The MA  				  Program served approximately 10,000 consumer-employers in 2002. </font></li>
<li><font>So far claims have been low. In 2002, Atlantic  				  Charter received approximately $2.5 million in premiums, processed 68 claims  				  and paid out $200-300,000 in benefits to injured workers. </font></li>
<li><font>This year was the first year that the State  				  Rating Bureau had a significant database on losses for classification code 0918  				  to determine rates. It was anticipated that the rates for code 0918 would go  				  down. Instead they went up $0.10. The should be Rating Bureau should be asked  				  to demonstrate how they computed a rate increase for 0918 with such good loss  				  experience information available to them. </font></li>
<li><font>It is important that the insurer receive Wage  				  Statements from employers that accurately report 52 weeks of wages prior to a  				  workers injury so that the insurer can compute accurate benefits payments.  				  Consumer-employers in self-directed support service programs need to rely on  				  the FEA to complete the Wage Statements and submit them to the insurer and FEA  				  staff need to be aware of the importance of accurate and timely Wage  				  Statements." </font></li>
<li><font>Unlike other employment groups, personal  				  assistance workers often work part-time for more than one employer. A personal  				  assistance worker who has one or more concurrent employers must report all  				  employment to the insurer in order for the worker to receive the proper workers  				  compensation benefit if he/she is injured. To count in wage calculations, the  				  concurrent employer must have workers compensation insurance and not pay the  				  worker under the table. This is not an issue in MA since all personal  				  assistance workers have employment taxes filed for them by the FEA and all  				  consumer-employers have workers compensation insurance coverage. FEAs can  				  facilitate the collection of wages from concurrent employers for personal  				  assistance workers. </font></li>
