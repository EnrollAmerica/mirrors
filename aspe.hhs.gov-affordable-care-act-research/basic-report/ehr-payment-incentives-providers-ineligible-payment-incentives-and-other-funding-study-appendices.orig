<p><i><b>HITECH Medicare EHR Incentive Payments</b></i></p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted February 17, 2009. It includes the HITECH Act, which outlines the requirements for the EHR Incentive Program, designed to incent Medicare and Medicaid eligible hospitals (EHs), Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) and eligible professionals (EPs) to electronically collect, store, transmit, and use health care information in a meaningful, secure, and timely way with other health entities and government agencies.<sup><a href="#noteA1">1</a></sup> Priority areas include e-prescribing, and the exchange of lab results and clinical summaries.<sup><a href="#noteA2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The EHR Incentive Program, which aligns financial incentives with five health goals (improving care coordination, improving quality, efficiency and patient safety and reducing health disparities, promoting public and population health, engaging patients and families and ensuring privacy and security), has specific and different timelines and requirements for eligibility for Medicaid and Medicare financial incentives. CMS is mandated to operate the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. EPs may receive either the Medicare or Medicaid incentives, but not both for the same payment year. To be eligible, among other requirements, at least 50 percent of an EP's patient encounters during the EHR reporting period must occur at locations equipped with CEHRT. EHs may receive both Medicare and Medicaid incentives for the same payment year.</p>
<p><a href="#tableA1">Table A1</a> identifies certain requirements applicable to the Medicare and Medicaid EH and EP EHR Incentive programs. The table identifies maximum EHR incentive payment amounts, the period of time over which incentives are available, whether downward payment adjustments are applied for failure to be a meaningful user, and factors that determine or adjust that payment rate.</p>
<p>To implement the EHR Incentive Programs, CMS publishes rules regarding Meaningful Use (MU) requirements that eligible professionals and hospitals must meet to be considered meaningful users of CEHRT. Currently eligible professionals attest to using CEHRT to meet 15 "Stage 1 MU" core objectives and five out of ten menu objectives (for a total of 20 objectives), in addition to six clinical quality measurements (CQMs) (three core or alternate core, and three from a list of 38 additional CQMs).<sup><a href="#noteA3">3</a></sup> Eligible hospitals must attest to 14 core objectives and five from a menu of ten objectives (for a total of 19).</p>
<p>CMS issued a Final Rule for Stage 2 MU in September 2012, which delays the start date of Stage 2 requirements until 2014 and establishes more rigorous requirements for the meaningful use of CEHRT. Eligible Professionals still have 20 objectives, but 17 are core and three are from a menu of six and the total of objectives for Eligible Hospitals (EHs) remains at 19, with 16 core and three from a menu of six. CMS increased the total number of clinical quality measures regardless of stage of meaningful use to nine out of 64 total and 16 out of 24 for eligible professionals and eligible hospitals, respectively.</p>
<p><i><b>HITECH Medicaid EHR Incentive Program </b></i></p>
<p>Participation in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program by States and Territories is voluntary. As of May 2012, with the exception of one state (Hawaii) all states and territories had set up programs.<sup><a href="#noteA4">4</a></sup> For states and territories that do participate, there is a 90 percent federal financial participation (FFP) match for administrative functions and 100 percent for payments to EPs and EHs. States must receive approval of their State Medicaid Health Information Technology Plan (SMHP), which must address individuals in long-term care settings; aged, blind and disabled individuals; and coordination of care across multiple service providers, funding sources, settings, and patient conditions in order to receive FFP for infrastructure development. States must also gain approval of their Health Information Technology Planning Advance Planning Document (HIT PAPD) and Health Information Technology Implementation Advance Planning Document (HIT IAPD) in order to received FFP for infrastructure.<sup><a href="#noteA5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>When registering, eligible professionals must designate which state and which program (Medicare or Medicaid) they are seeking eligibility for EHR incentive payments. Hospitals may be eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments, and if a hospital demonstrates meaningful use for purposes of the Medicare incentive payment program, it will be deemed to have done so for purposes of the Medicaid incentive payment program. The hospital must still meet the patient volume and other requirements of the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. Medicaid EHR incentives for Meaningful Use, unlike Medicare, include funding to adopt, implement or upgrade (AIU) as well as incentive payments for demonstrating the MU of a certified EHR system.<sup><a href="#noteA6">6</a></sup></p>

<td><b>March 15, 2010: Comment letter on the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program proposed rules, published in the January 13, 2010 Federal Register. </b>
<p><b>"GUIDING PRINCIPLES" (p.3)</b><br />"(1) The provider incentive program should ensure that we are not creating a two tiered system in which Medicaid is not fully integrated into the improved care delivery system enabled through this initiative....</p>
<p>(3) The provider incentive program should foster EHR adoption and meaningful use among eligible Medicaid providers pursuant to the NPRM, and strive towards including non-eligible providers that are critical to improve the quality and value of the Medicaid program, such as long-term care and behavioral health providers."</p>
<p><b><i>"Provisions in the Proposed Rule: Alignment of Medicare and Medicaid" (p.4)</i><br />"Alignment of Medicare and Medicaid"</b><br />The states support alignment across Medicare and Medicaid; however, the current clinical measures do not reflect key clinical services and issues for the Medicaid population, including behavioral health, dental, long-term care, and care coordination (particularly across physical and behavioral health care).</p>
<p>The states recommend that CMS work with the Medicaid Medical Directors and ONC and consider the development and inclusion of clinical and non-clinical quality measures that are more representative of the Medicaid population."</p>
<p><b><i>"State Match Requirements" (p.7)</i></b><br />"The states request that CMS allow in-kind contributions--such as state staff ‘on loan' to the Medicaid program for the provider incentive program--as part of the 10% state match. In today's economic reality of severe state deficits, states may otherwise not be able to secure the funding needed to participate in this program."</p>
<p><b><i>"Eligible Medicaid Providers" (p.9)</i></b><br />The states request that CMS recognize that the Act excludes many relevant and key providers from participating in the incentive program. Specifically, the states argue that community mental health centers and other behavioral health providers, nursing homes, community long-term care providers, and home health care providers should be eligible for incentive payments as they are critical partners in improving the quality and coordination of care for the Medicaid population. The states recognize that this is a statutory issue, but feel strongly that exclusion of these critical providers impacts Medicaid's ability to improve the quality and efficiency of care. The states recommend that CMS allow states and the regional extension centers (RECs) to provide education and training, technical assistance, and infrastructure as relevant to support these excluded providers pursuant to the 90/10 funding. By including these excluded providers in education and training, the states can set the stage for eventually achieving the long-term goal of helping all providers serving Medicaid exchanging data and be meaningful users of EHRs."</p></td>

<td><b>AAHSA Public Policy Priorities 2008 (pp.8-9)</b><br />"One thing is clear: Technology will make a tremendous difference in quality and cost...We therefore will advocate for:...Creating and standardizing private, and portable Personal and Electronic Health Records, which take into account the unique requirements of aging services, to be available to every senior (or citizen) in America to ensure continuity of information, continuity of care, reduced unnecessary interventions and errors, and increased ownership of one's medical history.
<p><b>Statement for the Record. Investing in Health IT: A Stimulus for a Healthier America. January 15, 2009 (p.3)</b><br />"HITECH...recognizes that hospitals and physicians need serious incentives to encourage adoption of information technology, and allocates $20 billion in incentive payments. However, it is critically important that we not allow the long-term side of the health care system to languish while the acute-care side is built up. We need to build both sides at the same time, if we are to ensure that patients are not lost in the process.</p>
<p>We therefore urge you to include long-term care providers in any incentives you adopt, including direct bonuses, so as to enable long-term providers to prepare their information and communications infrastructure and deploy new technologies, including Health Information Technologies (HIT) and interoperable EHR systems, as well as other technologies enabling direct care workers to document their patients' care.</p>
<p>Secondly, we urge that any data collection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid be through interoperable systems. We will not be able to achieve the goal of interoperability by 2014 if data collection in long-term care is done through a proprietary format, as CMS plans to do with the new MDS 3.0. This will inevitably set back the efforts to integrate long-term care data collection with the rest of the health care system and ultimately increase cost of making all systems interoperable by 2014....</p>
<p>Such HIT infrastructure and EHR systems, that are interoperable across provider settings, ensure the continuity of information, and thus the continuity of care, and can lead to reducing medical errors, duplicative procedures and expenditures, while improving care quality, especially for the aging population."</p>

Technology can help to reduce costs associated with chronic conditions such as diabetes. It also can reduce costs by making services more efficient, both in nursing homes and in the community.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act provides for a number of exciting opportunities to better integrate acute and post-acute care services through collaboration among a variety of health care providers. This kind of collaboration will require extensive data sharing to ensure continuity and quality of services. Data collection and sharing, in turn, will absolutely depend on the use of health information technology.</p>

The development of interoperable electronic health record and personal health records is critical to the success of technology implementation. We support the national initiatives to develop EHRs and encourage work on PHRs. These activities form the foundation for the future vision of how networked health care systems will operate between older adults, caregivers, family members and health care providers....Key to maximizing the benefits of such networked healthcare system is the inclusion of long-term care settings, such as assisted living, skilled nursing, home health, home care and specialty services providers...[and] necessitates that the standards for such electronic record systems take into account the requirements of the long-term care providers, including functional assessment data and patient summaries, to allow the electronic exchange of critical health information among different care providers, including long-term care providers. Lack of interoperability is one of the important barriers to the adoption of these technologies...
<p>More incentives, in the form of grants, tax-credits and low-interest loans, are needed to enable long-term providers to prepare their information and communications infrastructure and deploy new technologies, including Health Information Technologies (HIT) and interoperable EHR systems, and other technologies including technologies for care documentation by direct care workers that improve the quality of care.

<p><b>(pp.2-3)</b><br />"...in fashioning the "meaningful use" definition, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) should bear in mind that neither true health care reform nor our national goal of creating an effective and inclusive nationwide health information network can be achieved without an expansion of its current scope of work to include health care sectors. We urge that home care and hospice be specifically identified as components of the health information network and be included as equally important partners in the delivery of comprehensive quality healthcare."</p>
<p>"...the home care sector is still lacking the support and inclusion that would make our providers, and consequently the overall health care system, meaningful users of HIT."</p>

</p><ul><li>"Recognize that the common definition of "meaningful use" that serves as the standard for providers participating in the Medicare...EHR incentive program and ... the Medicaid EHR incentive program affects the process of establishing standards of meaningful use of EHRs for non-eligible health care providers (such as home health care and hospice providers) and that future redefinitions of meaningful use should consider applying criteria for meaningful use more broadly to inpatient and outpatient hospital settings and long-term post acute care (LTPAC) providers."</li>
<li>"Consider that the standards for Certified EHR technologies and the means by which EPs and eligible hospitals demonstrate meaningful use should work for all provider types; including home health care and hospice to ensure the maximization of the functionality of EHRs."</li>

<li>"Encourage stakeholders to conduct demonstration projects that test the exchange of meaningful clinical information between EPs, eligible hospitals and home health care and hospice providers and provide data on the outcomes and cost effectiveness of care coordination and the sharing of clinical data amongst a broad scope of health care providers."</li>
<li>"Encourage EPs (physicians) and hospitals in future rulemaking to partner with other health care providers, as defined by Section 3000(3) of the HITECH Act, by directly linking the formation of collaborative partnerships with home health care and hospice providers with the demonstration of meaningful use or by some other incentivizing means."</li>

We also share this experience within the home care and hospice industry and because of our non-incentivized status within the meaningful use program; we are also cognizant that these barriers are most problematic to all providers who serve underserved communities in rural and urban areas. Therefore, we recommend that you provide clear details regarding the government's plan to develop technology and policy solutions that build on meaningful use and fit the unique needs of ineligible providers, including home care and hospice providers...."</p>
<p><b>(p.2)</b><br />"It is promising that the RECs will work with the community-based organizations and we hope that if this partnership extends to home care and hospice agencies that we will be able to help the RECs better serve not only underserved and communities of color but also disabled persons. The ONC should advise the 62 Regional Extension Centers across the country to extend their guidance and technical assistance on certified EHR adoption and utilization to ineligible providers, including home care and hospice providers. This strategy would foster a business model for RECs that supports all health care providers and will enable them to operate without federal grant funds beyond 2015."</p>
<p><b>(pp.2-3)</b><br />"The ONC needs to recognize that establishing a criteria and process to certify EHR technologies for hospitals and eligible providers has created a trajectory that must be adhered to by all providers, even those that are non-incentivized, if they want to be able to participate in the capture and exchange of health information. The ONC should link the goals...to provide support and build awareness of not only ONC-ATCB Certified EHRs but also other certified EHRs, such as the CCHIT Certified EHR home health add-on, that is interoperable with the federal standards. Currently, the vendor community is not developing the home health add-on because there is no federal government support or financial incentives attributed to the home care end user."</p>
<p><b>(p.3)</b><br />"It would also be helpful if the ONC would help educate incentivized providers and hospitals about the benefits of accepting clinical information from home care and hospice providers so that the information they receive from the community is not devalued because it is not ONC Certified.

<td><b>April 16, 2009. Inclusion of Long-Term Care Settings in ARRA Funded Projects Letter to the David Blumenthal (the National HIT Coordinator)</b>
<p><b>(pp.1-2)</b><br />We are also aware of the ARRA-required investments in grants and loans programs that will be administered through your office to drive the adoption of interoperable HIT nationally. We are contacting you today to provide two recommendations designed to maximize the return on this significant one time investment in the national HIT infrastructure:
</p><ol><li>We recommend that ONC include language in the ARRA requests for HIT grant and loan proposals advising applicants of the benefits of and need to seek partners from different care settings, including long-term care and providing such help as may be necessary to help identify potential partners (such as providing lists of federally certified providers in various areas).</li>
<li>In addition, we recommend that ONC specify that one of the evaluation criteria for selecting grant/loan recipients will be a preference for those who do partner with long-term care providers (and other healthcare providers who will not receive financial incentives).</li>
</ol><p>We believe that implementing our ARRA recommendations would substantially help ensure that organizations likely to be primary drivers of adoption of standards-based EHRs and facilitators of health information exchange, such as Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs) and Regional Health Information Technology Extensions Centers, are inclusive of all provider settings and serve broad and diverse populations, including persons requiring long-term care. Advancing policies that extend interoperable health information exchange and use to support the needs of persons requiring long-term care (including the use of standards for patient assessments) will be necessary to meet the ARRA goal that each person in the U.S. use an EHR by 2014.</p>
<p><b>June 11, 2009 Health IT Extension Program Comments. Letter to the David Blumenthal (the National HIT Coordinator)</b></p>
<p><b>(p.1)</b><br />"Our collaborative has worked to ensure that long-term care is included in the health information technology (health IT) provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and Health Information technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Fully including this substantial sector of the health care community in interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to reforming the health care system."</p>
<p>"The Extension Program includes provisions addressing the unique needs of providers of historically underserved populations including long-term care. In order to achieve the goals of HITECH, Regional HIT Extension Centers must offer technical assistance to long-term care providers (nursing homes, assisted-living, home health, PACE providers, etc.) as a priority group.</p>
<p>This technical assistance is essential so that the health care community (both acute and post-cute) become "meaningful users", have the training and support necessary to create and implement the EHR infrastructure and exchange health information across care settings. Technical assistance to achieve meaningful user status will give acute care providers the opportunity to receive incentive payments under Medicare and Medicaid. Technical assistance will enhance long-term care providers' ability to further improve the quality of care for residents. Furthermore, we request that the scope of work for the Regional HIT Extension Centers require specific inclusion of long-term care providers as stakeholders, partners and an important priority group for receiving direct technical assistance.</p>
<p>Excluding long-term care will slow down the adoption of interoperable EHRs for each person in the U.S. and cause harm to our most vulnerable citizens as they migrate through the health care system with numerous providers during single episodes of care and overtime across multiple episodes of care."</p>
<p><b>March 15, 2010: Comment letter on the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program proposed rules.</b><br />This rule proposes to define the "meaningful use" of Certified Electronic Health Records (EHR) technologies and to establish evaluation criteria that facilitate the flow of incentive payments to eligible professionals (EPs) and eligible hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs. (<a href="http://www.ltpachealthit.org/system/files/MU%20Comments%20March%202010%20v4%205%20%284%29.pdf">http://www.ltpachealthit.org/system/files/MU%20Comments%20March%202010%20v4%205%20%284%29.pdf</a>)</p>
<p><b>LTPAC Recommendations on "Meaningful Use" (pp.1-2)</b>
</p><ul><li>Recognize that the common definition of "meaningful use" that serves as the standard for providers participating in the Medicare Fee-for-Service and Medicare Advantage EHR incentive program and for EPs and eligible hospitals participating in the Medicaid EHR incentive program affects the process of establishing standards of meaningful use of EHRs for non-eligible health care providers (such as LTPAC providers) and that future redefinitions of meaningful use should consider applying criteria for meaningful use for LTPAC providers.</li>
<li>Recognize that the means by which EPs and eligible hospitals demonstrate meaningful use should work for all provider types.</li>
<li>Consider that the Certified EHRs technologies approved for use by EPs and eligible hospitals must be measured by their ability to successfully send and receive standards-based patient summary records and clinical information and share them with all health care providers types (including skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, home health, etc.) as defined by the HITECH Act.</li>
<li>Encourage EPs (physicians) and hospitals in future rulemaking to partner with other providers, as defined by Section 3000(3) of the HITECH Act, by directly linking the formation of partnerships with LTPAC providers with the demonstration of meaningful use or by some other incentivizing means.</li>
<li>Recognize that the standards of meaningful use of Certified EHRs for 2013 must, at a minimum, include a defined standard for the transfer of care documentation between all providers as defined by Section 3000(3) of the HITECH Act. The recommendation of the LTPAC is for this to be addressed in 2011 rulemaking so that the industry has sufficient time to implement these standards and support meaningful use Stage 2.</li>
<li>Recognize that improved care coordination and the exchange of meaningful clinical information among the professional health care team should involve all health care provider types and that demonstration projects should be devised to demonstrate the exchange of meaningful clinical information between EPs, eligible hospitals and LTPAC providers.</li>
<li>Consider expanding clinical quality measures in future rulemaking to include both long-term care and post acute care."</li>
</ul><p><b>(p.2)</b><br />"To meet nationally stated goals of a) improving quality, safety, efficiency, and reduce health disparities; b) improving care coordination; and c) engaging patients and families, the health care team caring for a patient/resident must be able to electronically exchange meaningful clinical information between the professional health care team over the entire spectrum of care. This spectrum is not limited to physician practices and hospitals. Rather, it is inclusive of all provider settings, including LTPAC."</p>
<p><b>(p.3)</b><br />"Effective electronic health information exchange with LTPAC providers reduces hospital readmissions and medical errors, improves quality, supports the continuity of care, and reduces costs with the resultant higher quality of care and quality of life. Our country's health care system will only reach the primary goal of improved quality and care coordination, and hence meaningful use, when all providers across the spectrum of care are included in HIT initiatives."</p>
<p><b>(p.3)</b><br />"Even through LTPAC is not currently funded for financial incentives; it can be included in the demonstration of meaningful use by linking incentive payments to EPs and hospitals who partner with other providers including LTPAC. Without the engagement of LTPAC, the goals of HITECH won't be achieved since physicians and hospitals cannot become meaningful users in isolation."</p>
<p><b>(p.4)</b><br />"In summary, this regulatory effort to transform the health care delivery system and emphasize that this goal can only be realized if the health care system recognizes the vital role LTPAC plays in the full spectrum of care and thus the need to include LTPAC in the electronic exchange of health information to make the use of HIT truly meaningful. As our recommendations propose, LTPAC's inclusion in this initial meaningful use effort can be expanded without additional cost by refining the criteria is a way that will incentivize EPs and hospitals to partner with all provider groups as defined by the HITECH Act. Implementing these recommendations would ensure attaining a meaningful use of HIT across the total spectrum of care, as required by ARRA, achieving a meaningful return on ARRA funds invested, and meeting the ARRA goal that each person in the U.S. has an EHR by 2014."</p>
<p><b>January 18, 2011. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology "Realizing the Full Potential of Health Information Technology to Improve Healthcare for Americans: The Path Forward" Letter to ONC.</b></p>
<p><b>(pp.1-2)</b><br />"The report urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to focus on increasing health information exchange and to exercise its' influence as a major payer to drive health information exchange. While currently long term care providers are not eligible for Meaningful Use incentives for adoption of a certified electronic health record under ARRA-HITECH, CMS could leverage federally mandated LTPAC functional status assessments (such as MDS, OASIS and IRF-PAI) to accelerate the adoption of interoperable EHRs in this sector and increase the exchange of health information across health care provider settings. ONC should also support the creation of health data exchange programs that target and engage long-term and post-acute care providers."</p>
<p><b>(p.2) </b><br />"We strongly support the recommendation that CMS modernize their information systems and develop a strategy to use technology and standards that are consistent with the rest of the health care industry to leverage their influence and advance health information exchange activities for clinical, administrative, public health and research purposes and not deploy IT requirements that only fit CMS business processes."</p>

The LTPAC Health IT Collaborative supports the inclusion of the unique needs of behavioral health identified in the strategic plan and offers these recommendations below supporting the unique needs of the LTPAC community:
</p><ul><li>Support for effective care delivery which maintains health care quality outside of the hospital and acute care setting where most of the elder population--both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as well as "dual eligibles" reside.</li>
<li>Policies, standards, and incentives for vital links between health care providers to be encouraged to accelerate the care process outside current settings being incentivized [eligible hospitals, CAH, eligible professionals].</li>
<li>Policies, standards, and incentives to provide sustained effective care for the large numbers of vulnerable populations in settings outside acute systems.</li>
<li>Policies, standards, and incentives to develop communication between providers eligible for EHR incentive payments to establish and maintain connections supporting data exchange with those outside agencies who are NOT EHR incentive payment eligible to support consumer centric care across the continuum that includes the longitudinal care planning being discussed by HIT Policy Committee for inclusion in the future stages of Meaningful Use.</li>
<li>Support for effective electronic health information exchange with ALL health professionals involved in delivering LTPAC needs of the consumer including <i>include Home Care services such as Care Management, Private Duty, and Skilled Nursing--and also the personal care needs, infusion, nutrition, rehabilitation, PT, OT, Speech therapy as well as durable medical equipment providers</i></li>
<li>Support for Longitudinal assessments across the continuum which identify the patient's story....</li>
<li>Health information exchange from LTPAC facilities to hospitals and vice versa to facilitate better transitions to meet unique needs.</li>
<li>Support for services or service delivery structure to the current EHR that provide a means to track unique needs of patients transitioning between settings. This includes patient care services--not just medical decision making.</li>
<li>Support for the concept of a problem that is not disease specific or a medical problem; examples of other issues that need to be addressed include transportation, personal care, activities of daily living (ADLs), financial issues which are barriers to sustained effective care beyond acute care and often result in hospitalizations, re-hospitalizations and greater medical costs.</li>
<li>Support for health care delivery for of ALL levels of care and prevention--not just support for traditional health care delivery episodes of care "check in to check out" or "admission to discharge".</li>
</ul><p><b>OBJECTIVE II.A: Support more sophisticated uses of EHRs and other health IT to improve health system performance<br />STRATEGY II.A.1: Identify and implement best practices that use EHRs and other health IT to improve care, efficiency, and population health.</b>
</p><ul><li>Consider enhancing current language to "Clinical decision support (CDS) systems are tools that leverage EHRs to improve clinical processes--ADD NEW--"across ALL venues of care including LTPAC, behavioral health, and emergency care settings".</li>
<li>Usability is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in this GOAL so that systems providing clinical decision support provide consistent messaging and alerting across the continuum from acute care to long-term and post-acute care.</li>
</ul><p><b>OBJECTIVE II.D: Support new approaches to the use of health IT in research, public and population health, and national health security<br />STRATEGY II.D.1: Establish new approaches to and identify ways health IT can support national prevention, health promotion, public health, and national health security.</b>
</p><ul><li>Include a plan to integrate LTPAC. Include clinical decision support systems integrated across the continuum to consistently support meaningful use by all care providers, not just providers currently eligible for the EHR Incentive Program.</li>
<li>Collaboration with LTPAC providers to define supporting strategies, policy and standards needed regarding risk assessment and clinical decision support in a long-term or post-acute care setting.</li>
<li>Support for a link between quality and core processes important across the continuum which include medication reconciliation, care transitions, change of condition, and risk identification.</li>
<li>Support for health records associated with the longitudinal care plan and outcomes of care in various care settings that capture the essence of an individual's life in the community which are vital to the continuum of care. A more specific plan should be included for including these records in the near term meaningful use plans. This is particularly important for populations served by LTPAC.</li>
<li>Support for family histories which are a vital and rich part of the longitudinal care plan and unique assessment of the nursing home and long term or post-acute care environment.</li>

<h3 align="CENTER">A. HITECH Act Section 4104(a) Requirements</h3>
<p>Section 4104(a)<sup><a href="#noteB1">1</a></sup> of the HITECH Act, which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study to determine the extent to which, and manner in which, payment incentives and other funding for implementing and using certified EHR technology should be made available to those providers who receive minimal or no payment incentives or other funding under the HITECH Act, Medicare, Medicaid, or otherwise, for such purposes. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on the findings, addressing the following factors:</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">B. Definition of Providers</h3>
<p>The complexity of the U.S. health care delivery and payment system, variability in classifying healthcare providers across the states, and overlap in services between providers creates challenges in identifying the types of providers who are the focus of this study. The methodology used to determine which health care provider types are the focus of this study was:</p>
<ul><li>Identify and define the health care provider types in section 3000(3) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) as modified in section 13101 of HITECH.</li>
<li>Identify which of these providers in section 3000(3) could participate in either Medicare or Medicaid programs.</li>
<li>Which of these provider types are eligible to receive EHR incentive payments under HITECH, and which of these providers are not eligible for such incentive payments.</li>
<li>For those providers who were determined to be eligible to participate in Medicare and/or Medicaid programs but not eligible for the EHR Incentive Program, we considered whether any of these provider types received other funding (e.g., in the form of grants) to support their use of EHR technology. In brief, with one exception, any available "other funding" was not found to be sufficient to support wide-spread adoption and use of EHR technology by any of these ineligible provider types thus this report focuses on those provider types who are ineligible to participate in the EHR Incentive Program.</li>
</ul><p>See <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2013/EHRPI.shtml#sectionIIA">Section II.A</a> (Identifying Ineligible Providers) of the report for a complete description of the methodology and criteria used to identify the types of health care providers that were the focus of this study.</p>
<blockquote><ol start="3"><li>
<p>HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.--The term ‘health care provider' includes a hospital, skilled nursing facility, nursing facility, home health entity or other long-term care facility, health care clinic, community mental health center (as defined in section 1913(b)(1)), renal dialysis facility, blood center, ambulatory surgical center described in section 1833(i) of the Social Security Act, emergency medical services provider, federally qualified health center, group practice, a pharmacist, a pharmacy, a laboratory, a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Social Security Act), a practitioner (as described in section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Social Security Act), a provider operated by, or under contract with, the Indian Health Service or by an Indian tribe (as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act), tribal organization, or urban Indian organization (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act), a rural health clinic, a covered entity under section 340B, an ambulatory surgical center described in section 1833(i) of the Social Security Act, a therapist (as defined in section 1848(k)(3)(B)(iii) of the Social Security Act), and any other category of health care facility, entity, practitioner, or clinician determined appropriate by the Secretary. (PHSA §3000(3))</p>
</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<h3 align="CENTER">C. Definitions of Certified EHR Technology</h3>
<p>HITECH Section 4104(a) requires, among other things, a study of what is known about the ineligible provider's adoption of certified EHR technology. This study applies the definition of certified EHR technology and qualified EHR from Section 3000(1) and (13) of the PHSA as added by the HITECH Act:<sup><a href="#noteB3">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><ol><li>
<p>CERTIFIED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD TECHNOLOGY. The term "certified EHR technology" means a qualified electronic health record that is certified pursuant to section 3001(c)(5) as meeting standards adopted under section 3004 that are applicable to the type of record involved (as determined by the Secretary, such as an ambulatory electronic health record for office-based physicians or an inpatient hospital electronic health record for hospitals).</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start="13"><li>
<p>QUALIFIED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. The term "qualified electronic health record" means an electronic record of health-related information on an individual that--</p>
<ol type="A"><li>
<p>includes patient demographic and clinical health information, such as medical history and problem lists; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has the capacity--</p>
<ol type="i"><li>to provide clinical decision support;</li>
<li>to support physician order entry;</li>
<li>to capture and query information relevant to health care quality; and</li>
<li>to exchange electronic health information with, and integrate such information from other sources.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<h3 align="CENTER">D. Certification and Certification Criteria for Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>ONC provided guidance to other health care settings (including ineligible providers) on the types of certified EHR technology that support electronic health information exchange with EPs, EHs, and CAHs in the ONC Final Rule for Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for EHR Technology, 2014 Edition; Revisions to the Permanent Certification Program for Health IT.<sup><a href="#noteB4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The ONC Final Rule provides the following guidance to other health care settings:<sup><a href="#noteB5">5</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>We appreciate the interest in other health care settings expressed by commenters. We agree that it makes good policy sense to support interoperability and the secure electronic exchange of health information between all health care settings. We believe the adoption of EHR technology certified to a minimal amount of certification criteria adopted by the Secretary can support this goal. To this end, we encourage EHR technology developers to certify EHR Modules to the transitions of care certification criteria (§ 170.314(b)(1) and (2)) as well as any other certification criteria that may make it more effective and efficient for EPs, EHs, and CAHs to electronically exchange health information with health care providers in other health care settings. The adoption of EHR technology certified to these certification criteria can facilitate the secure electronic exchange of health information. We concur with commentersthat there are currently private sector organizations that are addressing requests for certification programs for other health care settings.</p>

<p><i><b>ONC HIT Certification Program</b></i></p>
<p>Section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA, as added by HITECH, requires the Office of the National Coordinator to keep or recognize a program for the voluntary certification of health information technology as being in compliance with applicable certification criteria. ONC established the ONC HIT Certification Program, under which health information technology products are tested and certified by authorized entities. ONC established both temporary and permanent testing and certification programs through rulemaking. The temporary program authorized ONC Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies (ONC-ATCBs). In subsequent rulemaking, ONC sunset the temporary program which referred to ONC-ATCBs and launched the ONC HIT Certification Program, which now includes ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) and Accredited Testing Laboratories (ATLs).<sup><a href="#noteB8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The ONC HIT Certification Program requires that ONC-ACBs certify health IT including complete EHRs and/or EHR modules. Section 170.102 of the Code of Federal Regulations includes the following definition of base, complete and modular EHR:<sup><a href="#noteB9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Base EHR</i> means an electronic record of health-related information on an individual that:</p>

<ol type="i"><li>To provide clinical decision support;</li>
<li>To support physician order entry;</li>
<li>To capture and query information relevant to health care quality;</li>
<li>To exchange electronic health information with, and integrate such information from other sources;</li>
<li>To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health information stored and exchanged; and</li>
</ol></li>
<li>

<p><i><b>Discussion of the Relationship of EHR Certification for an Ineligible Provider </b></i></p>
<p>This section includes excerpts from the HHS/ASPE report "Opportunities for Engaging LTPAC Providers in Health Information Exchange", a study in which the relationship and challenges of EHR certification related to ineligible providers was discussed.<sup><a href="#noteB10">10</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>HITECH requires the use of certified EHR technology for certain providers (e.g., physicians and short-term acute care hospitals) to qualify for incentive payments under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs ("EHR Incentive Programs"). For purposes of the EHR Incentive Programs, two types of certifications can be issued to EHR technology that meets certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of HHS: (1) Complete EHR, or (2) EHR Module. To be eligible for meaningful use incentive payments, eligible hospitals (EHs) and eligible professionals (EPs) must use EHR technology that has been certified by an entity authorized by ONC. To date, four ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs)<sup><a href="#noteB11">11</a></sup> have been authorized to test and certify EHR technology that can be used by eligible professionals and hospitals in the EHR Incentive Programs.<sup><a href="#noteB12">12</a></sup> For example, EHR certification criteria include (but are not limited to) vocabulary standards (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)) and content exchange standards (e.g., Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and Continuity of Care Document (CCD)).</p>
<p>While some EHR technology certification criteria used for the EHR Incentive Programs for EPs and EHs would be applicable to the workflow in LTPAC setting, there is growing concern and awareness that not all of the certification criteria are applicable to EHR technology used by LTPAC providers. For example, the capability to plot growth charts or submit to immunization registries would not be a typical feature of a LTPAC EHR technology. Additionally, the adopted EHR technology certification criteria do not reflect the requirements that are uniquely needed by LTPAC providers.</p>
<p>For several years, the LTPAC provider and vendor community worked with Health Level 7 (HL7) (a Standards Development Organization) to produce an EHR Functional Profile for LTPAC. This Profile was used by LTPAC stakeholders and the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT) to identify LTPAC EHR certification criteria.<sup><a href="#noteB13">13</a></sup> It should be noted that the CCHIT LTPAC EHR Certification Program has not been recognized by ONC. While there is significant overlap in the EHR criteria that have been adopted for the EHR Incentive Programs and the LTPAC EHR Certification Criteria, there are also differences in the criteria that have been identified in these two programs. This misalignment has created confusion and uncertainty among LTPAC providers regarding whether they should purchase certified EHRs and if so, what type of certified EHR product would support the workflow of the LTPAC provider. ONC is aware of the uncertainties and questions regarding EHR certification confronting LTPAC and other providers that are ineligible under the EHR Incentive Programs and is working with stakeholders to better understand their EHR technology needs.</p>
<p>During the discussion at the 2011 LTPAC HIT Summit at the session on "Moving LTPAC Providers in the Nationwide Health IT Infrastructure," providers and vendors concluded that there is likely a core set of EHR criteria that will be common across all EHR products (e.g., requirements related to privacy/ security, medication reconciliation, problem list, etc.).<sup><a href="#noteB14">14</a></sup> During this discussion, providers and vendors suggested that ONC consider: (1) meeting with LTPAC providers and vendors to identify what EHR certification criteria are needed to support the workflow in LTPAC; and (2) working with the Meaningful Use Workgroup of the Health IT Policy Committee to identify the types of HIE activities that are needed in and from LTPAC. The Longitudinal Coordination of Care Workgroup (LCCWG) created through the ONC-sponsored S&amp;I Framework (described in more detail below) is beginning to examine the health IT standards needed to support HIE on behalf of persons receiving LTPAC. The HIE activities targeted in this S&amp;I effort are expected to advance the meaningful use of EHRs and shed some light on some of the EHR certification criteria needed by LTPAC providers.ad</p>
<p>Experts interviewed as part of this study noted that there is growing discussion about the need to integrate LTPAC providers in HIE activities to support quality, continuity, and collaborative care (Appendix A: Stakeholder Interview Summary). To support efficient and interoperable HIE, some LTPAC providers and EHR vendors believe that it is important to use EHR products that support at least some of the standards incorporated in certification criteria for the Meaningful Use Incentive Program.</p>
<p>As reported at the 2011 LTPAC Health IT Summit, some vendors expressed an interest in obtaining certification for their EHR products as either: (1) meeting the meaningful use requirements; and/or (2) complying with the LTPAC CCHIT comprehensive EHR criteria.<sup><a href="#noteB15">15</a></sup> At least one LTPAC vendor has obtained hospital modular EHR certification (through an ONC-ATCB) for their product to support the interoperable and secure exchange of health information such as demographics, problem lists, physician order entry, medication lists, medication reconciliation, and advance directives. This LTPAC health IT vendor and one other have also obtained LTPAC CCHIT EHR certification.<sup><a href="#noteB16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>To support widespread adoption of appropriate and interoperable EHRs for LTPAC, the LTPAC health IT Collaborative recommended in the LTPAC 2010-2012 Health IT Roadmap<sup><a href="#noteB17">17</a></sup> that policy guidance be provided for the EHR certification criteria needed to enable the exchange of health information between hospitals, physicians and LTPAC providers. The members of the Collaborative believe that such criteria would facilitate HIE with and by LTPAC providers, support the meaningful use of EHRs by a wide array of health care providers, and support the emerging nationwide infrastructure.</p>
<p>At this time the ONC has not established a specialty EHR certification program (e.g., a certification and testing program for EHR products for LTPAC providers (or other specialty providers)) or identified EHR certification criteria that are unique to the workflow requirements in LTPAC or other specialty providers. Establishing such a program or identifying EHR certification criteria is complex, could be costly, and requires careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages. An objective in the draft roadmap of the recently established LCCWG under the ONC-sponsored S&amp;I Framework is to "develop certification requirements for EHR and LTPAC vendors in anticipation of LTPAC pilots."<sup><a href="#noteB18">18</a></sup> As described above, in Section D "Certification and Certification Criteria for Ineligible Providers," in the Final Rule for EHR Standards, Implementation Specifications, and certification Criteria for the Stage 2 EHR Incentive Programs, ONC encouraged EHR technology developers to certify EHR Modules to the transitions of care certification criteria as well as any other certification criteria that may make it more effective and efficient for EPs, EHs, and CAHs to electronically exchange health information with health care providers in other health care settings."</p>

<h2><a name="appendC" id="appendC">APPENDIX C. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT SECTION 3000(3) AS ADDED BY HITECH SECTION 13101 -- PROVIDER ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<p>This appendix provides an analysis of the providers identified in Section 3000(3) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as added by Section 13101 of HITECH, to determine whether they were eligible or ineligible to receive EHR incentive payments under Medicare or Medicaid. If a provider was identified in the PHSA Section 3000(3) but not defined, another source for a definition was researched in <a href="#tableC1">Table C1</a>. For those providers identified in the PHSA Section 3000(3), but considered ineligible for the EHR incentive payments under Medicare or Medicaid, a further analysis was done by health care cluster in Tables C2-C5. The four health care clusters of provider types include long-term and post-acute care providers, behavioral health providers, safety net providers, and other. Although certain types of provider entities are not eligible for EHR incentive payments under Medicare or Medicaid, we note that the professionals who practice in those entities may themselves be eligible and may be able to reassign their EHR incentive payments to the provider entity in accordance with the reassignment rules under Medicare.</p>
<p>Section 13101 of HITECH added the following definition of health care provider in Section 3000(3) of the PHSA:<sup><a href="#noteC1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>The term "health care provider" includes a hospital, skilled nursing facility, nursing facility, home health entity or other long-term care facility, health care clinic, community mental health center (as defined in section 1913(b)(1)), renal dialysis facility, blood center, ambulatory surgical center described in section 1833(i) of the Social Security Act, emergency medical services provider, federally qualified health center, group practice, a pharmacist, a pharmacy, a laboratory, a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Social Security Act), a practitioner (as described in section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Social Security Act), a provider operated by, or under contract with, the Indian Health Service or by an Indian tribe (as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act), tribal organization, or urban Indian organization (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act), a rural health clinic, a covered entity under section 340B, an ambulatory surgical center described in section 1833(i) of the Social Security Act, a therapist (as defined in section 1848(k)(3)(B)(iii) of the Social Security Act), and any other category of health care facility, entity, practitioner, or clinician determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>

</ol><p>§1931(c)(1) PHSA: section 1931(c)(1) of the PHSA. "Under this section, the services that a CMHC must provide include the following: (i) outpatient services, including specialized outpatient services for children, the elderly, the seriously mentally ill, and residents of the...[CMHC's] service area discharged from inpatient treatment at a mental health facility; (ii) 24-hour-a-day emergency care services; (iii) day treatment or other partial hospitalization services or psychosocial rehabilitation services; and (iv) screening for patients being considered for admission to state mental health facilities to determine the appropriateness of such admission."</p>
<p>"...Secretary of this Department has issued a regulation which defines the term "community mental health center." There, a CMHC is defined as an entity that (1) Provides outpatient services, including specialized outpatient services for children, the elderly, individuals who are chronically mentally ill, and residents of its mental health service area who have been discharged from inpatient treatment at a mental health facility; (2) Provides 24-hour-a-day emergency care services; (3) Provides day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, or psychosocial rehabilitation services; (4) Provides screening for patients being considered for admission to state mental health facilities to determine the appropriateness of such admission; (5) Provides consultation and education services; and (6) Meets applicable licensing or certification requirements for CMHC's in the state in which it is located. 42 C.F.R. 410.2"</p>
<p>In 2007, 224 certified CMHCs billed Medicare for partial hospitalization services for 25,087 Medicare beneficiaries. In June 2011, CMS proposed a set of requirements that Medicare-certified CMHCs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare program.<sup>15</sup></p></td>

<p>A Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) was established in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Transportation Reauthorization, Public Law 109-59 (Section 10202), to ensure coordination among federal agencies involved with state, local, tribal, and regional emergency medical services and 9-1-1 systems, since there is no single agency in charge. There is no definition at the FECEMS website of an "EMS provider." In response to the FAQ "<b>Who delivers prehospital emergency medical care?," this answer is given</b>:</p>
<p>"The delivery of emergency medical care is a local function and is organized in a variety of ways. Local communities design their own EMS systems, using local resources to fill local needs. The organizational structure of EMS, as well as who provides and finances the services, varies significantly from community to community. Prehospital services can be based in a fire department, a hospital, an independent government agency (i.e., public health agency), non-profit corporation (e.g., Rescue Squad) or provided by commercial for-profit companies."<sup>22</sup> A federally-sponsored report found at that site discusses the importance of Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics as part of the system.<sup>23</sup> "The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) will provide the framework for collecting, storing, and sharing standardized EMS data from states nationwide. The new NEMSIS database, to be housed at NHTSA's National Center for Statistics and Analysis, will empower EMS stakeholders at the local, state, and national levels with the information necessary to accurately assess EMS needs and performance today--and strategically plan for tomorrow."<sup>24</sup></p>

<h2><a name="appendD" id="appendD">APPENDIX D. INELIGIBLE PROVIDER CHARACTERISTICS</a></h2>
<p>This appendix provides data on ineligible health care providers to understand the size of the market, number of patients' served, expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid and other information. Comparability from one setting to the next was not always possible due to the number of diverse sources needed to produce the statistical data,<sup><a href="#noteD1">1</a></sup> overlapping services between health care providers, and lack of standardization across provider classifications at the federal and state levels. Please note, those expenditures in this table based on claims data generally exclude Medicare and Medicaid managed care. The assumptions made are documented in the footnotes.</p>
<p>Congress wanted to understand the extent to which ineligible providers work in settings that might receive EHR incentives or other funding under HITECH. Findings are documented in the "ownership" column, however data was very limited. MedPAC or the American Hospital Association survey provided the best sources of data indicating the percentage of hospitals with specialty units or services that included the ineligible provider types. There was limited to no information available for the number or percentage of the ineligible professionals/practitioners who work for eligible providers. Some eligible professionals may work in multiple types of provider settings, including settings ineligible for incentives. These providers may choose to retain their incentive payment, or assign the payment to a setting where they work. For example, physicians may assign incentive payment to their primary practice and not to the rural health clinic, ambulatory surgical center, or nursing home where they also practice. We were not able to find a source that tracked assignment of incentives.</p>

<ol><li>Medicare expenditures (unless otherwise noted) are from the MedPAC June 2012 data book. MedPAC estimates are generally based on fee-for-service patients, and exclude the approximately 25% of Medicare enrollees now in managed care.</li>
<li>Profit margin information (unless otherwise noted) is based on the most recent MedPAC analysis of Medicare-certified facilities.</li>
<li>This column reflects provider ownership or affiliation to the extent the information was available. Data may not be comparable across the various provider types. AHA data on hospital-based specialty units is from AHA (<i>AHA Hospital Statistics, 2012 Edition</i>).</li>
<li>November 2011 data. Most facilities are dually-certified as Medicaid nursing facilities (NFs) and Medicare-certified skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). As of November 2011, of 15,716 total, 14,344 (91%) were dually certified; 788 (5%) were SNF only, and 594 (4%) were NF only (CMS. Compendium 2011). According to MedPAC, 15,161 NFs were Medicare-certified SNFs in 2011. AHCA statistics, based on CMS-CASPAR data as of June 2012, show a slight decrease in the number of nursing home providers--15,673. (AHCA, LTC Stats: Nursing Facility, 2012)</li>
<li>American Health Care Association (AHCA) using CMS-CASPAR data as of June 2012. (American Health Care Association. Research Department. <i>LTC Stats: Nursing Facility Patient Characteristics Report, June 2012 update</i>. <a href="http://www.ahcancal.org/research_data/oscar_data/NursingFacilityPatientCharacteristics/LTC%20STATS_HSNF_PATIENT_2012Q2_FINAL.pdf">http://www.ahcancal.org/research_data/oscar_data/NursingFacilityPatientCharacteristics/LTC%20STATS_HSNF_PATIENT_2012Q2_FINAL.pdf</a>).</li>
<li>2011 data (MedPAC, June 2012).</li>
<li>2010 data (MedPAC, March 2012). Spending on nursing home care varies substantially depending on source. National Health Expenditure Accounts put the figure for 2010 at $45.1B. Eiken et al. indicate Medicaid expenditures for nursing homes in 2009 was $51.3B. Kaiser's estimates the total for 2010 to have been $50.5B, based on analysis of CMS (Form 64) data.</li>
<li>CMS, National Health Expenditures 2010.</li>
<li>2010 data (MedPAC, June 2012). A 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report showed margins much lower than MedPAC's analysis, but also recognized wide variation between private investment facilities and other for-profit and nonprofit facilities. GAO likely was looking at all NFs, while MedPAC focuses on Medicare-certified SNFs. The GAO report noted there was also wide variation based on other factors, stating: "On average, facility margins were also higher (1) the greater the percentage of residents whose stay was paid by Medicare, (2) the greater the number of beds, (3) the greater the occupancy rate, and (4) the lesser the degree of competition in the county."

<li>Provision of rehabilitation services is optional for state Medicaid agencies, although covered by most states. CMS puts Medicaid expenditures for rehabilitation services at $7.3 billion (Medicare and Medicaid Statistical Supplement, 2011). It is not clear what it covers and whether it includes inpatient. An analysis of IRFs in Pennsylvania estimated that, while approximately 52% of net patient revenues came from Medicare, about 8.6% of revenues were from patients receiving medical assistance. It was noted that, while Medicare covers the majority of patients served in Pennsylvania rehabilitation facilities, younger, Medicaid patients tended to have a longer length of stay. (Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, November 2008)</li>
<li>Based on MedPAC's estimation that Medicare pays about 60%.</li>
<li>Profit margins vary greatly from one IRF to another depending upon geography (urban/rural), ownership (nonprofit, for-profit, government), freestanding or hospital-based, and number of beds. (MedPAC, March 2012)</li>
<li>2010 data. One major freestanding IRF chain accounted for almost 50% of freestanding IRF revenues, and hospital-based units accounted for almost 60% of Medicare payments to IRFs in 2010. (MedPAC, March 2012)</li>

<li>According to the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health care system, long-term acute care is a Medicare-designated level of acute care services, although Medicaid will pay for care in these facilities as long as it is a state-contracted Medicaid provider. (Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Long-Term Acute Care, <a href="http://patients.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/care_mgt/long_term_acute_care.html">http://patients.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/care_mgt/long_term_acute_care.html</a>). Medicare is the predominant payer accounting for roughly two-thirds of LTCH patients (MedPAC, March 2012). MedPAC estimates Medicaid patient share at between 5% and 8%. (MedPAC, June 2012)</li>
<li>Based on MedPAC's estimation that Medicare pays for about two-thirds of LTCH costs.</li>
<li>Grabowski, 2010. In 2011, two major chains owned just over half of all LTCHs. Both major chains operate IRFs and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in addition to LTCHs. The share of discharges from freestanding facilities in 2010 was 70%. (MedPAC, March 2012)</li>
<li>CMS. Determining Medical Necessity and Appropriateness of Care for Medicare Long Term Care Hospitals, 2011.</li>
<li>Home health expenditures vary greatly from one data source to another. The discrepancies appear to arise both from Medicaid dollars going to Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS), Home and Community-Based Waivers (HCBW), Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), personal services, etc. (cf. CMS MBES data, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/MedicaidBudgetExpendSystem/CMS-64-Quarterly-Expense-Report.html">https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/MedicaidBudgetExpendSystem/ CMS-64-Quarterly-Expense-Report.html</a>), and the inclusion in some estimations of providers not providing medical services. The National Association for Home Care and Hospice (NAHC), e.g. includes HHAs, hospices, as well as private duty and home care aide agencies, both Medicare certified, Medicaid approved, and private in their estimation of the number of home health providers (e-mail correspondence, Mary St. Pierre, NAHC, September 28, 2012).</li>
<li>Medicare-certified agencies. 2011 data. MedPAC (June 2012). The National Home and Hospice Care Survey estimated 33,000 HHAs 2010, including Medicare certified HHAs, Medicare certified hospices, and an estimation of non-Medicare agencies. We chose not to use the NAHC estimate, based on concerns the number included entities not providing medical services.</li>
<li>2010 data (MedPAC, March 2012). NAHC estimates there were 7.6M recipients of home care services in 2007, a number cited by the National Center for Health Statistics in their survey of HHAs and hospices (Caffrey et al., 2011). NCHS does not provide an estimate of total home health patients but states on any given day in 2007, there were 1.46 million current home health care patients in the United States (CDC, Home Health Care Patients, n.d.). NAHC's estimate for 2010, which includes in-home hospice, was 12 million. (NAHC, 2010)</li>
<li>2011 data (MedPac, June 2012). U.S. Census Bureau estimates of home health care services revenues from Medicare (2010) are $27.4B and from Medicaid $13.5B, with total patient revenues at $65B. (Census Bureau, 2010 Service Annual Survey)</li>
<li>CMS states Medicaid expenditures for "home health and related" service for 2010 were $54 billion, breaking it down by home health ($4,751 million), HCBW ($36,161 million), and personal care services ($13,170 million) (Data Compendium, 2011). CMS' National Health Expenditures Accounts puts the total Medicaid expenditure at $26.2 billion, of which $17.2 billion is the federal portion and $9 billion state and local. NHEA numbers cover a wide range of home health services, not limited to that provided by HHAs.</li>
<li>Based on MedPAC estimates that Medicare pays for 45% of home health services. NHEA puts total expenditures at $70.2 billion ($31.5 billion Medicare, $26.2 billion Medicaid, $5 billion out-of-pocket, $4.5 billion private insurance, $0.8 billion Veteran's Administration, $2.2 billion other third party payers/programs). NHEA home care expenditures include any service provided in a patient's home, likely extending beyond that provided by HHAs. (CMS. NHEA, 2011)</li>

<li>ICFMR is the statutory term. These facilities are now widely referred to as ICF/IIDs including in the CMS Conditions of Participation, therefore we are using ICF/IID to represent the statutorily defined ICFMR.</li>
<li>2010 data (Larson et al., 2012). The AHCA counts 6465 ICFMRs, based on CMS CASPER/OSCAR data as of October 2011. (AHCA, LTC Stats: ICF/MR/DD, 2011)</li>
<li>2010 data (Larson et al., 2012). The Coleman Institute puts the number of persons in ICFMRs (2009) at 62,311 (20,768 (&lt;6 persons); 41,543 (7 or more persons)) but residents in state facilities appear to be counted separately (Braddock et al., I/DD Spending by Revenue Source, 2011). AHCA indicates the total number of clients in ICFs in October 2011 was 87,400, with 55,950 in private facilities and 31,450 in public facilities. (AHCA LTC Stats: ICF/MR/DD, 2011). CMS-64 data for 2009 counts 100,723 unique beneficiaries with 5.1 million total ICF claims at a cost to Medicaid of $12.9B (CMS, Financial Management Report). The Social Security Administration put the 2009 number at 101,000. "Table 8.E1--Number of recipients, total vendor payments, and average payment, by type of medical service, fiscal years 1985-2009" (U.S. Social Security Administration, 2011, http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2011/8e.html#table8.e1). AHCA counts 87,400 total ICFMR clients as of October 2011. The CMS website indicates approximately 129,000 residents of ICFs are Medicaid-funded. According to Braddock (Braddock, Challenges, 2011) and AHCA (Eljay, LLC, 2011), numbers of institutionalized residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities are decreasing largely due to HCBW. The Coleman Institute states that, in 2009, 32,469 residents with intellectual or developmental disabilities were living in nursing facilities. (Braddock et al., <i>The State of the States</i>, 2011)</li>

"Distribution of Medicaid Spending on Long Term Care, FY2010" (Kaiser, Statehealthfacts.org, <a href="http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=180&amp;cat=4">http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=180&amp;cat=4</a>). Larson et al. indicate total Medicaid federal and state expenditures for ICFMR services in FY 2009 was $12.87B. Braddock estimated Medicaid spending for ICFMR facilities in 2009 to be just under $16B (Braddock, 2011). Americans with developmental disabilities and mental retardation make up approximately 1.3% of Medicaid recipients, but account for about 9.3% of Medicaid payouts. Medicaid is the primary source of funding, but other funds are available. (Highbeam Business, 2012).</li>
<li>This amount is for total receipts in 2007. (Census Bureau, 2007)</li>
<li>2010 data. Public facilities housed 38% of clients and private facilities housed 62%, suggesting that public ICFs had a higher bed capacity. (AHCA, State Long-Term Health Care Sector, 2011)</li>
<li>Includes nongovernment inpatient psychiatric hospitals (255), hospital psychiatric units (1274), state psychiatric hospitals (220) (Dobson, 2010). Avalere, in their analysis of the costs of extending EHR incentive payments to behavioral health providers, estimated 360 psychiatric hospitals, based on the number filing Medicare reports (Avalere, 2010). MedPAC counts 1536 (426 freestanding and 1100 hospital-based), a number that probably excludes state psychiatric hospitals. SAMHSA's database of mental health hospital inpatient facilities includes 1608 facilities where hospital inpatient services are available. (SAMHSA. Mental Health Treatment Facility Locator)</li>
<li>N-SSATS data as of March 31, 2010 (<a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DASIS/2k10nssats/NSSATS2010Tbl4.2a.htm">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DASIS/2k10nssats/NSSATS2010Tbl4.2a.htm</a>) SAMHSA's online database of substance abuse facilities includes 588 that are hospital inpatient. (SAMHSA, data set created May 23, 2011; updated June 30, 2012.) SAMHSA's 2008 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services specified 838 substance abuse treatment facilities were hospital inpatient, with 317 having a primary focus of substance abuse, 296 focusing on a mix of substance abuse and mental health, 161 focusing on mental health care, and the rest focusing on general health care or other.</li>
<li>"Number and percentage of persons aged 18 or older who received mental health treatment in the past year, by disorder severity, United States, 2009" (Table 24, SAMHSA, Mental Health, U.S. 2010). MedPAC counts 431,276 Medicare patients. (MedPAC, June 2012)</li>

<li>2011 data. (MedPAC)</li>
<li>There is no Medicare inpatient substance abuse treatment provider type. A very broad estimate, based on SAMHSA's estimate Medicare pays approximately 7% of substance abuse treatment costs across all settings, would be $154M. This number may be an overstatement if limits on Medicare spending for inpatient psychiatric care extend to substance abuse facilities.</li>
<li>"Medicaid--Beneficiaries and Payments: 2000 to 2009" (U.S. Statistical Abstract 2012, http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/%20tables/12s0151.pdf.) This includes inpatient psychiatric facilities for persons under 21 and mental hospitals for the aged. Medicaid, under a restriction known as Medicaid's Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion, does not reimburse psychiatric institutions for services provided to Medicaid enrollees aged 21-64. A review by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute of state mental health agency-controlled Medicaid revenues for state psychiatric hospitals estimated $2.14B for 2009. (NASMHPD, 2012)</li>
<li>This is a very broad estimate based on SAMHSA's estimate Medicaid paid approximately 21% of substance abuse treatment costs across all settings.</li>
<li>2005 data. Includes mental health treatment in specialty units of general hospitals and inpatient specialty hospitals ($11.3B). "Table A.1. Spending by Provider and Setting: Levels and Percent Distribution for Mental Health and Substance Abuse (MHSA), Mental Health (MH), Substance Abuse (SA), Alcohol Abuse (AA), Drug Abuse (DA), and All-Health, 2005." (SAMHSA, National Expenditures, 2010). SAMHSA estimates costs for all inpatient hospital (specialty and non-specialty) MH treatment to be $31.47B for 2006 and $45.45B for 2014. (Levit, 2008)</li>
<li>Pennsylvania financial analysis showed in 2010, freestanding psychiatric hospitals had a operating margin of 5.92% and an overall margin for inpatient psychiatric facilities of 4.58% (Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, 2011). MedPAC reports hospital-based specialty units, such as psychiatric, historically have had lower profit margins than freestanding.</li>

<li>2010 data (1649 MH and 2843 SA). These numbers are based on SAMHSA's databases of MH and SA facilities, filtered by residential care (includes both adult and adolescent facilities)--(SAMHSA. Mental health facilities, 2010; SAMHSA. Substance Abuse Facilities, 2010) SAMHSA (Mental Health U.S., 2010) counts 551 residential treatment centers (RTCs) for children with severe emotional disturbance (2008 data) and 55 RTCs for adults (Table 116. "Number of mental health organizations, by organization type, United States and by State, 2008"). The most recently published numbers from SAMHSA's N-SSATS survey (2008) Schwalbe, who defines the RTC as an "RTC, also known as a psychiatric residential treatment facility (PRTF under the federal Medicaid laws and rules) is any non-hospital facility that holds a provider agreement with a state Medicaid agency to provide inpatient services benefit to Medicaid-eligible individuals under the age of 21" (Schwalbe, 2010).</li>
<li>Includes 211,000 clients under the age of 18 receiving MH treatment ("Table 56. Number and percentage of persons aged 12-17 who received mental health treatment in the past year, by type of treatment, United States, 2009," SAMHSA, <i>Mental Health U.S.</i>, 2010), and 103,692 clients (including 9302 under the age of 18) receiving SA treatment (<a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DASIS/2k10nssats/NSSATS2010Tbl5.2a.htm">http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DASIS/2k10nssats/NSSATS2010Tbl5.2a.htm</a>, N-SSATS, 2010). Although there are numbers for adults receiving SA treatment who have co-occurring MH issues, there are no good United States data on the numbers of adults receiving only MH treatment in adult residential facilities for adults with mental illness. A study published by SAMHSA in 2006, based on September 2003 data, reported results from a survey that received responses from 34 states and the District of Columbia. 63 types of facilities were identified by the survey, with a total of 7,327 facilities with 103,393 beds. State and local MH agencies were responsible for the majority of funding for care in these facilities. Residents also used Supplemental Security Income payments and Social Security Disability insurance payments as funding sources. (Ireys, 2006)</li>
<li>Residential care facilities are not eligible to enroll in Medicare. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates $988M in Medicare patient care revenues for residential mental retardation, MH and SA. (Census Bureau, 2010)</li>
<li>2008 data (Schwalbe, 2010). The MAX [Medicaid Analytic eXtract] Chartbook 2008 (Borck, 2012) indicates $488M was spent by Medicaid on residential MH treatment for adults and $2B was spent on residential MH treatment for children and adolescents. PRTF for persons under 21 is a designation for a Medicaid-certified facility. For further information about public spending for residential treatment facilities for children with emotional disturbance, see Ireys et al. (Ireys, 2006).</li>

(SAMHSA. <i>National Expenditures for Mental Health Services &amp; Substance Abuse Treatment, 1986-2005</i>, 2010.) Dobson et al. (NAPHS) estimate $4.5B in direct expenditures for MH services in RTCs for calendar year 2008.</li>
<li>Avalere puts the count of CMHCs at 672 (Avalere, 2010). CMS indicates in 2007 there were 224 facilities who billed Medicare for partial hospitalization services, the only treatment covered by Medicare in CHMCs. (CMS, Federal Register 76 FR 35684; June 17, 2011)</li>

<li>The George Washington University, 2012. "A provider-based RHC is an integral and subordinate part of a Medicare participating hospital, critical access hospital (CAH), skilled nursing facility (SNF), or home health agency (HHA), and is operated with other departments of the provider under common governance, professional supervision, and usually licensure. All other RHCs are considered to be independent" (73 FR 36696; June 27, 2008). Independent clinics are most commonly owned by physicians (49%), other individuals or corporate entities (29%), hospital corporations (15%), nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives (7%), or RHC administrators (1%). Provider-based clinics are owned by hospitals of less than 50 beds (50%), hospitals of more than 50 beds (40%), and nursing homes and other owners (10%). (Gale and Coburn, 2003)</li>
<li>2008 data (VMG Health, 2010). According to VMG Health analysis, of the total number of freestanding ASCs, 5174 were Medicare-certified. MedPAC data for 2011 indicates there were 5344 Medicare-certified facilities.</li>

<li>Based on MedPAC data for Medicare expenditures and VMG Health's estimate that Medicaid contributes approximately 5% to ASC revenues (VMG, 2010). A number of studies have shown that lower income individuals tend to receive outpatient surgery treatment in hospital outpatient departments instead of ASCs. (See, for example, Strope, et al., 2009)</li>
<li>Based on MedPAC data for Medicare expenditures and VMG Health's estimate that Medicare contributes approximately 25% to ASC revenues. (VMG, 2010)</li>

<p>A long-term care hospital provides inpatient services, by or under the supervision of a physician, to patients whose medically complex conditions require a long hospital stay and programs of care provided by a long-term care hospital. The average inpatient length of stay is greater than 25 days. A long-term care hospital has active physician involvement with patients during their treatment through an organized medical staff, physician-directed treatment with physician on-site availability on a daily basis to review patient progress, and consulting physicians on call and capable of being at the patient's side within a moderate period of time, and an interdisciplinary team.<sup><a href="#noteE5">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 align="CENTER">C. Community Mental Health Center</h3>
<p>Community mental health centers (CMHCs) came about as a result of legislation enacted in 1963 (the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, P.L. 88-164), to provide localities with funding for the development of CMHCs as part of the deinstitutionalization movement, and to provide services for the uninsured poor. With the passage of the 1981 Omnibus Reconciliation Act, mandatory federal funding ceased to federally qualified CMHCs (thus, eliminating the federal designation of CMHC) and funding was block granted to states for the delivery of behavioral health services to multiple provider organizations, including CMHCs and other multi-service mental health organizations. Most CMHC funds are controlled by the state mental health agency, although Medicare still recognizes CMHCs as a provider of partial hospitalization services, and in June 2011 proposed Conditions of Participation for CMHCs to ensure basic levels of quality and safety for CMHC care.<sup><a href="##noteF5">5</a></sup></p>

<h2><a name="appendI" id="appendI">APPENDIX I. TABLE SUMMARY OF PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVISIONS WITH RELATIONSHIP TO INELIGIBLE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH IT USE</a></h2>
<p>This table provides a summary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) provisions that potentially:</p>
<ul><li>impact the ineligible provides who are the focus of this study; and</li>
<li>require or could leverage the use of health IT to support health information exchange.</li>
</ul><p>The summary was compiled from the law and/or from implementing guidance by the authorized agency during the implementation of the provision. It should be noted that the summary is not intended to express Departmental views on statutory interpretation of provisions in the Affordable Care Act. Rather, the table highlights provisions in the Affordable Care Act that either: (i) required or could support the use of health IT, or (ii) required or imply the exchange of health information. Some of the health information exchange provisions in the Affordable Care Act require electronic health information exchange, while other provisions do not specify the method of exchange (e.g., information exchange could be electronic or manual).</p>

<h2><a name="appendJ" id="appendJ">APPENDIX J. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<p>This study identified ineligible providers based on: (i) the definition in HITECH §3000(3); and (ii) those HITECH identified providers that could participate in the Medicare or Medicaid Programs. The definition of health care provider in HITECH does not include certain healthcare providers that are key for delivering behavioral health services. Identifying the behavioral health provider types included in the behavioral health cluster in this report was particularly challenging in large part due to the historic blurring of behavioral health providers and the services provided by these entities. This appendix identifies the behavioral health providers included in the study and describes the services these types of providers can deliver. In addition, this appendix identified those behavioral health provider types evaluated, but not included in this study.</p>

They provide treatment and support to help the client recover from addiction or modify problem behaviors.<sup>a</sup><p>HITECH 3000(3) does not include the health care provider type of licensed counselor. We note that Medicare and Medicaid may cover various categories of professionals considered to be licensed counselors.</p></td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Psychiatric Advanced Practice Nurse</strong></td>
<td>Nurse practitioners (NP) or clinical nurse specialists (CNS) in psychiatric mental health nursing. States and place of service often title Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurse (APPN) differently. For example, in New Jersey APPNs with CNS or NP credentials in psychiatric mental health nurse are titled by the state as nurse practitioners. Standardizing the titling among states and places is a goal of American Psychiatric Nurse Association. From a national perspective, little difference exists between APPN roles except that nurse practitioners may provide primary health care for patients and in all states they have prescriptive authority.
<p>Psychiatric advanced practice nurses are not identified in HITECH Section 3000(3). However, some psychiatric practice nurses may also be clinical nurse specialists or nurse practitioners. Clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners subject to volume thresholds are eligible for Medicaid EHR incentives. This study does not include a study of these providers.</p></td>

<td>Partial hospitalization is a type of treatment program that is used to treat behavioral health conditions. An individual who is being treated in a partial hospitalization program is living at home, but commutes to treatment center up to 7 days a week. Partial hospitalization services are affiliated with a hospital and may be licensed as part of the hospital or a separate free standing program. Group therapy, individual therapy, medication management and other services are provided in the partial hospitalization setting.

<p>Some states have used funding through their State Health Information Exchange (SHIE) Cooperative Agreement with ONC. The SHIE Cooperative Agreement is a grant program to support states or State Designated Entities (SDEs) as they establish health information exchange (HIE) capabilities for eligible and ineligible providers.</p>
<p>The SHIE Cooperative Agreement requires states seeking funding to advance the electronic exchange and use of health information technology to develop an infrastructure that addresses the following domains: technical, technical and business operations, financial, policy and legal (e.g., privacy/security including access, authentication, and authorization), and governance. Some of the health IT infrastructure enhancements eligible for funding through a SHIE Cooperative Agreement (dependent on what the state submitted and ONC approved) are provided in <a href="#tableK1">Table K1</a>.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>State awardees have flexibility to use funds for activities identified and agreed to under their cooperative agreement with ONC, including funding the infrastructure to support connectivity between all providers whether they are EPs, EHs or non-eligible EHR providers. For example, Alabama is considering as an HIE enhancement the capacity for EHR support for Community Mental Health Centers that will be participating in the state's Medicaid Health Home Initiative through the development of a web-based CCD. In FFY 2011, funding for the SHIE was 100% federal. In FFY 2012 the match rate is $7 federal to $1 state and in FFY 2013, the last year of the grant, the federal grant is $3 to $1 state.</p>
<p><i><b>Medicaid Health Home State Plan Option</b></i><sup><a href="#noteK2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Section 1945 of the Social Security Act, along with the guidance provided in Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) Informational Bulletins and CMS State Medicaid Director Letter #10-024 of November 16, 2010,<sup><a href="#noteK3">3</a></sup> provides parameters for the State Plan Option for Health Homes for Enrollees with Chronic Conditions. It gives authority to State Medicaid Agencies to receive a 90 percent match for eight quarters to provide enhanced reimbursement for health home providers.</p>
<p>As defined by the state, health home providers may include designated providers, a team of health care professionals (physicians, nurse care coordinators, dieticians/nutritionists, social workers, behavioral health professionals and other professionals) or an interdisciplinary, inter-professional health team. Inter-professional health teams must include medical specialists, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, dieticians, social workers, behavioral health providers (including mental health providers, and substance use disorder prevention and treatment providers), doctors of chiropractic, licensed complementary and alternative medicine practitioners, and physicians' assistants.</p>
<p>The Medicaid health home benefit is targeted to Medicaid enrollees with at least two chronic conditions or one chronic condition and at risk for another, and/or individuals with a serious and persistent mental health condition. Medicaid health home providers must have the ability to use health IT, including an EHR, to link services and facilitate communication among team members and between the health team and individual and family caregivers. Health home providers must provide comprehensive transitional care, including appropriate follow-up from inpatient to other settings. The Health Home State Plan can be a mechanism for accommodating some of the health IT expenses of those providers. The state must define in its State Plan Amendment (Attachment 4.19B, Methods and Standards for Establishing Payment Rates) the parameters of the payment to assure efficiency, economy and quality of care.</p>
<p>Some state approaches to leveraging the Medicaid Health Home benefit as a vehicle to extend the use of Health IT/EHRs to support the exchange of health information on half of the persons who receive LTPAC or BH services follow. These examples are not a comprehensive list of all state approaches in this area.</p>

<p><i>Colorado:</i> Officials from the State of Colorado indicated that they expect to submit a State Plan Amendment for the Health Home benefit to support improved care coordination on behalf of persons receiving LTPAC services. Prior to submitting the State Plan Amendment, Colorado officials are conducting a strategic review of the various health IT and HIE activities underway and needed in their State so that when the amendment is submitted Colorado will positioned to most effectively use the time-limited enhanced federal match (available for eight quarters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>New York</i>: One of New York's first health home initiatives will focus on enrollees with behavioral health and/or chronic medical conditions.<sup><a href="#noteK4">4</a></sup> New York anticipates targeting persons who receive long-term care services in a subsequent phase of their Health Home Program. To facilitate the use of health IT by health homes to improve service delivery and coordination across the care continuum, New York has developed initial and final health IT standards for health homes that are consistent with New York State's Operational Plan for Health IT and Exchange.<sup><a href="#noteK5">5</a></sup> Providers must meet initial health IT standards to implement a health home and must provide a plan to achieve the final standards within 18 months of program acceptance.</p>
<p>Since New York anticipates a portion of health home providers may not utilize health IT in their current programs, health home providers must commit to utilizing regional health information organizations or qualified entities to the extent feasible and to develop partnerships that maximize the use of health IT across providers (EPs, EHs and non-eligible providers).<sup><a href="#noteK6">6</a></sup> New York Medicaid Health Home providers must use or have a plan for when and how they will implement an EHR that qualifies under MU.<sup><a href="#noteK7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The New York Digital Health Accelerator (NTDHA), a joint program by the New York State Department of Health (DOH), New York eHealthCollaborative (NYeHC) and the New York City Investment Fund, is a program for 12 information technology startups or growth companies to develop products for "care coordination, patient engagement, analytics and message alerts for healthcare providers".<sup><a href="#noteK8">8</a></sup> In addition to a $300,000 monetary award, the companies will collaborate with senior level managers at leading participating hospitals and leading digital entrepreneurs for mentorship and will have access to the digital technology that is connecting EHRs among providers throughout the state through the Statewide Health Information Network of New York (SHIN-NY). The accelerator program has already secured an initial investment of $4.2 million from backers including Aetna, Milestone Venture Partners, New Leaf Venture Partners, New York City Investment Fund, Quaker Partners, Safeguard Scientifics, and UnitedHealth Group. Applications are due June 1, 2012 with a program start date of September 10, 2012.<sup><a href="#noteK9">9</a></sup> Ineligible providers including the Visiting Nurse Services in two counties are participating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>West Virginia</i>: West Virginia, like Alabama, is in the process of implementing a statewide HIEthrough their ONC Cooperative Agreement that will facilitate the sharing of information across various care delivery settings. All health home providers will be expected to participate in the HIE as it is implemented across the state.<sup><a href="#noteK10">10</a></sup> West Virginia has received a planning grant from CMS<sup><a href="#noteK11">11</a></sup> to develop the State Plan amendment (SPA) and the state is working closely with the West Virginia Health Improvement Institute on the development of the SPA.<sup><a href="#noteK12">12</a></sup> Eligibility criteria to quality for the program include for individuals with chronic conditions residence in a long-term care facility.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Beacon Community Program Grants that Support Behavioral Health, Long-Term Post-Acute Care and Other Non-Eligible Providers </b></i></p>
<p>ONC awarded grants to 17 "Beacon Community Programs" (BCPs) to support innovative interoperable HIE activities. Several BCPs focus on HIE with BH, LTPAC and other providers non-eligible for the MU EHR Incentive programs. BCPs that include a focus on these non-eligible providers are described below:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Rhode Island's Beacon Community Program</i>: Spearheaded by the Rhode Island Quality Institute (RIQI), the Rhode Island BCP received $15,914,787, to build upon existing strengths in developing Patient Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs) by enriching them with greater health IT to support registered, clinical decision support tools, and health care quality reporting to drive improvements. Rhode Island, which has implemented a HIE system called <i>current</i> care, seeks to reduce the impact of undiagnosed, untreated depression through increased screening.<sup><a href="#noteK13">13</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Southeastern Minnesota Beacon Community</i>: The 11-county Southeastern Minnesota Beacon Community, which received $12,284,770, has been identified as one of the most advanced communities in terms of health IT. Virtually 100 percent of primary care providers in the area have EHRs, and Winona County has a decade of experience with "wired" connectivity of health information among health care and community partners. This Beacon Community seeks to facilitate better care coordination and clinical transformation among clinics, hospitals, the public health department, and schools in the community. In Olmsted County, it has been shown that sharing action plans for children with asthma across primary care clinics, schools, and the public health department reduces health care utilization and improves school attendance.<sup><a href="#noteK14">14</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Southern Piedmont Beacon Community (SPBC)</i>: The SPBC received $15,907,622 to serve a three-county area in North Carolina that has extensive EHR adoption, including all three nonprofit hospitals and the VA hospital, and close to 60 percent of the ambulatory care physicians in the area. SPBC is expanding the benefits of the care management model to other chronic diseases as well as increasing effective use of technologies to support early detection services, such as mammograms and colorectal cancer screenings. The goal of the SPBC is to use health IT to support increased communication and collaboration among members of the care team, including care managers, pharmacists, and mental health counselors, through specialized software notification to care managers when patients are due to be discharged so that plans can be made for a smooth transition from hospital to home or other health care settings.</p>
<p>Care managers and nurse practitioners, armed with laptops and access to EHRs and other information; provide home visits to patients within three days following hospital discharge. Computer software allows care managers and other clinicians to identify patients with ischemic vascular disease (clogging of the arteries) to ensure patients receive evidence-based interventions and appropriate monitoring of blood pressure and cholesterol levels. School nurses monitor students who have asthma and send updates to the child's primary care providers through a secure portal that will be available to their primary care pediatricians. Inhalers with GPS tracking capabilities, coupled with smart phone and web-based applications, are helping approximately 2,000 asthma patients manage their condition better.<sup><a href="#noteK15">15</a></sup> To improve care coordination, care managers, mental health counselors and pharmacists are being added to the health team for individuals with certain chronic diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Keystone Beacon Community Program (BCP)</i>: The Keystone BCP will extend the health infrastructure used in this Pennsylvania community by enabling LTPAC providers (even those without EHRs) to make available in their data repository clinically-useful assessment data. Assessment data will be summarized, transformed, and made interoperable by software running at the repository. Assessment Summary Documents and other clinical information are made available at the repository to authorized users using a patient identifier. Keystone is presently piloting the use of a document exchange standard previously endorsed by ONC. In December 2012, Keystone will conduct a Phase 2 pilot using the refined C-CDA.<sup><a href="#noteK16">16</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Bangor Beacon Community</i>: The Bangor BCP focuses on improving the health of patients with diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, and asthma by enhancing care management; improving access to, and use of, adult immunization data; preventing unnecessary ED visits and re-admissions to hospitals; and facilitating access to patient records using health information technology. To achieve their goals they are using information technology to enhance coordinated care management, improving access to adult immunization data, reducing unnecessary emergency department visits and readmissions through health IT, and facilitating patient access to their records.<sup><a href="#noteK17">17</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Hawaii County Beacon Community:</i> The Hawaii County BCP is improving the health of the Hawaii Island residents through health care system improvements and interventions across independent hospitals, physicians, and physician groups and in partnership with public and private health insurers. Engaging patients in their own health care is also a primary focus. This will be accomplished by implementing a patient-centered medical home and telemedicine to improve primary, specialty and behavioral health care; monitor patients more closely to avert onset and advancement of diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol; reduce health disparities for Native Hawaiians; and assist physicians in achieving meaningful use of electronic health records.<sup><a href="#noteK18">18</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Western New York Beacon Community</i>: The Western New York BCP is working to close gaps in service, and improve health outcomes for patients with diabetes by reducing emergency room visits, hospitalizations and readmissions; increasing control of their condition, improving smoking cessation, increasing flu immunizations, reducing disparities especially in urban and rural underserved areas through health IT to facilitate patient monitoring and treatment; and by expanding patient access to their health information.<sup><a href="#noteK19">19</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Infrastructure: ONC Challenge Grants for LTPAC</b></i></p>
<p>ONC awarded LTPAC Challenge Grants to four states to extend their state health IT infrastructure to include LTPAC providers. The focus of these challenge grants is described below.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Massachusetts Technology Park Challenge Grant</i>: Massachusetts Technology Park was awarded two HIE Challenge Grants ($1.7 million for improving long-term and post-acute care transitions and $1.6 million for fostering distributed population-level analytics).<sup><a href="#noteK20">20</a></sup> The Massachusetts Challenge grant will extend the State health infrastructure by deploying software (and perhaps hardware) to enable the interoperable exchange of: (i) data from LTPAC providers (even if they do not have EHRs); and (ii) inclusion of functional status, cognitive status, and pressure ulcers data from other health care providers (e.g., EPs and EHs). Massachusetts will pilot this exchange in late 2012, and expects later to extend this technology statewide.<sup><a href="#noteK21">21</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Colorado Challenge Grant</i>: As the state designated HIE, Colorado Regional Health Information Organization (CORHIO) was awarded a grant of $1,718,783 in 2011 to facilitate adoption of EHRs and measure the impact of HIE on LTPAC transitions.<sup><a href="#noteK22">22</a></sup> CORHIO is working with LTPAC organizations, including home health, hospice, skilled nursing, assisted living, long-term acute care hospitals and residential care facilities for the developmentally disabled to improve care transitions to and from acute care settings through the HIE. The goals of the program are to facilitate adoption of HIE by the LTPAC community, develop community protocol for information sharing across care transitions, and measure the impact of HIE on quality of patient care and rates of hospital readmissions.</p>
<p>In four diverse Colorado communities (Boulder County, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and the San Luis Valley), CORHIO is working with LTPAC organizations to demonstrate the value of participating with the rest of the local and statewide health care community in improving information sharing and care coordination through HIE. CORHIO has identified 320 LTPAC providers in the targeted communities, with a goal of 50 percent (160) participating in HIE by January 2014.<sup><a href="#noteK23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The first tier of qualified LTPAC applicants will receive funding from the Challenge Grant sufficient to cover: (i) the cost of their one-time set up fee of $2000; and (ii) the cost of two-years of monthly subscription fees for use of CORHIO's HIE. The second tier of qualified applicants will receive funding sufficient to cover: (i) the cost of a one-time set up fee of $2000; and (ii) the cost of one-year of monthly subscription fees for use of CORHIO's PatientCare.<sup><a href="#noteK24">24</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Oklahoma Challenge Grant</i>:<sup><a href="#noteK25">25</a></sup> The Oklahoma Health Care Authority received $1,719,086 to implement processes that optimize efficient and well-orchestrated patient transitions, including implementation of a Clinical Documentation Tool (CDT).<sup><a href="#noteK26">26</a></sup> The Oklahoma Health Information Exchange (OHIET) is focusing on improving transitions of care between hospitals and LTC facilities by implementing electronic information exchange to support patient care during and after patient transfers. In addition to the implementation of the technology to support electronic exchange of patient-specific information, they are focusing on improving workflow and processes associated with care transitions to ensure effective use of information to improve patient care.</p>
<p>Selected pilot nursing homes will access the regional HIE via a lightweight-hosted ambulatory EHR installed as a CDT. In addition, a continuity of care document (CCD) would be available for any transfer in or out of a long-term care facility in the Norman Regional Health System pilot region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Maryland Challenge Grant</i>:<sup><a href="#noteK27">27</a></sup> The goal of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who received $1,683,171 in 2011, is to pilot the electronic exchange of clinical documents between pairs of long-term care centers and proximate hospital emergency departments (EDs). The pilot will center on six large long-term care facilities across Maryland, with some services being offered to every facility in the state. Each participating long-term care facility is paired with a hospital in its immediate medical service area. The state will analyze the reduction in average time to transmit such information compared to the status quo, and the effect on hospital readmission rates for patients participating in the pilot versus a control group.<sup><a href="#noteK28">28</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The technology solutions under development and piloting in the four states could be re-used by other states and communities to engage LTPAC providers in HIE activities. For example, representatives in Colorado and Oklahoma have expressed an interest in potentially leveraging the tools created by Massachusetts.</p>
<p><i><b>Technical Assistance to States through the State Health Policy Consortium (SMPC)</b></i></p>
<p>SMPC, established through a HHS contract with RTI in March 2010, facilitates groups of states in resolving policy issues at a concrete level to enable electronically-exchanged health information across state lines. Building on previous work of the Health Information Security and Privacy Collaboration (HISPC) project, this effort seeks to pursue development of template language for interstate agreements or other similar mechanisms that will enable interstate HIE despite differences in individual state consent laws. The Upper Midwest (UM-HIE) Consortium convened representatives from six states, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, to work together to create concrete regional solutions to barriers affecting HIE for treatment purposes.<sup><a href="#noteK29">29</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Infrastructure: Behavioral Health Data Exchange Consortium</b></i></p>
<p>Created to pilot the interstate exchange of BH treatment records among treating health care providers using the Nationwide Health Information Direct protocols, this project involves the creation of draft Policies and Procedures (P&amp;P) for exchange of BH records. The pilot is intent on meeting the requirements of federal regulations at 42 CFR Part 2 and participating state mental health laws. To achieve this, the group of states (Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, New Mexico, Nebraska and Michigan) has created sample Part 2 compliant consent forms (one for universal disclosure of health information and one for more limited disclosure).</p>
<p><i><b>SAMHSA Health IT Grants: Increase Access to Behavioral Health Services</b></i><sup><a href="#noteK30">30</a></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Community Health Centers</i>: In September 2011, SAMHSA awarded 47 community health centers serving people with mental and substance use disorders $200,000 each to develop health IT and expand the use of EHRs.<sup><a href="#noteK31">31</a></sup></p>

<h3 align="CENTER">C. Proposals to Make Available Loans for EHRs for Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The following table identifies some proposals from some stakeholders to make available loans to support the costs related to EHRs for ineligible provider types, such as long-term and post-acute, and behavioral health providers. This summary is not intended to be a complete list of options that have been proposed. Rather the list serves to highlights some of the suggestions by some stakeholders regarding the use of loans for costs related to EHRs. Further, this list is not intended as endorsement of any one of these options. Instead, the summary serves only to list some of the actions that have been proposed that could support the use of EHR technology by ineligible providers. The text in the table below quotes from the referenced documents.</p>

In today's economic reality of severe state deficits, states may otherwise not be able to secure the funding needed to participate in this program.</td>

<td><b>IMPEDIMENTS TO THE ROLL-OUT OF IT HEALTHCARE STRATEGIES (pp.1-2)</b>:<br />More incentives, in the form of grants, tax-credits and low-interest loans, are needed to enable long-term providers to prepare their information and communications infrastructure and deploy new technologies, including health IT and interoperable EHR systems, and other technologies including technologies for care documentation by direct care workers that improve the quality of care. Such health IT infrastructure and EHR systems, that are interoperable across provider settings, ensure the continuity of information, and thus the continuity of care, and can lead to reducing medical errors, duplicative procedures and expenditures, while improving care quality, especially for the aging population.</td>

<p>HCTAA is a wholly-owned affiliate of the NAHC, and is organized to advance the accessibility and use of technology in home care and hospice settings. HCTAA was established to unite the home care technology industry into a stronger, more effective voice to Congress, the Administration, state legislatures, the home care industry, consumers, and the media. HCTAA believes that home care and hospice providers that are properly equipped with technological solutions will serve a central role in the delivery of healthcare by ensuring quality, efficiency, and patient care coordination.</p></strong></td>

We are contacting you today to provide two recommendations designed to maximize the return on this significant one time investment in the national health IT infrastructure:
<ol><li>We recommend that ONC include language in the ARRA requests for health IT grant and loan proposals advising applicants of the benefits of and need to seek partners from different care settings, including long-term care and providing such help as may be necessary to help identify potential partners (such as providing lists of federally certified providers in various areas).</li>
<li>In addition, we recommend that ONC specify that one of the evaluation criteria for selecting grant/loan recipients will be a preference for those who do partner with long-term care providers (and other health care providers who will not receive financial incentives).</li>

<p><i><b>Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Technical Assistance: LTPAC Providers </b></i></p>
<p>Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are helping doctors, hospitals, and home health agencies across the country harness the power of the latest information technologies such as EHRs, registries, e-prescribing, and telemedicine.<sup><a href="#noteM1">1</a></sup> QIOs will partner with Beacon Communities and RECs to integrate with state and local HIE efforts to encourage reporting via EHRs to state Immunization Information Systems (state registry). As directed by CMS, QIOs may perform onsite teaching or mentoring including training on evidence based interventions.<sup><a href="#noteM2">2</a></sup> For example, StratisHealth, Minnesota and North Dakota's QIO, provides actionable tools and resources to assist health care organizations in planning for and optimizing use of health IT, including a toolkit specifically for home health and another for nursing homes.<sup><a href="#noteM3">3</a></sup> In addition, the QIO program in the 10<sup>th</sup>SOW has a directed special innovation project in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Colorado focusing on providing technical assistance to long-term care providers and acute care hospitals to assist in the following key areas:</p>
<ol><li>Improve quality and coordination of care through the effective use of health IT during care transitions.</li>
<li>Leverage standardized patient assessment content to facilitate health information exchange (HIE).</li>
<li>Reduce medical errors by improving the medication management process through the use of EHR functionality.</li>
</ol><p><i><b>State Agencies Working with Behavioral Health Providers through SAMHSA</b></i></p>
<p>SAMHSA developed an EHRs Acquisition Guide for state and territorial behavioral health agencies. SAMHSA also collaborated with CMS to develop behavioral health components within the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) framework. SAMHSA developed a guide to assist mental health and substance use state agencies in obtaining assistance through CMS for information technology initiatives to integrate mental health, substance use, and Medicaid data systems.<sup><a href="#noteM4">4</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Behavioral Health Community Connection to Illinois Health Information Exchange using SAMHSA/HRSA Funded Cooperative Agreement</b></i><sup><a href="#noteM5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Illinois received $600,000 in federal funding to support their Behavioral Health Integration Project (BHIP), whose goal is to promote the exchange of health information among behavioral health and medical care providers to achieve better care. Grant activities will help licensed substance abuse and mental health practitioners' better coordinate patient care with their clients' primary care providers through a secure electronic HIE. Illinois is one of five (Kentucky, Maine, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Illinois) State Designated Entities (SDEs) that received funds (through the Center for Integrated Health Solutions (CIHS)/SAMHSA-HRSA funded cooperative agreement) for the development of infrastructure supporting HIE between behavioral health and physical health providers.</p>
<p><i><b>Vulnerable Populations Toolkit</b></i></p>
<p>This module was designed to help guide HIE activities in planning to support inclusion of vulnerable populations with LTPAC and BH needs. State health IT Coordinators and LTPAC and BH providers were the two audiences targeted for this Toolkit Module. The toolkit describes how inclusion of these vulnerable populations relates to:</p>
<ul><li>Meaningful Use (MU) criteria for eligible hospitals (EHs) and eligible professionals (EPs); and</li>
<li>Quality measures for EHs and EPs.</li>
</ul><p>The toolkit:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Describes: frequency of transitions in care; instances of "shared care" (multiple service providers) over time and during single episodes; opportunities for poor quality/poor coordination of care, costs of care…).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides: data on numbers of individuals receiving and providers of LTPAC and BH services; and expenditures for these services.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ul><li>CMS Final Rule on EHR Incentives and ONC Rules on standards and certification; and</li>
<li>HIE needs of persons receiving LTPAC and BH services.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The Toolkit identifies several recommended practices, including:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>States/State Designated Entities should identify and implement actions needed to:</p>
<ul><li>Ensure inclusion of "vulnerable populations" in planning/implementing information exchange; and</li>
<li>Provide technical assistance to providers serving "vulnerable populations" to enable development/dissemination of solutions that promote information exchange.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>It is incumbent upon States/State Designated Entities to define the scope of "vulnerable populations" for purposes of planning and implementing HIE activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States/State Designated Entities should support the exchange of clinical information to be transmitted by eligible professionals (EPs) or eligible hospitals (EHs) that is also of high value to LTPAC and BH service providers including:</p>
<ul><li>Patient summary documents;</li>
<li>Advance Directive information;</li>
<li>Medication information; and</li>
<li>Test results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>State/State Designated Entity planning and implementation activities should recognize and include participation by state and local agencies engaged with LTPAC and BH providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State health IT coordinators should coordinate with regional extension centers to consider the need for technical assistance to EPs to ensure proper construction and calculation of the EHR Incentive Program QMs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States/State Designated Entities should consider steps to advance the use of adopted standards by providers serving vulnerable populations.</p>

"Eligible Medicaid Providers" (p.9)</b>:<br />The states request that CMS recognize that the Act excludes many relevant and key providers from participating in the incentive program. Specifically, the states argue that community mental health centers and other behavioral health providers, nursing homes, community long-term care providers, and home health care providers should be eligible for incentive payments as they are critical partners in improving the quality and coordination of care for the Medicaid population. The states recognize that this is a statutory issue, but feel strongly that exclusion of these critical providers impacts Medicaid's ability to improve the quality and efficiency of care. The states recommend that CMS allow states and the regional extension centers (RECs) to provide education and training, technical assistance, and infrastructure as relevant to support these excluded providers pursuant to the 90/10 funding. By including these excluded providers in education and training, the states can set the stage for eventually achieving the long-term goal of helping all providers serving Medicaid exchanging data and be meaningful users of EHRs.</td>

<td><b>NAHC and HCTAA: comments on the definition of "Meaningful Use" of Electronic Health Records (EHR), as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009" (June 25, 2009)</b>:<br />We specifically would urge the ONCHIT to ensure that:
<ul><li>HIE grant funding be made to RHIOs/HIEs emphasize the need to include and support home health care providers to effectively facilitate the electronic exchange of health information across different care settings;</li>
<li>Grants and loans be made available to home health care providers to plan for and implement certified, interoperable health IT solutions;</li>
<li>Regional Extension Centers provide technical assistance for home health care providers seeking integration into the health information network, in addition to other acute care providers in their regions….</li>
</ul><p>…as we have stated, the goal of care coordination requires the exchange of timely health information among all care providers. This goal cannot be achieved unless it is inclusive of home health care and hospice providers. With appropriate resources for implementation and standardization of EHRs, further steps can be taken by the home care and hospice community to meet the objectives of the meaningful use of EHRs and care coordination.</p>
<p><b>NAHC/HCTAA comments on the 2011-2015 Federal Health Information Technology Strategic Plan (May 6, 2011):<br />(p.2)</b>: It is promising that the RECs will work with the community-based organizations and we hope that if this partnership extends to home care and hospice agencies that we will be able to help the RECs better serve not only underserved and communities of color but also disabled persons. The ONC should advise the 62 Regional Extension Centers across the country to extend their guidance and technical assistance on certified EHR adoption and utilization to ineligible providers, including home care and hospice providers. This strategy would foster a business model for RECs that supports all health care providers and will enable them to operate without federal grant funds beyond 2015.</p>
<p><b>(p.3)</b>: It would also be helpful if the ONC would help educate incentivized providers and hospitals about the benefits of accepting clinical information from home care and hospice providers so that the information they receive from the community is not devalued because it is not ONC Certified. Facilitating the exchange and receipt of health information between physicians, hospitals, and other clinical professionals within the care continuum will help to improve patient care coordination especially for those who are chronically ill.</p></td>

<td><b>April 16, 2009. Inclusion of Long-Term Care Settings in ARRA Funded Projects Letter to the David Blumenthal (the National HIT Coordinator) (p.2)</b>:<br />We believe that implementing our ARRA recommendations would substantially help ensure that organizations likely to be primary drivers of adoption of standards-based EHRs and facilitators of health information exchange, such as Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs) and Regional Health Information Technology Extensions Centers, are inclusive of all provider settings and serve broad and diverse populations, including persons requiring long-term care. Advancing policies that extend interoperable health information exchange and use to support the needs of persons requiring long-term care (including the use of standards for patient assessments) will be necessary to meet the ARRA goal that each person in the U.S. use an EHR by 2014.
<p><b>June 11, 2009 Health IT Extension Program Comments. Letter to the David Blumenthal (the National HIT Coordinator) (p.1)</b>:<br />Our collaborative has worked to ensure that long-term care is included in the health IT provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and Health Information technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Fully including this substantial sector of the health care community in interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to reforming the health care system.</p>
<p>The Extension Program includes provisions addressing the unique needs of providers of historically underserved populations including long-term care. In order to achieve the goals of HITECH, Regional Health IT Extension Centers must offer technical assistance to long-term care providers (nursing homes, assisted-living, home health, PACE providers, etc) as a priority group. This technical assistance is essential so that the health care community (both acute and post-cute) become "meaningful users", have the training and support necessary to create and implement the EHR infrastructure and exchange health information across care settings. Technical assistance to achieve meaningful user status will give acute care providers the opportunity to receive incentive payments under Medicare and Medicaid. Technical assistance will enhance long-term care providers' ability to further improve the quality of care for residents. Furthermore, we request that the scope of work for the Regional Health IT Extension Centers require specific inclusion of long-term care providers as stakeholders, partners and an important priority group for receiving direct technical assistance.</p>
<p>Excluding long-term care will slow down the adoption of interoperable EHRs for each person in the U.S. and cause harm to our most vulnerable citizens as they migrate through the health care system with numerous providers during single episodes of care and overtime across multiple episodes of care.</p>
<p><b>May 6, 2011.

<p><b>(p.1)</b>: … the Collaborative broadly recommends full inclusion of the LTPAC health sector in the Federal Health Information Technology Strategic Plan to improve quality and reduce care disparities through meaningful use and systematic exchange of health information among all providers in all settings."</p>
<p><b>(pp.2-5)</b>: The following comments build on what is contained in the Strategic Plan and further extend it to better meet the needs of the large population that LTPAC serves….</p>
<p><b>OBJECTIVE I.A: Accelerate adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR)<br />STRATEGY I.A.7: Align federal programs and services with the adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR </b><br />We applaud the ONC for planning to include methods to encourage providers that are not eligible for the incentive programs such as LTPAC to achieve meaningful use of information technology as well.</p>
<p><b>OBJECTIVE I.B: Facilitate information exchange to support meaningful use of EHR</b><br />Suggest including LTPAC settings with any example of provider settings.</p>
<p><b>OBJECTIVE I.C: Support health IT adoption and information exchange for public health and populations with unique needs.<br />STRATEGY I.C.3: Support health IT adoption and information exchange in LTPAC, behavioral health, and emergency care settings.</b><br />The Federal Health IT Strategic Plan notes ONC is working with SAMHSA and HRSA to address the policies and standards concerning the unique needs of behavioral health IT adoption and information exchange. The LTPAC Health IT Collaborative supports the inclusion of the unique needs of behavioral health identified in the strategic plan and offers these recommendations below supporting the unique needs of the LTPAC community:
</p><ul><li>Support for effective electronic health information exchange with ALL health professionals involved in delivering LTPAC needs of the consumer including <i>include Home Care services such as Care Management, Private Duty, and Skilled Nursing - and also the personal care needs, infusion, nutrition, rehabilitation, PT, OT, Speech therapy as well as durable medical equipment providers</i>.</li>
</ul><p><b>OBJECTIVE II.A: Support more sophisticated uses of EHRs and other health IT to improve health system performance.<br />STRATEGY II.A.1: Identify and implement best practices that use EHRs and other health IT to improve care, efficiency, and population health. </b>
</p><ul><li>Consider enhancing current language to "Clinical decision support (CDS) systems are tools that leverage EHRs to improve clinical processes--ADD NEW--"across ALL venues of care including LTPAC, behavioral health, and emergency care settings".</li>
<li>Usability is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in this GOAL so that systems providing clinical decision support provide consistent messaging and alerting across the continuum from acute care to LTPAC.</li>

<p><i><b>ONC Standards &amp; Interoperability (S&amp;I) Framework</b></i></p>
<p>ONC is sponsoring work to extend the interoperable health IT infrastructure to support the exchange and re-use of health information needed to provide services to medically complex and functionally impaired individuals, including persons who receive services by EPs, EHs, and non-eligible providers (such as LTPAC and BH providers). The CMS EHR Incentive Program -- Stage 2<sup><a href="#noteN1">1</a></sup> final rule includes requirements to provide a summary care record at transitions in care, including when such transitions are to providers who are not eligible for EHR incentives. To address the need for standards to support sharing of information between eligible and ineligible providers, the ONC rule on Standards, Implementation Specification, and Certification Criteria for EHR Technology, 2014 Edition<sup><a href="#noteN2">2</a></sup> provides a perspective on the priority areas for standards pertaining to ineligible providers:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We agree that it makes good policy sense to support interoperability and the secure electronic exchange of health information between all health care settings. We believe the adoption of EHR technology certified to a minimal amount of certification criteria adopted by the Secretary can support this goal. To this end, we encourage EHR technology developers to certify EHR Modules to the transitions of care certification criteria (§170.314(b)(1) and (2)) as well as any other certification criteria that may make it more effective and efficient for EPs, EHs, and CAHs to electronically exchange health information with health care providers in other health care settings. The adoption of EHR technology certified to these certification criteria can facilitate the secure electronic exchange of health information."</p>

Working in collaboration with HL7, the S&amp;I Framework advanced health IT standards that were named in the final ONC and CMS Stage 2 EHR MU rule, including standards for functional and cognitive status and pressure ulcer (these data element standards are included in the HL7 Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) which supports interoperable exchange of Summary of Care Records).</p>
<p>The S&amp;I Longitudinal Coordination of Care (LCC) Workgroup (WG), in collaboration with HL7, has advanced standards to support the interoperable exchange of functional and cognitive status, and pressure ulcer content, LTPAC summary documents and patient assessment documents. The C-CDA (referenced in the EHR certification criteria and standards for the Stage 2 EHR Incentive program) includes standards for functional and cognitive status, and the LTPAC Summary Documents.</p>
<p>In addition, the S&amp;I LCC WG is working to identify concepts and standards that could be included in Stage 3 of the EHR Incentive Program to enable the exchange of more comprehensive summary documents to support transitions of care and shared cared on behalf of medically complex and functionally impaired persons. In addition, the S&amp;I LCC WG is also working to advance standards that could be included in Stage 3 of the EHR Incentive Program for the interoperable exchange of care plans, including the home health plan of care.</p>
<p>S&amp;I Framework activities are also addressing an issue of critical importance to the behavioral health community for the secure exchange of health information -- specifically, data segmentation for privacy. Consensus use cases involve patients in inpatient Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment Programs (ADATP) to focus on patient information covered by 42 CFR Part 2 that cannot be disclosed without patient consent. The initiative is expected to be completed September 2012.<sup><a href="#noteN3">3</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>SAMHSA/CSAT Open Behavioral Health Information Technology Architecture (OBHITA)</b></i></p>
<p>The OBHITA contract supports the development of both data standards for behavioral health and HIT tools for advanced behavioral health care. The Reference Electronic Health Record Model (REM) EHR application is a sub-project of OBHITA that provides a platform to develop and pilot test advanced functionality for behavioral health care needs. The intent of this project is to develop standards based, open source modules, components and services that can be reused by existing EHRs and other health IT systems. These open source tools will then be made available for use and adaptation by the entire behavioral health and health care communities. Our current efforts are focused on developing an access control service tool that will support data segmentation and granular consent management for electronic health information exchange compliant with federal health information privacy regulations (42 CFR Part 2). SAMHSA is partnering with ONC and the Veterans Administration (VA) in this effort. SAMSHA's investment in the REM system provides a unique platform for quickly and agilely developing and testing functionality to support new models of health care including health homes.</p>
<p><i><b>Federal Communications Commission </b></i></p>
<p><i>Healthcare Connect Fund</i><sup><a href="#noteN4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In December 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) created the Healthcare Connect Fund to support state or regional broadband health care networks designed to bring the benefits of telehealth and telemedicine services to areas of the country where the need for those benefits is most acute.</p>
<p>The program provides a 65 percent discount on high-capacity broadband connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and to consortia of HCPs that have a majority of rural sites. Consortia may also obtain support for upfront charges under the Healthcare Connect Fund, which may include support for service provider deployment of new or upgraded facilities or for HCP-owned network facilities, if shown to be the most cost-effective option. Funding under the Healthcare Connect Fund will be available to all qualifying applicants starting January 1, 2014.</p>
<p>The Commission designed the Healthcare Connect Fund based on its experience with its RHC Pilot Program (established in 2006; closed to new applicants), where broadband health care provider networks were shown to reduce the cost and improve the quality of health care. The Pilot Program consists of 50 statewide or regional health care networks that provide broadband connectivity to roughly 3,800 HCP sites. With the necessary broadband connectivity, the Pilot Program participants were able to implement telemedicine and telehealth applications to help improve the quality of health care delivered to patients in rural areas, generate savings in the cost of providing health care, and reduce the time and expense associated with travel to distant locations to receive or provide care.</p>
<p>Pilot projects have already demonstrated how broadband health care networks can significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of providing health care in rural areas. For example: the Palmetto State Providers Network, located in South Carolina, reports that it saved $18 million dollars in Medicaid costs over 18 months as a result of its telepsychiatryprogram. Psychiatric consults are now available 24/7. Previously, patients would wait for days to receive psychiatric consults.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the Pilot Program, the FCC established the Healthcare Connect Fund to further encourage access and use of broadband by networks and individual HCPs.</p>
<p><i>Skilled Nursing Facility Pilot Program</i></p>
<p>The FCC is also creating a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Pilot Program to test how to support broadband connections to SNFs. SNFs are particularly well-suited to improve patient outcomes through greater use of broadband. By their nature, they are often remote from doctors and sophisticated laboratory and testing facilities, making the availability of EHRs and telehealth an especially valuable benefit to patients for whom traveling to see a doctor, diagnostician, or specialist would be especially difficult.</p>
<p>The SNF Pilot will focus on determining how to best utilize program support to assist SNFs that are using broadband connectivity to work with other health care providers (eligible for the FCC program) to optimize care for patients in SNFs through the use of EHRs, telemedicine, and other broadband-enabled health care applications. The pilot will provide up to $50 million in funding, over a three-year period, for discounted broadband connectivity. At the conclusion of the SNF Pilot, participants must demonstrate the health care cost savings and/or improved quality of patient care that they have realized through use of broadband, which should enable the Commission to gain experience and information that would allow it to determine whether such funding could be provided on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>The FCC is seeking input from government agencies and other stakeholders regarding the design of the pilot program, including the scoring criteria to be used to evaluate applications. The Commission expects to implement the program during Funding Year 2014.</p>

<p>Secondly, we urge that any data collection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services be through interoperable systems. We will not be able to achieve the goal of interoperability by 2014 if data collection in long-term care is done through a proprietary format, as CMS plans to do with the new MDS 3.0. This will inevitably set back the efforts to integrate long-term care data collection with the rest of the health care system and ultimately increase cost of making all systems interoperable by 2014….</p>

<h2><a name="appendO" id="appendO">APPENDIX O. ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE EHR SAFE HARBOR REGULATION</a></h2>
<p>This appendix provides a summary of the anti-kickback statute EHR safe harbor regulation, which is available to many providers, including certain ineligible providers. Below is an overview of the anti-kickback statute EHR safe harbor and its applicability to providers not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs, followed by a table containing the safe harbor regulatory text. At the time this report was written, we were unable to identify any ineligible providers that received donations via arrangements protected by the EHR safe harbor. The last section of the appendix identifies a proposal advanced by two stakeholder groups to extend the anti-kickback statute EHR safe harbor.</p>
<p><i><b>Overview of Anti-Kickback Statute EHR Safe Harbor and Possible Donations to Providers Ineligible for the EHR Incentive Programs</b></i></p>
<p>HITECH and Health Care Reform create a key business imperative for EHs and EPs to partner with LTPAC providers to support HIE. Depending on the particular facts, certain arrangements between such parties may implicate the anti-kickback statute. In order to have assurances that their arrangements will not be subject to liability under this law, parties may seek to structure their arrangements to fit within a the safe harbor.<sup><a href="#noteO1">1</a></sup> To encourage the adoption of electronic health records technology consistent with the ultimate goal of achieving fully interoperable electronic health records for all patients, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated (August 2006) a safe harbor to the anti-kickback statute for certain arrangements involving the donation of interoperable EHR software or information technology and training services. See <a href="#tableO1">Table O1</a>. Refer to: AKS: 42 CFR 1001.952(y).</p>
<p>The EHR safe harbor protects arrangements under which certain individuals and entities make donations (and cover up to 85 percent of cost) of EHR software or information technology and training services to health care providers (including those who are not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs) if certain conditions are met (see <a href="#tableO1">Table O1</a>). For example, a Medicare hospital could donate EHR software and training services to a nursing home, covering 85 percent of the cost, and receive safe harbor protection if all of the safe harbor conditions are met. Per regulation (see <a href="#tableO1">Table O1</a>), the safe harbor requires that donated software be "interoperable" and provides that such software will be "deemed to be interoperable if a certifying body recognized by the Secretary has certified the software no more than 12 months prior to the date it is provided to the recipient."  The safe harbor is scheduled to sunset at the end of 2013.</p>
<p><i><b>NOTE</b>: There are many important conditions in the EHR safe harbor, all of which MUST be met in order to receive protection. Those seeking to avail themselves of protection under this safe harbor should consult their legal counsel.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Proposals to Extend the Anti-Kickback Statute EHR Safe Harbor</b></i></p>
<p>The National Association for Home Care and Hospice (NAHC) asserts that the delivery of quality home health care and hospice services is very dependent upon the collaboration and exchange of health information across the continuum of care with physician and hospital systems. NAHC and its affiliated technology association, the Home Care Technology Association of America (HCTAA) have described their interest in strengthening the relationships of home health care agencies to both receive technologies from hospitals and other groups as well as to provide EHR technologies and services to physician partners under the EHR Safe Harbor provision. Towards that end, NAHC and HCTA have described:<sup><a href="#noteO2">2</a></sup></p>
<ul><li>Described the need to extend the safe harbor provision that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2013, and suggested aligning the EHR Safe Harbor provision with the EHR Incentive Programs to further encourage adoption of Certified Electronic Health Records by physicians.</li>
<li>Requested clarification regarding how the EHR Safe Harbor provision protects "other health care providers".</li>

<h2><a name="appendQ" id="appendQ">APPENDIX Q. REGULATIONS FOR MEDICAL RECORDS</a></h2>
<p>This appendix provides excerpts from the Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP) concerning medical records and plans of care for health care providers. Existing CoPlanguage could be updated to reflect contemporary use of EHR technology and aligned with Meaningful Use criteria. The following sections highlight regulatory requirements and interpretive guidelines surrounding patient medical records to demonstrate where they might align with the EHR Incentive Program and where the language could be updated to reflect current use of EHR technology and aligned with meaningful use criteria.</p>
<p>Regulatory language is provided for: (1) Hospitals, (2) Long-Term Care Facilities, (3)Home Health Agencies, (4) Hospice, (5) Outpatient Rehabilitation, (6) Outpatient Physical Therapy and Speech-Language Pathology, (7) Ambulatory Surgical Centers, (8) End Stage Renal Disease, (9) Psychiatric Hospitals, (10) Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and (11) Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID).</p>

<li>Does the hospital's system frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to gain access to their own medical record?</li>
<li>Does the procedure include the method to identify what documents were not provided and the reason?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><i>§482.23(c)(2)</i></p>
<ol type="i"><li>If verbal orders are used, they are to be used infrequently.</li>
<li>When verbal orders are used, they must only be accepted by persons who are authorized to do so by hospital policy and procedures consistent with federal and state law.</li>
</ol><blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(c)(2)(i)</b></p>
<p>Verbal orders should be used only to meet the care needs of the patient when it is impossible or impractical for the ordering practitioner to write the order or enter it into a computer (in the case of a hospital with an electronic prescribing system) without delaying treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>§482.24 Condition of Participation: Medical Record Services<br />[51 FR 22042, June 17, 1986, as amended at 71 FR 68694, November 27, 2006; 72 FR 66933, November 27, 2007; 77 FR 29074, May 16, 2012]</b></i></p>
<p>The hospital must have a medical record service that has administrative responsibility for medical records. A medical record must be maintained for every individual evaluated or treated in the hospital.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §482.24 </b></p>
<p>The term "<b>medical records</b>" includes at least written documents, computerized electronic information, radiology film and scans, laboratory reports and pathology slides, videos, audio recordings, and other forms of information regarding the condition of a patient.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><i>Standard: Organization and staffing.</i> The organization of the medical record service must be appropriate to the scope and complexity of the services performed. The hospital must employ adequate personnel to ensure prompt completion, filing, and retrieval of records.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><i>§482.24(b) Standard: Form and Retention of Record </i></p>
<p>The hospital must maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient. Medical records must be accurately written, promptly completed, properly filed and retained, and accessible. The hospital must use a system of author identification and record maintenance that ensures the integrity of the authentication and protects the security of all record entries.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(b) </b></p>
<p>These requirements apply to both manual and electronic medical record systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>§482.24(b)(1) -- Medical records must be retained in their original or legally reproduced form for a period of at least 5 years. </i></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(b)(1) </b></p>
<p>Medical records are retained in their original or legally reproduced form in hard copy, microfilm, computer memory, or other electronic storage media. The hospital must be able to promptly retrieve the complete medical record of every individual evaluated or treated in any part or location of the hospital within the last 5 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Survey Procedures §482.24(b)(1) </b></p>
<ul><li>Determine that records are retained for at least 5 years, or more if required by state or local laws.</li>
<li>Select a sample of patients, both inpatient and outpatient who were patients of the hospital between the previous 48-60 months. Request their medical record. Is it promptly retrieved? Is it complete? Is it in original or in a legally reproduced form?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><i>§482.24(b)(2) -- The hospital must have a system of coding and indexing medical records. The system must allow for timely retrieval by diagnosis and procedure, in order to support medical care evaluation studies.</i></p>
<p><i>§482.24(b)(3) -- The hospital must have a procedure for ensuring the confidentiality of patient records. Information from or copies of records may be released only to authorized individuals, and the hospital must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Original medical records must be released by the hospital only in accordance with federal or state laws, court orders, or subpoenas. </i></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(b)(3)</b></p>
<p>The hospital has sufficient safeguards to ensure that access to all information regarding patients is limited to those individuals designated by law, regulation, and policy; or duly authorized as having a need to know. No unauthorized access or dissemination of clinical records is permitted. Clinical records are kept secure and are only viewed when necessary by those persons having a part in the patient's care.</p>
<p>The right to confidentiality means safeguarding the content of information, including patient paper records, video, audio, and/or computer stored information from unauthorized disclosure without the specific informed consent of the individual, parent of a minor child, or legal guardian. Hospital staff and consultants, hired to provide services to the individual, should have access to only that portion of information that is necessary to provide effective responsive services to that individual.</p>
<p>Confidentiality applies to both central records and clinical record information that may be kept at dispersed locations.</p>
<p>The hospital's patient record system must ensure the security of patient records. The hospital must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to patient records and that individuals cannot alter patient records. Patient records must be secure at all times and in all locations. This includes open patient records for patients who are currently inpatients in the hospital and outpatients in outpatient clinics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Survey Procedures §482.24(b)(3)</b></p>
<ul><li>Verify that only authorized persons are permitted access to records maintained by the medical records department.</li>
<li>Verify that the hospital has a policy to grant patients direct access to his/her medical record if the responsible official (e.g., MD/DO responsible for patient's care) determines that direct access is not likely to have an adverse effect on the patient.</li>
<li>Verify that medical records and other confidential patient information are released only for patient care evaluation, utilization review, treatment, quality assurance programs, in-house educational purposes, or in accordance with federal or state law, court orders, or subpoenas.</li>
<li>Verify that copies of medical records and other confidential patient information are released outside the hospital only upon written authorization of the patient, legal guardian, or person with an appropriate -- power of attorney to act on the patient's behalf, or only if there is a properly executed subpoena or court order, or as mandated by federal and state law.</li>
<li>Verify that precautions are taken to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining physical access or electronic access to information in patient records.</li>
<li>Observe the hospital's security practices for patient records. Are patient records left unsecured or unattended? Are patient records unsecured or unattended in hallways, patient rooms, nurse's stations, or on counters where an unauthorized person could gain access to patient records?</li>

<p><i>§482.24(c)(1) -- All patient medical record entries must be legible, complete, dated, timed, and authenticated in written or electronic form by the person responsible for providing or evaluating the service provided, consistent with hospital policies and procedures. </i></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)(1) </b></p>
<p>All entries in the medical record must be <b>legible</b>. Orders, progress notes, nursing notes, or other entries in the medical record that are not legible may be misread or misinterpreted and may lead to medical errors or other adverse patient events.</p>
<p>All entries in the medical record must be <b>complete</b>. A medical record is considered complete if it contains sufficient information to identify the patient; support the diagnosis/condition; justify the care, treatment, and services; document the course and results of care, treatment, and services; and promote continuity of care among providers. With these criteria in mind, an individual entry into the medical record must contain sufficient information on the matter that is the subject of the entry to permit the medical record to satisfy the completeness standard.</p>
<p>All entries in the medical record must be <b>dated, timed, and authenticated</b>, in written or electronic form, by the person responsible for providing or evaluating the service provided.</p>
<ul><li>The time and date of each entry (orders, reports, notes, etc.) must be accurately documented. Timing establishes when an order was given, when an activity happened or when an activity is to take place. Timing and dating entries is necessary for patient safety and quality of care. Timing and dating of entries establishes a baseline for future actions or assessments and establishes a timeline of events. Many patient interventions or assessments are based on time intervals or timelines of various signs, symptoms, or events. (71 FR 68687)</li>
<li>The hospital must have a method to establish the identity of the author of each entry. This would include verification of the author of faxed orders/entries or computer entries.</li>
<li>The hospital must have a method to require that each author takes a specific action to verify that the entry being authenticated is his/her entry or that he/she is responsible for the entry, and that the entry is accurate.</li>
</ul><p>The requirements for dating and timing do not apply to orders or prescriptions that are generated outside of the hospital until they are presented to the hospital at the time of service. Once the hospital begins processing such an order or prescription, it is responsible for ensuring that the implementation of the order or prescription by the hospital is promptly dated, and timed in the patient's medical record.</p>
<p>In the case of a pre-established electronic order set, the same principles would apply, so that the practitioner would date, time and authenticate the final order that resulted from the electronic selection/annotation process, with the exception that pages with internal changes would not need to be initialed or signed if they are part of an integrated single electronic document.</p>
<p>Authentication of medical record entries may include written signatures, initials, computer key, or other code. For authentication, in written or electronic form, a method must be established to identify the author. When rubber stamps or electronic authorizations are used for authentication, the hospital must have policies and procedures to ensure that such stamps or authorizations are used only by the individuals whose signature they represent. There shall be no delegation of stamps or authentication codes to another individual. It should be noted that some insurers and other payers may have a policy prohibiting the use of rubber stamps as a means of authenticating the medical records that support a claim for payment. Medicare payment policy, for example, no longer permits such use of rubber stamps. Thus, while the use of a rubber stamp for signature authentication is not prohibited under the CoPs and analysis of the rubber stamp method per se is not an element of the survey process,hospitals may wish to eliminate their usage in order to avoid denial of claims for payment.</p>
<p><b>Where an electronic medical record is in use</b>, the hospital must demonstrate how it prevents alterations of record entries after they have been authenticated. Information needed to review an electronic medical record, including pertinent codes and security features, must be readily available to surveyors to permit their review of sampled medical records while on-site in the hospital.</p>
<p>When state law and/or hospital policy requires that entries in the medical record made by residents or non-physicians be countersigned by supervisory or attending medical staff members, then the medical staff rules and regulations must address counter-signature requirements and processes.</p>
<p>A system of auto-authentication in which a physician or other practitioner authenticates an entry that he or she cannot review (e.g., because it has not yet been transcribed, or the electronic entry cannot be displayed) is not consistent with these requirements. There must be a method of determining that the practitioner did, in fact, authenticate the entry after it was created. In addition, failure to disapprove an entry within a specific time period is not acceptable as authentication.</p>
<p>The practitioner must separately date and time his/her signature authenticating an entry, even though there may already be a date and time on the document, since the latter may not reflect when the entry was authenticated. For certain electronically-generated documents, where the date and time that the physician reviewed the electronic transcription is automatically printed on the document, the requirements of this section would be satisfied. However, if the electronically-generated document only prints the date and time that an event occurred (e.g., EKG printouts, lab results, etc.) and does not print the date and time that the practitioner actually reviewed the document, then the practitioner must either authenticate, date, and time this document itself or incorporate an acknowledgment that the document was reviewed into another document (such as the H&amp;P, a progress note, etc.), which would then be authenticated, dated, and timed by the practitioner.</p>

<p>The intent is to enable a facility to better monitor a resident's decline and progress over time. Computer-aided data analysis facilitates a more efficient, comprehensive and sophisticated review of health data. The primary purpose of maintaining the assessment data is so a facility can monitor resident progress over time. The information should be readily available at all times.</p>

<p>"Encoding" means entering MDS information into a computer.</p>
<p>"Transmitting data" refers to electronically sending encoded MDS information, from the facility to the <i>QIES ASAP System</i>, using a modemand communications software.</p>
<p>"Capable of transmitting" means that the facility has encoded and edited according to CMS specifications, the record accurately reflects the resident's overall clinical status as of the assessment reference date, and the record is ready for transmission.</p>
<p>"Passing standard edits" means that the encoded responses to MDS items are consistent and within range, in accordance with CMS specified standards. In general, inconsistent responses are either not plausible or ignore a skip pattern on the MDS. An example of inconsistency would be if one or more MDS items on a list were checked as present, and the "None of the Above" response was also checked for the same list. Out of range responses are invalid responses, such as using a response code of 2 for an MDS item for which the valid responses are zero or 1.</p>
<p>"Transmitted" means electronically transmitting to the <i>QIES ASAP System</i>, an MDS record that passes CMS' standard edits <i>and is accepted into the system</i>, within <i>14</i>days of the final completion date, <i>or event date in the case of Entry, Discharge and Death in Facility situations</i>, of the record.</p>
<p>"Accurate" means that the encoded MDS data matches the MDS form in the clinical record. Also refer to guidance regarding accuracy at §483.20(g),and the information accurately reflects the resident's status as of the Assessment Reference Date <i>(ARD)</i>.</p>
<p>"Complete" means that all items required according to the record type,and in accordance with CMS' record specifications and state required edits are in effect at the time the record is completed.</p>
<p>In accordance with the final rule, facilities will be responsible to edit the encoded MDS data to ensure that it meets the standard edit specifications.</p>
<p>We encourage facilities to use software that has a programmed capability to automatically edit MDS records according to CMS' edit specifications.</p>
<p>For §483.20(f)(1)(v), the subset of items required upon a resident's <i>entry</i>, transfer, discharge and death are contained in the <i>Entry and Death in Facility Tracking records and Discharge assessments</i>. Refer to <i>Chapter 2 of </i>Appendix R <i>(the MDS manual) </i>for further information about these records.</p>
<p>All nursing homes must computerize MDS information. The facility must edit MDS information using standard CMS-specified edits, revise the information to conform to the edits and to be accurate, and be capable of transmitting that data to the <i>QIES ASAP </i>system within 7 days of:</p>
<ul><li>Completing a comprehensive assessment (the <i>care plan completion </i>date);</li>
<li>Completing an assessment that is not comprehensive (the <i>MDS completion </i>date);</li>
<li>A discharge event (the date <i>of death or discharge</i>);</li>
<li>An <i>entry </i>event (the date <i>of entry (admission or reentry)</i>); or</li>
<li>Completing a correction request.</li>
</ul><p>Submission must be according to state and federal time frames. Therefore the facility must:</p>
<ul><li>Encode the MDS and <i>CAAs Summary </i>(where applicable) in machine readable format; <i>and </i></li>
<li>Edit the MDS and <i>CAA </i>Summary (where applicable) according to edits specified by CMS. Within the 7 day time period specified above for editing, the facility must revise any information on the encoded MDS and <i>CAA Summary </i>(if applicable) that does not pass CMS-specified edits, revise any otherwise inaccurate information, and make the information ready for submission. The MDS Vendor software used at the facility should have an automated editing process that alerts the user to entries in an MDS record that do not conform with the CMS-specified edits and that prompts the facility to complete revisions within the 7-day editing and revision period. After editing and revision, MDS information and <i>CAA summary </i>information (if applicable) must always accurately reflect the resident's overall clinical status as of the original ARD for an assessment or the original event date for a discharge or entry.</li>
</ul><p>Electronically submit MDS information to the <i>QIES ASAP system </i>within <i>14 </i>days of:</p>
<ul><li>Completing a comprehensive assessment (the care plan completion date);</li>
<li>Completing an assessment that is not comprehensive (the MDS completion date);</li>
<li>A discharge event (the date of death or discharge);</li>
<li>An entry event (the date of entry (admission or reentry)); or</li>

<p>MDS information serves as the clinical basis for care planning and delivery. With the introduction of additional uses of MDS information such as for payment rate setting and quality monitoring, MDS information as it is reported impacts a nursing home's payment rate and standing in terms of the quality monitoring process. A pattern within a nursing home of clinical documentation or of MDS assessment or reporting practices that result in higher RUG scores, untriggering <i>CAA</i>(s), or unflagging QI(s), where the information does not accurately reflect the resident's status, may be indicative of payment fraud or avoidance of the quality monitoring process. Such practices may include but are not limited to a pattern or high prevalence of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Submitting MDS Assessments (including any reason(s) for assessment, routine or non-routine) or tracking <i>record</i>s, where the information does not accurately reflect the resident's status as of the ARD, or the Discharge or <i>Entry </i>date, as applicable;</li>

<ol type="i"><li>The services that are to be furnished to attain or maintain the resident's highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being as required under §483.25; and</li>
<li>Any services that would otherwise be required under §483.25 but are not provided due to the resident's exercise of rights under §483.10, including the right to refuse treatment under §483.10(b)(4).</li>
</ol><blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §483.20(k)</b></p>
<p>An interdisciplinary team, in conjunction with the resident, resident's family, surrogate, or representative, as appropriate, should develop quantifiable objectives for the highest level of functioning the resident may be expected to attain, based on the comprehensive assessment. The interdisciplinary team should show evidence in the <i>CAA </i>summary or clinical record of the following:</p>
<ul><li>The resident's status in triggered <i>CAA </i>areas;</li>
<li>The facility's rationale for deciding whether to proceed with care planning; and</li>
<li>Evidence that the facility considered the development of care planning interventions for all <i>CAAs </i>triggered by the MDS.</li>
</ul><p>The care plan must reflect intermediate steps for each outcome objective if identification of those steps will enhance the resident's ability to meet his/her objectives. Facility staff will use these objectives to monitor resident progress. Facilities may, for some residents, need to prioritize their care plan interventions. This should be noted in the clinical record or on the plan or care.</p>
<p>The requirements reflect the facility's responsibilities to provide necessary care and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being, in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care. However, in some cases, a resident may wish to refuse certain services or treatments that professional staff believe may be indicated to assist the resident in reaching his or her highest practicable level of well-being.

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §483.75(l)(1) </b></p>
<p>A complete clinical record contains an accurate and functional representation of the actual experience of the individual in the facility. It must contain enough information to show that the facility knows the status of the individual, has adequate plans of care, and provides sufficient evidence of the effects of the care provided. Documentation should provide a picture of the resident's progress, including response to treatment, change in condition, and changes in treatment.</p>
<p>The facility determines how frequently documentation of an individual's progress takes place apart from the annual comprehensive assessment, periodic reassessments when a significant change in status occurs, and quarterly monitoring assessments. Good practice indicates that for functional and behavioral objectives, the clinical record should document change toward achieving care plan goals. Thus, while there is no "right" frequency or format for "reporting" progress, there is a unique reporting schedule to chart each resident's progress in maintaining or improving functional abilities and mental and psychosocial status. Be more concerned with whether the staff has sufficient progress information to work with the resident and less with how often that information is gathered.</p>
<p>In cases in which facilities have created the option for an individual's record to be maintained by computer, rather than hard copy, electronic signatures are acceptable. In cases when such attestation is done on computer records, safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, and reconstruction of information must be in place. The following guideline is an example of how such a system may be set up:</p>
<ul><li>There is a written policy, at the health care facility, describing the attestation policy(ies) in force at the facility.</li>
<li>The computer has built-in safeguards to minimize the possibility of fraud.</li>

</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.10(a)(1)</b></p>
<p>In the stratified sample of clinical records selected for review, look for notations that a statement of the patient's rights, including the statement concerning the collection and reporting of OASIS information, has been given to the patient by the HHA staff prior to care being initiated. This written statement must have been provided during admission, the patient's initial evaluation visit, or the patient's first professional visit.</p>
<p>The OASIS database is subject to the requirements of the Federal Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act allows the disclosure of information from a system of records without an individual's consent if the information is to be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the information was collected. However, under existing patient's rights regulations, the HHA must provide the patient with a written notice of this collection of information (i.e., OASIS in advance of furnishing care to the patient).</p>
<p>Before comprehensive assessments (that include collection of OASIS data items) are conducted, the HHA must tell patients about OASIS and explain their rights with respect to the collection and reporting of OASIS information. These rights include:</p>
<ul><li>The right to be informed that OASIS information will be collected and for what purpose;</li>
<li>The right to have the information kept confidential and secure;</li>
<li>The right to be informed that OASIS information will not be disclosed except for legitimate purposes allowed by the Privacy Act;</li>
<li>The right to refuse to answer a specific question; and</li>
<li>The right to see, review, and request changes on their assessment.</li>
</ul><p>If the HHA chooses to continue to collect OASIS information from non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients the patient should be provided with the Notice about Privacy (for non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients). If a home visit is made, the verification could also include a conversation with the patient and any material on patient rights that the patient has received from the HHA. A notation in the clinical record might also include a statement regarding any limitations the patient had in being able to understand the information.</p>

<p><i><b>§484.11 Condition of Participation: Release of Patient Identifiable OASIS Information.</b></i></p>
<p>The HHA and agent acting on behalf of the HHA in accordance with a written contract must ensure the confidentiality of all patient identifiable information contained in the clinical record, including OASIS data, and may not release patient identifiable OASIS information to the public.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.11</b></p>
<p>Protection of confidentiality of OASIS information is two-fold; the HHA has a responsibility to keep OASIS information confidential and CMS has a responsibility to keep it confidential, once it has been transmitted to the OASIS state system.</p>
<p>Under this condition of participation, the HHA is required to maintain the confidentiality of OASIS data while it is being used for patient care and may not release it without the consent of the patient for any reason other than for what it is intended, which is to appropriately deliver patient care. HHAs must have policies and procedures for limiting access to OASIS information to only those persons the HHA designates.</p>
<p>If the HHA contracts with a vendor for transmission of its OASIS data, a written agreement that addresses the confidentiality of that data must be in place. Violations of data confidentiality by an entity contracted by the HHA are still the responsibility of the HHA and would constitute condition-level non-compliance; therefore the HHA is ultimately responsible for compliance with the confidentiality requirements and is the responsible party if the contractor does not meet the requirements.</p>
<p>For privacy and security reasons, communication of OASIS information (from branch to branch, branch to parent, parent to vendor, etc.) must be done in accordance with CMS policies on the communication of patient-identifiable information. HHAs must have processes in place to assure that access to and transfer and delivery of OASIS information is limited to only authorized personnel.</p>
<p>HHAs that contract with accrediting organizations (AO), such as the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP), for determining compliance with the Medicare Conditions of Participation may share Outcome-based Quality Improvement /Monitoring (OBQI/M) reports with representatives of the appropriate AO on survey. The AO has a responsibility to review the OBQI/M reports and the HHA must provide the reports in the course of normal HHA business. State Agencies and Regional Offices may not share OBQI/M reports with the AO because no data use agreement exists with the SA/RO and the AO.</p>
<p>The other step in assuring confidentiality of the OASIS data is at the federal level and involves the Federal Privacy Act of 1974. Coverage under the Federal Privacy Act begins when the data reaches the state agency. The Privacy Act requires that policies and procedures related to the collection of information be made available to the public describing the reasons for collecting OASIS data, what will be done with it, and who will have access to it in an identifiable format. The Privacy Act puts into place certain processes that protect patient identifiable data from unauthorized use and disclosure. Provisions of the Privacy Act as they relate to the collection of OASIS data are described in detail on the OASIS Statement of Patient Privacy Rights (See §484.10(a)).</p>
<p><b>Onsite Activity</b> -- Verify that the HHA has established a mechanism to ensure confidentiality of OASIS data. Interview the administrator and staff regarding:</p>
<ul><li>Protecting confidentiality of OASIS data (written and/or electronic).</li>
<li>Assignment and maintenance of secure passwords for data encoding and transmission.</li>
<li>Determine how OASIS data, whether in hard copy or electronic format is kept confidential before and after transmission to the state agency.</li>
</ul><p>Interview the HHA administrator or system administrator for:</p>
<ul><li>Knowledge and application of rights to add, edit, or otherwise modify encoded OASIS data;</li>
<li>Assignment of passwords;</li>
<li>Assurance that only specified staff have contact with assessment information; and</li>
<li>Actions taken when an employee with access to the system leaves the HHA's employment.</li>
</ul><p>If possible, observe security of the OASIS data-entry location. Observe if the computer screen is logged off or password protected when not attended.</p>
<p>If applicable, review vendor contracts for provisions protecting confidentiality of OASIS data and determine what systems are in place to assure confidentiality throughout the transmission process. Vendors must be aware of the requirements and security policies of the HHA.</p>
<p>If questions are raised through interview or record review, review HHA's policies regarding confidentiality of patient information. <a name="42:5.0.1.1.3.2.7.4" id="42:5.0.1.1.3.2.7.4"></a></p>

<p><i><b>§484.14 Condition of Participation: Organization, Services, and Administration.</b></i></p>
<p>(g) <i>Standard: Coordination of patient services. </i>All personnel furnishing services maintain liaison to ensure that their efforts are coordinated effectively and support the objectives outlined in the plan of care. The clinical record or minutes of case conferences establish that effective interchange, reporting, and coordination of patient care does occur. A written summary report for each patient is sent to the attending physician at least every 60 days.</p>
<p><i><b>§484.18 Condition of Participation: Acceptance of Patients, Plan of Care, and Medical Supervision.</b></i></p>
<p>Patients are accepted for treatment on the basis of a reasonable expectation that the patient's medical, nursing, and social needs can be met adequately by the agency in the patient's place of residence. Care follows a written plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatric medicine.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.18</b></p>
<p>It is CMS' policy to require that the HHA must have a plan of care for each patient, regardless of the patient's Medicare status or that nurse practice acts do not specifically require a physician's order. The CoPs do not require a physician's order for services furnished by the HHA that are not related to the patient's illness, injury, or treatment of the patient's medical, nursing, or social needs.</p>
<p>Medical orders may authorize a specific range in the frequency of visits for each service (i.e., 2-4 visits per week) to ensure that the most appropriate level of service is provided to the patient. However, ranges include "0" as a frequency are not allowed, because "0" is not a frequency. The regulation requires the HHA to alert the physician to any changes that suggest a need to alter the plan of care. If the HHA provides fewer visits than the physician orders, it has altered the plan of care and the physician must be notified The HHA must maintain documentation in the clinical record indicating that the physician was notified and is aware of the missed visit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><i>Standard: Plan of care. </i>The plan of care developed in consultation with the agency staff covers all pertinent diagnoses, including mental status, types of services and equipment required, frequency of visits, prognosis, rehabilitation potential, functional limitations, activities permitted, nutritional requirements, medications and treatments, any safety measures to protect against injury, instructions for timely discharge or referral, and any other appropriate items. If a physician refers a patient under a plan of care that cannot be completed until after an evaluation visit, the physician is consulted to approve additions or modifications to the original plan. Orders for therapy services include the specific procedures and modalities to be used and the amount, frequency, and duration. The therapist and other agency personnel participate in developing the plan of care.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.18(a)</b></p>
<p>A statutory change renamed the "plan of treatment" to "the plan of care." These terms are synonymous. Neither is to be confused with a nursing care plan.</p>
<p>The conditions do not require an HHA to either develop or maintain a nursing care plan as opposed to a medical plan of care. This does not preclude an HHA from using nursing care plans if it believes that such plans strengthen patient care management, the organization and delivery of services, and the ability to evaluate patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Review a case-mix, stratified sample of clinical records (see §2200B) to determine if the requirements of this standard are met.</p>
<p>Written HHA policies and procedures should specify that all clinical services are implemented only in accordance with a plan of care established by a physician's written orders. Policies should also specify if the HHA:</p>
<ul><li>Accepts physician's orders on referral communicated verbally by an institution's discharge planner, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or other authorized staff member followed by written, signed and dated physician's orders, in order to begin HHA services as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Accepts signed physician certification and recertification of plans of care, as well as signed orders changing the plan of care, by telecommunication systems ("fax"), which are filed in the clinical record.</li>
</ul><p>The plan of care must be established and authorized in writing by the physician based on an evaluation of the patient's immediate and long-term needs. The HHA staff, and if appropriate, other professional personnel, shall have a substantial role in assessing patient needs, consulting with the physician, and helping to develop the overall plan of care.</p>
<p>The patient has the right, and should be encouraged, to participate in the development of the plan of care before care is started and when changes in the established plan of care are implemented. (See §484.10(c)(2).)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Standard: Periodic review of plan of care. </i>The total plan of care is reviewed by the attending physician and HHA personnel as often as the severity of the patient's condition requires, but at least once every 60 days or more frequently when there is a beneficiary elected transfer; a significant change in condition resulting in a change in the case-mix assignment; or a discharge and return to the same HHA during the 60-day episode. Agency professional staff promptly alert the physician to any changes that suggest a need to alter the plan of care.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.18(b)</b></p>
<p>Changes in the patient's condition that require a change in the plan of care should be documented in the patient's clinical record.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><i>Standard: Conformance with physician orders. </i>Drugs and treatments are administered by agency staff only as ordered by the physician with the exception of influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines, which may be administered per agency policy developed in consultation with a physician, and after an assessment for contraindications. Verbal orders are put in writing and signed and dated with the date of receipt by the registered nurse or qualified therapist (as defined in §484.4 of this chapter) responsible for furnishing or supervising the ordered services. Verbal orders are only accepted by personnel authorized to do so by applicable state and federal laws and regulations as well as by the HHA's internal policies.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.18(c)</b></p>
<p>Review HHA policies and procedures in regard to obtaining physician orders, changes in orders, and verbal orders. All physician orders must be included in the patient's clinical record. Plans of care must be signed and dated by the physician.</p>
<p><i>Verbal orders must be countersigned by the physician as soon as possible. Ask HHA's, whose pattern of obtaining signed physicians' orders exceeds the HHA's policy or state law, to clarify or explain what circumstances created the time lapse, and how they are approaching a resolution to the problem.</i></p>
<p>Other designated HHA personnel who accept verbal orders must do so in accordance with state and federal law and regulations and HHA policy. Verbal orders must be signed and dated by the registered nurse or qualified therapist who is furnishing or supervising the ordered service. It is the RN's or therapist's responsibility to make any necessary revisions to the plan of care based on that order.</p>

</ol><p><i><b>§484.20 Condition of Participation: Reporting OASIS Information.</b></i></p>
<p>HHAs must electronically report all OASIS data collected in accordance with §484.55.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.20</b></p>
<p>HHA's must, at least monthly, electronically report OASIS data on all applicable patients in a format that meets CMS electronic data and edit specifications. For purposes of this requirement, the term "reporting" means electronic reporting.</p>
<p>Effective December 8, 2003, the collection of OASIS data on the non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients of an HHA was temporarily suspended. HHAs must continue to comply with the aspects of the regulation at 42 CFR 484.55 regarding the comprehensive assessment of patients.</p>
<p>HHAs may continue to collect OASIS data on their non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients for their own use. HHAs must continue to collect, encode, and transmit OASIS data for their non-maternity Medicare and Medicaid patients that are age 18 and over and receiving skilled services.</p>
<p>Private pay patients are defined to include any patient for whom (M0150 ) the Current Payment Source for Home Care does not include any of the following responses:</p>
<blockquote><p>1- Medicare (Traditional fee-for-service)<br />2- Medicare (HMO/ managed care)<br />3- Medicaid (Traditional fee-for-service)<br />4- Medicaid(HMO/managed care).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a patient has a private pay insurance andM0150 response 1, 2, 3, or 4 as an insurance to which the agency is billing the services, the comprehensive assessment including OASIS must be collected and transmitted. Medicare (HMO/managed care) does include Medicare Advantage (MA), formerly known as Medicare+Choice(M+C) plans and Medicare PPO plans.</p>
<p><i>HHAs or contracted entities acting on behalf of the HHA can report OASIS data to the state agency using the HAVEN software CMS provides free of charge or by using HAVEN-like software that conforms to the same specifications used to develop HAVEN.</i></p>
<p><i>Reported OASIS data will be analyzed and findings made available to HHA's by way of reports that will help HHA's identify their performance level in the provision of care to the patient population they serve as compared with other HHA's on either a national, state or local level.</i></p>
<p>As part of the ongoing survey process, state agencies may establish policies in keeping with unannounced surveys that include the ongoing request, at specified intervals, for the submission of a current census (number) of patients being serviced by the HHA. Census information should include only a count of non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients. Since OASIS data on non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients will be received by the OASIS state system in an unidentifiable format, names of non-Medicare/non-Medicaid patients on the census are not appropriate.</p>
<p>With this information, surveyors can conduct a gross comparison of patient counts to data from the OASIS state system and monitor, offsite, if required OASIS data are being transmitted to the state.</p>

<ol type="a"><li>
<p><i>Standard: Encoding and transmitting OASIS data. </i>An HHA must encode and electronically transmit each completed OASIS assessment to the state agency or the CMS OASIS contractor, regarding each beneficiary with respect to which such information is required to be transmitted (as determined by the Secretary), within 30 days of completing the assessment of the beneficiary.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.20(a)</b></p>
<p>After OASIS data are collected and completed by the qualified clinician as part of the comprehensive assessment at the required time points (i.e., start of care, resumption of care, follow-up, transfer to inpatient facility with or without discharge, discharge to community, and death at home), HHAs may take up to seven calendar days after the date of completion of the comprehensive assessment to enter (encode) the OASIS data into their computers using HAVEN or HAVEN-like software. The day the clinician completes the assessment is day zero for purposes of calculating the 7-day window. Encoding of all OASIS data items must be complete (i.e., locked) in order to accurately compute the information (health insurance prospective payment system or HIPPS code) necessary for billing Medicare patients under the prospective payment system.</p>
<p><b>Pre-Survey Activity</b> -- Check with the state OASIS Education or Automation Coordinator and/or review OASIS data management reports to determine if OASIS items are encoded, checked for errors and locked within 7 days of collection using Haven or Haven-like software (i.e., made transmission ready).</p>
<p><b>Onsite Activity</b> -- Check to see if the HHA is transmitting its own data or has an arrangement with an outside entity acting on behalf of the HHA to electronically submit OASIS data to the state agency. If so, make sure a written contract exists that describes the arrangement the HHA has with the outside entity to enter and transmit OASIS data on behalf of the HHA.</p>
<p>Determine the process for encoding and locking OASIS data being readied for transmission to the state.</p>
<p>If questions are raised through interview or record review, review the HHA's policies regarding encoding time frames.</p>
<p><b>Initial Survey</b> -- New HHA's seeking initial certification must apply for appropriate state and federal HHA identification and passwords and be able to demonstrate compliance with collecting, completing, encoding and reporting OASIS data for all applicable patients in an electronic format that meets CMS specifications prior to the initial survey.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Standard: Accuracy of encoded OASIS data. </i>The encoded OASIS data must accurately reflect the patient's status at the time of assessment.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.20(b)</b></p>
<p>Check to see how the HHA monitors the accuracy of their data to ensure the data collected, encoded, and reported accurately reflects the patient's status at the time of the assessment. Some tips for establishing a program to monitor the quality and accuracy of OASIS data are found in Chapter 12 of the OASIS Implementation Manual -- Data Quality Audits.</p>
<p><b>Onsite Activity</b> -- When reviewing the clinical records, determine that a visit was made to conduct the assessment, as applicable. Also, determine that other clinical information in the patient record does not contradict OASIS data collected during the assessment, encoded or reported.</p>
<p><b>New patient admission</b> -- If possible, include a home visit for a newly admitted patient who is scheduled to have a comprehensive assessment done. Determine that the OASIS data collected accurately reflects the patient's status at the time of the assessment.</p>
<p><b>Patient currently on service</b> -- If a home visit is made on a patient for whom an assessment has already been conducted and is not now scheduled to have one conducted, review the most current assessment and compare it with your observation of patient status, keeping in mind the patient's progress/decline and the normal progression of the clinical condition.</p>
<p>Determine that other clinical information in the patient record does not contradict OASIS data.</p>

<li>
<p><i>Standard: Transmittal of OASIS data. </i>An HHA must --</p>
<ol><li>
<p>For all completed assessments, transmit OASIS data in a format that meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.20(c)(1)</b></p>
<p>By the last day of the current month, HHA's must electronically transmit all OASIS data collected, encoded, and locked in the previous month for each patient (as applicable), to the state agency or CMS OASIS contractor. At a minimum, HHA's must transmit OASIS data at least monthly; HHA's may transmit OASIS data more frequently, if desired, and are free to develop schedules for transmitting data to best suit their needs.</p>
<p>Rejected data that requires correcting and re-transmitting must be received by the OASIS state system within the same required time frame. Submission of data with identified fatal errors does not justify extending the required time frame. While overdue assessments will be accepted, HHA's (or their contracted vendors) may not wait until the end of the month to transmit their OASIS data in case errors are identified that require retransmittal or system problems develop that prevent transmission.</p>
<p>Entities submitting OASIS data to the state agency or CMS OASIS contractor on behalf of the HHA (i.e., corporate offices or vendors under contract) must share the feedback reports with the HHA in order for them to monitor their encoding and transmission process.</p>
<p><b>Pre-Survey Activity</b> -- Check with the state OASIS Education or Automation Coordinator and/or review OASIS data management reports to determine if OASIS data are being transmitted as required. Determine whether the HHA is: (1) submitting data less often than monthly; and/or (2) has greater than 20 percent of records rejected in accordance with pre-survey preparation guidelines (SOM Section 2200).</p>
<p><b>Onsite Activity</b> -- If either probe noted above is triggered, investigate compliance with OASIS transmission requirements of this section, during the survey through the partial extended survey process. Ask the HHA to demonstrate how it creates, saves and transmits OASIS data to the state agency. Randomly select patient assessments and ask the HHA for the final validation report to demonstrate that they were received by the state.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successfully transmit test data to the state agency or CMS OASIS contractor.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.20(c)(2)</b></p>
<p>Determine that all required OASIS assessments are being transmitted.</p>
<p>Certain missing information or inconsistencies will cause a record to be completely rejected requiring correction by the HHA and retransmission. These are called fatal errors. For example, a fatal error will occur when a record is submitted without the HHA's state-assigned identification number, without the patient's last name, when the record is a duplicate of one previously received or the record is missing or has an incorrect branch identification number in M0016. A complete listing of current record rejection criteria is available in the HHA Error Message Guide on the OASIS website (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/oasis/usermanu.asp).</p>
<p>HHA's have the ability to electronically correct nearly all errors found in their production OASIS submissions that have been transmitted to the SA or CMS OASIS contractor. There is no current time limit to correcting errors in previously submitted records. SA should not be accepting requests for manual key field changes. Instead, HHA's should use the inactivation procedures to correct assessments containing key field errors. HAVEN 5.0 or above will give HHA's the ability to electronically correct nearly any kind of assessment errors.</p>

<p>HHA's must have a computer system that supports dial-up communications for the transmission of OASIS data to the state agency or CMS OASIS contractor, transmits the export files, and receives validation information. Corporate offices or contracted vendors submitting OASIS data on behalf of the HHA must provide the HHA with either an electronic copy of the validation information received from the state agency or CMS OASIS contractor, or a summary of that information.</p>
<p>All HHA's must use of the Medicare Data Communication Network (MDCN) to connect to the state agency for submission of OASIS data.

<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.20(d)</b></p>
<p>Reasons for non-submission include lack of compliance with the requirement to electronically transmit OASIS data by the HHA, or transmission using an improper format. HHA's must encode and transmit data using the HAVEN software available from CMS or HAVEN-like software that conforms to all CMS data transmission specifications available on the OASIS website. The software must also include the most current version of the OASIS data items which are available on the OASIS website at all times.</p>
<p><b>Pre-Survey Activity</b> -- Review any OASIS state system data management reports to determine if there are indications of problems with OASIS data transmission. Check with the State OASIS Education or Automation coordinator to see if he/she has identified a problem with OASIS data transmission.</p>

</li>
</ol><p><i><b>§484.34 Condition of Participation: Medical Social Services.</b></i></p>
<p>If the agency furnishes medical social services, those services are given by a qualified social worker or by a qualified social work assistant under the supervision of a qualified social worker, and in accordance with the plan of care. The social worker assists the physician and other team members in understanding the significant social and emotional factors related to the health problems, participates in the development of the plan of care, prepares clinical and progress notes, works with the family, uses appropriate community resources, participates in discharge planning and in-service programs, and acts as a consultant to other agency personnel.</p>
<p><i><b>§484.48 Condition of Participation: Clinical Records.</b></i></p>
<p>A clinical record containing pertinent past and current findings in accordance with accepted professional standards is maintained for every patient receiving home health services. In addition to the plan of care, the record contains appropriate identifying information; name of physician; drug, dietary, treatment, and activity orders; signed and dated clinical and progress notes; copies of summary reports sent to the attending physician; and a discharge summary. The HHA must inform the attending physician of the availability of a discharge summary. The discharge summary must be sent to the attending physician upon request and must include the patient's medical and health status at discharge.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.48</b></p>
<p>The clinical record must provide a current, organized, and clearly written synopsis of the patient's course of treatment, including services provided for the HHA by arrangement or contract. The clinical record should facilitate effective, efficient, and coordinated care.</p>
<p>Questionable patterns, rather than isolated instances, in clinical records are an indicator that the quality of care provided by the HHA needs to be carefully assessed for compliance with the plan of care, coordination of service, concurrence with the HHA's stated policies and procedures, and evaluations of patient outcomes. However, isolated instances, depending on their nature and severity, can serve as the basis of a deficiency and enforcement action (e.g., immediate and serious threat as outlined in Appendix Q).</p>
<p><b><i>Electronic Signatures</i></b><br />While the regulations specify that documents must be signed, they do not prohibit the use of electronic signatures. HHA's that have created the option for an individual's record to be maintained by computer, rather than hard copy, may use electronic signatures as long as there is a process for reconstruction of the information, and there are safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to the records. If necessary, review written policies maintained by the HHA describing the clinical record and authentication policy(ies) in force. Clinical, progress notes, and summary reports as defined at §484.2 must be maintained on all patients.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician's Rubber Stamp Signatures</i></b><br /><i>Home health agencies may accept a physician's rubber stamp signature for their clinical record documentation if this is permitted by federal, state and local law and authorized by the HHA's policy. The individual whose signature the stamp represents must place in the Administrative office of the agency a signed statement attesting that he/she is the only one who has the stamp and uses it. All state licensure and state practice regulations continue to apply to Medicare approved HHA's. Where state law is more restrictive than Medicare, the provider needs to apply the state law standard. Note that this does not supersede any current policy related to Medicare coverage and eligibility rules or instructions from the Regional Home Health Intermediaries.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Correction of Clinical Records</i></b><br />The HHA is encouraged to create policies and procedures that govern correction of clinical records. It is prudent for the HHA to include latitude for correction of records in the event of staff turnover or staff schedules. For example, a clinical supervisor may be permitted by agency policy to make corrections when the original clinician is no longer available due to staff turnover.</p>
<p><i>When a comprehensive assessment is corrected, the HHA must maintain the original assessment record as well as all subsequent corrected assessments in the patient's clinical record for 5 years, or longer, in accordance with the clinical record requirements at 42 CFR 484.48. If maintained electronically, the HHA must be capable of retrieving and reproducing a hard copy of these assessments upon request. It is acceptable to have multiple corrected assessments for an OASIS assessment, as long as the OASIS and the clinical record are documented in accordance with the requirements at 42 CFR 484.48, Clinical records.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Clinical Implications of Corrected Assessment Records</i></b><br />When corrections are made to an assessment already submitted to the state system, the HHA must determine if there is an impact on the patient's current care plan. If there is an impact, in addition to the correction made to the assessment, the HHA must make corresponding changes to the current plan of care. If there are any other records where the correction has an impact, for example, the Home Health Resource Group, the Plan of Treatment, or the Request for Anticipated Payment, the agency should make corresponding changes to that record, as applicable. The agency should establish a procedure to review the impact of any corrections made to assessment records and make corresponding changes to other records that are affected."</p>
<p>Some agencies use a manual corrections form for one or more OASIS items that can be acceptable after confirming the correction with the original clinician or as described in the agency's policies and procedures. As long as the correction form clearly identifies the item or items of the specific assessment and remain with the original assessment as part of the permanent record in order to have a complete picture of the entire assessment; these suggestions are consistent with CMS's overall guidelines for maintaining clinical records in accordance with accepted professional standards.</p>
<p>The regulations do not dictate the form to be used as a progress note and/or a summary report.

<p>The regulation does not dictate the frequency with which progress notes must be written. If necessary, review the HHA's policies and procedures concerning the frequency of preparing progress notes.</p>
<p>The discharge summary need not be a separate piece of paper and may be incorporated into the routine summary reports already furnished to the physician.</p>

<p><i>Standards: Retention of records. </i>Clinical records are retained for 5 years after the month the cost report to which the records apply is filed with the intermediary, unless state law stipulates a longer period of time. Policies provide for retention even if the HHA discontinues operations. If a patient is transferred to another health facility, a copy of the record or abstract is sent with the patient.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.48(a)</b></p>
<p>An HHA may store clinical and health insurance records electronically (i.e., on disk, on microfilm, or on optical disk imaging systems). This includes the storage of OASIS information. All material must be available for review by CMS, the intermediary, Department of Health and Human Services, or other specially designated components for bill review, audit, or other examination during the retention period.</p>
<p>With respect to a state agency or federal survey to ensure compliance with the Conditions of Participation, clinical records requested by the surveyor, along with the equipment necessary to read them, must be made available during the course of the unannounced survey.</p>
<p>The final validation reports from submission of OASIS records and OBQI/M reports are not part of the clinical record and as such need not be retained for 5 years.

</li>
</ol><p><i><b>§484.52 Condition of Participation: Evaluation of the Agency's Program.</b></i></p>
<p>The HHA has written policies requiring an overall evaluation of the agency's total program at least once a year by the group of professional personnel (or a committee of this group), HHA staff, and consumers, or by professional people outside the agency working in conjunction with consumers. The evaluation consists of an overall policy and administrative review and a clinical record review. The evaluation assesses the extent to which the agency's program is appropriate, adequate, effective, and efficient. Results of the evaluation are reported to and acted upon by those responsible for the operation of the agency and are maintained separately as administrative records.</p>
<p>(b) <i>Standard: Clinical record review. </i>At least quarterly, appropriate health professionals, representing at least the scope of the program, review a sample of both active and closed clinical records to determine whether established policies are followed in furnishing services directly or under arrangement. There is a continuing review of clinical records for each 60-day period that a patient receives home health services to determine adequacy of the plan of care and appropriateness of continuation of care.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.52(b)</b></p>
<p>Quarterly reviews need not be performed at a joint, sit-down meeting of the professionals performing the review. Each professional may review the records separately, at different times.</p>
<p>The HHA should evaluate all services provided for consistency with professional practice standards for HHA's and the HHA's policies and procedures, compliance with the plan of care, the appropriateness, adequacy, and effectiveness of the services offered, and evaluations of anticipated patient outcomes. Evaluations should be based on specific record review criteria that are consistent with the HHAs admission policies and other</p>
<p>HHA specific patient care policies and procedures. The review by appropriate health professionals should include those professionals representing the scope of services provided in that quarter. Therefore, for example, if no speech therapy services were performed, the speech therapist need not be a part of that quarterly review.</p>
<p>If the survey reveals that one (or more) approved services are never, or rarely, provided either for Medicare/Medicaid patients or non-Medicare/Medicaid patients, undertake the following actions to determine whether the HHA is complying with the patients' plans of care (§484.18):</p>
<ul><li>Review the HHA's policies relevant to the evaluation of patient care needs.</li>
<li>Review HHA contracts for unservedor underserved services, if they are provided under contract or arrangement.</li>
<li>Review plans of care to determine if the services were ordered by a physician but not delivered.</li>
<li>Ask the HHA under what circumstances it would contact the patient's physician to request modification of a patient's plan of care.</li>

<p><i><b>§484.55 Condition of Participation: Comprehensive Assessment of Patients.</b></i></p>
<p>Each patient must receive, and an HHA must provide, a patient-specific, comprehensive assessment that accurately reflects the patient's current health status and includes information that may be used to demonstrate the patient's progress toward achievement of desired outcomes. The comprehensive assessment must identify the patient's continuing need for home care and meet the patient's medical, nursing, rehabilitative, social, and discharge planning needs. For Medicare beneficiaries, the HHA must verify the patient's eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit including homebound status, both at the time of the initial assessment visit and at the time of the comprehensive assessment. The comprehensive assessment must also incorporate the use of the current version of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) items, using the language and groupings of the OASIS items, as specified by the Secretary.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.55</b></p>
<p>The comprehensive assessment includes the collection of OASIS data items for most patients, as described below, by a qualified clinician (i.e., an RN, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech language pathologist). For Medicare patients, there are some additional requirements. HHAs are expected to conduct a comprehensive assessment of each patient that accurately reflects the patient's current health status and includes information to establish and monitor a plan of care. The plan of care must be reviewed and updated at least every 60 days or as often as the severity of the patient's condition requires, per the requirements at 42 CFR 484.18 (a) and (b).</p>
<p>The requirement to conduct a drug regimen review at §484.55(c) as part of the comprehensive assessment applies to all patients serviced by the HHA.</p>
<p>...in addition to an initial assessment visit, the HHA must also conduct a start of care comprehensive assessment with OASIS data items integrated on patients to whom the requirements are applicable. Subsequent comprehensive assessments (updates and recertification) must be conducted at certain time points during the admission. These updates must include certain data items (i.e., those in the current OASIS data set). The recertification, transfer to an inpatient facility, resumption of care, significant change in condition (SCIC), and discharge comprehensive assessment apply to all patients, but it does not have to include OASIS for private pay patients. The recertification comprehensive assessment can be completed before the 5 day window as long as it continues to be done "not less frequently than the last five days of every 60 day episode beginning with the start-of-care date."</p>
<p>OASIS data items are not meant to be the only items included in an HHA's assessment process. They are standardized health assessment items that must be incorporated into an HHA's own existing assessment policies and process. An example of a comprehensive assessment showing an integration of the OASIS data items with other agency assessment items can be found in "Appendix C: Sample Clinical Records Incorporating OASIS B-1 Data Set," in the OASIS User's Manual. For therapy-only cases, the comprehensive assessment should incorporate OASIS data items as well as other assessment data items the HHA currently collects for therapy patients, as opposed to simply adding them at the beginning or end.</p>
<p>Medicare patients: For Medicare patients, the HHA must include a determination of the patient's eligibility for the home health benefit, including homebound status.</p>
<p>Incorporating OASIS items: HHA's must incorporate the OASIS data items into their own assessment instrument using the exact language of the items, replacing similar items/questions on their current assessment tool as opposed to simply adding the OASIS items at the beginning or end of the existing assessment tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><i>Standard: Initial assessment visit. </i></p>
<ol><li>
<p>A registered nurse must conduct an initial assessment visit to determine the immediate care and support needs of the patient; and, for Medicare patients, to determine eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit, including homebound status. The initial assessment visit must be held either within 48 hours of referral, or within 48 hours of the patient's return home, or on the physician-ordered start of care date.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.55(a)(1)</b></p>
<p>The initial assessment visit is conducted to determine the immediate care and support needs of the patient.</p>
<p>For Medicare patients, the initial assessment visit must include a determination of the patient's eligibility for the home health benefit, including homebound status. Verification of a patient's eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit including homebound status does not apply to Medicaid patients, beneficiaries receiving Medicare outpatient services, or private pay patients.</p>
<p>Review a case-mix, stratified sample of clinical records and make home visits according to the survey process (see §§2200 and 2202) to determine compliance with this requirement.</p>
<p>For Medicare patients, if the initial assessment indicates that the patient is not eligible for the Medicare home health care benefit (i.e., the patient is not homebound, has no skilled need, etc.), and the HHA does not admit the patient, then there is no indication for the HHA to conduct a comprehensive assessment or to collect, encode, or transmit OASIS data to the state.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>When rehabilitation therapy service (speech language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy) is the only service ordered by the physician, and if the need for that service establishes program eligibility, the initial assessment visit may be made by the appropriate rehabilitation skilled professional.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Interpretive Guidelines §484.55(a)(2)</b></p>
<p>For non-Medicare patients, if the need for a single therapy service establishes initial home health eligibility, the corresponding practitioner, (including a physical therapist, speech-language pathologist, or occupational therapist) can conduct the initial assessment visit.</p>
<p>For the Medicare home health benefit, occupational therapy services provided at the start of care alone do not establish eligibility; therefore, occupational therapists may not conduct the initial assessment visit under Medicare. Patients needing only occupational therapy services on admission to the agency may qualify for eligibility under programs other than Medicare.</p>
<p>When physical therapy (PT), speech language pathology (SLP), or occupational therapy (OT) is the only service ordered by the physician, a PT, SLP, or OT may complete the initial assessment visit if the need for that service establishes program eligibility.</p>
<p>Review a case-mix, stratified sample of clinical records and make home visits according to the survey process (see §§2200 and 2202) to determine compliance with this requirement. For a sample of patients, determine who conducted the initial assessments, if the homebound status for Medicare was identified, and the dates of the referral and initial assessments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Probes §484.55(a)(2)</b></p>
<p>Review patient records in which therapy (occupational therapy, physical therapy, or speech language pathology) was the only skilled service provided.

<h2><a name="appendR" id="appendR">APPENDIX R. TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>This appendix provides a summary of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting held at HHS on June 13, 2012. The TAG meeting brought together experts to provide feedback and input to advise the contractor (the AHIMA Foundation) on ineligible providers and incentive/funding considerations. The information from the TAG was used in the development of a final report to ASPE to support preparation of the report required by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5). The TAG's specific role was to perform the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Provide feedback on the:</p>
<ul><li>identification and categorization of providers ineligible for incentives/other funding of use of EHRs; and</li>
<li>completeness/accuracyof identified EHR incentives/funding options.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Consider whether current incentives/other funding to support the use of certified EHRs will be sufficient to:</p>
<ul><li>achieve the goals of the EHR Incentive Programs for Eligible Professionals/Eligible Hospitals;</li>
<li>support the use of certified EHRs/health IT by all/some of the ineligible providers; and</li>
<li>if the current support is sufficient, why and how; and if not, why not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Identify factors that should be considered when examining the costs of making available at least some incentives/ funding options for certain ineligible providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify barriers to implementing incentives/other options and methods to address identified barriers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Summary: The TAG focused on the following key themes throughout the meeting:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Establish goals for what is to be achieved with the availability of additional incentives and/or other funding for ineligible providers. These goals should be:</p>
<ul><li>Focused on the patient and support the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Triple Aim.</li>
<li>Future-looking to support new healthcare delivery and payment models.</li>
<li>Supportive of meaningful use by eligible hospitals and eligible professionals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Do not apply a one-size-fits-all approach to incentive and/or other funding programs targeted at ineligible providers. Programs should be prioritized for targeted providers and custom fit to help the providers overcome barriers in achieving the desired goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize the LTPAC and Behavioral Health ineligible providers for incentives and/or other funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not limit programs to just EHR technology. Application and modules may be appropriate to facilitate interoperable health information exchange.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">TAG Feedback on Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The TAG reviewed the methodology for selecting the ineligible providers to be the focus of the study and final report (<a href="#figureR1">Figure R1</a> outlines the methodology used). The TAG agreed with the methodology used to identify and select the ineligible providers focusing on providers who are identified in HITECH §3000(3), grouping the providers into two categories -- those eligible for payment incentives under HITECH and those who are ineligible, and selecting the ineligible providers who participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.</p>
<p>The TAG reviewed and provided feedback on the providers who were identified as ineligible for payment incentives under HITECH. Based on the methodology used to identify the ineligible providers, not all providers in the United States health care system will be the focus of this study. The TAG noted that there are health care provider organizations (facility/place), professionals/ practitioners (people), and health care service programs. To remain consistent with the HITECH, healthcare services (such as home and community-based services) are not included in this study.</p>
<p>Other TAG recommendations:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Correctional Facilities, Jails, and Prisons are not identified as providers in HITECH or eligible for Medicare and/or Medicaid, however, the TAG discussed the importance of having health information available and exchanged particularly when inmates leave the prison system and require continued treatment and services for medical and/or behavioral health conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the ineligible providers may have access to certified EHR technology through their affiliation with an eligible hospital or eligible professional.</p>
<ul><li>Reevaluate Ambulatory Surgery Centers on the ineligible provider list. Their eligibility may be an issue of affiliation or ownership (i.e., hospital-based).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Recognize that the ancillary providers identified in the <b>Other Healthcare Provider section</b> may not use EHR, but may merely require an interface (as discussed above for labs, pharmacies, blood banks, and ambulance services). Reconsider these providers on the ineligible provider list because they are a service organization and do not maintain an EHR. They provide valuable information and must have the capability to exchange information with an EHR. The TAG suggested a footnote in the main report that expresses the importance of these providers to interoperability exchange of health information.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Current Environment and Drivers for EHR Technology Adoption</h3>
<p>The TAG discussed the current environment and drivers for adoption. As part of that discussion, they reviewed and commented on the proposed evaluation criteria definitions below and identified additional evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>The TAG recommended that the final report define a goal to be met with incentives or other funding that supports a provider's interoperability to benefit the patient and CMMI Triple Aim: better health in the overall population, better health care delivery, and reduction in per capita cost of care. The goal would serve as a point of focus for evaluation criteria on how the technology supports the interoperability and the CMMI Triple Aim.</p>
<p>The TAG identified three important factors in evaluating the use of EHRs/health IT by ineligible providers. The major difference from the proposed criteria is to differentiate between use and utility on how it benefits the provider and how it benefits the patient/society to improve care.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" class="footable table sort-disable" title="FIGURE R1. TAG Priorities for Evaluation Criteria"><caption><a name="figureR1" id="figureR1">FIGURE R1</a>. TAG Priorities for Evaluation Criteria</caption>

</ul></td>
</tr></tbody></table><h3 align="CENTER">TAG Discussion on Adoption Rates of EHR Technology by Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The TAG did not support limiting the measurement of EHR adoption rates to certified EHR technology (CEHRT) because the definitions do not apply to the ineligible providers. They recognized that adoption statistics for EHR technology are an important factor when determining incentive or funding options, however, concerns were raised about the ability to measure adoption in a consistent manner against national averages.<sup><a href="#noteR1">1</a></sup> While ONC reports EHR adoption statistics for eligible hospitals and professionals on their dashboard,<sup><a href="#noteR2">2</a></sup> standardized definitions and surveys are not in place for ineligible providers except Federally Qualified Health Centers. HRSA collects EHR data from Centers from the Uniform Data Systems administrative dataset.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">TAG Discussion on Clinical Utility of EHR Technology by Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The TAG viewed clinical utility differently than the proposed definition which focused on how the technology supported the provider's clinical and business operations. They recommend that clinical utility be framed from the patient's perspective -- how technology supports patient care, coordination, and transitions. The TAG recommended that clinical utility be defined as how the EHR technology directly enables the provider's ability to deliver efficient and effective patient care. Considerations include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How is patient care affected by technology?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will having this technology improve care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will some providers have a greater need for technology to share information than others? For example, some consideration highlighted by the TAG include:</p>
<ul><li>Patients who have high re-admission rates;</li>
<li>Providers who serve patients with multiple, chronic conditions and require multiple care givers to share and coordinate care; and/or</li>
<li>Providers who support patients who are a lifetime residents and require frequent interaction with the continuum of care (such as providers serving the developmentally disabled).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The TAG noted that the clinical utility of an EHR may be greater for providers who serve patients with numerous transitions and/or re-hospitalizations. There is a similar direct relationship between clinical utility and providers serving lifetime patients where there are frequent care coordination needs with multiple specialists.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">TAG Discussion on Use of Technology by ineligible Providers</h3>
<p>The TAG supported the use of a technology definition focused on meaningful use stage criteria. They agreed that some providers had a greater need to use technology. The TAG also noted that not all ineligible providers would benefit from EHRs or incentives for EHRs, specifically:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Ancillary service providers (such as labs or pharmacies) need technology that facilitates interoperability and communication with providers' EHR system. These ancillary providers may need a module or application to exchange interoperable health information rather than adopt a complete EHR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emergency Service/Ambulance Providers could benefit from interoperable systems, particularly viewing information on a patient and transmitting data to a provider's EHR. A module or application that allows viewing and sharing common information would be beneficial.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Other Evaluation Criteria Identified by the TAG</h3>
<p>The TAG discussed other criteria that could be useful to evaluate the need for EHR incentives and/or other funding. The following summarizes the criteria and points of consideration.</p>
<p><i><b>Ability to Survive Market Forces</b></i></p>
<p>Incentive and/or other funding should only be available to providers who will survive market changes. Questions to consider include: Which providers will still be delivering services in 2014 and beyond? Where will there be consolidation? Will the provider be able to survive without incentives? Will they meet the changing demands of the healthcare delivery and payment system on their own? Some providers will not need incentives or other funding to adopt interoperable technology because business forces will push adoption. For example, a pharmacy serving large providers in urban areas may invest in health IT for business reasons to facilitate interoperable communication but a small pharmacy or lab in rural areas may need support to implement interoperable technology.</p>
<p><i><b>Benefit to Medicare and Medicaid (Expenditures/Costs)</b></i></p>
<p>Incentives and/or other funding should benefit Medicare and Medicaid. Who bears the cost and who gets the benefit from EHR technology (EHRT)? Where is there cost savings? What are the Medicare and Medicaid expenditures by the provider? Are there opportunities to reduce costs and improve quality through the use of CEHRT? Would the technology allow Medicare and Medicaid move toward risk adjusted and pay for performance models? The costs per treating a patient (per year/per episode) may also be a relevant factor in prioritizing providers for incentives.</p>
<p><i><b>Capacity to Invest (Margins)</b></i></p>
<p>The extent to which provider payments exceed costs (i.e., margins) should be taken into account in determining a provider's ability to invest in technology on their own without incentives and/or other funding. What are the margins for the ineligible providers? For some provider types Medicare margins may be high (e.g., home health) and in some instances margins may vary for subcategories of particular provider types (e.g., rural vs. urban). In contrast, Medicaid margins are believed to be lower. Providers (e.g., Medicaid-reliant providers) with lower margins may need to rely on grants for funding and other means to support the costs of acquisition and/or use of technology. Margin data can be found in Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reports and Medicare and Medicaid cost summary reports. Some ancillary providers have margins that far exceed standard health care providers (e.g., CVS pharmacies) and should not be the target for incentives and/or funding.</p>
<p><i><b>Market Size/Capacity</b></i></p>
<p>Information on the number of the providers or professionals in the market and number of patients treated could be important in prioritizing the providers and the impact incentives and/or other funding may have on the largest number of patients.</p>
<p><i><b>Need for Exchange Now and with Future Business Models</b></i></p>
<p>In order for exchange to be meaningful, some providers may be more involved in transitions on care in current and future service delivery models. To what extent is exchange necessary between health providers to improve transitions now? Which providers are important to new delivery models such as ACOs to improve care? Which providers are important to a state to monitor public health?</p>
<p><i><b>Support for Current EHR Incentive Programs</b></i></p>
<p>Providers could be prioritized for incentives and/or other funding based on their importance to eligible hospitals and professionals to meet their meaningful use criteria. Do the ineligible providers assist eligible providers in meeting meaningful use requirements? Will incentivizing CEHRT for the ineligible provider improve care across the continuum?</p>
<p><i><b>Relationship to Eligible Organization</b></i></p>
<p>Some providers and professionals may be ineligible, but work for or are part of an eligible hospital or professional organization with access to CEHRT. Is there a way to determine how many are free-standing or not-associated with an eligible hospital/professional? If there are minimal free-standing providers, there may not be a reason to prioritize them for possible incentive or other funding.</p>
<p><i><b>Geography</b></i></p>
<p>The location of an ineligible provider may be an important factor in determining whether to extend incentives and/or other funding particularly if they are a safety net provider or in rural or underserved areas. Margins are also impacted by geography.</p>
<p><i><b>Availability of Other Funding to Adopt &amp; Use EHRs</b></i></p>
<p>Some ineligible providers have access to other funding sources and grants to support adoption and use of technology minimizing the need to extend other programs or incentives. Are there other funding sources beside EHR Incentive Program incentives to assist in the adoption and use of CEHRT? For example, Safety Net providers have grantfunding available to adopt technology and other funding has been directed to these providers to support their use of this technology. The availability of funds to support the acquisition and use of EHRT may not make these providers a priority to receive additional incentives.</p>
<p><i><b>Provider Track Record</b></i></p>
<p>Incentive and/or other funding programs should not be offered to providers where there are serious fraud concerns. Do the providers have a good record as a Medicare provider? Is there any litigation against them? The TAG members expressed concerns about some providers such as home care where there are fraud rings in Florida. Programs should be designed to ensure only legitimate providers are assisted.</p>
<p><i><b>Summary of Evaluation Criteria/Principles</b></i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The need for technology that supports future care delivery, business models, and providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need for technology to support care coordination and management, and health information exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information known about adoption costs to acquire and maintain the technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost of the incentive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefit of technology to improve care delivery and outcomes for the patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provider's benefit and their need for EHRs that supports best practices and outcomes for their patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ineligible provider's ability to access capital and/or cover the cost of technology based on their profit margin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefit to Medicare and Medicaid of incenting technology that supports:</p>
<ul><li>Quality and financial oversight.</li>
<li>Data for risk adjustments and pay for performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>The benefit to society (public health/population health).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">General TAG Recommendations on the Need for Incentives</h3>
<p><i><b>Interventions Should Have the Future in Mind</b></i></p>
<p>The TAG recommended that the final report look at the future (2014 and later) and emerging business models. Health care is moving towards new delivery and payment models with health care reform. The report should look at the future and identify the ineligible providers who will survive the transition or be priority providers that need interoperable technologies.</p>
<p><i><b>Interventions Need to Be Patient Centered</b></i></p>
<p>If actions are undertaken, they must support a patient-centered approach to care delivery.</p>
<p><i><b>Interventions Should Support Meaningful Use</b></i></p>
<p>Any actions/interventions for ineligible providers should focus on meaningful use and help eligible hospitals and professionals meet the program priorities.</p>
<p><i><b>There Should Not Be a "One-Size-Fits-All" Approach to Incentives and Other Funding for Ineligible Providers</b></i></p>
<p>The TAG agreed that broadly applying the EHR Incentive Programs to all of the ineligible providers is not necessary. They recognized that the ineligible providers would have different needs or barriers to overcome and some are adopting the technology more successfully than others and would not require the same level of support. The TAG recommended an approach that identified specific goals and used different interventions to meet the goals. They outlined general categories.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Overview of Levels of Support</h3>
<p>The TAG discussed the concept of levels of support to tailor interventions to the needs of the ineligible provider in meeting goals.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Level 1 -- No Assistance: The market will naturally evolve and do it anyway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level 2 -- Mandate the implementation of technology using federal and state authority (e.g., through regulatory requirements)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level 3 -- Provide direct support (e.g., grants, loan programs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level 4 -- Provide indirect support (e.g., technical assistance/consulting services)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level 5 -- Provide financial incentives (e.g., extend EHR incentive programs)</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Barriers to Ineligible Provider EHR Technology Adoption</h3>
<p>To determine what interventions (incentives/other funding) or level of support may be necessary, the TAG summarized their perception of the current barriers to adoption by ineligible providers. The following is a general list of barriers. To tailor interventions, the goals and barriers would need to be identified for each ineligible provider type.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Lack of standards across continuum of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lag time in vendor's adoption of standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of clear clinical/economic reason for stand-alone facilities to adopt CEHRT (No business case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workforce issues -- not trained on health IT/EHR technology and/or small in size particularly in health IT to operate EHR systems and infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confusion over what technology to adopt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current workflow set; do not want to adopt technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of access to capital markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of free capital (thin margins, as in the case of many Medicaid providers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perceived privacy concerns and the technological barrier 42 CFR presents particularly with behavioral health settings providing substance abuse services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual provider lacks infrastructure/knowledge to win grants and other funding.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3 align="CENTER">Program that Could Apply to All/Almost All Ineligible Providers</h3>
<p><i>The TAG identified the following set of funding or other programs that could be applied to all/almost all ineligible providers at a relatively low cost:</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Anti-Kickback Statute EHR Safe Harbor Regulation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment of broadband internet everywhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ONC Direct Project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage federal Conditions of Participation to require certain EHR/health IT capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant requirements that include conditions on key EHR/health IT capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current infrastructure opportunities in programs such as Medicaid grant opportunities, technical assistance to states on health IT, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Framework for Evaluating Actions per Ineligible Provider</h3>
<p>After considerable discussion, the TAG recommended that each ineligible provider type be evaluated for a course of action. They identified evaluation questions and three general actions as outlined below.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Why</b> is the EHR/health IT important to support national goals? Why is it important to patients, providers, emerging business models, and current meaningful use provider?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What</b> is known about the provider, their use of EHRs, the availability of interoperable health IT, their barriers and the desired outcomes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How</b> will the use of technology support the desired outcome?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What <b>program action</b> should be considered?</p>
<ol><li>Ignore: Due to the current financial status and prevalence of grants or other funding, no further incentive/funding action should be directed to the provider.</li>
<li>Encourage: Use carrots and sticks to encourage desired action. Carrots could include the EHR Incentive Program, pay for performance programs, positive payment rate adjustments, low interest loan, grants, and other interventions. Sticks include implementing negative payment rate adjustment or other penalties for not adopting/using interoperable EHR technology.</li>
<li>Mandate: Drive the desired action by creating an administrative requirement (e.g., Condition of Participation) to earn Medicare/Medicaid funding or fees, or program participation.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Sample Application of the Framework</h3>
<p>The TAG applied the framework to three provider settings: Home Health Agencies; Community Mental Health Clinic; and Federally Qualified Health Clinic. The framework was an exercise to demonstrate a process and not to be considered a formal recommendation by the TAG. The information used in the exercise may or may not be accurate and was based on TAG member knowledge or perceptions rather than researched facts.</p>
<p><i><b>Home Health Agency</b></i></p>
<p><i>Why is EHR technology important?</i></p>
<p>The population served by home health agencies experiences multiple transitions and has complex clinical needs. As a result, home health is a prime candidate for health IT support. Areas of potential support include remote monitoring and support to achieve an interoperable technology infrastructure needed for health delivery reform such as new ACO delivery and payment models. Improving communication and information sharing is critical with transitions of care and re-hospitalization issues. For the home care provider EHRs support improved patient management and communication. Clinical decision support and other technology supports would be beneficial for skilled nursing/therapy services such as wound care. Technology also improves internal communications between care givers and nurses/therapists.</p>
<p><i>What do we know about the provider and their use of technology?</i></p>
<p>There are EHR vendors for home health agencies, but they have not yet deployed interoperability standards that allow exchange with eligible hospitals and professionals to support the EHR Incentive Programs.</p>
<p>Adoption Status: Adoption of EHRs is at 39 percent. The sector is starting to adopt EHR technology on their own, although a business case to invest in interoperable technologies has not emerged. Over time the economic/clinical reasons for the agency to adopt technology may change with healthcare reform to ensure referral sources from eligible hospitals and professionals.</p>
<p>Home health vendors may be challenged to keep up with the demand for multiple interfaces as every HIE organization requires a custom interface which is expensive custom programming. The sector lacks interoperable standards and technology to exchange basic information such as summary records. It is not clear which interoperability standards apply to home health agencies.</p>
<p>Barriers: Connectivity in the home is still an issue in some regions due to limited broadband availability, however connectivity is becoming increasingly available.</p>
<p>Other general barriers apply to home health, particularly related to workforce as many organizations don't employ staff with expertise in EHR technology.</p>
<p><i>Program Actions: Encourage plus mandate</i></p>
<ol><li>Combine a mandate with a carrot: Require the use of interoperable technologies through the Home Health Care federal Conditions of Participation (stick) in combination with a carrot. MedPACdiscussed having standards for the home health benefit. Until standards and formats are available, it is difficult to move forward.</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage (Carrots/Sticks): Could make available various approaches based on size and sophistication:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>Adjust Payment -- "rate minus" if an agency does not implement technology or "rate plus" if they do. Require certain capabilities.</li>
<li>Low interest loans for agencies with lower capital or less access to capital markets.</li>
<li>Grants to acquire technology targeted to Medicaid providers.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Disseminate information on the applicability of the Anti-kickback Safe Harbor Statute to home health care providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend technical assistance (TA) and workforce training programs to certain types of home health agencies (such as TA through Regional Extension Center services).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The TAG indicated the home health analysis could also be applied to long-term care facilities (SNF/NF) because there are similar characteristics.</p>
<p><i><b>Community Mental Health Clinic (CMHC)</b></i></p>
<p><i>Why is EHR technology important?</i></p>
<p>The National Council for Behavioral Health just released a survey on health IT use which showed that the severely mentally ill have numerous health conditions and problems not limited to behavioral health. They are complex patients, frequently have housing issues, and often have substance abuse issues. These patients are expensive and are often described as accessing health care services through a "revolving door".</p>
<p>The Community Mental Health Center is frequently the patient's primary contact with the health system, but often has poor connections with the primary medical care system. They could be considered the safety net provider for many Medicaid behavioral health patients. Case management/care coordination is very important to improving quality of care, care delivery, and efficiency.</p>
<p>The lack of interoperable technology by community mental health clinics solidifies the silos between behavioral health care and primary care for medical conditions. Coordination and communication between primary care and CMHC is critical particularly with medication coordination and reconciliation.</p>
<p>Health care reform brings new models including health homes which will provide the case management/care coordination needed, however, CMHCs will need the technical infrastructure to actively participate in the emerging health home models.</p>
<p><i>What do we know about the provider and their use of technology?</i></p>
<p>The adoption of EHRs by CMHC is low. Psychiatrists are eligible for EHR incentive payments, but many have their own practice and will use EHR Incentive Program payments for their own EHR acquisition rather than reassigning the payment to the CMHC.</p>
<p>The primary payer for CMHCs is Medicaid with some funding through Medicare and private grants. The typical patient with schizophrenia costs Medicaid approximately $18K per year. Generally CMHCs have very limited resources to invest in technology and no profit margins. The TAG recognized that they needed more information on the market size and costs of the population.</p>
<p>Barriers include a lack of resources (including workforce) to invest in both EHR and interoperable technology. There are privacy and consent concerns with interoperability that are yet to be addressed with a standards-based technical infrastructure. Many state HIE organizations are not investing in exchange use cases to support behavioral health providers due to the lack of standards to address the complex privacy and consent issues.</p>
<p><i>Program Actions: Encourage </i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Extend a modified EHR Incentive Programs (potentially through grants with similar features to meaningful use) to CMHCs which would include:</p>
<ul><li>Funding to support the acquisition and use of CEHRT.</li>
<li>Development of national standards to address privacy and consent issues (which would benefit all of health care).</li>
<li>Technical assistance to implement CEHRT (e.g., RECs).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Grant programs/funding options with Health Homes:</p>
<ul><li>Grants to support infrastructure development and standards.</li>
<li>The TAG recognized that additional analysis was needed evaluate opportunities with the health home Medicaid state plan amendment and whether there was funding available that could be used as an incentive or grant for CMHCs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><i><b>Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)</b></i></p>
<p>The TAG began to analyze FQHCs and noted the following facts:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>FQHCs have received a fair amount of HIT grant funding from HRSA. Some eligible professionals may assign their benefits to the health center (although the data on how many do so is limited).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EHR Adoption rate is higher than other ineligible providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FQHCs have a Medicaid cost based system that is more generous than other providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicare has a higher reimbursement for FQHCs than other providers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For these reasons, the TAG recommended no additional incentive action for FQHCs is needed.</p>

<h2><a name="appendS" id="appendS">APPENDIX S. EVALUATING BENEFITS AND COSTS OF NEW INCENTIVES FOR EHR ADOPTION BY INELIGIBLE PROVIDERS</a></h2>
<p><i>The material below was prepared for this study by David Dranove, PhD, an economist and the Walter McNerney Professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. </i></p>
<p>In this section presents results of original research on the effect of the HITECH Act on adoption of EHR by hospitals. The research highlights the potential for incentives to promote EHR adoption and discusses factors for evaluating the cost and benefits.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">I. Overview</h3>
<p>This section of the report presents a framework for estimating the benefits and costs of programs to accelerate adoption of EHR by ineligible providers. First a number of key theoretical issues in cost-benefit analysis are examined, followed by a review of the research evidence on the effectiveness of the EHR and a presentation of criteria for evaluating the costs and benefits of incentive programs. These criteria to assess several specific programs, and finally issues associated with promoting interoperability are considered.</p>
<p><i><b>A. The Importance of Looking at Incremental Effects</b></i></p>
<p>Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) compares the <i>incremental</i> benefits accruing from a policy program against the <i>incremental</i>costs. A program creates incremental benefits or costs if it causes <i>changes in behaviors</i>. This is important to bear in mind because the adoption of EHR by ineligible providers is expected to continue to grow with or without government intervention. (See <a href="#tableS1">Table S1</a> for estimates of adoption by various categories of ineligible providers.<sup><a href="#noteS1">1</a></sup>) Any program designed to increase adoption will engender benefits only if it accelerates adoption above and beyond the projected growth path. For example, suppose that 60 percent of providers currently adopt EHR and that figure is expected to increase to 80 percent in the absence of any policy intervention. If a policy intervention increases adoption by to 90 percent, then the incremental benefits of the policy accrue from the 10 percentage point increment in adoption above the forecasted level.</p>
<p>While the benefits of a program accrue from <i>incremental</i> adoption above the forecast trend, the cost of the program may accrue from <i>all</i> future adopters. Continuing our example, suppose that the intervention involves a subsidy to all future adopters, whether or not they planned to adopt without the subsidy. This subsidy would be paid out to the 30 percent that adopt EHR -- this includes the 10 percent that respond to the subsidy and the 20 percent that would have adopted EHR regardless. Because it may be difficult to target a subsidy towards incremental adopters, the cost of such programs can be very high relative to the benefits.</p>
<p><i><b>B. The Importance of Perspective</b></i></p>
<p>The calculation of benefits and costs of any intervention depends on one's perspective. Suppose that it costs a medical provider $40,000 to adopt EHR. A new government policy will subsidize 75 percent of the cost of adoption. What cost should be used in a CBA framework? If one takes the perspective of the provider, the cost of adoption is $10,000. From the government's perspective, the cost is $30,000. From the perspective of the EHR vendor, adoption is a benefit. Similar concerns arise for the calculation of benefits.</p>
<p>It is common when assessing government interventions to view the costs as those accruing to the government. In the previous example, this would include $30,000 in subsidy payments plus any costs associated with administering the incentive program. It is also common to view the benefits as accruing to the ultimate beneficiaries of the intervention. In the case of EHR, those benefits would include reductions in medical spending (some of which may ultimately be recouped by the government through lower medical fees) and improvements in the quality of care. This is the manner in which costs and benefits in this analysis.</p>
<p><i><b><a name="sectionS.I.C" id="sectionS.I.C">C. Evidence on Benefits and Costs</a></b></i></p>
<p>There have been numerous studies of the benefits and costs of EHR adoption. Every EHR study begins from the same place: EHR is expensive. One prominent estimate, from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO 2008), estimates that the cost of adopting EHR for office-based physicians is between $25,000 and $45,000 per physician, with annual maintenance costs of $3000-$9000. For a typical urban hospital, these figures range from $3-$9 million for adoption and $700,000-$1.35 million for maintenance. In context these costs are quite significant: If the adoption costs are amortized over 10 years, EHR can account for about 1 percent of total provider costs. It would be no surprise, therefore, if research suggested that EHR may not pay for itself, let alone generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings.</p>
<p>In their review of 257 studies of EHR effectiveness, Chaudry et al. (2006) note that few studies focus on cost savings, providing, at best, indirect evidence of productivity gains.<sup><a href="#noteS2">2</a></sup> Most of the studies they review focus on quality of care, with mixed results.<sup><a href="#noteS3">3</a></sup> Ten studies examine the effects of EHR on utilization of various services. Eight studies show significant reductions of 8.5-24 percent, mainly in laboratory and radiology testing. While 15 studies contained some data on costs, none offered reliable estimates of cost savings. Indeed, only three reported the costs of implementing EHR and two of these studies were more than 10 years old.</p>
<p>One of the most widely cited cost studies, Hillestad et al. (2005) uses results from prior studies of EHR and medical utilization and extrapolates the potential cost savings net of adoption costs. They identify several dozen potential areas of cost savings, including reduced drug, radiology, and laboratory usage, reduced nursing time, reductions in clerical staff, fewer medical errors, and shorter inpatient lengths of stay. They estimate that if 90 percent of United States hospitals were to adopt EHR, total savings in the first year would equal $41.8 billion, rising to $77.4 billion after 15 years. They also predict that EHR adoption could eliminate several million adverse drug events annually, and save tens of thousands of lives through improved chronic disease management. Sidorov (2006) challenges these findings, arguing that the projected savings are based on unrealistic assumptions. Sidorovalso questions whether EHR will generate forecasted reductions in medical errors.</p>
<p>Buntin et al. (2011) reviewed 73 studies of the impact of EHR on medical utilization. EHR is associated with a significant reduction in utilization in 51 (70 percent) of these studies. They do not break these down into specific areas of savings, however. Buntin et al. do not identify any studies of EHR and costs. To our knowledge, such studies remain few and far between.</p>
<p>Indeed, only three focused cost studies have been identified.<sup><a href="#noteS4">4</a></sup> Borzokowski(2009) examines whether early versions of financial and clinical information technology systems generated significant savings between 1987 and 1994. He finds that hospitals adopting the most thoroughly automated versions of EHR realize up to 5 percent savings within 5 years of adoption. He also finds that hospitals that adopt less automated versions of EHR experience an increase in costs. His conclusions mirror the popular discussion: there appears to be the potential for savings but there is little understanding of the drivers of the heterogeneity across hospitals. Furukawa, Raghu, and Shao (2010) study the effect of EHR adoption on overall costs among hospitals in California for the period 1998-2007. They find that EHR adoption is associated with 6-10 percent higher costs per discharge in medical-surgical acute units, in large part because nursing hours per patient day increased by 15-26 percent. This is plausible because nurse use of EHR can be very time consuming. Finally, Agha(2012) analyzes 2.5 million inpatient admissions across 3,900 hospitals between the years 1998-2005. She finds no evidence of cost savings, even 5 years after adoption. Additionally, adoption appears to have little impact on the quality of care, measured by patient mortality, medical complication rates, adverse drug events, and readmission rates.</p>
<p>Overall, these studies present an ambiguous picture of EHR effectiveness. Two recent studies take more nuanced views of EHR and help to explain the seemingly inconsistent findings. Dranoveet al. (2012) view EHR as a business process innovation whose success requires human capital that is skilled at working with information technology. They present evidence that hospitals that are located in more information technology-intensive communities enjoy larger cost savings after adoption of EHR. In addition, hospitals that have more experience with early (from the 1990s), primitive forms of EHR enjoy large cost savings after adoption of advanced EHR. Finally, McCullough et al. (2012) find that EHR adoption reduces mortality for patients with complex diagnoses but has no effect on mortality of patients with average severity.</p>
<p>In its 2008 study, the CBO anticipates a cost reduction of 0.36 percent as a result of implementation of the HITECH ACT, although it is difficult to find supporting empirical evidence.<sup><a href="#noteS5">5</a></sup> Despite the ambiguous and noisy evidence at hand, it is still worth exploring the potential savings from EHR adoption. In doing so, savings rates ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.5 percent are assumed, not because any particular figure is likely to be valid, but rather to illustrate how one might perform these calculations were we to have more precise information about EHR effects.</p>
<p><i><b>D. Interoperability</b></i></p>
<p>The full potential of EHR may not be unleashed until providers use the technology to share clinical information. Thus far, however, the EHR market is fragmented and exchanging information across different vendor platforms can be difficult. Even providers adopting the same vendor platform may find it difficult to exchange data with other providers. One exception is the EPIC platform, which was developed and marketed to facilitate information exchange among other providers that use the Epic system.</p>
<p>In principle, any estimate of the benefits of EHR adoption should be sensitive to the extent of information exchange. While the HITECH Act encourages information exchange, this does not appear to be a requirement for the incentives for Stage 1 of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. Moreover, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of the benefits of information exchange and these benefits may vary substantially across provider types. Thus, this analysis does not attempt to model or quantify any benefits from information exchange.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">II. Preliminary Evidence on Effects of Incentives on Adoption</h3>
<p>In this section we present results of original research on the effect of the HITECH Act on adoption of EHR by hospitals. The research highlights the powerful potential for incentives to promote EHR adoption.</p>
<p><i><b>A. HIMSS Data</b></i></p>
<p>Evidence on the effectiveness of adoption incentives can be obtained by examining how eligible providers have responded to the incentives in the HITECH Act. To perform this analysis we rely on data provided by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics database. The HIMSS Annual Study collects information systems data related to software and hardware inventory and reports the current status of EHR implementation in more than 5,300 health care providers nationwide. Organizations that seek access to HIMSS Analytics data must provide their information on software and hardware use. Because most organizations tend to participate for a long period of time, the HIMSS Analytics data closely approximates panel data and can be used for fixed effects regression.</p>
<p>Most of the surveyed respondents are eligible for incentives under the HITECH Act (mainly hospitals). However, HIMSS also surveys many ineligible providers, nearly all of which are affiliated with hospital systems. These can be categorized into three groups of providers: Subacute, Ambulatory Care, and Home Health.</p>
<p>HIMSS reports adoption of 99 different technologies in 18 categories. Examples include Emergency Department Information Systems, Financial Modeling for Financial Decision Support, and a Laboratory Information System. For hospital and subacute providers, we restrict attention to five applications in the category Electronic Medical Records that are commonly used in other studies of EHR adoption:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A <i>Clinical Data Repository (CDR) </i>is a real time database that combines disparate information about patients into a single file. This information may include test results, drug utilization, pathology reports, patient demographics, and discharge summaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)</i> use clinical information to help providers diagnose patients and develop treatment plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Order Entry</i> provides electronic forms to streamline hospital operations (replacing faxes and paper forms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE)</i> is a more sophisticated type of electronic order entry and involves physician entry of orders into the computer network to medical staff and to departments such as pharmacy or radiology. CPOE systems typically include patient information and clinical guidelines, and can flag potential adverse drug reactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Physician Documentation</i> (PD) helps physicians use clinical information to generate diagnostic codes that are meaningful for other practitioners and valid for reimbursement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These closely represent the kind of EHR applications that many proponents believe will lead to dramatic cost savings and quality enhancements.</p>
<p>For hospitals and subacute care providers, the five EHR applications are aggregated into two broad categories labeled the "basic" and "advanced" EHR. Applications within each of these categories involve similar costs of adoption and require similar types of co-invention to be used successfully. It is determined that a provider has basic EHR if it has adopted a clinical data repository (CDR), clinical decision support systems (CDSS), or order entry/communication. A provider has advanced EHR if it has adopted either computerized practitioner order entry (CPOE) or physician documentation, applications that are more difficult to implement and more difficult to operate successfully due to the need for physician training and involvement. Analyses of health IT adoption, such as the HIMSS Forecasting Model, consider advanced EHR applications to represent the final stage of EHR adoption (HIMSS Analytics 2011).</p>
<p>Tables S2-S7 show adoption rates for each category of provider for every year that data is available for that category, through 2011. The tables also report adoption trends for the Epic EHR platform. Adoption by all provider types has been trending steadily upward since 2001. It seems that the pace of adoption quickens around 2008 and 2009, around the time of passage of the HITECH Act. This is especially noteworthy because with each passing year there are fewer holdouts; it appears that a greater percentage of holdouts chose to adopt EHR after HITECH. In addition, there is a strong increase in adoption of Epic EHR following HITECH.</p>
<p><i><b>B. Statistical Analysis of Adoption Trends</b></i></p>
<p>In this section the results of a statistical analysis of the effects of the HITECH Act on EHR adoption by hospitals is reported and "Hazard Regression" models are estimated. Hazard regressions study the rate at which some event occurs over time. In this case the "event" is the adoption of EHR. The key variable under study is the adoption "rate;" which can be thought of as the fraction of hospitals in a given year that (a) had not yet adopted EHR and (b) adopt EHR in that year. For example, if there are 1,000 total hospitals and as of 2005, 600 have adopted EHR, it stands to reason that 400 hospitals have not adopted EHR. If the hazard rate is 10 percent, then we would expect 40 of the 400 hospitals to adopt EHR in 2005, leaving 360 without EHR at the start of 2006. If the hazard rate remains 10 percent, an additional 36 hospitals can be expected to adopt EHR in 2006. Hazard regression can be used to determine whether the HITECH Act increased the hazard rate.</p>
<p><a href="#tableS8">Table S8</a> presents results of a hazard regression for hospital adoption of both elements (CPOE and PD) of advanced EHR. These elements are important for hospitals to satisfy the meaningful use criteria in HITECH, but hospitals with advanced EHR do not necessarily exchange information with other providers, a requirement for meaningful use. Thus, results are suggestive of the impact of HITECH on the fulfillment of the meaningful use requirement, but not definitive. The key predictors in the model include an indicator for the passage of HITECH and interactions between the passage of HITECH and various hospital characteristics.</p>
<p>The regression results imply that for the average hospital, the adoption rate increased after the passage of the HITECH Act by a considerable amount. Prior to the Act, only 29.8 percent of hospitals had adopted both elements of advanced EHR and the new adoption rate by these hospitals was approximately 6 percent. After the Act, the new adoption rate increased to approximately 20 percent. Thanks to this increase, 54.8 percent of hospitals used both advanced EHR applications by 2011. If this adoption rate continues, then 84.3 percent of hospitals will adopt both applications by 2016. Had the adoption rate remained at 6 percent, then only 70.9 percent will have adopted EHR by 2016. In other words, the increase in the adoption rate that occurs at the time that HITECH is enacted is predicted to lead to a 13.4 percentage point increase in the number of hospitals that adopt both elements of advanced EHR by 2016.<sup><a href="#noteS6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The coefficients on hospital characteristics indicate that smaller and for-profit hospitals were less likely to adopt advanced EHR prior to the Act but saw a larger increase in their adoption rate after the Act. Smaller hospitals may view the costs of adoption as excessive relative to the benefits, and therefore would be more responsive to subsidies. Likewise, for-profits may have been reluctant to invest in EHR without subsidies. Academic hospitals were more likely to invest prior to the Act and also saw a larger than average increase in adoption after the Act. Finally, hospitals that were part of larger systems were more likely to adopt advanced EHR prior to the Act but showed a smaller increase in their adoption rate after the Act.</p>
<p>In unreported regressions, ineligible providers affiliated with hospital systems were also found to increase adoption of advanced EHR following the passage of HITECH. This is important; system membership seems to be a big predictor of EHR adoption.</p>
<p>This analysis shows that hospitals and affiliated providers increased adoption of advanced EHR after the passage of the HITECH Act. We cannot be certain of causality, however, as there may have been other factors affecting adoption that arose at the same time. However, the fact that a similar increase in adoption of basic EHR was not identified confirms that a spurious trend is not being observed.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">III. Modeling EHR Adoption</h3>
<p>The goal of government incentive programs is to reduce the costs and/or increase the benefits of EHR adoption. In this section these costs and benefits are described in more detail so that a better understanding of how incentive programs may affect adoption can be obtained.</p>
<p><i><b><a name="sectionS.III.A" id="sectionS.III.A">A. A Simple Example</a></b></i></p>
<p>A health care provider considering EHR would weigh the private costs against the private benefits. It would consider financial factors, such as the cost of installing and maintaining the EHR as well as any potential impact on efficiency. It may also consider the impact on quality, both because higher quality could translate into more demand and higher revenues, and because it might directly cares about quality independent of financial considerations. EHR may create positive spillovers to other providers; a provider that is part of an integrated organization may internalize these spillovers, making it more likely to adopt EHR.</p>
<p>A simple example captures these ideas. <i>Note: the numbers included in this example do not bear any relationship to actual nursing home revenues or profits, or EHR costs for nursing homes. The numbers in this example are included only to illustrate some of the cost/benefit considerations that may inform a decision to invest in an EHR system, with or without incentives</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider an independent nursing home that has total revenues of $100m and expected profits of $40m. (All dollar amounts are expressed in terms of net present value.) Of this, 50 percent of its profits is derived from Medicare and Medicaid. This is based on estimated Medicaid/Medicare revenues of $60m and estimated costs of $40m. The nursing home is considering adopting EHR. The home estimates that the cost of adopting and maintaining EHR is $5m. It expects to enjoy cost savings equal to 2 percent of total revenues ($2m) and quality of care improvement that it "monetizes" at 1 percent of total revenues ($1m). Thus, the benefits or adoption are $3m while the cost is $5m. Because the costs outweigh the benefits, the home does not adopt EHR at this time.<sup><a href="#noteS7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Suppose that a new program will augment Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements by 5 percent for nursing homes that adopt EHR. The nursing home in this example calculates that this bonus payment will amount to $3m, based on its Medicare/Medicaid revenues of $60m. The benefits of adoption increase to $6m while the costs remain at $5m. Therefore, the home adopts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simple example illustrates the some of the many factors that we must consider if we are to predict the number of providers that will adopt EHR regardless of incentives, and, more importantly, the extent to which incentives will accelerate EHR adoption. To predict adoption rates in the absence of incentives, we must consider the factors that will affect the costs and benefits of adoption.</p>
<p><i><b>B. Factors Affecting Costs and Benefits of Adoption</b></i></p>
<p><i>Factors affecting adoption costs</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Size:</i> Adoption costs tend to increase with the size of the provider, due to the need for greater system capacity and complexity as well as the need to train additional staff. However, fixed adoption costs increase less than proportionately with size, for two reasons. First, there is a substantial fixed component to EHR costs. Second, larger providers will likely have lower financing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Access to capital independent of size:</i> Providers that have superior access to capital can more easily finance the substantial costs of adoption. Thus, for-profit providers, nonprofits that enjoy favorable financial performance, and providers that are part of large systems may enjoy greater access to capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Presence of complementary labor inputs: </i>EHR is a business process innovation and successful implementation requires access to labor that is skilled at working with information technology.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>Factors affecting adoption benefits</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Size:</i> Adoption benefits are likely to increase proportionately with size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>System membership:</i> To the extent that information exchange creates spillover benefits, providers in systems will internalize these benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Patient severity</i>: EHR may be more likely to improve outcomes for patients with complex conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Market competitiveness</i>: To the extent that EHR improves quality and this leads to higher demand, then a competitive EHR provider may value EHR more than a provider that faces little or no competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Provider objectives:</i> Providers that value quality of care independent of profits may value EHR more highly than a purely profit driven provider.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Many of these considerations are borne out by the empirical analysis of the HITECH Act described earlier. Smaller hospitals, for-profit hospitals, and teaching hospitals are more likely to adopt EHRs when incentives are available. Hospitals that are part of smaller integrated delivery systems are more likely to adopt when incentives are available.</p>
<p><i>Factors affecting incremental adoption</i></p>
<p>Size, ownership, and system membership may predict EHR adoption, but do not necessarily predict <i>incremental adoption</i> from the incentive program. The model suggests that incremental adoption depends on the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>The size of the incentives:</i> This will be very dependent on the specific incentives under consideration. In our example, the size of the incentive is proportional to the total Medicare and Medicaid revenues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>The size of the provider:</i> Larger providers are likely to perceive larger gaps between benefits and costs, whether positively or negatively, simply because the stakes are higher. Thus, it will take bigger incentives to motivate a given number of large providers relative to a given number of small providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>The number of fence sitters</i>: The number of providers for whom the costs of adoption exceed the benefits in the absence of incentives but for whom the benefits exceed the costs with incentives. In other words, we need to know the number of "fence sitters."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Decision-making: </i>The extent to which the provider's decision to adopt EHR is based on financial rather than medical considerations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Most of these considerations are supported by the empirical analysis of HITECH. No empirical evidence outlines the relationship between the size of the incentives and the adoption rate, as there have been no experiments in which the size of the incentives have varied. Smaller hospitals responded more strongly to HITECH, which could indicate that smaller hospitals were more likely to be fence sitters. Finally, for-profits responded more strongly to HITECH, likely because they placed more weight on financial considerations.</p>
<p>The biggest unknown when forecasting incremental adoption is identifying the fence sitters. Ideally, one would obtain such information from a carefully constructed survey. Absent survey data, simple statistical theory can be used to conjecture about incremental adoption rates. Noting that there is likely to be a distribution of providers with a range of benefit/cost ratios for EHR adoption. Like most distributions, this is likely to be bell-shaped with disproportionate number of providers "in the middle" of the distribution. This helps account for the classic "S-curve" of new technology adoption, whereby there are a few early adopters, adoption accelerates, and then slows.</p>
<p>If there is a bell curve of benefit/cost ratios, then there are more fence sitters when about half of all providers have chosen to adopt EHR than when either 10 percent or 90 percent have chosen to adopt. Put another way, when very few providers have adopted, then most are probably far away from choosing to adopt and an incentive program may not change many minds. When most have adopted, there are few providers left whose minds need changing. Thus, the biggest impact of any incentive program will come when some but not all providers have adopted. Referring to <a href="#tableS1">Table S1</a>, which lists adoption rates of basic EHR by provider categoryshows a wide range of reported adoption rates. If these adoption rates are valid, then for those classes of ineligible providers, including rehabilitation hospitals and long-term care hospitals, where less than 10 percent have adopted EHR, then large incentives may be necessary to encourage substantial additional adoption in these categories. On the other hand, about half of providers in categories such as nursing homes and home health care have adopted basic EHR. Small incentives might be sufficient to generate substantial additional adoption. However, these conclusions are dependent on the availability of reliable and valid data regarding EHR adoption rates for these providers.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">IV. Comparing Different Approaches to Encouraging Incremental Adoption</h3>
<p><i><b>A. Caveats</b></i></p>
<p>Although it is difficult to forecast with any degree of confidence the impact of incentives on incremental EHR adoption, the CBO and other organizations have made such forecasts in conjunction with the HITECH Act and a proposed extension to mental health providers. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine whether they have forecasted overall growth in EHR adoption or incremental growth attributable to the incentives in the legislation. Nor has there been any retrospective review to ascertain the accuracy of these forecasts.</p>
<p>Rather than attempt to provide specific forecasts of the impact of extending the EHR Incentive Program on adoption, we believe it is more reasonable to use the ideas developed above to compare the relative effectiveness of different incentive programs.</p>
<p><i><b>B. Comparing Incentives</b></i></p>
<p>When evaluating a specific program to encourage EHR adoption, there are many considerations.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How large are the incentives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the incentives larger for some providers than for others? Which providers get the largest benefits from adoption? Which enjoy the largest cost reductions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How large are the benefits relative to the incentives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the program target "fence sitters?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the program pay for adoption by providers that have already adopted and/or would have adopted in the absence of incentives?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We bear these in mind as we consider three different programs: Payment incentives, Financing, and Information technology consulting.</p>
<p><i>Payment Incentives</i></p>
<p>The HITECH Act creates incentive payments under Medicare and Medicaid for hospitals that meet a range of criteria for EHR adoption. Incentive payments have several advantages. The government can stipulate precisely what providers must do to be eligible. Providers can easily understand these requirements and easily compute the financial benefits from compliance. Incentive payments also have disadvantages. They tend to be broad based, so that the government must reimburse providers that would have adopted EHR and complied with the stipulations even if no incentive payments were forthcoming. And the strict requirements for payment can strait-jacket providers into EHR solutions that are not optimal for their particular circumstances. Our research evidence suggests that HITECH's incentives had a powerful effect on EHR adoption.</p>
<p><i>Financing Programs</i></p>
<p>Low interest loan programs allow providers lacking access to capital to obtain low interest loans to finance EHR adoption. These tend to be low stakes programs for the government -- in the long run the cost of these programs is equal to the discount on the interest rate afforded to the providers. But these programs can have a high return because they target the types of providers that seem to be most responsive to financial incentives -- small and unaffiliated with larger systems. We are aware of a few loan programs that make available low interest loans to support EHR acquisition and use, such as the financial program offered by North Dakota, but we are unaware of any studies documenting whether these programs have been effective.</p>
<p><i>Information Technology Consulting</i></p>
<p>Dranove et al. (2012) showed that the EHR is more effective when adopting providers are located in a community rich with information technology expertise. Government might consider programs that provide information technology training to providers that lack this necessary complement to EHR adoption. These programs could target information technology-poor communities, both by reducing the costs and increasing the benefits of EHR implementation and use. But these programs cannot be short term -- they must provide enduring local information technology knowledge.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">V. Programs to Improve Interoperability</h3>
<p>This comparison of incentive programs has largely ignored a key criterion for incentive payments under HITECH and a key success factor for EHR: Interoperability. To date, information exchange across different EHR platforms is difficult. With just a few exceptions, such as with the Epic system, exchange among providers using the same platforms is also difficult. Such exchange creates positive externalities for patients that may not be captured by providers; thus, providers may not give proper weight to interoperability when choosing an EHR vendor. This is one of the reasons that interoperability is a key criterion for meaningful use under HITECH.</p>
<p>The meaningful use criteria in HITECH do seem to be influencing platform choices, as evidenced by the sharp increase in adoption of EPIC. Note, however, that while EPIC offers has high interoperability among EPIC users, it is not especially interoperable with other platforms. It remains to be seen whether providers interpret the interoperability requirement as a <i>de facto</i> endorsement of Epic, thereby driving providers towards a single platform.</p>
<p>Financial incentives can be a powerful tool for promoting interoperability, as evidenced by the growth of Epic subsequent to HITECH. Incentives to promote interoperability can be thought of as being quite distinct from incentives for EHR adoption, as the latter affect the costly <i>decision to adopt</i> any EHR platform whereas the former merely affect the <i>choice of platform</i>. Given the ongoing rise in EHR adoption, it might be cost effective to focus on promoting interoperability. This focus would satisfy the goal of achieving the maximum benefit at minimal cost to the government. Indeed, a key focus of the Stage 2 Meaningful Use EHR Incentive Program includes a focus on interoperable health information exchange.</p>
<p>Before the government invests too heavily in further promoting interoperability, it should take stock of ongoing changes in the provider landscape, specifically the growth of formally integrated provider systems as well as the growth of "virtual" provider systems such as Accountable Care Organizations. These systems can internalize the benefits of health information exchange. Ongoing system growth is likely to further promote EHR adoption and interoperability among eligible and ineligible providers.</p>
