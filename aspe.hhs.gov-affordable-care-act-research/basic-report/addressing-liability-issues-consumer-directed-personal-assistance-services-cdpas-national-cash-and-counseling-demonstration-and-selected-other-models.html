<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p> This report addresses the liability issues that may arise in  		government-sponsored consumer-directed personal assistance programs (CDPAS). In  		analyzing these issues, the report focuses on the programs implemented in  		Arkansas, Florida and New Jersey as part of the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration, but also briefly addresses variations on the liability analysis  		for two well-established CDPAS programs, California's In-Home Supportive  		Services Program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program.  		The purpose of this report is twofold: first, to identify the circumstances in  		which negligence or other misconduct could result in liability and what persons  		or entities are likely to be liable; and second, to identify steps that can be  		taken to reduce exposure to such liability.</p>
<p> The methodology for this analysis involved review of all available  		program materials and operational procedures, relevant law and regulations,  		available literature and reports on the state programs,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> and telephone interviews with several key  		contacts from the three Cash and Counseling programs and the California and New  		York programs. Legal research revealed that there are very few reported cases  		that discuss liability issues in the context of government sponsored  		consumer-directed care. Consequently, much of the legal analysis in this report  		is based on either the application of basic legal principles of tort law or  		analogies to comparable situations where appropriate. However, in the case of  		claims between workers and consumers, there is considerable case law that is  		directly analogous, in the context of both traditional agency care and  		privately employed care providers.</p>
<p> Although not identical, the Cash and Counseling programs in Arkansas,  		Florida and New Jersey share the following characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>All participants are Medicaid recipients who have been determined to  			 be eligible for specific numbers of hours of home care services, based on their  			 level of need or claims history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consumer's eligibility level for traditional Medicaid long term  			 care benefits is converted into a cash benefit amount or "allowance."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultants, who are private agencies or individuals with whom the  			 state has contracted, provide supportive services to consumers to help them  			 convert the cash allowance into a spending plan. Most of the consumer's  			 allowance typically is used to pay wages to CDPAS workers, but consumers have  			 the discretion to spend part of their allowance on a variety of goods and  			 services that enable them to function more independently, such as equipment and  			 home modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultants are also responsible for advising the consumer about  			 hiring, training and supervising personal assistance workers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the consumer is unable to or does not wish to assume the  			 responsibility of directing his or her own care, the consumer has the option of  			 designating an authorized representative. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to providing these supportive services from consultants,  			 the state contracts with one or more fiscal intermediary agencies that are  			 available to perform employer bookkeeping functions for the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the spending plan has been completed and the workers hired,  			 consultants maintain regular contact with the consumer, and consultants and/or  			 fiscal agents periodically review consumer records to check for errors or  			 overspending. </p>
</li>
</ul><p> In this model of consumer-directed care, the state relinquishes  		considerable control over services to consumers. This raises the concern that  		in the absence of state control, there may be a decline in the quality of care  		and that: (1) poor care may result in injury to consumers; and (2) the state or  		its agents may be held responsible for the injury. However, the preliminary  		data from the Cash and Counseling Demonstration supports the conclusion that  		there is no increase in risk of injury to consumers under the consumer-directed  		model of care, compared to agency-provided care.<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note2"><sup><font>2</font></sup></a></p>
<p> Building on that conclusion, this analysis of liability risk (i.e., the  		risk of being held legally responsible for the injury suffered by another)  		finds that the risk of liability as between the consumer and the worker is no  		greater than that encountered under agency provided care. In addition, because  		in many cases family members serve as CDPAS workers under this model of care,  		there is, as a practical matter, less likelihood that the parties will seek  		compensation for personal injuries in the courts. </p>
<p> Putting aside any impact of familial relationships, personal assistance  		workers face a heightened theoretical risk of liability if they are negligent  		in performing caregiving duties, compared to agency provided care, because in  		the latter structure the agency shoulders the ultimate responsibility for  		injury under the doctrine of vicarious liability. Absent the agency, the  		individual worker employed by the consumer bears the sole legal responsibility  		for injuries caused by the worker's negligence. However, the practical  		likelihood of liability is influenced by the extent of assets or insurance  		owned by a prospective defendant. Individuals providing personal assistance are  		likely to have insignificant assets compared to agencies and in practical  		terms, are therefore likely to be "judgment proof." </p>
<p> In the case of injury to workers while on the job, liability risk is  		affected dramatically by the availability of workers' compensation. Where  		workers are <em>not</em> covered by workers' compensation benefits, consumers  		who have assets are more likely to be subject to suit for compensation if a  		worker is injured on the job, because of the absence of other remedies.  		Workers' compensation provides a relatively simple administrative remedy to  		injured workers and, at the same time, bars most personal injury actions by the  		worker against the consumer. </p>
<blockquote><p> With respect to other actors in the provision of services -- i.e.,  		  the state sponsoring agency, consultants, fiscal agents, public authorities (as  		  in California), or consumer-directed provider agencies (as in New York) -- this  		  analysis finds that their liability risk is limited to the specific tasks they  		  perform, with minimal risk of vicarious liability for personal injury  		  negligently caused by personal assistance workers. The risk of direct liability  		  is also relatively very low because of each actor's limited functions. Thus, in  		  general, delivering home care services through the Cash and Counseling model or  		  a similar consumer-directed structure results in a relatively low level of  		  liability risk where employer and support functions are "unbundled" in a  		  clearly defined and communicated fashion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Seeking to provide a broad taxonomy of all possible tort liability  		risks, this report identifies the following liability risks for each of the  		actors in consumer-directed care:</p>
<h3>Worker's Liability Risk</h3>
<p><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A"> Section II.A</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a> discuss the following liability risks for  		workers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Negligent caregiving</strong>. Case law demonstrates that  			 individual workers face a significant risk that they may be found liable if  			 they are negligent in performing their caregiving duties, including leaving the  			 consumer unattended. However, if a worker's income and assets are low or  			 modest, as is the case for many in this field, the worker may, in practical  			 terms, be "judgment proof." From this perspective, the risk of enforceable  			 liability for negligent caregiving is a risk that is not likely to materialize  			 (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.1">Section II.A.1</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negligence in non-caregiving matters</strong>. A worker may  			 be found liable for negligence in non-caregiving activities, most notably  			 creating a hazard in the consumer's home. However, here, again, if a worker  			 does not have sufficient income or assets to pay the judgment in a damage  			 action, this is a risk that is not likely to materialize (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.2">Section II.A.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A worker may be  			 a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective services (APS) law and  			 may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for failure to report abuse  			 or neglect that comes to attention of the worker. However, liability can easily  			 be avoided by complying with the APS law (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.3.a">Section  			 II.A.3.a</a>). As a practical matter, workers employed by the consumer or the  			 consumer's representative, especially if the worker is a family member, may  			 have greater emotional or economic barriers to reporting, compared to  			 agency-employed workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for abuse or neglect</strong>. A worker may be  			 criminally liable under the state's APS law if the worker abuses or neglects  			 the consumer. This is a low level risk because of the infrequency of  			 encountering worker misconduct that rises to the level of abuse or neglect. Of  			 course, on the rare occasions when it does occur, the injury to the consumer  			 can be extremely serious (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.3.b">Section  			 II.A.3.b</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injury to third party caused by the  			 worker</strong>. The worker and the consumer are potentially liable for  			 injuries to third parties caused by the worker while acting within the scope of  			 employment. The worker's liability is direct, i.e., flowing directly from his  			 or her own action or inaction, while the consumer's risk of liability is  			 vicarious, arising from the employer-employee doctrine of <em>respondeat  			 superior</em>. Unless the worker and the consumer have sufficient income or  			 assets to pay the judgment in a damage action, this too is a risk that has a  			 low probability of materializing (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section  			 II.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injury to third party caused by  			 consumer</strong>. A third party may claim that an injury inflicted by a  			 consumer was caused by the negligent care or supervision of the worker, thus  			 making the worker liable for damages. However, such claims are rare and are  			 likely to be dismissed for failure to prove that the worker owed a duty of care  			 to the third party (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>).</p>

<p><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B"> Section II.B</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a> discuss the following liability risks for  		consumers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Negligence in maintaining the workplace</strong>. Consumers  			 face a distinct risk of liability for on the job injuries to individual workers  			 they employ unless those employees are covered by workers' compensation. The  			 existence of workers' compensation coverage is a key protection for both  			 workers who risk injury and for consumers who, without it, face significant  			 liability risk. The case law demonstrates that a consumer may be found liable  			 for negligence in maintaining the workplace -- that is, for creating or failing  			 to correct hazardous conditions in the consumer's home. If the consumer lives  			 with a family member or friend who is the owner or renter of the consumer's  			 home, that family member or friend may also be liable on a theory of premises  			 liability (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.1">Section II.B.1</a>). It is true that the  			 consumer could be liable for injury caused to any person invited into his or  			 her home on these same legal grounds. However, the frequency and level of  			 involvement of a personal assistance services worker in the home raise the risk  			 to a substantially higher level, although no higher than is faced with  			 agency-provided services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Injuries caused by the consumer's mental  			 impairment</strong>. Cases in which consumers with mental impairments engage in  			 negligent or aggressive behavior that causes injury to the worker are more  			 complicated, because state law varies on whether the consumer's mental  			 impairment will be recognized as a defense in an action for damages. The trend  			 is to recognize the defense when asserted by a defendant who is confined to a  			 residential facility, and there is case law suggesting that in at least some  			 circumstances, this defense will also be accepted in the home care setting (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.2">Section II.B.2</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrongful discharge and other employment-related  			 claims</strong>. As an employer, the consumer is potentially liable for a  			 variety of employment related claims, such as discharge in violation of an  			 employment agreement or employment actions that are discriminatorily motivated.  			 However, this is a low frequency risk, and consumers can be protected from  			 liability by a carefully worded employment agreement and by being made aware of  			 any applicable state employment laws (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3">Section  			 II.B.3</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injuries to third parties caused by the  			 workers</strong>. Consumers may be liable as employers on the basis of  			 vicarious liability (also referred to as <em>respondeat superior</em>) for  			 injuries caused to third parties by their workers while acting within the scope  			 of employment. For example, an auto accident caused by the worker while running  			 an errand for the consumer could result in such liability (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>). </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Authorized Representative's Liability Risk</h3>
<p><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a> discusses the following  		liability risks for authorized representatives:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligence and for breach of fiduciary  			 duty</strong>. In addition to potential liability for negligence (that is,  			 failure to exercise ordinary care) in performing the duties of an authorized  			 representative, an authorized representative may well have a heightened  			 "fiduciary duty" to the consumer. However, in most cases authorized  			 representatives are relatives or friends whose caregiving commitment is high,  			 as is their level of care in performing their duties, thus significantly  			 reducing the likelihood of negligence or breach of fiduciary duty (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent hiring of a worker</strong>. The  			 parent or other legally responsible person who is acting as the consumer's  			 authorized representative may be liable for injuries or damage that results  			 from a worker's failure to properly supervise or care for the consumer.  			 However, case law on negligent hiring and parental liability strongly suggests  			 that the authorized representative would be liable only if the representative:  			 (1) knew or had reason to know that the consumer was likely to cause such  			 damage or injuries; and (2) the authorized representative was negligent in  			 hiring the personal assistant responsible for the supervision or care of the  			 consumer (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability as the employer of the worker</strong>. The  			 authorized representative normally will be considered the joint employer, or  			 the sole employer of the worker if the consumer has no ability to self direct  			 his or her care, and therefore will have potential employment related liability  			 (see <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3">Section II.B.3</a>), including vicarious  			 liability for torts committed by the worker that cause injury to third  			 parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for abuse, neglect or exploitation of the  			 consumer</strong>. In states that provide for a civil cause of action for abuse  			 of a vulnerable adult, the representative may be liable to the consumer if the  			 representative abuses, neglects or exploits the consumer. The representative  			 could also be criminally liable. Again, this is a very low-incidence risk.  			 Finally, the representative may be a mandatory reporter under the state APS law  			 (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Fiscal Agent's Liability Risk</h3>
<p> Because the role of the fiscal agent is limited (processing payroll  		records and issuing paychecks, and, in some cases, fiscal monitoring), the  		liability risks for fiscal agents are correspondingly quite limited. The report  		does not address the various contractual obligations to the state that the  		fiscal agent may incur. The report does analyze the following personal injury  		liability risks for fiscal agents in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII">Section III</a>:  		</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability to consumers for breach of contract</strong>. In  			 some states, the fiscal agent (FA) enters into an agreement directly with the  			 consumer, creating the possibility of a breach of contract action by the  			 consumer if the FA fails to issue a paycheck to the worker and the consumer, as  			 a result, loses the worker's services and suffers injury. However, the possible  			 theories of liability are speculative and difficult to prove, and even if the  			 plaintiff is nonetheless successful, the amount of damages a consumer or worker  			 will be able to recover is likely to be insignificant (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.A">Section III.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tort liability to consumers and workers for failure to pay  			 worker</strong>. Negligence resulting in failure to pay the worker could also  			 give rise to a tort action by the worker or the consumer against the FA. Here,  			 too, there are serious legal obstacles to these claims, such as the difficulty  			 of proving causation, and in any case, the amount of damages at stake is likely  			 to be insignificant (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.B">Section III.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability to consumers for negligent monitoring</strong>. A  			 fiscal agent's negligence in monitoring a consumer's expenses and detecting  			 problems could result in negative consequences for the consumer such as  			 dis-enrollment from the CDPAS program, but here again there are serious legal  			 obstacles to recovery, most notably the consumer's contributory negligence in  			 deviating from the spending plan (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.C">Section  			 III.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A  			 fiscal agent may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective  			 services (APS) law and may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for  			 failure to report abuse, neglect, or exploitation that comes to attention of  			 the FA. Liability can easily be avoided by complying with any applicable APS  			 reporting requirements (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.D">Section III.D</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Consultant's Liability Risk</h3>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, consultants, rather than the  		state, are assigned the most critical program functions -- assisting the  		consumer in designating an authorized representative and developing the  		spending plan and the back-up plan; providing consultation with regard to  		hiring, training and supervising workers; and monitoring program quality and  		initiating action to correct problems. While the fact that the consultant's  		functions are so critical certainly creates a significant risk of liability,  		this risk is mitigated by the fact the consumer explicitly bears primary  		responsibility for decisions regarding development of the spending plan and the  		back-up plan and selection and supervision of a worker, including  		hiring/firing, training, and scheduling. This separation of responsibility  		should protect the consultant from being deemed vicariously liable for injury  		to consumers caused by workers or by deficiencies in the spending plan or  		back-up plan. The way the program defines the functions of the consultant (or  		case worker by any other name) is critical to the liability risk analysis, for  		liability risk follows function.</p>
<p> Consultants can effectively protect themselves against liability by:  		(1) being very clear in practice about staying within the bounds of  		consultation versus case management; (2) complying with program procedures and  		instructions carefully and executing all responsibilities conscientiously and  		with reasonable care; and (3) making it clear all times that it is the role of  		the consumer, not the consultant, to make decisions regarding the consumer's  		care.</p>
<p><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV"> Section IV</a> discusses the following liability  		risks for consultants:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent designation of an authorized  			 representative</strong>. To the extent that the consultant takes on  			 responsibility for screening and/or approving an authorized representative, the  			 consultant may be liable to the consumer for negligence in investigating,  			 evaluating, or approving that selection, if the representative subsequently is  			 negligent in performing his or her responsibilities or otherwise fails to act  			 in the consumer's best interest (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.A">Section  			 IV.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent assistance in the development of the  			 spending plan and back-up plan</strong>. If the consultant provides inadequate  			 or incorrect advice, the consultant may be liable for negligent assistance in  			 the development of the spending plan or back-up plan. In states that give  			 consultants authority to approve the spending plan and/or the back-up plan, the  			 consultant may be liable for negligent approval of a deficient plan (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.B">Section IV.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent assistance in hiring, training and  			 supervising workers</strong>. Similarly, if the consultant provides inadequate  			 or incorrect advice regarding hiring, training or supervising workers, the  			 consultant may be liable for negligence if the consumer who relies on that  			 advice is subsequently injured (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.C">Section  			 IV.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent monitoring</strong>. A consultant  			 may be liable if the consultant is negligent in monitoring program quality or  			 fails to initiate action to correct problems identified in the course of  			 monitoring, resulting in injury to the consumer (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.D">Section  			 IV.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A  			 consultant may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective  			 services (APS) law and may therefore face civil and/or criminal liability for  			 failure to report abuse or neglect that comes to attention of the consultant  			 (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.E">Section IV.E</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>State's Liability Risk</h3>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, the state's risk of  		liability for personal injury is greatly reduced. Most of the functions that  		were performed by the state or a provider agency in traditional Medicaid-funded  		home care services are now unbundled and performed by consumers (e.g., hiring  		and supervising workers), consultants (e.g., advising consumers and monitoring  		care), and fiscal agents (e.g., payroll services for workers). The core  		functions that continue to be performed by the state, such as enrolling  		consumers and responding to serious problems in connection with consumer care,  		carry some risk of liability, but if the state program is well structured and  		operated in accordance with that structure, this risk is minimal.</p>
<p> <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV">Section V</a> discusses the following liability  		risks for states:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to obtain adequate consent</strong>.  			 State programs that elect not to screen applicants to determine whether the  			 applicant is an appropriate candidate for CDPAS risk liability if the state  			 enrolls a consumer without first obtaining the consumer's voluntary agreement  			 to participate in the program (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.A">Section V.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to adopt adequate criteria and  			 procedures for selection of an authorized representative for consumers who lack  			 the capacity to designate a representative</strong>. The relatively informal  			 criteria and procedures for selection of an authorized representative that are  			 now in effect in the Cash and Counseling states create the risk that the state  			 may be liable if a representative mismanages a consumer's care, particularly  			 the care of a consumer who lacks the capacity to designate a representative (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.B">Section V.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent response to a problem or complaint  			 regarding consumer's care</strong>. The state may be liable if it fails to  			 exercise ordinary care in responding to a problem or complaint regarding a  			 consumer's care However, this liability risk is no different from that faced in  			 agency-provided care (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.C">Section V.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability as alleged employer of the individual  			 worker</strong>. If the state is found to be the employer of the individual  			 worker, the state will be vicariously liable for torts committed by that person  			 while acting within the scope of employment and for workers' compensation if  			 the worker is injured on the job. However, in the Cash and Counseling model,  			 where the consumer, and not the state (or fiscal agent), controls the key  			 employer functions (hiring/firing, assigning and scheduling tasks, training,  			 and supervision), the risk of such liability is negligible (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.D">Section V.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vicarious liability for consultant's or fiscal agent's  			 negligence and other tortious conduct</strong>. Even though the state  			 identifies an individual who provides consultant or fiscal agent services as an  			 independent contractor, if the state exercises sufficient control over the  			 independent contractor, the state can nevertheless be found to be the employer  			 of that contractor and will be vicariously liable for the contractor's  			 negligence and other tortious conduct. In the Cash and Counseling model, the  			 state typically does not exercise such control (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section  			 V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability based on nondelegable duty</strong>. The state  			 will be liable if a tortious act is committed by the consultant or the fiscal  			 agent while carrying out a "nondelegable duty" of the state. The concept of  			 "nondelegable duty" has been used in those cases where a court concludes that  			 as a matter of policy, the government should be responsible for the torts of  			 independent contractors who are carrying out the work of or executing a  			 responsibility of the government. However, courts vary in how they approach  			 this issue, and the content of statutes or regulations setting forth the  			 state's responsibilities in connection with CDPAS is likely to determine  			 whether a nondelegable duty exists (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section  			 V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to provide effective emergency back-up  			 care</strong>. The Cash and Counseling Demonstration states required consumers  			 to develop back-up strategies as part of the planning process, but if the state  			 takes on a system-wide role in securing or providing emergency back-up, the  			 state will take on significantly greater risk of liability for failure of  			 back-up care, depending upon the level of responsibility and function assumed.  			 For example, under the current federal Independence Plus Medicaid waiver  			 templates for consumer-directed personal assistance programs, the state is  			 required to "assure" emergency backup care for consumers. Undertaking a  			 responsibility to "assure" emergency back-up brings with it a high level of  			 liability risk if the state's emergency backup system fails and the consumer  			 suffers injury as a result. (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.F">Section V.F</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p> CDPAS programs can be structured in many ways, and it is beyond the  		scope of this report to identify and analyze the liability issues associated  		with each of the variations on CDPAS. However, <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI">Section  		VI</a> of the report does address two well-established CDPAS programs,  		California's In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program and New York's  		Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP). There are several  		significantly different liability issues that may arise in the California IHSS  		program:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The liability risks for counties and state agencies involved in IHSS  			 are small because they have been given broad statutory immunity. However, the  			 state does assume the responsibility of covering all workers with workers'  			 compensation protection (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI.A.2">Section VI.A.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public authorities in each county act as the employer of IHSS  			 workers for purposes of collective bargaining, but the public authorities have  			 been granted statutory immunity which shields them from vicarious liability  			 arising out of the consumer-worker relationship (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI.A.3">Section VI.A.3</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public authorities also perform certain other designated  			 functions, such as: screening and referral of workers through employment  			 registries; providing training; providing emergency back-up support; and  			 monitoring services. The immunity provision for public authorities, unlike that  			 for the state and counties, does not extend to functions such as these that a  			 public authority carries out directly. Therefore, liability risk follows and is  			 proportional to the breadth and depth of the specific function undertaken by  			 the public authority (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI.A.3">Section VI.A.3</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The New York CDPAP program is structured around a provider agency,  		Concepts of Independence, Inc., that serves as the employer of record of the  		workers for purposes of employee payroll and benefits functions and for  		purposes of entering into a Medicaid provider agreement with the state. At the  		same time, the consumer retains responsibility for directing his or her care  		and services to substantially the same extent as is done in the Cash and  		Counseling model. Accordingly, the liability issues are substantially similar  		in the two models, except that all workers are mandatorily covered by workers'  		compensation through Concepts, the provider agency.</p>
<p> <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVII">Section VII</a>, Conclusions and Options to  		Address Liability Risk, reiterates the conclusions reached in Sections II  		through VI. This section also sets forth an array of steps CDPAS program  		administrators may want to consider to address the liability risks for each  		actor in consumer-directed care. The steps include:</p>

<p> Government-sponsored programs offering consumer direction and consumer  		choice in personal assistance services<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> are not a new or unusual concept.

These factors are:</p>

<p>The Cash and Counseling Demonstration, jointly sponsored and funded  			 by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the  			 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which represents the largest and most  			 sophisticated research effort to date designed to evaluate the safety,  			 efficacy, and economic feasibility of consumer-directed care. The program,  			 which is described in greater detail in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionI.A">Section I.A</a>,  			 randomly assigned Medicaid recipients in three states, Arkansas, Florida, and  			 New Jersey, who were eligible for home care and interested in managing their  			 own supports and services, to two groups: an "experimental" group, which  			 received consumer-directed personal assistance services; and a "control" group,  			 which received traditional agency care. Although the analysis of the data  			 collected in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration is ongoing, initial reports  			 support the conclusion that consumer-directed personal assistance services  			 significantly increase consumer satisfaction without compromising consumer  			 health or safety.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>

<p>The Independence Plus initiative of DHHS' Centers for Medicare and  			 Medicaid Services ("CMS"), which is intended to expedite "the ability of states  			 to offer families with a member who requires long-term supports and services,  			 or individuals who require long-term supports and services, greater  			 opportunities to take charge of their own health and direct their own  			 services."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> The key  			 component of this initiative is the issuance of two Medicaid waiver  			 "templates," a Section 1115 waiver template for demonstration projects and a  			 Section 1915(c) waiver template for home and community-based services, both of  			 which are intended to encourage the states to develop additional  			 consumer-directed personal assistance services (CDPAS) programs.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> In general, the waiver templates follow the  			 model of the Cash and Counseling Demonstration in its specifications regarding  			 the structure and components of CDPAS programs that will be approved under the  			 waivers.</p>

<li>
<p>Increased consumer demand for such services among both younger and  			 older persons with disabilities. Younger persons with disabilities were the  			 original proponents of consumer-directed personal assistance services as part  			 of the "independent living" movement.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> But older consumers have caught on too. As  			 recently reported by the AARP, "Persons 50 and older with disabilities,  			 particularly those age 50-64, strongly prefer independent living in their own  			 homes to other alternatives. They also want more direct control over what  			 long-term supportive services they receive and when they receive  			 them."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> In June of  			 2001, the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S.  			 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) joined other federal and private  			 sponsors to host "Independent Choices: A National Symposium on  			 Consumer-Direction and Self-Determination for the Elderly and Persons with  			 Disabilities" in Washington, D.C. One of the key themes articulated in that  			 conference was that consumer-directed services are desirable and appropriate  			 not only for younger adults with physical disabilities but also for the  			 elderly, for individuals with cognitive impairments such as mental retardation  			 or dementia, or for people with severe and persistent mental illness.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> As CMS encourages additional experiments with CDPAS, a primary concern  		is the quality and safety of such programs and the related issue of their  		effect on liability for personal injuries.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> In Arkansas, the first of the Cash and  		Counseling states for which an analysis of the quality and safety of the  		program has been completed, research data demonstrated that CDPAS increased  		consumer satisfaction "without discernibly compromising consumer health,  		functioning or self-care."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> A recent study of consumer-directed care in  		Washington state similarly concluded that "[t]here was no evidence of problems  		of quality of care or consumer safety attributable to self-directed  		care."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Another concern has been possible fraud and abuse. In a 1999 survey by  		the National Council on Aging, "[t]he most pressing ethical and legal issues  		cited by the [state] administrators were abuse or exploitation of the  		consumer... and the potential for fraud or misuse of funds."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> Here, again, the experience in  		the Cash and Counseling Demonstration has been that the implementation of CDPAS  		has not resulted in an increase in fraud or abuse. In New Jersey, the Cash and  		Counseling evaluators noted that "representatives of the personal care  		industry, consultants, fiscal agent staff, [and] state [program] staff" all  		reported having seen no "evidence of material abuse of the cash  		allowance."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note18">18</a></font></sup>  		Similarly, in Arkansas:</p>
<blockquote><p> To date... there has been <em>no</em> material abuse of the cash  		  benefit.... Nor has substantial exploitation of consumers been detected under  		  IndependentChoices. While traditional providers raised concerns about the  		  safety and well-being of a few cash recipients, state investigations in every  		  case concluded that these concerns were unfounded.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The fact that in the aggregate, there has not been an adverse effect on  		the quality of care or an increase in fraud and abuse is certainly reassuring  		in terms of liability. However, this does not mean that there will not be  		individual cases in which workers, consumers, authorized representatives,  		consultants, fiscal agents, and state agencies are negligent or make mistakes,  		causing injury to others and the potential for liability. The purpose of this  		report is therefore twofold: first, focusing primarily on the Cash and  		Counseling model, to identify the circumstances in which such conduct could  		result in liability and what persons or entities are likely to be liable; and  		second, to identify steps that can be taken to reduce exposure to such  		liability.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI.A" id="sectionI.A">A. The Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration</a></h3>
<p> The Cash and Counseling Demonstration, which is designed to evaluate  		scientifically the safety, efficacy and economic feasibility of  		consumer-directed care, also represents an effort to develop a model structure  		for the delivery of consumer-directed personal assistance services. The  		distinguishing feature of this structure is that key supportive services are  		provided to the consumer without compromising the consumer's ultimate  		decision-making authority:</p>
<blockquote><p> Perhaps the fundamental tenet of the Cash and Counseling model -- the  		  tenet that distinguishes it from other models of consumer direction -- is the  		  provision of counseling and fiscal services to help consumers manage their cash  		  benefit. Some critics of the Cash and Counseling model argue that an unfettered  		  cash allowance would be preferable, on the grounds that such an allowance is  		  more consistent with the philosophy of consumer direction than a program that  		  imposes restrictions on, and monitors, the uses of the cash benefit. States,  		  however, must balance this argument with the concern that state Medicaid funds  		  might be misused, which could jeopardize political support for the  		  program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> With some variation from state to state, the following elements are  		typical of the programs in Arkansas, Florida and New Jersey during  		implementation phases of approximately 18 months that began in December 1998  		for Arkansas, November 1999 for New Jersey, and June 2000 for  		Florida:<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>All participants are Medicaid recipients who have been determined to  			 be eligible for specific numbers of hours of home care services based on their  			 level of need or claims history. The consumer's eligibility level for  			 traditional Medicaid long term care benefits is converted into a cash benefit  			 amount or "allowance" using a formula which is designed to ensure that the  			 ultimate cost of CDPAS is approximately equal to the cost of agency care (for  			 example, the formula may take into account a state's experience that in  			 traditional agency care, the amount of service hours approved are typically not  			 fully utilized).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the experimental phase of the Cash and Counseling demonstration,  			 participants who expressed an interest in consumer-directed personal assistance  			 services were randomly assigned to either the "control" group, which received  			 traditional agency care, or the "experimental" group, which received CDPAS.  			 Outside the experimental context, the goal would be to give Medicaid  			 participants a choice of receiving traditional agency care or CDPAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers who elect CDPAS are assigned to consultants<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> who help the consumer with several essential  			 components of the program. Consultants are private agencies or individuals with  			 whom the state has contracted to provide supportive services to  			 consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consultant first helps the consumer convert the cash allowance  			 into a spending plan. Most of the consumer's allowance typically is used to pay  			 wages to CDPAS workers, but consumers have the discretion to spend part of  			 their allowance on a variety of goods and services that enable them to function  			 more independently, such as equipment (e.g., a micro-wave oven to heat  			 pre-cooked meals) and home modifications (e.g., installation of grab bars in  			 the bathroom).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> Within  			 the constraints of their allowance, consumers also have discretion in setting  			 the pay rate and scheduling the hours worked by personal assistants. An  			 essential tenet of consumer-directed care is that the consumer is the expert on  			 the consumer's needs, so the consultant's role in this aspect of the program is  			 necessarily limited to advising the consumer regarding options for structuring  			 the spending plan. Nevertheless, some approval process of the plan is in place  			 in all three states, usually at the level of the state agency overseeing the  			 program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consultant is also responsible for advising the consumer about  			 hiring, training and supervising care workers. Here, too, the consultant's role  			 is to provide training and advice, with the consumer retaining ultimate control  			 and decision-making authority. The consultant also helps the consumer develop  			 an emergency back-up plan to cover situations when a regular worker is not  			 available or fails to show up for work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the consumer is unable to or does not wish to assume the  			 responsibility of directing his or her own care, the consumer has the option of  			 designating an authorized representative (typically a family member or close  			 friend) to assume this role. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to receiving these supportive services from consultants,  			 the state also contracts with one or more fiscal intermediary agencies that are  			 available to perform employer bookkeeping functions for the consumer. In this  			 report, these agencies are referred to as the fiscal agent because this is the  			 term used in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> The consumer may elect to have  			 the fiscal agent calculate all legally required payroll deductions, based on  			 time sheets prepared and submitted by the consumer, and to forward these  			 payments to the appropriate state and federal agencies. The fiscal agent can  			 also prepare and issue paychecks to workers. Almost all consumers elect to use  			 the service of the fiscal agent rather than assume bookkeeping responsibilities  			 themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the spending plan has been completed and the workers hired,  			 consultants maintain regular contact with the consumer, and consultants and/or  			 fiscal agents periodically review consumer records to check for errors or  			 overspending. This ongoing monitoring is intended both as continuing support,  			 helping to ensure that small problems do not become big problems, and as a form  			 of quality management, that is, as a way to ensure that the consumer receives  			 adequate care and that funds are appropriately spent.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The participants and their roles in the Cash and Counseling model are  		illustrated in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#figure1">Figure 1</a> below. The diagram structure  		shows a primary employer-employee relationship between the consumer (or the  		consumer's representative) and an independent worker who provides of personal  		assistance services. The consumer's responsibilities are listed to the right of  		the consumer figure. In addition to this primary employment relationship, there  		are other participants who fulfill designated employer and related functions:  		the counselor or consultant, the fiscal agent, and the state agency responsible  		for the Cash and Counseling program. They are listed in order of their level of  		direct involvement with the consumer. Their specific duties are summarized to  		the right of each figure. Because they also have some actual or potential  		interaction with the independent worker, albeit limited, their relationship to  		the independent provider is illustrated by a dotted line.</p>

<p> This report focuses primarily on liability issues that are likely to  		arise in a CDPAS program modeled on the structure of the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration. One section will consider how these issues might differ under  		other CDPAS models, such as the California In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS)  		program and New York's Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP).  		</p>
<p> In deciding which of a multitude of possible legal claims merited  		discussion, we used the following criteria. First, we do not discuss issues  		that are common to Medicaid programs in general (e.g., Medicaid fraud). We also  		do not discuss possible federal law claims that are not unique to CDPAS, such  		as claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> or the Supreme Court's  		<em>Olmstead </em>decision.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> Finally, we have assumed that the various  		actors in the Cash and Counseling structure (i.e., consumers, workers,  		authorized representatives, fiscal agents, consultants and state agencies) for  		the most part will act in good faith and will not intentionally do a poor job  		or engage in fraud.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note27">27</a></font></sup>  		In cases of fraudulent conduct, it is obvious that some liability, perhaps  		including criminal liability, is likely to result.</p>
<p> Instead, we have focused on claims that may arise when despite good  		faith -- and the state's considerable efforts at monitoring and quality  		management -- fallible people make mistakes that result in injury to others.  		These claims are primarily state law tort claims, particularly claims for  		negligence that may arise when a worker, consumer, authorized representative,  		fiscal agent, consultant or state agency fails to act with ordinary care and  		causes injury. We also touch on several situations in which intentional tort or  		contract law claims might be asserted and in which potential liability under  		state adult protective services statutes may arise.</p>
<p> It is important to note that the liability issues we discuss are  		governed virtually exclusively by state law, and, thus, the law applicable to  		the claim may vary considerably from state to state. It can be difficult to do  		more than generalize about the likelihood of liability in a particular  		situation because much may depend on the law in a particular state. Our ability  		to assess the likelihood of liability is also hindered by the dearth of  		reported decisions<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note28">28</a></font></sup>  		dealing with consumer-directed care.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> With respect to many liability issues, we  		have been able to obtain guidance from decisions involving home care agencies  		or privately-employed personal assistants, even though there are virtually no  		directly applicable decisions involving government funded CDPAS programs. With  		respect to other issues, and especially where we have not been able to identify  		an analogous situation, our analysis is necessarily more speculative.</p>
<p> The following four sections of this report discuss the liability risks  		associated with each aspect of consumer-directed care programs modeled on the  		Cash and Counseling Demonstration: <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII">Section II</a>,  		Potential Liability Arising from the Relationship Between Consumers and  		Workers; <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII">Section III</a>, Liability Risk of Fiscal  		Agents; <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV"> Section IV</a>, Liability Risk of Consultants;  		and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV">Section V</a>, Liability Risk for States and Other  		Governmental Entities. <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI">Section VI</a> discusses how these  		issues are affected by other models of CDPAS, such as the California In-Home  		Supportive Services program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal  		Assistance Program. The conclusions we reach in each of these sections are  		detailed in the final section, <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVII">Section VII</a>, which  		also sets forth a variety of steps that can be taken to reduce potential  		liability. As explained in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVII">Section VII</a>, the overall  		effect on liability of CDPAS is mixed.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI.C" id="sectionI.C">C. Methodology</a></h3>
<p> The methodology for this analysis involved review of all available  		program materials and operational procedures, relevant law and regulations,  		available literature and reports on the state programs, and telephone  		interviews with several key contacts from the three Cash and Counseling  		programs. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionI.D" id="sectionI.D">D. Possible Legal Bases for Claims  		of Liability in Connection with CDPAS</a></h3>
<p> Before discussing the specific liability issues that arise in the  		context of consumer directed personal assistance services, it is helpful to  		summarize the legal framework within which these issues may arise. The possible  		legal bases for claims of liability fall into three categories: (1) tort  		claims, which are claims that the defendant engaged in "conduct that amounts to  		a legal wrong and that causes harm for which courts will impose civil  		liability;"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> (2)  		contract claims, which are claims that the defendant breached an agreement  		between the parties; and (3) claims for violation of a right created by  		statute, such as failure to make a report of abuse as required by a state adult  		protective services law. The rights and liabilities governed by tort law and by  		contract law are private. They can be enforced only through the civil justice  		system and will result in liability only if the potential plaintiff decides to  		initiate and pursue legal remedies. In contrast, rights and liabilities created  		by statute may be subject to enforcement by the state or federal government, by  		private enforcement, or by both, and enforcement by the government may be  		through a civil action, a criminal action, or both. </p>
<p> Most of the potential claims discussed in this article are tort claims.  		Torts range from intentional interference with one's person (such as assault,  		battery, and false imprisonment) to the more familiar types of torts involving  		negligence and malpractice, and injuries to intangible interests, such as those  		involving good reputation, privacy, or emotional distress. However, the claims  		that are most likely to be asserted in the context of CDPAS are negligence  		claims. The essential elements of a negligence claim are:</p>
<ol><li>The defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care (for instance, not to  		  engage in unreasonably risky conduct);</li>
<li>the defendant breached that duty by his/her conduct;</li>
<li>the defendant's conduct is a "proximate cause" of the plaintiff's  		  harm, meaning that the defendant's conduct not only caused the harm in fact,  		  but it is perceived to have a significant causal relationship to the harm  		  suffered by the defendant; and</li>
<li>the plaintiff must have sustained actual injury or harm as a result  		  of the defendant's conduct.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note31">31</a></font></sup></li>
</ol><p> Home care services can give rise to two kinds of negligence claims:  		claims for ordinary negligence, in which the legal standard is whether the  		defendant used "ordinary care," defined as "the care of a reasonable and  		prudent person;"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> and  		medical malpractice, in which the legal standard is "whether the defendant's  		conduct conformed to the medical standard or medical custom in the relevant  		community."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> As we  		discuss in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A">Section II.A</a>, cases involving home health  		care agencies and privately employed individuals make it clear that the first  		standard applies to both professionals and non-professionals, such as CDPAS  		workers, who assist with homemaking chores and activities of daily living, and  		that the second standard applies only to medical professionals providing  		medical services.</p>
<p> Assuming the plaintiff can establish a <em>prima facie</em> case (i.e.,  		initially establish each of the elements of negligence), the defendant may be  		able to defeat the claim by asserting one of a number of defenses. The defenses  		that are most likely to be asserted in the context of consumer-directed care  		are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Contributory or comparative negligence, including assumption of  			 risk. Under the traditional common law rule, any contributory negligence by the  			 plaintiff constituted a complete bar to a claim of negligence.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> However, most states now apply  			 comparative fault, "reducing the plaintiff's recovery in proportion to the  			 plaintiff's fault."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note35">35</a></font></sup>  			 Similarly, the defense of assumption of risk, which also barred recovery under  			 traditional common law, has in most states now been either abolished or merged  			 with the concept of contributory negligence.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note36">36</a></font></sup> "Assumption of risk" is not easily defined  			 (traditionally, "assumed risk always seemed to be a way of talking about some  			 other established legal doctrine"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note37">37</a></font></sup>), but in the context of comparative  			 negligence, it refers to risk-assuming conduct on the part of the plaintiff  			 that falls short of consent to accept all risks generated by the defendant (in  			 which case the defendant would not have a duty of care to the plaintiff, a  			 situation which is now sometimes referred to as "primary assumption of  			 risk").<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>

<p><strong>Workers' compensation</strong>.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note39">39</a></font></sup> In all states, the traditional rules  			 regarding employer liability for on the job injuries have, for the most part,  			 been replaced by workers' compensation, a no fault system of  			 insurance.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note40">40</a></font></sup> This means  			 that the worker receives compensation for work-related injuries, regardless of  			 the employer's fault or the worker's own contributory negligence or assumption  			 of risk.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note41">41</a></font></sup> However,  			 under workers' compensation, the employer's liability is limited and the worker  			 may be paid less compensation than the worker might have received as damages in  			 a tort action (for example, "in the case of an employee's total disablement,  			 two-thirds of her average wage for a limited period of years plus medical  			 expenses, but notably not for pain and suffering").<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note42">42</a></font></sup> It is important to note that  			 the exclusive remedy provision of workers' compensation usually does not apply  			 where injury is caused by a third party.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> Thus, if a worker has a car accident while  			 doing an errand for the consumer, and the other driver is at fault, workers'  			 compensation would not bar the worker's claim against the driver. Similarly,  			 where a consumer is living in his or her daughter's home, and the worker is  			 injured in a "slip and fall" incident, due to negligent maintenance of the  			 home, the worker may be able to bring a claim against the daughter, even though  			 the worker is covered by workers' compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spousal and parental immunity</strong>. Spouses, parents or  			 children of consumers often act as authorized representatives, and in some  			 states, spouses, parents or children may be permitted to act as workers. As we  			 discuss in the introduction to <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII">Section II</a>, most of the  			 common law rules regarding parental and spousal immunity have in large part  			 been overruled. Yet, in some states and in some circumstances, these common law  			 rules may still bar recovery in a dispute between consumers and workers,  			 consumers and authorized representatives, or workers and authorized  			 representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governmental immunity</strong>. In the introduction to  			 <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV">Section V</a> (Liability Risk for States and Other  			 Government Entities), we describe the rules regarding governmental immunity  			 that might under some circumstances bar a claim against a state agency, other  			 governmental entity, or government official. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent</strong>. In <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.A">Section V.A</a>  			 (Failure to Obtain the Consumer's Clear Agreement to Participate in CDPAS), we  			 discuss the importance of the consumer's choice in the decision of whether or  			 not to participate in consumer-directed personal assistance services.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The concepts above are most easily applied in circumstances in which  		one person's negligence is alleged to have caused another person's injury.  		However, tort cases often involve more complicated actions and relationships,  		such as actions by an organization or corporate entity, and relationships in  		which an employee may be acting on behalf of an employer when an injury occurs.  		Because of this, different conceptual bases of negligence have evolved over  		time to define the duties and liabilities arising from different  		relationships:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Personal liability</strong>. This is the simplest form of  			 liability, holding one person responsible for his or her negligent or  			 intentional acts that result in harm to another.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct corporate liability</strong>. Under this theory, an  			 institution may be held directly liable for acts, or failures to act in matters  			 that are directly within its control. For example, a hospital may not be  			 directly responsible for a doctor's performance in the operating room, but it  			 may be directly responsible for its failure to exercise reasonable care in  			 selecting its staff members and granting clinical privileges. Similarly, an  			 agency doing background checks of individuals seeking to be personal assistance  			 services workers in a consumer-directed program may not be directly responsible  			 for injury caused by that worker, but it may be directly responsible for its  			 failure to exercise reasonable care in performing the background check, which  			 if done correctly would have revealed the worker to be dangerously  			 irresponsible.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vicarious liability</strong>. This theory of liability holds  			 a principal strictly responsible for the acts or omissions of his or her agent,  			 based upon the common law doctrine of <em>respondeat superior</em>, this  			 doctrine literally meaning "let the master answer." It requires the existence  			 of an employment relationship (or in legal parlance, a "master-servant" or  			 "agency" relationship). If an injury is caused by the negligent or intentional  			 wrongdoing of an employee who is acting within the scope of his or her  			 employment, then the employer is liable for such conduct under this  			 doctrine.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note46">46</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> The application of vicarious liability to CDPAS has been a persistent  		worry of states undertaking such programs, because it poses the dilemma of  		control.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note47">47</a></font></sup> The greater  		the control exercised by the state or any other entity over the conduct of  		personal attendants, the more likely it will be deemed the <em>de facto</em>  		employer of the worker and thus strictly liable for the negligent conduct of  		that worker. The less control exercised by the state or other entity, the  		greater are its perceived worries over accountability and quality of care. </p>
<p> Legally, the label of "employer" represents a conclusion that some  		entity exercises such power and control over the conduct of some person that it  		should bear the burden of responsibility for certain obligations established by  		law (e.g., social security, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation)  		or for injuries negligently caused by that person, whom we will label the  		"employee."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note48">48</a></font></sup> Whether  		the label can or must be applied varies under different statutes and different  		contexts. Thus, one must constantly ask: "Employer for what purpose?" Indeed, a  		key characteristic of the Cash and Counseling Demonstration and other CDPAS  		programs is that they, in effect, unbundle the notion of employer into specific  		responsibilities that are relevant to personal assistance services and then  		apportion and assign these responsibilities among the parties involved in the  		particular CDPAS program. Thus, for example, for purposes of employee  		withholding and benefits, one entity may be the employer of record, but for  		purposes of accountability for injury caused by the negligence of a worker, the  		same entity may not be deemed the employer. The "employer" for purposes of the  		latter circumstance may also be called the "common law" employer.</p>
<p> As a starting point, all the CDPAS programs view the consumer as having  		direct and primary control over the work of the personal assistant, and thus,  		the consumer deserves the label of THE employer, or common law employer,  		primary employer, or managing employer.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note49">49</a></font></sup> But unlike simple employment situations  		involving two parties -- employer and employee -- publicly funded CDPAS  		programs typically involve three or four parties or more: the consumer, the  		individual worker, the payer or regulator of the program, an intermediary  		fiscal agent that handles payroll, and other entities such as consultants (in  		Cash and Counseling) or public authorities (in California) or consumer-directed  		provider agencies (in New York). Conventional tort law is not well adapted to  		such service configurations, so the apportioning of responsibility among the  		participants has presented a challenge to these novel programs to be as clear  		and cogent as possible about who is responsible for what.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE  		RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND WORKERS</a></h2>
<p> Both the case law involving home health care agencies and common sense  		suggest that the relationship between consumers and CDPAS workers can give rise  		to a variety of legal claims. The most likely are personal injury claims based  		on the alleged negligence of either party. Workers may injure consumers both  		through negligence in the way they provide personal assistance services (for  		example, bathing the consumer in scalding water) and by negligently creating  		hazards in the consumer's home (for example, creating a fire hazard by leaving  		magazines piled near a heater).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note50">50</a></font></sup> These are discussed in  		<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.1">Section II.A.1</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.2">Section II.A.2</a> below. Similarly, consumers may be  		negligent in creating or failing to correct dangerous conditions in their homes  		that cause injury to the worker. The most common such cases are "slip and fall"  		cases -- cases where a condition at the defendant's home causes the plaintiff  		to slip and fall and suffer injury. <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.1">Section II.B.1</a>  		examines these scenarios.</p>
<p> Third parties may also assert personal injury claims against consumers  		and workers (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>). A third party who is  		injured by the worker while the worker is engaged in personal assistance  		services -- for example, a third party whose car is hit by the worker's car  		while the worker is on the way to the grocery store for the consumer -- may  		assert a claim both against the worker for direct liability and against the  		consumer for vicarious liability as an employer. In the same example, if the  		third party is at fault, and the worker is injured in the car accident, the  		worker may seek compensation from the third party, and where the worker has  		workers' compensation, it too would cover the injury. Finally, a third party  		who is injured by a physically or mentally disabled consumer may allege that  		the worker had a duty to supervise the consumer and that the worker's  		negligence in performing this duty caused the injury. Third-party permutations  		are discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a> below.</p>
<p> Although personal injury claims based on alleged negligence are the  		most likely, the relationship between consumer and worker can also give rise to  		several other kinds of claims. <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.3.b">Section II.A.3.b</a>  		touches upon the possibility that extreme neglect or clearly substandard care  		by workers could result in civil or criminal liability for abuse under state  		adult protective services ("APS") statutes. Independent workers may also be  		"mandatory reporters" under the APS law, thus exposing them to civil or  		criminal penalties if they fail to report suspected abuse they observe during  		the course of their work (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.3.a">Section II.A.3.a</a>).  		Friction in the employment relationship itself may result in claims by workers  		against consumers -- described in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3">Section II.B.3</a>  		for wrongful discharge and a variety of other employment related claims. </p>
<p> Finally, in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>, we discuss the  		potential liability of authorized representatives for negligence in performing  		their duties, including the likelihood that a court would find that the  		authorized representative owed a fiduciary duty to the consumer.</p>
<p> The use of family members as workers raises another issue in claims  		between consumers, workers and authorized representatives -- that of tort  		immunity rules that may apply in legal actions between family members. Spouses,  		parents and children frequently serve as representatives, and the Section 1115  		demonstration program waiver for the Cash and Counseling program allows legally  		responsible relatives to serve as workers, which is normally prohibited under  		Medicaid rules.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note51">51</a></font></sup> New  		Jersey elected to permit spouses to act as workers,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note52">52</a></font></sup> and Florida permits all legally  		responsible relatives to act as workers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note53">53</a></font></sup> The common law rules regarding parental and  		spousal immunity have in large part been overruled by case law or by statute,  		but in some states and in some limited circumstances, these rules might bar  		recovery in a dispute related to consumer-directed personal assistance  		services.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note54">54</a></font></sup></p>
<p> As in many endeavors, personal assistance services involve the  		possibility of inadequate performance, injury, or even abuse -- not only to the  		consumer, but also to workers or third parties. In this section we discuss in  		detail the nature and level of risk of liability to both consumers and workers  		under the consumer-directed model.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII.A" id="sectionII.A">A. Worker Liability Risk</a></h3>
<h4><a name="sectionII.A.1" id="sectionII.A.1">1. Negligent Caregiving</a></h4>
<p> Although there are no reported decisions in negligence suits between  		consumers and workers arising from consumer-directed personal assistance  		services, the substantial number of reported cases involving alleged negligence  		by employees of home health care agencies provides useful information regarding  		both the kinds of injuries that are likely to occur in the context of CDPAS and  		the legal theories of liability that are available to consumers who seek  		compensation.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Malpractice versus Ordinary Negligence</em></strong></p>
<p> A threshold question in these cases is whether claims against personal  		assistance workers must be based on a breach of professional standards (which  		requires testimony by expert witnesses) or merely ordinary negligence (which  		can be determined by a jury without such testimony). The case law consistently  		supports the latter view: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Case 1: Ordinary negligence</strong>. In <em>Headley v.  			 Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc.</em>, the plaintiff claimed that she was  			 injured when the legs of a Hoyer lift gave way while a nursing assistant was  			 transporting her to the shower, and that the nursing assistant's improper and  			 negligent placement of the legs of the lift caused the accident.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note56">56</a></font></sup> The defendant home health care agency moved  			 for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's claim was one for medical  			 malpractice, rather than ordinary negligence, and that it was therefore barred  			 by the one year statute of limitations applicable to such claims.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note57">57</a></font></sup> The trial court denied the  			 motion because the nursing assistant was not in one of the designated  			 professions for a medical claim and because the fall occurred while the  			 plaintiff was being transported to the shower, not while she was receiving  			 medical care.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note58">58</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case 2: Ordinary negligence</strong>. <em>Williams v. Metro  			 Home Health Care Agency</em> also illustrates the judicial acceptance of  			 ordinary negligence as the proper analysis, even though the care provider in  			 that case was a nurse.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note59">59</a></font></sup> In <em>Williams</em>, the plaintiff alleged  			 that, although an agency nurse was scheduled to see him three days a week to  			 educate and assist him in caring for his decubitis ulcers, the nurse actually  			 visited him only once a week. The plaintiff claimed that as a result of the  			 nurse's negligent care, he developed an ulcer that required surgical  			 treatment.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note60">60</a></font></sup> The  			 defendants moved for summary judgment based on the plaintiff's failure to name  			 an expert witness to establish the standard of care, and the trial court denied  			 the motion.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note61">61</a></font></sup> On  			 appeal, the appellate court upheld the trial court because expert testimony was  			 not necessary to establish negligence: "Expert testimony is not mandated where  			 the physician or caretaker does an obviously careless act from which a lay  			 person can infer negligence."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> Thus, the nature of the claim is determined, not by whether the actor  		is a health professional, but by the nature of the task in issue.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note63">63</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Leaving the Consumer Unattended</em></strong></p>
<p> The most common negligent care-giving scenarios involve some variation  		on leaving the consumer unattended. This may involve anything from failing to  		show up at the scheduled time or leaving early, to momentary lapses of  		monitoring that resulted in injury to the consumer. The liability risk in  		failing to show up for work is illustrated by the following cases:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Weekend no-show for fractured hip</strong>. In <em>Rosenthal  			 v. Bologna</em>,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note64">64</a></font></sup> the  			 client had contracted with the defendant home health care agency to provide  			 services seven days a week while he recovered from a fractured hip, but his  			 home care attendant did not appear at work the first weekend because he  			 mistakenly believed his services were required only five days a week. Over the  			 weekend the client attempted to move on his own from his wheelchair to his  			 walker and refractured his hip.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note65">65</a></font></sup> The agency argued that the plaintiff's  			 negligence claim was barred by a waiver provision in the contract between the  			 agency and the client, but the appellate court refused to enforce the waiver,  			 holding that the purported waiver violated public policy: "This aspect of the  			 contract warrants judicial rejection here because of the state's interest in  			 the health and welfare of its citizens and also because of the highly dependent  			 (and thus unequal) relationship between patient and health care  			 provider."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emergency arising while unattended</strong>. In <em>Walker  			 v. EHCCI</em>, a multiple sclerosis patient did not receive timely emergency  			 care because she had been left unattended by her home care worker.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note67">67</a></font></sup> The defendants argued "that  			 their only obligations to plaintiff were 'cooking, cleaning and other household  			 tasks.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note68">68</a></font></sup> However, in  			 affirming the trial court's denial of the defendants' motion for summary  			 judgment, the appellate court noted that the home care worker had been  			 instructed regarding the patient's medical condition and the circumstances  			 under which she might need emergency care.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note69">69</a></font></sup> Based on this evidence, the court found that  			 "[c]learly, defendants owed a duty of care to plaintiff beyond contractual  			 obligations to cook and clean."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note70">70</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> These two cases point to the same conclusion: the "state's interest in  		the health and welfare of its citizens"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note71">71</a></font></sup> argues in favor of a duty of care which  		encompasses not just the duty of ordinary care in the performance of specified  		personal assistance services, but also the duty to exercise ordinary care to  		protect the consumer in any situation that threatens the consumer's health or  		safety. <em>Rosenthal</em> reflects a perspective on the duty of personal  		attendants that is very significant in assessing risk -- namely, that courts  		are likely to see the duty of attendants as much broader than merely performing  		a list of specified personal assistance services. Rather, it may also include a  		duty to exercise ordinary care to provide protective oversight in many  		situations that threaten the consumer's health or safety. Leaving the consumer  		alone risks violating that duty. The <em>Walker</em> case similarly suggests  		that an attendant's duty includes ordinary care in responding to medical  		emergencies -- that is, responding in a common sense fashion based on the  		worker's knowledge of the consumer's medical condition -- and, perhaps,  		ordinary care in dealing with a variety of unanticipated situations which are  		incidental to the provision of personal assistance services. </p>
<p> Two cases illustrate the dangers of leaving a consumer unattended by  		virtue of leaving work early. In both cases, home health care agencies were  		sued for injuries sustained when a fire broke out during a worker's scheduled  		work hours, but the worker was not present to protect or rescue the client  		because the worker had left work early. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Early departure fire 1</strong>. In <em>Willis v. City of  			 New York</em>, the agency moved for summary judgment, arguing that it did not  			 owe a duty to rescue, that the plaintiff's injuries were not foreseeable, and  			 that the aide's early departure was not a proximate cause of the  			 injury.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note72">72</a></font></sup> The trial  			 court's denial of the agency's motion was sustained by the appellate court,  			 which held that "[w]here a defendant is responsible for caring for an  			 individual, the defendant's abandonment of that individual can result in  			 liability."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note73">73</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early departure fire 2</strong>. In <em>Villarin v.  			 Onabango</em>, both the client, who was severely disabled and bedridden, and  			 his daughter, who was trying to rescue him, died in a house fire. Surviving  			 family members filed suit to recover for personal injuries (apparently  			 sustained by the surviving family members themselves) and for wrongful death,  			 claiming that the agency's employee had breached his duty when he left the  			 house an hour before the end of his scheduled shift.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note74">74</a></font></sup> The trial court granted the agency's motion  			 to dismiss, but the appellate court reversed, citing <em>Willis</em>.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> Finally, <em>Esposito v. Personal Touch Home Care</em> demonstrates the  		risk of momentary lapses by an attendant in which a consumer is left  		unattended.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note76">76</a></font></sup></p>

<p><strong>Unattended in the bathroom</strong>. In <em>Esposito</em>,  			 the plaintiff sustained injuries when he fell in the entrance to his bathroom  			 while under the care of his home health aide.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note77">77</a></font></sup> The plaintiff, a multiple sclerosis patient  			 who used a walker and a wheelchair, argued that the aide was negligent in  			 leaving him in the bathroom unattended.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note78">78</a></font></sup> As in <em>Willis</em>, the appellate court  			 ruled that "[w]here a defendant is responsible for caring for an individual,  			 the defendant's abandonment of that individual can result in liability," and  			 reversed the trial court's decision granting summary judgment to the  			 defendant.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note79">79</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> While this decision and others sometimes use the term "abandonment" to  		describe the defendant's conduct, the phrase is used in its common meaning  		suggesting negligence and is not equivalent to the tort of abandonment, which  		has been recognized by some courts as a separate cause of action.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note80">80</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Negligent Administration of Care</em></strong></p>
<p> All the above examples involve failure to be there, that is, sins of  		omission. At the opposite end of the spectrum are cases that involve errors in  		administration of care. For example, several cases have been brought against  		home health care agencies by clients who were severely injured when their  		personal care workers bathed or showered them in scalding water, a type of  		injury that certainly could occur in the context of consumer-directed personal  		assistance services. In these cases, and in many other cases involving alleged  		negligence in the provision of home care services, both the existence of a duty  		to the plaintiff and causation were not seriously contested. Instead, pretrial  		motions and post-trial appeals typically focused on issues of whether the  		defendant was negligent or even reckless in caring for the plaintiff:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Shower scalding</strong>. In <em>Lee v. Health Force,  			 Inc.</em>, a mentally retarded and physically handicapped child who was  			 severely burned while being given a shower by a personal care aide filed a  			 negligence action against the aide and the agency which employed her.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note81">81</a></font></sup> After filing suit, the  			 plaintiff moved to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages  			 based, <em>inter alia</em>, on the aide's allegedly reckless care.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note82">82</a></font></sup> The trial court's decision  			 granting this motion was reversed by the appellate court, which noted that the  			 aide had given prompt and appropriate first aid when the shower water  			 unexpectedly became very hot.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note83">83</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> Home care agencies have also been sued for alleged negligence in  		helping a patient perform other tasks:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Elevator slip</strong>. For example, in <em>Calick v. Double  			 A Property Associates</em>, the client was injured when she slipped on a puddle  			 in an elevator while being assisted by her home care attendant.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note84">84</a></font></sup> The attendant argued that she  			 was not negligent because she looked into the elevator, as was her practice,  			 and saw no puddle.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note85">85</a></font></sup>  			 The trial court agreed and granted the defendant's motion to set aside the  			 jury's verdict for the plaintiff, but the appellate court reversed, holding  			 that "the reasonableness of the attendant's actions and her failure to see what  			 was on the floor of the elevator was a factual question for the jury" to  			 determine.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note86">86</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> Virtually any task can be negligently performed, but the reported case  		law provides only occasional examples that reach appellate review. Again, the  		import of these cases is that they are judged by standards of ordinary  		negligence and not by a professional standard of care. This fact may be viewed  		as both a plus and a minus for personal care attendants -- a plus because  		attendants are held to a duty of only ordinary care, and not to a higher duty  		by virtue of their chosen work. Simultaneously, this is a minus, because  		allegations of negligence can be sustained by a jury of ordinary citizens.  		Expert testimony is not required. </p>
<h4><a name="sectionII.A.2" id="sectionII.A.2">2. Negligence in Non-Caregiving  		Matters</a></h4>
<p> Workers can also cause injuries to consumers in ways that are not  		directly related to the provision of personal assistance services. The worker  		will necessarily be in the consumer's home on a regular basis and may  		unwittingly -- and negligently -- create a hazardous condition that results in  		injury to the consumer. Two lawsuits against home care agencies illustrate the  		possibilities for such claims: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Falling supply bag</strong>. In <em>Rogers v. Crossroads  			 Nursing Service, Inc.</em>, the plaintiff was receiving home health care  			 services from the defendant agency while he recovered from back  			 surgery.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note87">87</a></font></sup> He sued the  			 agency alleging that "a Crossroads employee negligently placed a heavy supply  			 bag on a table close to him that fell and re-injured his back."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note88">88</a></font></sup> The agency argued that the case  			 fell under the state's Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act and that  			 the case should be dismissed because the plaintiff had failed to provide the  			 expert report required under that Act, a defense similar to that in the  			 <em>Headley</em> case.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note89">89</a></font></sup> But also as in <em>Headley</em>, the defense  			 was ultimately unsuccessful -- although the trial court dismissed the action,  			 the appellate court reversed, reasoning that "the question of how to place a  			 heavy supply bag in a patient's home so as not to injure the patient is not  			 governed by an accepted industry standard of safety within the health care  			 industry, but rather is governed by the standard of ordinary care."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note90">90</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Burning magazines</strong>. The critical issue in  			 <em>Daniels v. Senior Care, Inc</em>., was whether the negligence of a home  			 care worker who acted as a live-in companion caused a house fire that killed  			 both the worker and the elderly woman for whom she provided care.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note91">91</a></font></sup> The children of the deceased  			 woman filed a wrongful death action against the agency that had employed the  			 worker, arguing that she was responsible for the fire either because she  			 "allowed the decedent to accumulate papers and magazines on the heater, when  			 she was under a duty to prevent the decedent from doing so, or, alternatively,  			 [because she] placed these combustibles on the heater herself."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note92">92</a></font></sup> The trial court rejected these  			 arguments and granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, but the  			 appellate court disagreed.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note93">93</a></font></sup> Citing testimony from the fire marshal  			 regarding the likely cause of the fire, the appellate court held that  			 "Plaintiffs submitted a probative factual scenario showing that Defendant's  			 breach of its duties to decedent was a proximate cause of her death."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note94">94</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> These cases illustrate a critical point: an injury is unlikely to  		result in a lawsuit unless there is a potential defendant who has a "deep  		pocket." In both these cases and in all the cases discussed in the preceding  		section, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the home health care agency  		which employed the negligent employee, and in most of the cases, the plaintiff  		did not name the individual employees involved in the plaintiff's care as  		additional defendants. The reason for this is obvious: the agency is likely to  		have significant assets and/or liability insurance, whereas home care agency  		employees who provide personal care services, rather than skilled medical care,  		are low-wage workers who are likely to have few assets. In the  		consumer-directed personal assistance services model, no such agency "deep  		pocket" is readily available to compensate a consumer for injuries caused by a  		personal assistant, making recovery of compensation for such injuries  		problematic unless the personal assistant has significant assets or liability  		insurance that covers torts committed in the course of the personal assistant's  		work. On the other hand, workers who do have significant assets, but who are  		not protected by insurance, risk serious financial consequences if they are  		sued for allegedly negligent care. However, most CDPAS workers do not have  		significant assets, and the familial relationship between many, if not most,  		consumers and workers further reduces the likelihood that a legal action will  		be brought against a worker who negligently, but unintentionally, causes an  		injury to the consumer.</p>
<h4><a name="sectionII.A.3" id="sectionII.A.3">3. Abuse or Neglect</a></h4>
<p> Under limited circumstances, personal assistance workers also face the  		risk of liability under state adult protective services (APS) laws. These laws,  		which are in effect in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, provide  		the framework for government intervention in cases of suspected abuse, neglect  		or financial exploitation of vulnerable adults. There are two ways CDPAS  		workers may become liable under such laws: (1) if they are mandatory reporters  		and they fail to report suspected abuse or neglect; and (2) if they provide  		substandard care which constitutes abuse or neglect. Note that these risks are  		no different for CDPAS workers than they are for employees of home care  		agencies. However, as a practical matter, a worker employed directly by the  		consumer or the consumer's representative, especially if the worker is a family  		member, may have greater social or emotional barriers to reporting, such as  		fear of retaliation, compared to agency-employed workers, who have less  		personal entanglement with the family.</p>
<p><strong><a name="sectionII.A.3.a" id="sectionII.A.3.a">a. Failure to Report Abuse or  		Neglect</a></strong></p>
<p> Under many APS laws, personal assistance workers are "mandatory  		reporters" -- that is, they are legally required to report suspected abuse and  		can face significant criminal and civil penalties if they fail to do so. The  		coverage of APS statutes -- that is, the legal definition of the persons  		protected by the statutes -- varies greatly from state to state. Although the  		APS statutes in several states protect only the elderly,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note95">95</a></font></sup> the APS laws in most states apply to both  		older and younger adults who are vulnerable due to physical and/or mental  		impairment.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note96">96</a></font></sup> Typical  		of such states is Florida, which defines "vulnerable adult" as "a person 18  		years of age or older whose ability to perform the normal activities of daily  		living or to provide for his or her own care or protection is impaired due to a  		mental, emotional, physical, or developmental disability or dysfunctioning, or  		brain damage, or the infirmities of aging."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note97">97</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Because they are in the consumer's home on a regular basis, CDPAS  		workers are in an excellent position to observe abuse. Most consumers of  		personal assistance services are elderly and/or have physical and/or mental  		impairments that place them within the protection of their state's APS statute,  		so the critical issue in determining whether a worker is required to report  		abuse is the scope of the mandatory reporting provision. Only six states do not  		mandate reporting of suspected abuse.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note98">98</a></font></sup> The other forty-four states and the District  		of Columbia include mandatory reporting provisions in their statutes. Seventeen  		of these states require "any person" to report suspected abuse, and in these  		states CDPAS workers would, of course, be mandatory reporters.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note99">99</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The other 27 states and the District of Columbia list categories of  		individuals, such as social workers and health care providers, who are mandated  		to report. Many of these states include categories that would cover CDPAS  		workers. For example, Alabama, Alaska, Nebraska and South Carolina identify  		"caregivers," both paid and unpaid, as mandatory reporters.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note100">100</a></font></sup> Three other states require  		reporting by persons who have assumed responsibility for the care of a  		vulnerable adult.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note101">101</a></font></sup>  		Several other states mandate reporting by paid care providers only. For  		example, Pennsylvania requires reporting by "any person who is employed or who  		enters into a contractual relationship to provide care to a care-dependent  		individual for monetary consideration in the individual's place of  		residence."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note102">102</a></font></sup> Because  		mandatory reporting provisions are amended occasionally to add new categories  		of reporters, the scope of the reporting obligation in any particular state can  		be determined only by referring to the current statutory language.</p>
<p> It is important to note that even if a worker is a mandatory reporter,  		the worker may nonetheless be very reluctant to make a report, despite the  		possibility of a criminal penalty for failure to do so.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note103">103</a></font></sup> Recent statistics on the prevalence of  		elder abuse indicate that abuse of vulnerable adults is perpetrated most often  		by family members.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note104">104</a></font></sup>  		The majority of the CDPAS workers in the Cash and Counseling states are also  		family members and are therefore likely to confront conflicting loyalties if  		they observe abuse.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note105">105</a></font></sup>  		A daughter/worker may not want to report her father's emotional abuse of her  		mother/consumer. A daughter-in-law/worker may be afraid to report abuse of her  		mother-in-law/consumer by a husband who is also abusive to her, or she may be  		benefiting from her husband's financial abuse of his mother.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note106">106</a></font></sup> While there are no ready  		answers to these conflicts, workers who are mandatory reporters should be made  		aware of their reporting obligation and the risks they run for failure to  		report (in addition to criminal penalties, the APS laws in a few states provide  		for a civil cause of action for failure to report abuse of a vulnerable  		adult).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note107">107</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><a name="sectionII.A.3.b" id="sectionII.A.3.b">b. Abuse or Neglect by the  		Worker</a></strong></p>
<p> Many APS statutes provide for criminal and/or civil liability for  		engaging in abuse, neglect or financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult.  		Thus, a second, but less likely, basis for worker liability under an APS  		statute is substandard care that reaches the level of abuse or neglect (and  		although this standard may not be clearly defined in the statute or case law,  		it is clearly considerably higher than the ordinary care standard that creates  		the potential for tort liability). Two cases, one involving a paid caregiver  		who provided personal assistance services and one involving a home care agency,  		illustrate the extreme degree of neglect required to support a finding of  		criminal liability:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Prosecution of caretaker neglect</strong>. In  			 <em>Commonwealth v. Waskovich</em>, the defendant, Charles Waskovich, had  			 entered into a care arrangement with Kenneth Andrews, an elderly gentleman who  			 had been living alone.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note108">108</a></font></sup> Under the arrangement, Waskovich and his  			 wife would live in Andrews' home and provide him with personal assistance  			 services, and the value of those services (set at $7.00 an hour) was to be  			 applied toward the purchase of Mr. Andrews' house.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note109">109</a></font></sup> After Mr. Andrews died from "pneumonia and  			 severe infection associated with bedsores,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note110">110</a></font></sup> Maskovich was convicted on charges of  			 neglect of a care dependent person resulting in serious bodily  			 injury.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note111">111</a></font></sup> Under  			 Pennsylvania law, a "caretaker is guilty of neglect of a care-dependent person  			 if he... [i]ntentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury or  			 serious bodily injury by failing to provide treatment, care, goods or services  			 necessary to preserve the health, safety or welfare of a care-dependent person  			 for whom he is responsible to provide care."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note112">112</a></font></sup> "Caretaker" is defined as including a  			 person "who has an obligation to care for a care-dependent person for monetary  			 consideration... in the care-dependent person's home."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note113">113</a></font></sup> On appeal, Waskovich argued that the  			 evidence did not support a finding that he was a "caretaker," but the appellate  			 court disagreed and upheld his conviction, citing the following key facts:</p>
<blockquote><p> Appellant performed health-related duties (such as taking Mr.  				Andrews to the doctor, giving him a bath, changing his dressing, and attending  				to him during the night). Nurse Reede testified that Appellant introduced  				himself as Mr. Andrews' sole caregiver. Appellant controlled Nurse Reede's  				visitation of Mr. Andrews, and Appellant refused additional [Medicare] services  				for Mr. Andrews' benefit.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note114">114</a></font></sup></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Prosecution of agency neglect</strong>. In <em>Caretenders,  			 Inc. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky</em>, a client, who had been receiving home  			 care from the defendant agency since September 1987, was observed on January  			 15, 1988, by her treating physician to have developed several decubitus  			 ulcers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note115">115</a></font></sup> The client  			 was admitted to the hospital on February 9, 1988 with "'multiple, extensive'  			 decubiti on her body.

</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionII.B" id="sectionII.B">B. Consumer Liability  		Risk</a></h3>
<p> At first blush, claims by workers against consumers may appear to be a  		matter of little concern because Medicaid recipients are almost by definition  		judgment proof. All Medicaid recipients must meet certain income and asset  		limitations in other to qualify,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note121">121</a></font></sup> and it should be emphasized that these  		income and asset limitations make it unlikely that a worker would consider it  		worthwhile to pursue a potential claim against a consumer. There are, however,  		at least three situations in which it might make economic sense to bring such a  		claim:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>First, the Medicaid asset tests permit recipients to retain their  			 home as an asset,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note122">122</a></font></sup>  			 and particularly in the case of older Medicaid beneficiaries, these homes may  			 have substantial value.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note123">123</a></font></sup> At the same time, state debtors law may  			 protect the homestead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, claims against a consumer who is a homeowner or renter, or  			 who resides with a homeowner or renter, may be covered by the liability  			 provisions of an insurance policy on the house or rental unit or by a separate  			 "umbrella" liability policy. This is important because the most likely claim by  			 a worker is for an injury resulting from alleged negligence in providing a safe  			 workplace, the workplace being the consumer's residence.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note124">124</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third, and perhaps most significant, way a worker could recover  			 is by naming someone other than the consumer as a defendant. Some consumers  			 live with family members who have substantial incomes and assets. Particularly  			 in the case of injuries in the home, the worker is likely to sue such family  			 members in addition to or instead of the consumer, as is illustrated in the  			 premises liability cases discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.1">Section  			 II.B.1</a>. Another possibility is that a worker will name the consumer's  			 authorized representative as a defendant on the theory that the representative  			 is the joint employer of the worker.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note125">125</a></font></sup> In cases where the representative  			 independently (that is, without consultation or direction from the consumer)  			 performs most of the functions of an employer (hiring the worker, setting the  			 worker's hours, assigning the tasks to be performed by the worker, etc.), as is  			 likely to be the case if the consumer suffers from dementia, the representative  			 may well be found to be a joint employer, or even the sole employer.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note126">126</a></font></sup></p>

</ul><p> Thus, from the standpoint of consumers and their family members and  		representatives who are <em>not</em> judgment proof, the possibility of  		liability to workers is a real concern.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note127">127</a></font></sup> Conversely, in cases where the consumer  		and any other likely defendants <em>are</em> judgment proof or lack sufficient  		assets or insurance to provide compensation for injuries and other work-related  		claims, the worker has a very serious concern. This is especially true if the  		worker is not covered by workers' compensation.</p>
<p> Because in some cases, there will be an economic incentive for such a  		claim, there is good reason to explore the potential for personal injury claims  		by workers against consumers. The three most likely bases of liability are  		discussed below: (1) negligence in maintaining the worker's workplace, that is,  		the consumer's home; (2) negligent and intentional injuries caused by consumers  		with a mental impairment; and (3) wrongful discharge and other employment law  		claims.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note128">128</a></font></sup></p>
<h4><a name="sectionII.B.1" id="sectionII.B.1">1. Negligence in Maintaining the  		Workplace (i.e., the Home)</a></h4>
<p> There are no reported lawsuits by workers against consumers of CDPAS.  		Nevertheless, numerous actions for negligence have been brought against  		consumers by other home care providers, and these cases provide a good picture  		of the claims that are likely to arise in the context of CDPAS. Significantly,  		most of these cases were brought by individual independent providers who were  		not employed by agencies. The reason for this is undoubtedly the fact that  		agency providers are covered by workers' compensation and therefore can receive  		compensation for workplace injuries without bringing a negligence action or  		proving negligence by the employer.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note129">129</a></font></sup> Conversely, most privately employed  		individual providers are not covered by workers' compensation and, thus, their  		only recourse is to seek tort damages.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note130">130</a></font></sup> In some of these cases, the actual  		recipient of the home care services either was not a defendant or was not the  		primary defendant. Instead, recovery was sought from a relative of the  		recipient (usually a son or daughter) who was the actual employer of the  		provider and/or owned the premises where the provider worked. These cases  		reinforce the concern that family members of judgment proof CDPAS consumers who  		have significant assets are at some risk of being identified as "deep pockets"  		and named as defendants in claims for on the job injuries.</p>
<p> About half of the reported decisions alleging that a homeowner or  		renter was negligent are standard slip and fall cases -- that is, cases that  		allege that the consumer negligently created or allowed a condition to exist in  		the consumer's home that caused the worker to slip and fall and sustain injury.  		The rest of the reported cases involve a variety of alleged hazards --  		defective furniture or appliances, pets that bite or otherwise endanger  		workers, and the like. The fact patterns are typical of those in premises  		liability claims, and the fact that the injury occurred in the context of the  		provision of home care services rarely is a factor in determining the  		consumer's liability. </p>
<p> To clarify the legal principles that operate in these lawsuits, a brief  		summary of the law of premises liability law is necessary. Under traditional  		common law, the duty of a landowner (or possessor of land) to an entrant on the  		property was determined by the status of the entrant, and the landowner's duty  		therefore varied according to whether the entrant was a trespasser, a licensee  		or an invitee.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note131">131</a></font></sup> In  		recent years, a substantial number of jurisdictions have rejected this approach  		and simply apply the duty of ordinary care, at least as to some  		categories.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note132">132</a></font></sup>  		However, in the case of care workers, who are categorized as  		invitees,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note133">133</a></font></sup> the legal  		standard is the same whether or not the traditional common law approach is  		followed. This is because the "landowner owes to the invitee a duty of care to  		make operations on the land reasonably safe and to conduct his active  		operations with reasonable care for the invitee whose presence is known or  		reasonably foreseeable."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note134">134</a></font></sup> Given this "duty of reasonable care, the  		invitee's suit is an ordinary negligence case and the ordinary rules of  		negligence apply."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note135">135</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The following "slip and fall" cases illustrate the risk a consumer runs  		if the consumer fails to maintain reasonably safe conditions in the home:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>The hazardous doormat</strong>. In <em>Dapp v. Larson</em>,  			 a home health aide was injured when she fell down the porch steps at the  			 client's residence.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note136">136</a></font></sup>  			 The aide sued the client for personal injuries, claiming that a brown plastic  			 doormat on the porch constituted a dangerous condition that caused her  			 fall.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note137">137</a></font></sup> The trial  			 court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground that  			 the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate either the existence of a dangerous  			 condition or that the defendant had notice of that condition.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note138">138</a></font></sup> However, the appellate court  			 ruled that regardless of whether the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts on  			 these issues, the case should be dismissed because the plaintiff had failed to  			 submit evidence that the accident was caused by the allegedly dangerous  			 condition.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note139">139</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The icy sidewalk</strong>. The plaintiff in <em>Rolfe v.  			 Betts</em>, made the novel argument that his contract with the defendant to  			 provide home health care services enhanced the duty of care owed by the  			 defendant.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note140">140</a></font></sup> The  			 plaintiff had fallen on an icy sidewalk outside the defendant's house, and  			 under Connecticut premises liability law, the defendant did not owe a duty of  			 care to remove the ice until a reasonable time after the end of the  			 storm.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note141">141</a></font></sup> In response  			 to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff argued both that  			 the defendant was liable because the ice he slipped on pre-dated the storm, and  			 that even if the ice did not pre-date the storm, the in-home services contract  			 constituted "unusual circumstances" justifying a departure from the normal  			 rule.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note142">142</a></font></sup> The court  			 denied summary judgment because there was a factual dispute as to whether the  			 plaintiff's "claimed  			 injuries resulted from new ice or old ice,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note143">143</a></font></sup> but the court also noted that there was  			 nothing in the contract to "support the proposition that the plaintiff was  			 entitled to an enhanced duty of care, or suggest that the defendants agreed to  			 become absolute insurers of the plaintiff's safety."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note144">144</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> Home care workers have also asserted claims of liability for injuries  		caused by allegedly hazardous furnishings and appliances and by household pets:  		</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>The collapsing chair</strong>. In <em>Baxter v. Cramco,  			 Inc.</em>, a home care worker sought compensation for injuries she suffered  			 when she sat on a chair that collapsed.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note145">145</a></font></sup> Her suit named her employer, her  			 employer's husband, and the manufacturer of the chair as defendants.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note146">146</a></font></sup> On appeal of a jury verdict  			 finding that the husband's negligence had caused her injuries, the appellate  			 court reversed, because although there was evidence that the chair had been  			 repaired, there was no evidence as to who had authorized or conducted the  			 repairs.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note147">147</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The dog bite</strong>. In<em> Singer v. Superior Court of  			 Los Angeles County</em>, a nurse who was privately employed was bitten twice by  			 her employer's dog and then was fired after she complained about the  			 incidents.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note148">148</a></font></sup> The  			 primary issue on appeal was whether the potential damages in her law suit for  			 personal injury and wrongful discharge were sufficiently great to satisfy the  			 $25,000 jurisdictional threshold for an action in superior court.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note149">149</a></font></sup> The appellate court found  			 that she did meet the jurisdiction limit, based both on her claim for lost  			 earnings and on the potential for a substantial award in connection with the  			 dog bites: "For one thing, plaintiff experienced pain and emotional suffering  			 both as the result of the two dog bites and as a result of defendants' failure  			 to advise whether [the dog] had been inoculated against rabies."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note150">150</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> Although it should be apparent that the claims in many of these cases  		rest on very unusual facts, consumers and family and friends with whom they  		reside may want to consider obtaining insurance against such claims.</p>
<h4><a name="sectionII.B.2" id="sectionII.B.2">2. Injuries Caused by the  		Consumer's Mental Impairment</a></h4>
<p> In all the cases discussed in the preceding section, the mental  		capacity of the defendant, and the extent to which impaired capacity might  		affect liability, were not issues. However, many CDPAS consumers are to varying  		degrees mentally incapacitated as a result of dementia, developmental  		disabilities, and other conditions. In recent years, both the courts<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note151">151</a></font></sup> and legal  		commentators<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note152">152</a></font></sup> have  		grappled with the issue of the extent to which mentally impaired patients,  		particularly patients with Alzheimer's disease, should be found responsible for  		negligent and intentional torts that cause injury to their care providers. In  		the context of assaults on care providers by patients in residential care  		facilities, the courts have generally concluded that they should not. </p>
<p> Although none of the leading cases have dealt with assaults on home  		care workers, both the increase in home care services and the increasing  		incidence of Alzheimer's disease<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note153">153</a></font></sup> make it inevitable that more such claims  		will be made in the future. In each of the leading cases, it was important, if  		not critical, to the court's holding that the defendant was confined to a  		secure institution and that such confinement minimized the risk of injury to  		"innocent" parties. This rationale clearly does not apply to a patient with  		dementia or other mental disability who has elected, or whose family or  		authorized representative has elected, to have care provided in the home. It is  		unclear whether the second rationale in these cases -- that the care worker is  		not an "innocent" member of the public, but, instead, has knowingly taken on  		the risks and responsibilities associated with caring for potentially violent  		patients -- would be considered sufficient to relieve the defendant of  		liability to a home care worker. </p>
<p>	<em>Vinccinelli v. Musso</em>,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note154">154</a></font></sup> the only reported decision that  		specifically addresses the issue, albeit in the context of an injury caused by  		a slip and fall, rather than by an assault on the worker, suggests that at  		least some courts may refuse to impose liability on defendants with mental  		disabilities. Two other cases, one involving a home care recipient and the  		other a resident of an assisted living facility, also suggest that mentally  		impaired home care consumers may be relieved of liability, at least in some  		circumstances.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note155">155</a></font></sup>  		However, before discussing these cases, it is helpful to review three of the  		leading cases that articulate the legal principles and policy considerations  		regarding liability that have arisen in institutional settings:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Mental illness and the duty to refrain from violent  			 conduct</strong>. In the first such case, <em>Anicet v. Gant</em>, the Florida  			 District Court of Appeal considered whether a violent mental patient who was  			 confined to the locked ward of a state mental hospital should be liable for  			 injuries he inflicted on a hospital attendant. Critical to the court's  			 conclusion were the following facts: that "[a]mong the most severe features of  			 [the defendant's] illness" was "an inability to control himself from acts of  			 violence which specifically included throwing rocks, chairs and other objects  			 at persons nearby;"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note156">156</a></font></sup>  			 that in large part for this reason he had been "confined to the hospital ward  			 designed for the lowest functioning and most dangerous patients;"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note157">157</a></font></sup> and that the plaintiff's  			 duties as a "unit treatment specialist" "specifically included the treatment  			 and, if possible, the control of patients like Anicet, of whose dangerous  			 tendencies he was well aware."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note158">158</a></font></sup> In determining liability, the court cited  			 two policies that support the usual rule, which is reflected in the Restatement  			 (Second) of Torts,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note159">159</a></font></sup>  			 that a mentally disabled plaintiff is "liable in the same generalized way as is  			 an ordinary person for both 'intentional' and 'negligent acts'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note160">160</a></font></sup> -- "that as between an  			 innocent injured person and an incompetent injuring one, the latter should bear  			 the loss,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note161">161</a></font></sup> and that  			 imposing such liability encourages placement of the disabled person in an  			 institution so as to prevent harm to others.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note162">162</a></font></sup> The court concluded, however, that neither  			 of the reasons for the general rule applied in this case and that the defendant  			 therefore was not liable -- first, Anicet's relatives had already done as much  			 as they could to prevent injury to the innocent by confining him to a mental  			 hospital,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note163">163</a></font></sup> and,  			 second and probably more significant, "Gant was not an innocent member of the  			 public unable to anticipate or safeguard himself.... [H]e was employed to  			 encounter, and knowingly did encounter, just the dangers which injured  			 him."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note164">164</a></font></sup> The court  			 emphasized that its holding was not based on assumption of risk, but "[r]ather  			 we conclude that no <em>duty</em> to refrain from violent conduct arises on the  			 part of a person who has no capacity to control it to one who is specifically  			 employed to do just that."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note165">165</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's disease and the duty to refrain from violent  			 conduct</strong>. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in  			 <em>Gould v. American Family Mutual Insurance Company</em>, a case brought by  			 the head nurse of a dementia unit against a patient institutionalized with  			 Alzheimer's disease who had knocked her to the floor.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note166">166</a></font></sup> The court held that "an individual  			 institutionalized as here, with a mental disability, and who does not have the  			 capacity to control or appreciate his or her conduct cannot be liable for  			 injuries caused to caretakers who are employed for financial  			 compensation."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note167">167</a></font></sup> The  			 court considered the same policy rationales for imposing liability despite  			 mental incapacity as in <em>Anicet</em>, but also relied on a third rationale  			 for imposing liability that had not been considered in that case, that the  			 Restatement rule discourages tortfeasors from simulating mental incompetence.  			 The court found that this rationale did not apply because it was hard to  			 imagine that someone would "feign the symptoms of a mental disability and  			 subject themselves to commitment in an institution in order to avoid some  			 future civil liability."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note168">168</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's disease and primary assumption of risk</strong>.  			 In <em>Herrle v. Estate of Helen I. Marshall</em>, the California Court of  			 Appeal found "the reasoning in <em>Anicet</em>... and <em>Gould</em>  			 persuasive" and held that an Alzheimer's patient owed no duty of care to a  			 certified nurse's aide employed by a convalescent hospital who was seriously  			 injured by the patient.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note169">169</a></font></sup> Like the plaintiff in <em>Anicet</em>,  			 Herrle "knew her job exposed her to patients suffering from mental illnesses  			 which made them violent, combative and aggressive. She also knew of prior  			 instances where aides were struck by patients."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note170">170</a></font></sup> The court concluded that there was no duty  			 of care under the doctrine of "primary assumption of risk," which applies  			 "'where, by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties' relationship  			 to the activity, the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from  			 the particular risk of harm that caused the injury.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note171">171</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> In each of these three cases involving institutionalized patients, the  		courts refused to find the plaintiff legally responsible for conduct that was a  		product of the plaintiff's mental impairment. Although the courts differed  		somewhat in the legal theories they applied to reach this result, in each of  		these cases it was critical that the plaintiff had been hired to manage the  		very risks that resulted from the impairment. In the following three cases, the  		court considered whether liability should be imposed on mentally impaired  		defendants who were <em>not</em> living in a secure institution, and in each  		case, either found no liability or reduced the plaintiff's liability:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's and the spilled ice cream</strong>. The  			 plaintiff in <em>Vinccinelli v. Musso</em> had been hired by the client's son  			 to work as a sitter/companion to his mother, who had Alzheimer's  			 disease.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note172">172</a></font></sup> The  			 plaintiff was injured when she slipped and fell on a small amount of ice cream  			 on the kitchen floor that the mother had spilled about an hour earlier when she  			 went to get herself something to eat.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note173">173</a></font></sup> On review of the trial court's decision  			 granting fifty percent compensation to the plaintiff (the award was reduced by  			 fifty percent for her comparative negligence), the appellate court  			 characterized the "primary issue" on review as "whether, under the particular  			 facts and circumstances of this case, the patient owed a duty to her caregiver  			 to protect against such an accident."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note174">174</a></font></sup> The court held that she did not  			 because:</p>
<blockquote><p> [the plaintiff] knew that Mrs. Musso might get ice cream on her  				own, and she knew that if she spilled some, she would not pay attention to the  				spill because of her disease.... [T]he risk the plaintiff encountered was one  				of the types of risks she was contractually obligated to guard against. Because  				of the special status and job responsibilities of the plaintiff in this case,  				the risk from a small spill occasioned by the patient was not unreasonable  				vis-à-vis this particular plaintiff.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note175">175</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The court explained its decision by citing <em>Herrle, Gould,</em>  			 and other cases that have reached the same conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p> Even in those jurisdictions that follow the Restatement rule,  				courts have held that Alzheimer's patients who have no capacity to control  				their conduct do not owe a duty to protect caregivers from injuries suffered in  				attending to them, because the factual circumstances negate the policy  				rationales that would otherwise support the rule.... The caregiver is in the  				superior position to prevent injury and to avoid the risks associated with the  				responsibilities of that position.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note176">176</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The violent home care patient</strong>. <em>Maher v.  			 Scollard</em> is an unreported decision in which a registered nurse who was  			 providing home care was twice physically assaulted by her patient. The case  			 suggests that assumption of risk or similar defenses may be available and  			 convince a court to reduce the defendant's liability, if not relieve the  			 defendant of liability altogether. In Maher, the patient, "in a confused  			 state," grabbed the nurse "forcefully by the wrists and fingers and threw her  			 against a window frame and radiator."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note177">177</a></font></sup> Two months later, the patient "again  			 injured Maher's wrists, slamming them against the bed rails."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note178">178</a></font></sup> There is no indication in the  			 opinion that the patient suffered from dementia or other mental disability, and  			 the defendant apparently did not argue that there was no duty of care.

<p><strong>Alzheimer's and intent to harm</strong>. Finally, a decision  			 by the Supreme Court of Colorado in a lawsuit against a resident of an assisted  			 living facility suggests an alternative defense to intentional tort claims that  			 could apply in the home care setting. In <em>White v. Muniz</em>, the  			 defendant, an eighty-three year old woman who had been placed in an assisted  			 living facility by her granddaughter, began displaying agitated and aggressive  			 behavior soon after admission.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note181">181</a></font></sup> A few weeks later, when a shift supervisor  			 tried to change the defendant's adult diaper, the defendant "struck Muniz on  			 the jaw and ordered her out of the room."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note182">182</a></font></sup> The next day, the defendant was diagnosed  			 with dementia caused by Alzheimer's.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note183">183</a></font></sup> Perhaps because the defendant had not  			 previously been identified as a patient with aggression caused by mental  			 disability, the court did not discuss <em>Anicet, Gould</em> or  			 <em>Herrle</em>, nor did the court consider the issue of whether the defendant  			 was owed a duty of care. Instead, the court held that in Colorado, to prevail  			 on a claim of the intentional tort of battery, the plaintiff must show that the  			 defendant intended to commit the act <em>and</em> that the defendant "intended  			 the act to result in a harmful or offensive contact."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note184">184</a></font></sup> Because the trial court's instructions to  			 the jury were consistent with this standard, the court upheld the jury's  			 verdict in favor of the defendant.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note185">185</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> These cases suggest that it is quite possible that a CDPAS worker  		injured by a mentally disabled patient will have difficulty recovering damages.  		The court may find that the mentally impaired defendant did not owe the worker  		a duty of care (<em>Vinccinelli)</em>, or that because of the defendant's  		mental impairment, the defendant did not have the required intent  		(<em>White</em>), in which case the worker will be barred from any recovery; or  		the court may find liability, but reduce the damage award based on assumption  		of risk, comparative negligence or other defenses (<em>Maher</em>). The  		possibility that the worker may not be able to prevail in a tort action  		reinforces the need to make compensation for on the job injuries available  		through the workers' compensation system.</p>
<h4><a name="sectionII.B.3" id="sectionII.B.3">3. Wrongful Discharge and Other  		Employment Law Claims</a></h4>
<p> The philosophy behind consumer-directed personal assistance services  		requires not only that consumers have the authority to select and hire their  		CDPAS workers, but also that they be able to discharge workers whenever they  		are unhappy with their care. In most situations and in most states the consumer  		can lawfully discharge the worker at will, unless: (1) the employee has a  		contract or some other evidence of a guarantee of continued employment; or (2)  		the employer's reason for the discharge is unlawful.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note186">186</a></font></sup> If there is no job guarantee and no  		unlawful motivation, the consumer can discharge the worker for no reason or for  		any reason at all.</p>
<p> Although real, as we explain in subsections <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3.a">II.B.3.a</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3.b">II.B.3.b</a>, the threat of claims for wrongful  		discharge and other employment law violations should not discourage consumers  		from discharging workers who are not meeting their needs. Instead, consumers  		can be advised to: (1) avoid making any representation, either written or  		verbal, that implies that a worker is guaranteed employment for a definite  		period of time or that the worker will only be terminated for cause; (2) if the  		consumer and the worker enter into a written agreement, as has been the  		practice in Arkansas and Florida, include in the agreement language specifying  		that the worker's employment is terminable at will by the consumer; and (3)  		exercise great care in making statements about the reason for employment  		decisions, so as to avoid any possible claim that the reason was unlawful or  		that the consumer's statements were defamatory.</p>
<p><a name="sectionII.B.3.a" id="sectionII.B.3.a"><strong>a. Discharge in Violation of an  		Employment Contract</strong></a></p>
<p> In both Arkansas and Florida, the state developed a consumer-worker  		agreement that listed the responsibilities of both parties. Although the  		Florida "Employer/Employee Agreement" required the worker to agree "to give my  		employer two weeks written notice if I decide to terminate my employment  		agreement," the agreement did not contain language regarding the consumer's  		right to terminate the worker.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note187">187</a></font></sup> The Arkansas' IndependentChoices "Personal  		Care Assistant Agreement" specifies both that "This agreement may be terminated  		by the Participant/Representative due to unsatisfactory Assistant performance  		or by the Assistance [sic] with notice" and that "The provisions of this  		agreement represent the entirety of the agreement between the parties. It may  		be amended only in writing with all parties consenting by their  		signature."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note188">188</a></font></sup> Neither  		agreement provides that the consumer can discharge the worker "at will," that  		is, without cause -- the first agreement is silent on whether cause is needed  		to terminate, and the second could be read to imply that unsatisfactory  		performance is required in order to terminate.</p>
<p> Litigation by home care workers against home health care agencies  		demonstrates the importance of including language in the consumer-worker  		agreement that permits the consumer to discharge the worker at will. These  		cases also illustrate both the possibility that a discharged CDPAS worker will  		claim the existence of an implied contract of employment and the difficulty of  		proving such a claim. For example, in <em>McCullough v. Visiting Nurse Service  		of Southern Maine</em>, the plaintiff, a part-time visiting nurse who had been  		discharged after she made two errors in patient care, sued for wrongful  		discharge, even though she had signed two acknowledgements that the defendant  		"retained the right to terminate the employment relationship 'with or without  		cause and without notice at any time.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note189">189</a></font></sup> The plaintiff nonetheless claimed first,  		that written statements in an employee handbook created a contract of  		employment of definite duration, and second, that even if there was no contract  		of employment of definite duration, other written statements by the employer  		created a contract of employment terminable only for cause.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note190">190</a></font></sup> The trial court granted  		summary judgment for the defendant on both claims, and the appellate court  		agreed, because none of the statements cited by the plaintiff was clear enough  		to override her explicit acknowledgement of employment at will.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note191">191</a></font></sup></p>
<p> It should be noted, however, that even if the worker is able to prove  		the existence of a contract or other guarantee of employment, the damages the  		worker can recover are limited to "the employee's lost expectancy, which is the  		compensation the employee would have earned over the contract term."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note192">192</a></font></sup> In the case of a CDPAS  		worker, these lost earnings will be relatively modest, making it unlikely that  		a lawsuit will be worthwhile. In addition, the discharged employee has the duty  		to mitigate damages by seeking approximately equivalent replacement employment,  		further reducing any possible damage award and making a legal action for lost  		wages even less attractive.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note193">193</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><a name="sectionII.B.3.b" id="sectionII.B.3.b">b. Other Employment Law  		Claims</a></strong></p>
<p> A discharged worker could also allege that the discharge was unlawfully  		motivated. The primary reasons why a discharge might be unlawful relate to  		violations of an anti-discrimination law (e.g., discharge based on sex, race,  		religion, or national origin) or reasons of public policy (e.g., discharge of a  		whistleblower). With one exception, federal anti-discrimination laws apply only  		to employers who employ a specified minimum number of employees and therefore  		would not apply to CDPAS consumers. For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights  		Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color,  		religion, sex, and national origin,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note194">194</a></font></sup> applies only to an employer "who was  		fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more  		calendar weeks.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note195">195</a></font></sup>  		Although Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note196">196</a></font></sup> which, <em>inter alia,</em> prohibits  		racial discrimination in employment agreements,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note197">197</a></font></sup> does not contain such a jurisdictional  		threshold, there is no administrative enforcement mechanism for Section 1981,  		making it an unlikely basis for a claim by a plaintiff who does not have the  		resources to retain an attorney. Unlike federal laws, state anti-discrimination  		laws often extend to smaller employers and in some cases cover all employers,  		regardless of the number of employees, making a lawsuit against a consumer a  		possibility.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note198">198</a></font></sup> Many  		states laws also prohibit kinds of discrimination that are not prohibited under  		federal law, such as discrimination on the basis of marital status or sexual  		orientation.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note199">199</a></font></sup></p>
<p> To avoid any possible claim of violation of state anti-discrimination  		laws, consumers and their authorized representatives can be advised as to  		whether they are covered by their state law. If the consumer is covered, the  		consumer can be informed about the kinds of discrimination prohibited under  		that law. The consumer might be further advised to avoid even the appearance of  		a discriminatory motivation in all employment related decisions, but  		particularly in hiring and discharge decisions. This is important because  		within the privacy of their own homes, consumers understandably are likely to  		feel free to make comments and express attitudes that could be interpreted as  		discriminatory.</p>
<p> It is also quite possible that a CDPAS worker could be discharged for  		reasons that violate public policy. A worker might be discharged in retaliation  		for reporting elder abuse or suspected Medicaid fraud. The law varies  		considerably from state to state regarding the extent to which "whistleblowers"  		and other plaintiffs allegedly terminated for reasons that violate public  		policy are protected against retaliatory discharge.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note200">200</a></font></sup> To minimize the possibility  		of such a claim, it may be wise to advise consumers to be avoid discharging a  		worker in circumstances that could be interpreted as retaliatory.</p>
<p> Finally, if the discharged worker has a factual basis for alleging one  		or more of a variety of employment related torts in addition to wrongful  		discharge, the worker may be able to obtain a substantial damage award. As  		explained in an American Bar Association handbook on employment law:</p>
<blockquote><p> There has been a steady increase of new claims and causes of action  		  in connection with wrongful discharge cases over the last several years. The  		  new claims an employer can expect to see coupled with a claim for wrongful  		  termination or discrimination include defamation, invasion of privacy,  		  intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, loss of consortium,  		  interference with prospective economic advantage, false imprisonment, and  		  assault and battery. These "tag-along torts" are beneficial to plaintiffs  		  because they enable a disgruntled employee to recover large tort awards,  		  including punitive damages, which are not normally available in a breach of  		  contract case.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note201">201</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Tag-along torts</strong>. <em>James v. In Home Services,  			 Inc.,</em> a case with several such "tag-along torts," is particularly  			 interesting. In <em>James</em>, all the claims most directly related to the  			 plaintiff's employment were dismissed, yet the Court of Appeals of Minnesota  			 nevertheless remanded the case for trial of related tort claims that could  			 result in significant liability.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note202">202</a></font></sup> The plaintiff, a nurse who worked for a  			 home care agency, was terminated from employment after her employer was told by  			 a sheriff's deputy that she had been arrested and incarcerated for a period of  			 time.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note203">203</a></font></sup> The agency  			 discharged her because it believed that she was a convicted felon and that she  			 had falsified her employment application.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note204">204</a></font></sup> Although the appellate court sustained the  			 lower court's decision granting the defendant summary judgment on her claims of  			 breach of contract, discrimination based on disability, and retaliation for  			 seeking workers' compensation benefits, the court reversed the lower court and  			 remanded for trial her claims for defamation, intentional infliction of  			 emotional distress and punitive damages.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note205">205</a></font></sup> These claims were reinstated because the  			 agency "took no steps to verify the information which the deputy provided, even  			 though it could easily have done so."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note206">206</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> While the kinds of employment law claims discussed in this section are  		much less likely to occur in the context of consumer-directed personal  		assistance services than in the context of agency care, the following steps can  		be taken to protect consumers: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The consumer and the worker can sign an employment agreement that  			 includes a provision that specifies that the consumer may terminate the worker  			 at will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a state anti-discrimination law applies to the consumer, the  			 consultant can explain the terms of that law as part of the consumer's training  			 in how to hire a worker. The consultant may further advise the consumer to  			 avoid even the appearance of discrimination in employment decisions, including  			 the need to be careful about candid comments that might be  			 misinterpreted.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionII.C" id="sectionII.C">C. Claims Involving Third  		Parties</a></h3>
<p> There are three situations in which claims against consumers and  		workers may result from interactions with third parties:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The first situation, and probably the most common, is an injury to  			 the worker caused by a third party while the worker is acting within the scope  			 of employment. In this situation, the worker can bring a tort action against  			 the third party if the worker can allege that the third party is at fault, and  			 if the worker is covered by workers' compensation, the worker can collect  			 benefits regardless of who is at fault. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second situation, which is also quite common, is an injury to a  			 third party caused by the worker while acting within the scope of employment.  			 In this situation, the third party may seek compensation from both the worker  			 <em>and</em> the consumer, arguing that under the doctrine of respondeat  			 superior, an employer is vicariously liable for any tort committed by an  			 employee within the scope of employment.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note207">207</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third situation is a claim by a third party that an injury  			 inflicted by a consumer was caused by the negligent care or supervision of the  			 worker, thus making the worker liable for damages. Although not unknown, such  			 claims are rare and are likely to be dismissed for failure to prove that the  			 worker owed a duty of care to the third party.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The issues that arise in the first situation are illustrated by  		<em>Smith v. Ford</em>: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Third-party injures worker</strong>. In <em>Smith v.  			 Ford</em>, an employee whose duties included personal care of her employer  			 argued that she was entitled to workers' compensation.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note208">208</a></font></sup> The employee had been injured in an  			 accident with another car "while driving home after picking up her employer's  			 dog at the veterinarian's office."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note209">209</a></font></sup> Instead of or in addition to seeking  			 recovery from the car's driver, the employee filed a claim for workers'  			 compensation.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note210">210</a></font></sup> On  			 appeal of a workers' compensation order awarding disability benefits to the  			 employee, the appellate court held that the employee was a domestic servant  			 excluded from coverage under the Florida workers' compensation law.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note211">211</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> The opinion in <em>Ford v. Smith</em> does not indicate whether the  		plaintiff asserted a claim against the driver of the other car. Whether or not  		the employee was covered by workers' compensation, the employee could have  		brought a personal injury claim against the driver because the exclusive remedy  		provision in workers' compensation laws usually does not bar an employee's  		claims against third parties.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note212">212</a></font></sup> It is quite possible that the driver was  		not at fault or was uninsured and judgment proof,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note213">213</a></font></sup> or that there were other obstacles to a  		successful tort claim. The fact that a worker may not be able to recover for on  		the job injuries inflicted by a third party, even when the third party is at  		fault, is yet another reason why it is important to require that CDPAS workers  		be covered by workers' compensation. </p>
<p> The second situation, injury to a third party caused by a worker in the  		scope of the worker's employment, is probably more likely to occur in the  		context of consumer-directed personal assistance services than in the context  		of personal care services provided by an agency. This is because the range of  		services performed by a CDPAS worker is broader and therefore will more often  		bring the worker into contact with third parties. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Worker injures third-party</strong>. <em>Schmidt v. County  			 of Kern</em>, a case involving a worker who provided of personal assistance  			 services under the California In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program,  			 suggests the possibilities for such claims:<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note214">214</a></font></sup> In <em>Schmidt,</em> the IHSS worker was  			 taking the consumer to an appointment with her physician when the consumer  			 began experiencing problems with her oxygen.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note215">215</a></font></sup> The worker then drove to the hospital  			 emergency room and parked the car and left it running while he sought medical  			 assistance.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note216">216</a></font></sup> An  			 emergency room physician and the worker were both injured when the car started  			 rolling and the consumer, who was still in the car, "accidentally pushed the  			 accelerator instead of the brake in attempting to stop the car."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note217">217</a></font></sup> The physician subsequently  			 sued the county, claiming that the county was the employer of the worker and,  			 therefore, was vicariously liable for his negligence.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note218">218</a></font></sup> The jury found that the county was not  			 liable because it was not the worker's employer, and the appellate court upheld  			 the verdict.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note219">219</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> It is fair to assume that the <em>Schmidt </em>plaintiff chose to sue  		the county, rather than the worker and/or the consumer, because the worker and  		the consumer had limited assets, whereas the county was a "deep  		pocket."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note220">220</a></font></sup> However,  		in the absence of another potential defendant with a deeper pocket, both  		consumers and workers are at risk of claims by third parties injured by the  		worker in the scope of the worker's employment.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note221">221</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Finally, a New York case provides an example of the circumstances under  		which a third party might try to assert a claim against a worker for injuries  		inflicted by a consumer, but the court's ruling for the defendant suggests that  		there is little risk that the worker would be found liable: </p>

</ul><p> It is likely that other courts would reach the same conclusion in a  		case involving a CDPAS worker because in the consumer-directed model of care,  		the consumer controls the relationship and the worker certainly does not have  		"custody" of the consumer. However, as we discuss in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>, under limited circumstances, a parent or  		authorized representative of the consumer might be liable for injuries caused  		by the worker's failure to supervise the consumer.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII.D" id="sectionII.D">D. Potential Liability of  		Authorized Representatives</a></h3>
<p> Authorized representatives are subject to several potential risks of  		liability. As discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B"> Section II.B</a>, the  		representative may be liable as the joint employer, or even the sole employer,  		of the worker. This can include liability for on the job injuries, as well as  		claims by third parties injured by the worker in the course of performing the  		worker's duties. In states that provide for a civil cause of action for abuse  		of a vulnerable adult, the representative may also be liable to the consumer if  		the representative abuses, neglects or exploits the consumer. Such conduct  		could also result in criminal penalties.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note227">227</a></font></sup> If the representative is subject to a  		reporting obligation, the representative may also be subject to civil or  		criminal penalties for failure to report suspected abuse, neglect or  		exploitation to adult protective services.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note228">228</a></font></sup></p>
<p> In addition to these specific bases for liability, the representative  		owes a duty of care to the consumer in carrying out his or her functions as a  		representative, creating the potential for liability to the consumer if the  		representative is negligent in performing those duties.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note229">229</a></font></sup> Moreover, although there is as yet no case  		law on this point, the courts are likely to find that the representative has a  		fiduciary relationship to the consumer, in which case the representative will  		owe the consumer a higher duty than the negligence standard of "ordinary care"  		with respect to health and financial decisions. Finally, an authorized  		representative might be liable for injuries or property damage caused by the  		worker's failure to supervise the consumer if the authorized representative  		knew or had reason to know that the consumer was likely to cause such damage or  		injuries and the authorized representative was negligent in hiring the  		worker.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em></strong></p>
<p> Most courts recognize both "formal" fiduciary relationships and  		"informal" fiduciary relationships:</p>
<blockquote><p> Formal fiduciary relationships are those well-settled cases -- such  		  as trustee-beneficiary, guardian-ward, partner-partner, director-shareholder,  		  and attorney-client -- where fiduciary duties apply as a matter of course.  		  Informal fiduciary relationships -- often referred to as "confidential  		  relationships" -- are those in which the court imposes fiduciary duties based  		  on a qualitative evaluation of the relationship.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note230">230</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the authorized representative relationship is closely analogous  		to a guardianship, there is good reason to believe that a court making a  		"qualitative evaluation of the relationship" would impose fiduciary duties on  		the representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note231">231</a></font></sup></p>
<p> If the representative is a fiduciary, the representative owes a very  		high duty to the consumer, both in the oversight of the consumer's spending  		plan and in the supervision of the consumer's CDPAS workers. A fiduciary owes a  		duty of care,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note232">232</a></font></sup> but  		more importantly, "[t]he duty that is distinctive of fiduciaries arises out of  		a concern that the fiduciary will take advantage of the beneficiary. It is not  		a concern about inadvertent behavior, but about self-interested  		behavior."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note233">233</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The most obvious example of a potential breach of fiduciary duty by a  		representative is "unjust enrichment" -- that is, use of the consumer's  		Medicaid benefit or personal assistance services for the representative's own  		benefit. However, in most cases, representatives will be relatives or friends  		whose caregiving commitment ensures a high level of integrity in performing  		their duties. Program interviewees in this study often noted that it takes a  		high level of commitment for anyone to take on the task of representative in  		managing personal care. Nevertheless, individuals who are considering becoming  		representatives should be given complete information regarding their  		responsibilities, including the associated liability risks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Liability for Negligent Hiring of a Worker</em></strong></p>
<p> There is concern in the disability community that a parent or other  		legally responsible person might be vicariously liable for personal injuries or  		property damage caused by a disabled consumer, particularly consumers with  		developmental disabilities. In the context of consumer-directed personal  		assistance services, there is the additional concern that if a worker fails to  		supervise or care for the consumer competently, a parent or other person who is  		acting as the consumer's authorized representative could be vicariously liable  		for any resulting injuries or damage to third parties. While there do not  		appear to be any reported decisions addressing the issue in the context of  		consumer-directed care, the case law on negligent hiring and parental liability  		strongly suggests that the authorized representative would be liable only if  		the representative: (1) knew or should have known that the consumer was likely  		to cause such damage or injuries; and (2) the authorized representative was  		negligent in hiring or supervising the worker.</p>
<p> There are two theories under which an authorized representative could  		be held liable for injuries to third parties -- negligent hiring of the worker  		and, in the case of a consumer who is a minor, parental liability rules. With  		regard to the first theory, "An employer who negligently hires or retains in  		his employ an individual who is incompetent or unfit for the job 'may be liable  		to a third party whose injury is proximately caused by the employer's failure  		to exercise due care.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note234">234</a></font></sup> The plaintiff in such a case must prove  		two elements: that the employer "knew or had reason to know of the particular  		unfitness, incompetence or dangerous attributes of the employee and could  		reasonably have foreseen that such qualities created a risk of harm to other  		persons;"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note235">235</a></font></sup> and that  		"through the negligence of the employer in hiring the employee, the latter's  		incompetence, unfitness or dangerous characteristics proximately caused the  		injury."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note236">236</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Although a negligent hiring action has not been brought in the context  		of CDPAS, it is likely that liability can be avoided if the authorized  		representative: (1) gives a potential worker candid and complete information  		regarding dangers and risks that may be caused by the consumer; (2) obtains  		assurances (by checking references and the like) that the worker will be  		competent to supervise the consumer and ensure that such dangers and risks do  		not materialize; and (3) is careful to supervise and give instructions to the  		worker on how to prevent the dangers and risks.</p>
<p> Alternatively, in cases where a parent is the authorized representative  		for his or her minor child, two theories of parental liability would  		potentially apply.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note237">237</a></font></sup>  		First, "[e]very state legislature has enacted, in some form, a parental  		liability statute."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note238">238</a></font></sup>  		Although these statutes "impose liability on parents without regard to the  		parents' fault,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note239">239</a></font></sup>  		the amount of damages that can be recovered under such statutes is typically  		quite limited.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note240">240</a></font></sup>  		Alternatively, a tort claim could be brought under Section 316 of the  		Restatement (Second) of Torts, which places no limit on damages. Section 316  		provides:</p>
<blockquote><p> Duty of Parent to Control Conduct of Child</p>
<p> A parent is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control  		  his minor child as to prevent it from intentionally harming others or from so  		  conducting itself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them, if  		  the parent:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control his  			 child, and</li>
<li>knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for  			 exercising such control.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note241">241</a></font></sup></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p> It is important to stress that the duty described in Section 316 "is  		only a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, not a duty to  		guarantee protection.... [T]he defendant is expected to act only if he knows or  		should know of his power to do so and knows of the need."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note242">242</a></font></sup> In the context of  		consumer-directed care, this means that a parent who is his or her child's  		authorized representative and who has knowledge (or should have knowledge) that  		the child is likely to cause injury or damage must exercise reasonable care in  		hiring a worker. As with a claim for negligent hiring, liability under Section  		316 can probably be avoided by carefully hiring and supervising the worker.</p>
<p> It is important to note that state law varies,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note243">243</a></font></sup> and that the theories of liability  		discussed above have not been applied in the context of CDPAS. However, even if  		these theories of apply, there is little risk of liability if parents and other  		authorized representatives are conscientious in hiring and supervising workers  		who will be responsible for consumers who are likely to engage in dangerous or  		risky behaviors.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. LIABILITY RISK OF FISCAL AGENTS</a></h2>
<p> The role of fiscal agents (also called fiscal intermediaries) in the  		Cash and Counseling programs, and in similar consumer-directed personal  		assistance programs that use fiscal agents, is limited. Private agencies that  		contract with a state or county to provide such services have a correspondingly  		limited risk of liability. The primary function of a fiscal agent (FA) is to  		issue paychecks to workers based on time sheets prepared and submitted by the  		consumer, after calculating all required payroll deductions.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note244">244</a></font></sup> If the FA fails to pay the  		worker, or makes a mistake in the amount of payment to the worker, this could  		result in claims of liability both by the consumer (under either a tort theory  		or a contract theory) and by the worker (under a tort theory), especially if  		the missing or incorrect payment results in the loss of the worker's services.  		These are claims based on direct corporate liability. However, as we explain in  		<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.A">Section III.A</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.B">Section  		III.B</a> below, any such claims would encounter significant legal obstacles  		and problems of proof and, thus, pose minimal risk to agencies that act as  		fiscal agents.</p>
<p> Another possible source of liability is failure to detect overspending  		or other misuse of the consumer's allowance (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.C">Section  		III.C</a>). In some consumer-directed personal assistance programs, fiscal  		agents are responsible for monitoring time sheets for problems, such as  		services in excess of a consumer's cash allowance, and reporting any such  		problems or discrepancies either to the consultant who advises the consumer or  		to the state or county agency administering the program. Although simple errors  		in monitoring should not give rise to liability, negligence or failure to  		adhere to the ordinary standard of care in conducting such monitoring could  		result in liability. However, a consumer who brings a legal action alleging  		that the fiscal agent was negligent in monitoring problems is likely to have  		great difficulty proving that any compensable harm resulted. Fiscal agents can  		also protect themselves from such liability, and from liability for nonpayment  		and other errors, by implementing an effective quality management  		program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note245">245</a></font></sup></p>
<p> A third possible source of liability arises from state adult protective  		services laws (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.D">Section III.D</a>). If a fiscal agent  		becomes aware that the consumer is a victim of abuse or exploitation, the  		fiscal agent may be legally obligated to report such abuse or exploitation and  		potentially liable for criminal and civil penalties if the FA fails to do so.  		Because it is quite easy to comply with the reporting requirements in state APS  		laws, here, too, there is little real risk of liability.</p>
<p> It should be noted that consumers in the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration were given the option of calculating and submitting payroll  		deductions themselves, rather than using the services of the fiscal  		agent.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note246">246</a></font></sup> In such  		cases, the liability risks discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.A">Section  		III.A</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.B">Section III.B</a> would not apply, and it  		is less likely that the fiscal agent would have information regarding abuse or  		neglect that would require the fiscal agent to file a report with adult  		protective services. However, in states where the fiscal agent has monitoring  		responsibilities, the analysis in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.C">Section III.C</a>  		would still apply.</p>
<p> Fiscal agents may also be concerned that they could be deemed the  		worker's employer and therefore vicariously liable for the worker's torts. In  		<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.D">Section V.D</a>, which addresses the issue of whether the  		state can be considered the worker's employer, we explain that under the Cash  		and Counseling model, the consumer (or the consumer's representative) is  		clearly the managing employer of the worker, and that it is unlikely that any  		other person or entity would be found to be the employer for purposes of tort  		liability. This is because neither the state nor the fiscal agent exercises  		control over the worker, such as the right to hire, fire, assign and schedule  		tasks, or supervise the daily work of the worker. For purposes of employee tax  		and benefit obligations, the federal Internal Revenue Service recognizes that  		in this situation, the Medicaid recipient and/or his or her representative is  		the employer, and that the fiscal agent acts only as the employer's  		agent.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note247">247</a></font></sup> Fiscal  		agents are therefore very unlikely to be vicariously liable for torts committed  		by workers, although they could face significant penalties if they fail to  		comply with their obligations under IRS regulations.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note248">248</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Finally, the fact that some fiscal agents are the conduit for large  		sums of money obviously creates the potential for fraud. However, because the  		potential for such fraud in CDPAS is not unique or different in character from  		other situations in which a private agency disburses Medicaid or other  		government funds, we do not discuss this as a separate basis for liability.  		</p>
<p> With regard to the potential tort claims against fiscal agents, it is  		important to note that not only is the risk of liability limited, but the  		amount of damages a consumer or worker is likely to be able to recover is also  		very limited. This makes it unlikely that a consumer or worker will find it  		worthwhile to pursue a legal action against a fiscal agent. Perhaps for this  		reason, there are no reported cases involving claims against a fiscal agent by  		either consumers or workers. Because of this absence of reported decisions, the  		discussion of possible claims that follows is necessarily based on predictions  		about how courts might apply general principles of tort and contract law and is  		much more speculative than the analysis in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII">Section II</a>.  		</p>
<p> Although fiscal agents do not have a significant risk of liability,  		there are steps a fiscal agent may wish to take to further reduce its potential  		exposure to lawsuits. In addition to implementing a quality management program,  		the fiscal agent can obtain liability insurance to provide protection against  		the possibility of a large claim. To protect against claims resulting from loss  		of a worker's services, the fiscal agent might also seek assurances from the  		county or state agency that administers the CDPAS program that effective  		procedures are in place to ensure that consumers prepare and maintain an  		adequate back-up plan.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.A" id="sectionIII.A">A. Potential Liability to  		Consumers for Breach of Contract</a></h3>
<p> It is probably inevitable that even a well run fiscal services agency  		will occasionally fail to issue a payment to a worker or underpay a  		worker.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note249">249</a></font></sup> The most  		likely result of any such error is a telephone call from the consumer or the  		worker (or the consumer's consultant, after being contacted by the consumer  		about the problem) and prompt correction of the error by the fiscal  		agent.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note250">250</a></font></sup> However, if  		the error is not corrected quickly and the worker terminates services to the  		consumer as a result, and if the loss of services results in serious injury to  		the consumer,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note251">251</a></font></sup> the  		consumer may in theory bring a breach of contract action against the fiscal  		agent.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note252">252</a></font></sup></p>
<p> However, there are serious legal obstacles to such a lawsuit. A breach  		of contract claim would be based on the agreement between the consumer and the  		fiscal agent that the fiscal agent will provide payroll services in exchange  		for a payment to be deducted from the consumer's cash allowance.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note253">253</a></font></sup> If the fiscal agent has indeed made a  		mistake and failed to pay the worker, there would be no difficulty proving a  		breach of the contract, but there would be considerable difficulty proving that  		the fiscal agent is legally responsible for the injuries to the consumer. The  		damages the consumer would seek -- damages to compensate for injuries caused by  		the worker's failure to work -- are consequential or special damages for breach  		of contract, defined as damages that "are claimed to result as a secondary  		consequence of the defendant's nonperformance."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note254">254</a></font></sup> Such damages are available only when  		certain specific conditions are met. Two of these conditions would be extremely  		difficult to meet: (1) the breach of contract must be the cause in fact of the  		damages;<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note255">255</a></font></sup> and (2)  		the harm to the plaintiff must be "shown to be within in the contemplation of  		the parties at the time the contract was made."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note256">256</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Plaintiffs in the Cash and Counseling program, and in other  		consumer-directed personal assistance programs that require the consumer to  		develop emergency "back-up plans" as an essential component of the  		program,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note257">257</a></font></sup> are likely  		to encounter considerable difficulty proving causation. The purpose of such a  		"back-up plan" is to provide uninterrupted care on the inevitable occasions  		when a worker will fail to work as scheduled -- because the worker is sick, has  		car trouble, quits without notice, or for any other reason. If the consumer has  		developed a sound back-up plan, someone will be available to fill the gap  		caused by the loss of the worker's services. If a consumer suffers an injury  		after a worker quits work, the immediate cause is arguably the failed back-up  		plan. In this context, a court is likely to find that the "cause in fact" of  		the consumer's injury was the failure of the back-up plan, not the fiscal  		agent's failure to pay the worker.</p>
<p> A fiscal agent can also defend a contract claim by arguing that the  		failure of the back-up plan and the resulting injury to the consumer were not  		"within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was  		made."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note258">258</a></font></sup> Under New  		York law, for example, </p>
<blockquote><p> Contemplation can be express or implied. The courts take the  		  "commonsense approach" where contemplation is implied. The commonsense approach  		  involves considering the nature, purpose and particular circumstances known by  		  the parties to determine what the parties intended, and "what liability the  		  defendant fairly may be supposed to have assumed consciously, or to have  		  warranted the plaintiff reasonably to suppose that it assumed, when the  		  contract was made."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note259">259</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the consumer and the fiscal agent almost surely did not expect  		that a worker who was having trouble getting a paycheck would elect to quit  		work (with the result that he or she is out of work), rather than remain on the  		job and attempt to correct the payroll problem with the fiscal agent. The  		consumer and the fiscal agent also undoubtedly did not expect the consumer's  		back-up plan to fail. For this reason too, the consumer is unlikely to prevail  		on a contract claim.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.B" id="sectionIII.B">B. Potential Tort Liability to  		Consumers and Workers for Failure to Pay Worker</a></h3>
<p> Both consumers and workers who suffer injuries in connection with the  		failure of a fiscal agent to issue payments have the option of seeking  		compensation by bringing a tort claim. However, because similar, although not  		identical, concepts of causation and foreseeability as described above also  		apply to tort claims arising from a fiscal agent's failure to pay a worker, any  		such tort claim is unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p> In the case of a claim by a consumer, even if a court found that the  		fiscal agent had a duty of care to the consumer, and that the fiscal agent was  		negligent in performing that duty, the plaintiff consumer would still have to  		establish that the fiscal agent's negligence caused the harm (the serious  		medical injury to the consumer).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note260">260</a></font></sup> The fiscal agent could argue that not one,  		but two intervening causes were responsible for the plaintiff's injury: (1) the  		worker responded to the error in the paycheck by quitting work, rather than  		remaining on the job while trying to get the error corrected; and (2) the  		consumer's back-up plan failed. The test of whether an alleged "intervening  		cause" is sufficient to relieve a defendant of liability is foreseeability:  		"The ultimate inquiry is merely whether the intervening cause is foreseeable or  		whether the injury is within the scope of the risk negligently created by the  		defendant."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note261">261</a></font></sup> If the  		fiscal agent convinces the court that at least one of these "intervening  		causes" was not foreseeable, it will be successful in defeating the negligence  		claim.</p>
<p> Another defense the fiscal agent could assert against the consumer is  		contributory negligence -- that is, that the plaintiff consumer's negligence in  		developing an ineffective back-up plan was at least partially responsible for  		the injury. Although in most states this defense would not completely relieve  		the fiscal agent of liability,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note262">262</a></font></sup> the defense could result in a significant  		reduction of the damage award.</p>
<p> Tort claims by workers are at least as problematical as tort claims by  		consumers. Even assuming the worker can establish that the fiscal agent owed  		the worker a duty of care, which is itself quite problematic,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note263">263</a></font></sup> the worker will have no  		economic incentive to bring such a claim unless the worker has damages that  		extend beyond lost wages. Most, if not all, states have a wage payment law that  		provides a mechanism by which workers can recover lost pay.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note264">264</a></font></sup> Because these laws often  		include provisions for attorney's fees,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note265">265</a></font></sup> enforcement through administrative  		proceedings,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note266">266</a></font></sup> and  		damages and penalties in addition to the lost wages,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note267">267</a></font></sup> including criminal penalties,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note268">268</a></font></sup> they are a very effective  		remedy for workers who seek to recover unpaid wages.</p>
<p> Thus, it will be worthwhile for a worker to file suit only if the  		worker can claim damages above and beyond unpaid wages. It may be that the lost  		pay triggered a series of financial disasters for the worker -- for example,  		the worker was unable to pay the mortgage and lost the family home. But as with  		a claim by a consumer, the worker would encounter difficulty establishing both  		causation and that there was no contributorily negligence. Presumably none of  		the financial disasters would have occurred if the worker had remained on the  		job and persisted in attempts to correct the fiscal agent's error. The fiscal  		agent can argue that the worker was contributorily negligent, and in large part  		responsible for the financial disaster for which damages are claimed, because  		the worker chose to quit employment with the consumer precipitously, before the  		worker had obtained other employment. Similarly, it can be argued that this  		decision, perhaps coupled with other instances of financial mismanagement by  		the worker, was the proximate or legal cause of the worker's catastrophic  		damages.</p>
<p> As an alternative to a claim based on negligence, a consumer or worker  		might allege an intentional tort such as intentional infliction of emotional  		distress.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note269">269</a></font></sup> Here,  		too, the plaintiff is likely to encounter problems proving liability,  		causation,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note270">270</a></font></sup> and  		damages. To establish liability for an intentional tort, the plaintiff must  		prove that the defendant acted intentionally or at least recklessly -- a  		standard a CDPAS consumer or worker is very unlikely to be able to  		meet.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note271">271</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.C" id="sectionIII.C">C. Potential Liability to  		Consumers for Failure to Monitor Expenses and/or Detect Problems</a></h3>
<p> In two of the three Cash and Counseling states, fiscal agents have some  		responsibility for monitoring expenses and detecting problems.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note272">272</a></font></sup> In New Jersey, the fiscal  		agent will not cut checks beyond a consumer's allowance. Moreover, if  		inappropriate requests are made, the fiscal agent alerts the state agency.  		Either the consultant or the state agency staff itself would investigate the  		situation.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note273">273</a></font></sup> In  		Arkansas, where the fiscal agent and consultant functions are performed by the  		same agency, the fiscal agent and consultant both monitor for problems and  		address them at regular meetings. As in New Jersey, the Arkansas fiscal agent  		may not cut checks that exceed a consumer's allowance and will alert the  		consultant to investigate the problem. In isolated instances, a client can  		elect to overspend in one month but if the client does so, the next month's  		allowance would automatically be adjusted to account for the funds. If problems  		persist, the state is notified.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note274">274</a></font></sup></p>
<p> If the fiscal agent has responsibility for monitoring the consumer's  		expenditures, the courts are likely to find that the consumer is owed a duty of  		care.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note275">275</a></font></sup> But  		establishing a duty of care is not the same as establishing liability. In  		Arkansas, if the consumer persists in having problems keeping spending within  		the cash allowance, the consumer can be dis-enrolled from the CDPAS program and  		transferred to traditional agency home care. It is unclear whether  		dis-enrollment would also result from overspending that was belatedly detected  		because of the fiscal agent's negligent monitoring, but even if it did, the  		consumer would still face two major obstacles in any lawsuit against the fiscal  		agent. First, the fiscal agent could argue that the consumer was contributorily  		and, indeed, primarily negligent, because the consumer was responsible for the  		overspending and the fiscal agent was responsible only for failing to detect  		the overspending. Second, it is unclear what damages, if any, the plaintiff can  		prove resulted from removal from the CDPAS program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note276">276</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Alternatively, the consumer might consider bringing a claim for  		negligent infliction of emotional distress against the fiscal agent, but the  		consumer would have considerable difficulty establishing the elements of that  		claim. "Most courts today do allow many recoveries for stand-alone [that is,  		unaccompanied by personal injury] emotional harm," if "the defendant was  		negligent and emotional harm was foreseeable and caused in fact by his  		negligence."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note277">277</a></font></sup>  		However, "most courts [also] hold that a plaintiff can recover only if a  		normally constituted person would suffer, and the plaintiff in fact suffered  		severe distress."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note278">278</a></font></sup>  		Even if a plaintiff could convince the court that for a normally constituted  		disabled person, dis-enrollment from a consumer-directed personal assistance  		services program results in serious damage to the disabled person's sense of  		control and autonomy, causing severe and foreseeable distress, many states have  		adopted additional restrictions on such claims which would make success  		unlikely.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note279">279</a></font></sup> In  		addition, in at least some states, the consumer's contributory negligence could  		be a defense to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional  		distress.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note280">280</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Finally, as a government contractor, the fiscal agent could try to  		establish entitlement to an immunity defense. In some circumstances,  		governmental "immunity from liability is shared by private parties who contract  		with the public body for performance of public work."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note281">281</a></font></sup> Although this immunity has most typically  		been applied to companies that manufacture products for the government in  		accordance with government specifications,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note282">282</a></font></sup> or that construct buildings, highways and  		other public works,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note283">283</a></font></sup>  		more recently some state courts have extended this derivative immunity to  		professionals who provide services under contract to the government.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note284">284</a></font></sup> However, even in states that  		recognize such immunity, it is available only for allegedly negligent acts that  		resulted from a contractor's compliance with specifications mandated by the  		contracting government agency.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note285">285</a></font></sup> Because it is highly unlikely that an  		injury to the consumer resulted from the fiscal agent's compliance with  		government specifications regarding precisely how the fiscal agent should  		perform its monitoring duties or avoid overpayments, this defense almost  		certainly will not be available to an fiscal agent who is sued for failure to  		monitor expenses or detect problems.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note286">286</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.D" id="sectionIII.D">D. Potential Liability Under  		State Adult Protective Services Laws</a></h3>
<p> It is possible that a fiscal agent will become aware that the consumer  		is being abused or neglected, particularly if the abuse is financial in  		nature<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note287">287</a></font></sup> and being  		inflicted by a worker, a family member, or the consumer's authorized  		representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note288">288</a></font></sup> If  		the fiscal agent is operating in one of the seventeen states that require "any  		person" to report suspected abuse,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note289">289</a></font></sup> the fiscal agent must report the suspected  		abuse and may risk significant civil and criminal penalties if it fails to do  		so. In the states that do not provide for universal mandatory reporting, but,  		instead, list occupational categories which are required to report, the  		categories typically listed in the statutes -- medical professionals, social  		workers, public safety employees and the like -- are unlikely to cover  		employees who work for a fiscal services agency. However, because there are  		exceptions,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note290">290</a></font></sup> and  		because state APS laws are frequently amended, fiscal agents should check the  		laws in their states to determine whether they are subject to a mandatory  		reporting requirement.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note291">291</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="sectionIV" id="sectionIV">IV. LIABILITY RISK OF CONSULTANTS</a></h2>
<p> One of the distinctive features of the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration during its experimental phase was the use of private agencies and  		individuals to advise and guide the consumer through the process of developing  		a spending plan and hiring, training and supervising CDPAS workers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note292">292</a></font></sup> Consultants also have primary  		responsibility for monitoring the consumer's experience in consumer-directed  		care. The state typically retains the responsibility for deciding whether  		applicants are eligible to participate in the program and for approving the  		care plans that are translated into the consumers' monthly cash  		allowances.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note293">293</a></font></sup> In  		Arkansas and New Jersey, these services are provided by consultants<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note294">294</a></font></sup> employed by private agencies  		that contract with the state<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note295">295</a></font></sup> to provide consultant services. Florida  		contracts with both agencies and individuals to serve as consultants.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note296">296</a></font></sup> Because the consultants'  		responsibilities are so critical to the program, consultants face the greatest  		liability risk of any of the individuals and entities involved in  		consumer-directed care -- the risk of liability is proportionate to the scope  		of the responsibilities assigned to consultants. These responsibilities  		typically include the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The consultant helps determine whether an authorized representative  			 is needed and participates to varying degrees in the selection of an authorized  			 representative, where the consumer is unable to direct the consumer's care or  			 if the consumer elects not to do so. If the consultant fails to obtain the  			 consumer's designation of a representative where one is needed, or if the  			 representative fails to act in the consumer's interest (for example, by  			 ignoring care problems or misusing the consumer's cash allowance), and injury  			 to the consumer results, the consumer may consider a damage action alleging  			 that the consultant was negligent (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.A">Section  			 IV.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consultant helps the consumer develop an acceptable written plan  			 for spending the cash allowance, including a back-up plan. If an injury results  			 from a defect in the spending plan or the back-up plan, the consumer may  			 consider suing the consultant for: negligent authorization of a spending plan  			 that provides for inadequate care or services; negligent failure to include in  			 the plan services that the consumer contended were necessary; or negligent  			 failure to help the consumer develop an adequate back-up plan (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.B">Section IV.B</a>). Whether the state ultimately may be  			 liable for negligent approval of a plan is discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section V.E</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consultant is responsible for advising the consumer about  			 hiring, training and supervising CDPAS workers. If a consumer is subsequently  			 injured by an incompetent worker, the consumer may claim that the consultant  			 was negligent in performing these tasks and that the consultant is therefore  			 liable for the consumer's injuries (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.C">Section  			 IV.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consultants are responsible for monitoring consumer  			 satisfaction, safety, and use of funds through initial home visits, telephone  			 calls, reviews of receipts and worker's time sheets, and periodic  			 reassessments, and for initiating action to correct problems where necessary.  			 If the consultant is not conscientious in the performance of these  			 responsibilities, and the consumer is injured as a result of inadequate care,  			 the consumer could assert a claim for negligent failure to detect or report the  			 inadequacy of services provided by the care worker (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.D">Section IV.D</a>). </p>
</li>
</ul><p> The above scenarios are all based on theories of direct liability. The  		role of the consultant in assisting in the development of a services plan and  		monitoring that plan could theoretically give rise to a claim that the  		consultant is the <em>de facto</em> employer of the worker and, thus,  		vicariously liable for any injury negligently caused by the worker. However,  		the limited case law, such as the <em>Reeder</em> case discussed below,  		suggests that the likelihood of success of such a claim is quite low, as long  		as the consumer retains the key employer functions of hiring/firing, assigning  		and scheduling tasks, and supervising care.</p>
<p> Finally, in addition to the consultant's responsibility for monitoring  		safety as part of the consumer-directed care program, the consultant may also  		have a legal responsibility under the state's adult protective services law to  		report abuse or neglect of the consumer (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.E">Section  		IV.E</a>).</p>
<p> Despite the broad scope and importance of the consultant's role in  		consumer-directed care, the liability risk can be minimized by taking the  		following steps:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The extent and limitations of the consultant's functions can be  			 clearly communicated to the consumer and well documented. The role is quite  			 different and more limited than that of a case manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consultant should be careful to follow all written procedures or  			 instructions regarding the consultant's activities and should perform all his  			 or her responsibilities conscientiously and with reasonable care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the consultant can and should answer questions and  			 facilitate decision-making by presenting options, it is also advisable to make  			 it clear that it is the role of the consumer, not the consultant, to make all  			 decisions regarding the consumer's care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the consultant believes a consumer's decision is not just unwise  			 but potentially dangerous (for example, a decision regarding the spending plan  			 or the hiring of a particular worker), the consultant can communicate the  			 concern to the consumer, while making it clear that the consultant is only  			 giving the consumer advice and that the decision is ultimately the consumer's.  			 If the consumer disagrees with the consultant's advice, the consultant should  			 document the fact that the advice was given and that the consumer elected to  			 disregard that advice. Of course, if the consumer's or representative's actions  			 indicate an inability to self-manage care, then the assessment process for  			 determining eligibility for the program can be re-applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies and individuals that provide consultant services should  			 consider carrying general liability insurance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> Taking care to follow all written procedures or instructions is  		particularly important because a court may look to those procedures or  		instructions as providing the relevant standard of care in a negligence  		action.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note297">297</a></font></sup><em>Caulfield v. Kitsap County</em>, a case discussed in greater detail in  		<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.D">Section IV.D</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.C">Section  		V.C</a>, illustrates this point.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note298">298</a></font></sup> In <em>Caulfield</em>, a county was found  		liable for negligence in supervising the home care provided to a severely  		disabled consumer. Among other arguments, the plaintiff cited language in the  		interagency agreement between the county and the state department of social and  		health services as support for his claims. The court noted that the interagency  		agreement "incorporates the Aging and Adult Services Field Manual, which  		enumerates minimum requirements for COPES [the home care program] case  		managers. <em>The contract thus provides evidence of the reasonable standard of  		care for caseworkers managing COPES in-home placements.</em>"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note299">299</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Similarly, in the Cash and Counseling states, training manuals for  		consultants and contractual agreements between the states and consultants  		contain statements that can be cited as evidence of the standard of care. For  		example, Florida has issued a document entitled "Guidelines for Consultants"  		that describes how consultants should handle problems and when and how they  		should intervene. Consultants are given directions on how to develop a  		"corrective action plan."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note300">300</a></font></sup> Florida's "Quality Management Plan"  		provides that the consultant "approves" both the spending plan and the back-up  		plan. The document specifically states that "the consultant fulfills a  		monitoring role for the state to ensure that the CDC allowance is used to meet  		the long-term care needs of the consumer and to assure the needs of a  		vulnerable population are met."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note301">301</a></font></sup></p>
<p> On the other hand, program documents may also contain statements that  		can be helpful to a consultant in defending a claim of negligence, particularly  		where they clearly define rules and expectations. For example, the agreement  		that must be signed by both the consumer and the consultant in Florida lists  		the respective responsibilities of each party. The consumer's responsibilities  		include: "write a purchasing plan;" "train workers about their job duties and  		what you expect from them;" and "contact your consultant if you have concerns  		about something, so small problems don't become big problems." The consultant's  		responsibilities to the consumer include: "provide training;" "review... [the]  		purchasing plan and backup plan;" and "review... monthly budget reports from  		the project bookkeeper." The agreement also lists "What the Consultant will  		<em>not do</em>," including "interview, hire, train or supervise your workers;"  		"find back-up or emergency workers;" and "write your purchasing  		plan."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note302">302</a></font></sup></p>
<p> In sum, although the responsibilities of the consultants are critical  		to the success of consumer-directed care, the risk of liability can be  		minimized by clearly defining roles and following agreed upon procedures.  		Concerns about liability should not deter agencies and individuals from serving  		as consultants.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note303">303</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionIV.A" id="sectionIV.A">A. Negligent Designation of an  		Authorized Representative</a></h3>
<p> The procedures for appointment of an authorized representative create  		potential liability issues for both the states and consultants. In each of the  		three Cash and Counseling states, the state has elected to adopt relatively  		informal criteria and procedures for the selection of representatives. The  		procedures that are in place in Arkansas and New Jersey suggest that these  		states view the appointment of a representative as the consumer's right and  		responsibility and the role of the consultant as merely to explain and document  		the process. However, because the procedures in all three states are so  		informal, the consultant may, in fact, play a significant role, at least in  		some cases, which creates the risk that a consultant may be sued for negligence  		in connection with the designation of, or the failure to designate, a  		representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note304">304</a></font></sup> The  		procedures in each of the three states can be briefly described as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In Arkansas, "[t]he question of who to select as a representative  			 was usually settled informally,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note305">305</a></font></sup> and the final report on implementation of  			 the Cash and Counseling Demonstration concluded that "[t]here was no need in  			 Arkansas for a formal process to determine the need for a representative or  			 identify one."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note306">306</a></font></sup>  			 Although the state has not adopted formal criteria and procedures to determine  			 whether a representative is needed and, if so, who should serve in that  			 capacity, the state does use two forms in connection with the designation. The  			 first form, the "IndependentChoices Designation of Authorized Representative,"  			 is signed by both the consumer and the representative and authorizes the  			 representative to "use the IndependentChoices monthly allowance to purchase the  			 services and items to meet my personal care needs as listed on the Cash  			 Expenditure Plan and... assure that all items purchased and services received  			 with the IndependentChoices allowance are paid."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note307">307</a></font></sup> In addition, the representative must  			 review a list of "representative requirements" and then complete and sign the  			 "IndependentChoices Representative Screening Questionnaire."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note308">308</a></font></sup> [See copy at  			 <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#appendD">Appendix D</a>.] The representative is designated and the  			 forms are usually completed under the supervision of the consultant.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note309">309</a></font></sup> These procedures all add  			 helpful clarity and deliberateness to the designation of a representative by a  			 consumer. In addition, as a safeguard, the contracts between the state and the  			 two agencies that provide consultant services require the agencies to engage in  			 more intensive monitoring when a representative has been designated.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note310">310</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, in New Jersey, "[u]sually the choice of a person to serve  			 as representative was obvious and grew out of the current relationships of the  			 consumer." Like Arkansas, New Jersey formalizes the process to the extent of  			 using "Designation of Authorized Representative" and "Representative Screening  			 Questionnaire" forms that are similar to those in Arkansas.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note311">311</a></font></sup> [See copy at  			 <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#appendD">Appendix D</a>.] However, the primary purpose of this  			 questionnaire is apparently to help the prospective representatives decide  			 "whether they wish[ ] to undertake this role,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note312">312</a></font></sup> as is reflected in the state's description  			 of "Procedures for establishment of an authorized representative:"</p>
<blockquote><p> When a consultant determines that a representative is necessary  				for a participant to be successful, and the participant agrees, the potential  				representative will be given the <em>Representative Description</em> to review.  				The consultant will interview the potential representative and complete the  				<em>Representative Screening Questionnaire.</em> If the potential  				representative volunteers to serve, then the <em>Designation of Authorized  				Representative Form </em>will be signed and witnessed. A copy will be  				maintained in the participant file and the original forwarded to the State  				Program Office.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note313">313</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Florida does not use a representative screening questionnaire.  			 Instead:</p>
<blockquote><p> Initially, the consultant determines the desirability/necessity  				for a representative with input from the caregiver, the case manager, the case  				file and his or her personal observations. A caregiver or other person who is a  				potential representative attends the enrollment presentation and, if indicated  				and the individual agrees, his or her name is entered on the application as the  				consumer's representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note314">314</a></font></sup> The consumer has the right to appeal the  				consultant's appointment of a representative to the state.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note315">315</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p> The consultant's involvement in the selection of an authorized  		representative is a matter of concern because of the potential for situations  		in which a representative is negligent in performing his or her  		responsibilities or otherwise fails to act in the consumer's best interest. In  		these situations, who is responsible for any resulting injury? For example, the  		representative's negligence may result in inadequate care by a worker that  		causes serious injury or damage to the consumer's health; the representative  		may intentionally misuse the consumer's allowance, also resulting in inadequate  		care and injury to the consumer; or the consultant may fail to secure the  		consumer's designation of a representative, even though one is needed. In each  		of these situations, the consumer may bring an action to seek compensation from  		the consultant, especially if the consultant is employed by an agency that is  		perceived as a "deeper pocket" than the representative, based on the claim that  		the consultant was negligent in investigating or approving the selection of the  		representative.</p>
<p> If the representative is the parent of a consumer who is a minor, or is  		the guardian of or holds a power of attorney from a consumer who lacks mental  		capacity, the representative will already have a legal relationship to the  		consumer that sanctions decision-making on the consumer's behalf by the  		representative. In such situations, there should be no basis for a claim that  		the consultant was negligent in approving the appointment of the  		representative. There also should be no potential liability if the consumer has  		capacity to direct his or her own services, but nevertheless elects to  		designate a representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note316">316</a></font></sup> If the consumer's designation later proves  		to be unwise and the consumer suffers injury as a result, the consultant should  		be able to defend against any potential claim of liability by pointing out that  		he or she acted consistent with the philosophy of consumer-directed care by  		honoring the consumer's wishes, as long as the consumer's wishes were clearly  		expressed and documented.</p>
<p> The situation is quite different, however, in the case of a mentally or  		developmentally disabled consumer who may lack the capacity to designate a  		representative and who does not already have a legal surrogate in place. In  		these situations, the designation of a representative will determine who will  		have control over the development of the spending plan and the hiring, training  		and supervision of care workers.</p>
<p> There are no reported decisions in which a consultant or case manager  		has been sued in connection with the investigation or designation of a  		representative. However, cases alleging negligence in the placement of foster  		children provide an analogy, albeit imperfect. In foster care placement, as in  		designation of a representative, the state is making a critical decision  		regarding who will supervise the care of an extremely vulnerable citizen.  		Although most of the reported decisions regarding foster care placement have  		focused on issues of governmental immunity, there are a significant number of  		cases in which "the evidence of negligence by the placing agency established  		governmental tort liability or... the allegations of negligence were sufficient  		to state a cause of action against the government."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note317">317</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Thus, for example, in <em>Bartels v. County of Westchester,</em> the  		appellate court upheld a trial court's refusal to dismiss an action brought by  		a child who alleged that she had been "severely scalded as a result of the  		unfitness and carelessness of [her] foster parents in bathing her."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note318">318</a></font></sup> The plaintiff's allegations  		included the charge that "the county acted negligently in the selection of  		foster parents."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note319">319</a></font></sup> In  		upholding the trial court, the appellate court held that the county was  		"required to exercise due care in the selection of foster parents and to  		oversee diligently the rendition of proper care by the foster  		parents."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note320">320</a></font></sup></p>
<p> These cases and general principles of negligence law suggest that a  		court may well find that a consultant owes a duty of care in the investigation  		and selection of a representative. Therefore, if a plaintiff can prove that a  		consultant failed to adequately investigate the qualifications of a  		representative, or that the consultant approved selection of a representative  		who the consultant had reason to know was not qualified, there is a real risk  		that the consultant will be found liable for injuries caused by the  		representative. To avoid such liability, states should consider adopting  		procedures similar to those we describe in the next section of the report (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.B">Section V.B</a>), which discusses the state's potential  		liability for failure to adopt adequate criteria and procedures for the  		selection of a representative.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIV.B" id="sectionIV.B">B. Negligent Assistance in the  		Development of the Spending Plan and Back-up Plan</a></h3>
<p> Another important responsibility of the consultants is to assist  		consumers in developing a spending plan and a back-up plan. Although most of  		the consumer's cash allowance typically is used to pay wages to CDPAS workers,  		consumers have the discretion to spend part of their allowance on a variety of  		goods and services that enable them to function more independently, such as  		equipment (for example, a micro-wave oven to heat pre-cooked meals) and home  		modifications (for example, installation of grab bars in the  		bathroom).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note321">321</a></font></sup> Within  		the constraints of that allowance, consumers also have discretion in setting  		the pay rate and scheduling the hours worked by workers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note322">322</a></font></sup> An essential tenet of consumer-directed  		personal assistance services is that the consumer is the expert on the  		consumer's care needs, so the consultant's role in this aspect of the program  		is necessarily limited to advising the consumer regarding options for  		structuring the spending plan and the back-up plan.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note323">323</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The consultant also has the primary responsibility for approving  		standard spending plans. In Arkansas, the state prepared a list of goods and  		services clearly covered by the cash benefit. "If all the uses of the cash were  		in the list of approved uses, the counselor could approve the cash  		plan."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note324">324</a></font></sup> Although  		during the demonstration, New Jersey required state approval of the plan, "[a]s  		of early 2003,... [t]he consultants would be allowed to approve spending plans  		that contained only items on a pre-specified list developed by the state based  		on its experience in the demonstration."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note325">325</a></font></sup> In Florida, consultants initially approve  		spending plans for all categories of consumers (elderly consumers,  		developmentally disabled consumers, physically disabled adults, and consumers  		with traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries), and final approval by the state  		is required only for some categories of consumers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note326">326</a></font></sup></p>
<p> If an injury results from an alleged defect in the spending plan or the  		back-up plan, it is conceivable that the consumer might sue the consultant  		claiming that the consumer received inadequate or incorrect advice. Because the  		consumer is the ultimate decision-maker regarding the spending plan and the  		back-up plan, a consumer would have some difficulty in proving that a defect in  		the plan was the fault of the consultant, rather than the consumer,  		<em>unless</em> the consultant either failed to alert the consumer to a clear  		defect or failed to provide the consumer with any advice at all.</p>
<p> There are no reported cases involving such claims against consultants  		in consumer-directed care. However, the following two lawsuits against case  		managers responsible for overseeing medical care in connection with a workers'  		compensation claim suggest that the consumer would need to prove that the  		consultant's negligence caused <em>additional </em>injury (that is, injury in  		addition to the medical condition(s) that created the need for CDPAS) in order  		to establish liability:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Case manager misdirects medical care</strong>. In <em>Vakos  			 v. Travelers Insurance,</em> an injured employee sued his employer's worker's  			 compensation carrier, a medical management service company, and the medical  			 case manager who handled his case, alleging that their negligence in directing  			 him and advising him regarding his medical care caused additional  			 injuries.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note327">327</a></font></sup> The  			 plaintiff alleged that the medical case manager did not approve the chronic  			 pain management program recommended by the plaintiff's doctor because it was  			 "too costly," but she failed to recommend another more cost effective  			 program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note328">328</a></font></sup> The trial  			 court dismissed the claim, finding that the suit was barred by the state  			 workers' compensation law, but the appellate court reversed, noting that "[t]he  			 acts of negligence [alleged by the plaintiff] were committed subsequent to and  			 independent of the original injury" and allegedly occurred as a result of the  			 defendant's negligent direction of the plaintiff's medical treatment.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note329">329</a></font></sup> The case was remanded for  			 trial, but to prevail at trial the plaintiff would have to prove both that the  			 defendants were negligent and that their negligence caused injuries <em>in  			 addition to </em>the injury for which he was receiving workers' compensation.  			 Similarly, a claimant against a CDPAS consultant would have to prove both that  			 the consultant was negligent and that the consultant's negligence caused  			 injuries in addition to the medical conditions for which the consumer was  			 already receiving care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rehabilitation consultant urges premature return to  			 work</strong>. In <em>Gilchrist v. Trail King Industries,</em> an injured  			 employee who was receiving workers' compensation sued his employer and the  			 consultant hired to oversee his rehabilitation, claiming bad faith (that is, a  			 violation of an insurer's duty of good faith and fair dealing) and intentional  			 infliction of emotional distress.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note330">330</a></font></sup> Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that  			 the rehabilitation consultant had "'hounded [his doctor] for an appropriate  			 work release which was then used to terminate [him] from his job while he was  			 still convalescing. This sent him spiraling downward emotionally and  			 psychologically.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note331">331</a></font></sup>  			 Like the court in <em>Vakos, </em>the Supreme Court of North Dakota held both  			 that the rehabilitation consultant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff and that  			 the plaintiff "must show that the consultant caused some additional  			 injury."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note332">332</a></font></sup> The court  			 found that the consultant had not caused additional injuries to the plaintiff  			 because the state Department of Labor had concluded that he was "totally  			 disabled and entitled to continued disability payments as a result of his work  			 related depression."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note333">333</a></font></sup> In addition, the court rejected the  			 plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because he  			 had not alleged the "extreme and outrageous" conduct which is an element of the  			 tort.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note334">334</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> It is quite possible to envision circumstances in which approval of an  		inadequate spending plan or back-up plan could result in additional injury. For  		example, if the consumer is left unattended because the back-plan fails, and  		the consumer (who otherwise needs assistance) tries to get to the bathroom  		alone, but falls and breaks a hip, the consumer could claim that the inadequate  		back-up plan caused the injury. To minimize the liability risk to consultants,  		state agencies should consider providing clear guidance regarding the  		circumstances in which consultants are authorized to override a consumer's  		preference and withhold approval from spending plans and back-up plans that  		they believe are inadequate. State agencies should also consider developing  		clear and explicit minimum criteria for the approval of such plans, thus  		reducing the consultant's discretion and the attendant risk of liability.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIV.C" id="sectionIV.C">C. Negligent Assistance in Hiring,  		Training and Supervising Workers</a></h3>
<p> Consultants are also responsible for assisting consumers in the hiring,  		training and supervision of workers. The typical Medicaid recipient does not  		have experience as an employer, so the consultant's advice, assistance, and  		training can be critical in determining whether the consumer is able to hire  		satisfactory workers and receive the full benefit of consumer-directed personal  		assistance services. The experience in CDPAS has been that most of the workers  		hired are family and friends,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note335">335</a></font></sup> which reduces the risk of negligent care  		or financial exploitation by the worker. However, if the worker does injure or  		exploit the consumer, the consumer may claim that the consultant is liable  		because the consultant was negligent in assisting the consumer with the process  		of hiring, training and supervising the worker.</p>
<p> However, as with the spending plan, the consumer is the ultimate  		decision-maker regarding the hiring and supervision of workers. As long as that  		expectation is made clear and agreed to by the consumer, the consumer would  		have difficulty proving that it was the consultant's negligence, rather than  		the consumer's unwise decision-making, that caused the injury (and, at a  		minimum, the consultant would have a contributory negligence defense). The  		consultant is unlikely to be held liable unless the consultant failed to follow  		required procedures (for example, the consultant failed to advise the consumer  		of the availability of a criminal background check, and a worker with a  		criminal record subsequently financially exploited the consumer)<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note336">336</a></font></sup> or failed to provide any assistance at  		all.</p>
<p> The only reported decision involving a claim of negligence in the  		hiring of a CDPAS worker suggests the difficulty of convincing a court that a  		consultant or state caseworker was negligent:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Who is responsible for negligent personal care aide</strong>?  		  In <em>Reeder v. State of Nebraska</em>, Randy Reeder, a consumer who had  		  become paralyzed as a result of an automobile accident, located and hired Sheri  		  Perales, a licensed practical nurse, to provide home care for him pursuant to  		  the Nebraska's Aged and Disabled Medicaid Waiver program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note337">337</a></font></sup> As required for workers hired  		  directly by consumers, rather than chosen off a list of potential workers  		  maintained by the state Department of Social Services ("DSS"), "Perales  		  completed the documentation necessary to be approved by DSS as Medicaid service  		  provider in the capacities of personal care aide (PCA) and LPN."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note338">338</a></font></sup> After Perales had been  		  providing care for Reeder for about two months, he developed decubitis ulcers  		  on his feet.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note339">339</a></font></sup>  		  Although Reeder consulted a podiatrist and Perales followed the podiatrist's  		  treatment orders, the ulcers did not heal properly and Reeder's feet became  		  infected.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note340">340</a></font></sup> As a  		  result, "Reeder underwent a lengthy period of hospitalization and treatment"  		  and faced the possibility that it would be necessary to amputate his  		  feet.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note341">341</a></font></sup> Reeder filed  		  suit against the state of Nebraska based on two theories of liability: "first,  		  Perales was an employee of DSS, and DSS was vicariously liable for her  		  negligence under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior</em>; or,  		  alternatively, DSS breached an independent duty to select and train a nurse who  		  was competent to provide the services required by Reeder."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note342">342</a></font></sup> On appeal of the trial  		  court's decision granting summary judgment on both theories to the state, the  		  Nebraska Supreme Court reversed and remanded for trial the issue of whether  		  Perales was an employee of the state or an independent contractor,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note343">343</a></font></sup> but it sustained the trial  		  court's rejection of Reeder's argument that, "DSS 'had a separate, independent,  		  and non-delegable duty to supply Reeder with a care provider fully capable of  		  meeting all his daily nursing needs.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note344">344</a></font></sup> The supreme court disagreed with Reeder's  		  contention that provisions in state law authorizing financial support for  		  disabled persons created such a duty:<br /><blockquote>
<p> [T]he statutory requirement that DSS review needs of aid  				recipients and develop standards for determining qualified programs is related  				to a statutory duty to provide compensation for health services, not a duty to  				provide the actual services. DSS caseworkers who serve clients receiving public  				assistance are not licensed health care professionals and are not authorized to  				make medical judgments. The fact that they maintain periodic contact with  				clients who receive health care benefits pursuant to the act and maintain a  				general interest in their welfare does not, in our judgment, amount to an  				undertaking to qualitatively access or intervene in health care provided to the  				clients.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note345">345</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p> Although <em>Reeder</em> could also be characterized as a case in which  		the plaintiff alleged negligent monitoring, an issue which we discuss in the  		next section, Reeder's legal claim was that the state had breached a  		"non-delegable duty to select and train a nurse who was competent to provide  		the services" he required.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note346">346</a></font></sup> By holding that the state was liable only  		if it had notice that Perales was providing deficient care, the court implied  		that the state could not be liable simply because it delegated the hiring  		decision to Reeder and did not second-guess that decision. In other words, the  		consequences of a bad hiring decision are the responsibility of the consumer,  		not the state or its caseworkers.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIV.D" id="sectionIV.D">D. Negligent Monitoring</a></h3>
<p> In each of the three Cash and Counseling states, consultants are  		responsible for monitoring program quality for individuals and initiating  		action to correct problems identified in the course of monitoring.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note347">347</a></font></sup> As a result, the consultant  		is the individual who has the most frequent contact with a participant, and  		indeed, is likely to be the only CDPAS program official who has the opportunity  		to observe the consumer in the home and assess whether the spending plan and  		the workers selected by the consumer are delivering adequate care. Contracts  		and/or training manuals in each state specify the frequency of home visits and  		telephone calls by the consultant.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note348">348</a></font></sup> Especially in the case of consumers whose  		physical and/or mental disabilities have diminished their capacity to  		self-advocate regarding inadequate care, the consultant's failure to make these  		contacts or to detect and take action to correct problems may well result in  		liability. This potential for liability is graphically illustrated by the  		decision in <em>Caulfield v. Kitsap County, </em>discussed below.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note349">349</a></font></sup> Although much of the opinion  		deals with whether the defendant county was immune from liability under the  		public duty doctrine,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note350">350</a></font></sup> the holding in the case, that state and  		county caseworkers owed a duty of care to a severely disabled patient who was  		receiving home care, has significant implications for private agencies and  		individuals who contract to provide consultant services in consumer-directed  		personal assistance services. </p>
<p> In general, a defendant does not owe a duty to protect the plaintiff by  		controlling the conduct of a third person and thereby preventing harm to the  		plaintiff.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note351">351</a></font></sup> As set  		forth in Section 315(b) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, there is an  		exception to this rule in the case of a "special relationship" between the  		defendant and the plaintiff:</p>
<blockquote><p> There is no duty to control the conduct of a third person so as to  		  prevent him from causing physical injury to another unless:</p>
<p> (b) a special relationship exists between the actor and the other  		  which gives to the other a right to protection.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note352">352</a></font></sup></p>

<ul><li>
<p><strong>Case managers and the question of a "special  			 relationship"</strong>. In <em>Caulfield v. Kitsap County</em>, the Court of  			 Appeals of Washington held that the county had such a special relationship with  			 the plaintiff and owed him a corresponding duty of care. In Washington, the  			 state's Department of Social and Health Services provided disabled persons with  			 personal care from an in-home caregiver through the COPES program, a federally  			 funded program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note353">353</a></font></sup> The  			 plaintiff, who suffered from multiple sclerosis and needed 24 hour care, had  			 lived in a nursing facility until his DSHS caseworker arranged for his transfer  			 to in-home care and hired a worker to care for him.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note354">354</a></font></sup> The caseworker failed to  			 visit the plaintiff for more than a month after his transfer to home care,  			 despite assurances that she would continue to be his caseworker, and when she  			 did finally visit the plaintiff, she observed major changes in his condition  			 and heard his complaints about his caregiver.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note355">355</a></font></sup> Pursuant to an interagency agreement  			 between DSHS and Kitsap County, the DSHS caseworker transferred the case the  			 next day to a county social worker who noted that there were problems that  			 needed "immediate attention."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note356">356</a></font></sup> Nonetheless, the county social worker did  			 not promptly contact or visit the consumer.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note357">357</a></font></sup> Eight days later, the worker called the  			 county social worker because he was concerned about the consumer's condition,  			 and the social worker told him to call 9ll.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note358">358</a></font></sup> Upon admission to the hospital, the  			 plaintiff was suffering from: </p>
<blockquote><p> urosepsis, pneumonia, saline depletion, contractures, was  				malnourished, suffered severe weight loss, and had severe bed sores that had  				cut through his flesh to his bone. And even though Caulfield had Multiple  				Sclerosis, he previously had some ability to function at levels that allowed an  				appreciable amount of independence and freedom. But because of the above  				conditions, he lost most of the ability to function with any  				independence.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note359">359</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> At trial, the jury returned a verdict finding that the county,  			 DSHS, and the worker were negligent and proximately caused consumer's injuries,  			 and apportioned damages totaling $2,626.707.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note360">360</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The main issue on appeal was the county's claim that as a  			 government agency, it owed no duty to the plaintiff under the public duty  			 doctrine. However, the court's reasoning in holding that the county did, in  			 fact, owe a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff would have equal force in  			 an action against a private agency or individual with responsibility for  			 monitoring the care of a child or vulnerable adult:</p>
<blockquote><p> Caulfield's relationship with his County case manager involved an  				element of "entrustment" by virtue of the dependent and protective nature of  				the relationship. Caulfield's case file showed that he could not get out of bed  				and could not reach the telephone for assistance. Given Caulfield's inability  				to take care of himself, the case manager's responsibility for establishing and  				monitoring his in-home service care plan took on great significance. COPES case  				managers were responsible for establishing Caulfield's service plans,  				monitoring his care, and providing crisis management, including terminating  				in-home care if it was inadequate to meet his needs. And the case managers were  				required to make assessment visits. This responsibility gave rise to a duty to  				protect Caulfield and other similarly vulnerable clients from the tortious acts  				of others, especially when a case manager knows or should know that serious  				neglect is occurring. This duty is limited by the ordinary care a case manager  				would take in similar situations and by the concept of  				foreseeability.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note361">361</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p> Although the result in <em>Caulfield </em>may appear to conflict with  		the decision of the Nebraska Supreme Court in <em>Reeder</em>,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note362">362</a></font></sup> the difference can be  		explained by the contrasting findings of the two courts regarding the role of  		the caseworker. In <em>Reeder</em>, the court concluded that the caseworker's  		role was limited, despite the fact that the state agency had considerable  		involvement in approving the care plan, approving the worker, and monitoring  		services. It found that the program under which the caseworkers performed these  		functions established a duty "to provide compensation for health services, not  		a duty to provide the actual services."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note363">363</a></font></sup> Thus, the fact that caseworkers "maintain  		periodic contact with clients who receive health care benefits pursuant to the  		act and maintain a general interest in their welfare does not... amount to an  		undertaking to qualitatively assess or intervene in health care provided to the  		clients."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note364">364</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The nature of the caseworker's role is also directly influenced by the  		level of dependence and functioning of the consumer. Reeder had hired his own  		worker, Reeder was apparently quite able to monitor the quality of his care,  		and the state apparently had no reason to believe the worker was not providing  		adequate care. In contrast, in <em>Caulfield,</em> the caseworker knew the  		consumer needed 24-hour care and was unable to make telephone calls or  		otherwise instigate complaints about his care. The caseworker had in fact  		initiated the transfer to consumer-directed care, had hired the care provider,  		and was aware of the serious threat to Caulfield's health. The transfer of  		responsibility to a county level caseworker, per program procedures, did not  		cause a break in this duty. Put another way, the caseworkers' roles in the two  		cases were defined differently by their programs' policies and procedures, and  		the caseworkers assumed differing responsibilities in fact. The risk of  		liability follows function, and function is defined both by program policies  		and procedures and by actual operation, which need to be consistent. </p>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling states, consultants are clearly assigned  		responsibility for monitoring client safety, as reflected in contracts,  		training manuals, and other documents. However, the extent of case monitoring  		can have many levels of intensity, so it is especially important that the  		limited scope of the monitoring role be spelled out clearly in program  		policies, communicated to the consumer in an understandable way, and  		implemented consistent with program policies. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionIV.E" id="sectionIV.E">E. Liability under State APS  		Laws</a></h3>
<p> Because of their frequent contact with consumers, including home  		visits, consultants are in a very good position to detect abuse, neglect or  		exploitation (hereinafter referred to collectively as "abuse") of the consumer  		by a worker, consumer's representative, family member, or anyone else who has  		regular contact with the consumer. Depending on the state, consultants may have  		the obligation to report such abuse under either the state APS law<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note365">365</a></font></sup> or the consultant's contract  		with the state, or both, and failure to report can result in liability.</p>
<p> If the consultant works in one of the seventeen states that require  		"any person" to report suspected abuse,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note366">366</a></font></sup> the consultant must report the suspected  		abuse and may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for  		failure to do so. In the states that do not provide for universal mandatory  		reporting, but, instead, list occupational categories that are required to  		report, some of the categories listed in the statutes are likely to cover  		consultants. For example, some consultants may be trained social workers and  		many states list "social workers" as mandatory reporters, although these states  		do not specify whether this requirement applies only to individuals who  		currently work as social workers or to anyone with training as a social  		worker.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note367">367</a></font></sup> Other  		states have general categories that are likely to be interpreted as covering  		consultants -- these states include Ohio ("senior service provider");<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note368">368</a></font></sup> West Virginia ("social  		service worker");<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note369">369</a></font></sup>  		Minnesota ("a professional or professional's delegate while engaged in...  		social services");<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note370">370</a></font></sup>  		Maryland ("human service worker");<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note371">371</a></font></sup> and Nebraska ("human services professional  		or paraprofessional").<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note372">372</a></font></sup> Consultants should therefore check the  		laws in their states to determine whether they are subject to a mandatory  		reporting requirement.</p>
<p> Consultants may also be required to report suspected abuse under the  		internal policies of the consumer-directed personal assistance services  		program. In Arkansas, for example, both state law and the contracts between the  		state and the two agencies that provide consultant and fiscal agent services  		require the agencies to report suspected abuse. The Arkansas mandatory  		reporting law applies to "any social worker," "a case manager," and "a case  		worker."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note373">373</a></font></sup> The  		contracts provide that the agencies must:</p>
<blockquote><p> Demonstrate an effective plan to detect abuse, neglect and  		  exploitation and report those instances immediately to DHS -- Adult Protective  		  Services. According to Arkansas Criminal Law 5-28-203, Counseling/Fiscal Agency  		  counselors are considered persons required to report abuse.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note374">374</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Consultants should therefore be careful to check both the laws in their  		states and all contracts and other documents describing their responsibilities  		to determine whether they are subject to a mandatory reporting requirement.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionV" id="sectionV">V. LIABILITY RISK FOR STATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT  		ENTITIES</a></h2>
<p> States that sponsor Medicaid consumer-directed personal assistance  		services programs, particularly programs structured like the Cash and  		Counseling Demonstration, face comparatively little exposure to liability as  		long as the state maintains a relatively limited role. This is because many, if  		not most, of the functions that are performed by the state<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note375">375</a></font></sup> in connection with  		traditional Medicaid-funded home care services are transferred to consumers,  		fiscal agents and consultants. Two functions retained by the state --  		determination of eligibility for Medicaid and determination of the level of  		care and services to be provided to the consumer -- are program eligibility  		functions and not unique to consumer-directed personal assistance services, and  		we therefore do not address potential liability in connection with these  		functions. </p>
<p> There are, however, three functions that are performed by the state, or  		by contractors for the state, that present some risk of liability to the state  		itself:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In the three Cash and Counseling demonstration states, the states do  			 not screen applicants to determine whether the applicant is a suitable  			 candidate for consumer-directed personal assistance services. If the state  			 fails to obtain the consumer's consent and agreement to participate in the  			 program (or the agreement of a legal surrogate or authorized representative of  			 a consumer who lacks capacity), and the consumer suffers injury because the  			 consumer is unable to manage his or her care, the state may be liable for  			 negligence (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.A">Section V.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Cash and Counseling states, consultants have been given  			 considerable discretion in the designation or validation of an authorized  			 representative, as discussed in the previous section. The state also bears some  			 risk. If the consultant designates or recognizes a representative who fails to  			 provide adequate care for the consumer, and the consumer is injured as a  			 result, the consumer could claim that the injury was caused by the state's  			 failure to protect the consumer by adopting adequate criteria and procedures  			 for appointment of a representative. The failure to adopt adequate criteria or  			 procedures could be a basis for finding direct negligence and/or a denial of  			 due process (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.B">Section V.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state usually has some responsibility for resolving serious  			 problems that arise in consumer-directed personal assistance services, although  			 the consultants perform this function, at least initially, on the front lines.  			 Nevertheless, to the extent that the state itself gets involved in monitoring  			 and problem resolution, it could be held directly liable if it fails to take  			 appropriate action and the consumer is injured as a result (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.C">Section V.C</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p> We also discuss two other situations in which the state could be sued,  		even though under the Cash and Counseling structure, the risk of liability in  		these situations should be small:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Claims of liability on the grounds that the state is, <em>de  			 facto</em>, the employer of the CDPAS worker. Such claims can take two forms:  			 that the state is liable for on the job injuries to the worker; and that the  			 state is liable on a <em>respondeat superior</em> theory of liability for torts  			 committed by the worker in the course of employment (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.D">Section V.D</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claims of liability for torts committed by the consultant or fiscal  			 agent, either because the consultant or fiscal agent was acting as the employee  			 of the state, rather than an independent contractor, or because the consultant  			 or fiscal agent was executing a nondelegable duty of the state (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p> Finally, although under the Cash and Counseling Demonstration, the  		state did not have responsibility for providing back-up care to the consumer  		(it is the consumer's responsibility to develop the back-up plan), the Section  		1115 and the Section 1915(c) waiver templates developed as part of the  		Independence Plus initiative of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  		take a different approach.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note376">376</a></font></sup> In addition to individual back-up plans,  		the waiver templates require that state programs have "a viable system in place  		for assuring emergency backup and emergency response capability in the event  		those providers of services and supports essential to the individual's health  		and welfare are not available."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note377">377</a></font></sup> The liability risks associated with this  		requirement are discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.F">Section V.F</a>.</p>
<p> A threshold question in any tort claim against the state or its  		officials is whether the claim is barred by governmental immunity. The rules  		regarding governmental immunity vary from state to state and even within a  		state depending on whether the defendant is the state itself, a unit of local  		government, or a government employee or official. In addition, in some states  		immunity is a matter of common law; in other states, common law principles have  		been supplanted by a tort claims act or similar legislation; and in yet other  		states immunity is a determined by a combination of common and statutory law.  		</p>
<p> For this reason, it is impossible to address in this report whether a  		claim would be barred by the governmental immunity law of a particular state.  		However, the following brief summary of governmental immunity law provides some  		guidance and will be referred to in our discussion of specific potential claims  		against the state.</p>
<p><strong><em>State Immunity</em></strong></p>
<p> Historically, with the exception of certain claims under federal law,  		the states enjoyed complete "sovereign immunity" from suit.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note378">378</a></font></sup> However, "[a]lmost all states  		have now enacted tort claims statutes waiving the blanket common law immunity  		of the state and its agencies."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note379">379</a></font></sup> Although some claims are permitted under  		these statutes, others are not. In some states, "discretionary," but not  		"ministerial," decisions are immune from suit.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note380">380</a></font></sup> However, many courts hold that where the  		discretion that is exercised involves a decision that can be judged under a  		professional standard of care, discretionary function immunity does not  		apply.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note381">381</a></font></sup> "Essentially  		the same idea is expressed by saying that the discretionary immunity only  		applies when a high degree of discretion is required and when it is applied,  		not merely to routine matters but to 'basic policy decisions.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note382">382</a></font></sup> For example, in <em>Nakahira  		v. State of Hawaii</em>, the plaintiff conceded that the decision of the Hawaii  		Army National Guard to adopt a program to train non-aviator personnel to  		conduct ground "run-ups" of helicopters was a discretionary policy decision,  		but he successfully argued that implementation of training of the non-military  		personnel was not discretionary and therefore was not immune from  		suit.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note383">383</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Other states "utilize the distinction between planning and operational  		decisions, limiting immunity to cases of 'planning' and excluding it for actual  		operations or execution of decisions."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note384">384</a></font></sup> Examples of planning activities include  		"the assessment of competing priorities, weighing of budgetary considerations,  		[and] allocation of scarce resources."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note385">385</a></font></sup> In addition, many states follow the public  		duty doctrine, which holds that "when a state statute imposes upon a public  		entity a duty to the public at large, and not a duty to a particular class of  		individuals, the duty is not one enforceable in tort."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note386">386</a></font></sup> The most common is example is that there  		is no liability for failure of the police to prevent or stop a crime because  		the duty of the police is to the public at large.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note387">387</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Local Public Entity Immunity</em></strong></p>
<p> At common law, municipalities were not considered sovereigns and  		therefore did not enjoy sovereign immunity.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note388">388</a></font></sup> However, the courts adopted a rule  		distinguishing between "governmental" and "proprietary" functions of the  		municipality, holding that only torts committed in connection with the latter  		were subject to suit.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note389">389</a></font></sup> For example, in a negligence action  		brought by a plaintiff who was injured when he attempted to dive into a gravel  		pit lake excavated upon land in a public park, the court held that although the  		operation of the park was a governmental activity, the government's activities  		in connection with operation of the gravel pit were proprietary and therefore  		were not immune from suit.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note390">390</a></font></sup> As with sovereign immunity, many states  		have now adopted statutes that modify the common law rules regarding local  		public entity immunity.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note391">391</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>State and Local Officers and Employees</em></strong></p>
<p> Both state legislatures and state courts have developed immunity rules  		for officers and employees of public entities. The general rule is that  		officers and employees are given qualified immunity for discretionary acts (for  		example, "evaluating reports or employees' performances or deciding upon parole  		release"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note392">392</a></font></sup>), but not  		for ministerial acts (for example, "driving cars, posting warning signs, or  		moving office furniture"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note393">393</a></font></sup>). "The discretionary immunity is qualified  		or conditional because it is usually lost if the officer is guilty of bad  		faith, malice, corruption, wanton misconduct or the like."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note394">394</a></font></sup> Under some state statutes,  		"the employee is simply immune to claims for negligence committed within the  		scope of his employment."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note395">395</a></font></sup> State statutes may also provide that "the  		public entity must or may defend the employee who is sued for acts committed  		within the scope of his employment," and that "the public entity may be  		permitted or required to indemnify the employee if he is held  		liable."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note396">396</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Finally, it should be noted that if a state is concerned about  		potential liability in connection with its consumer-directed personal  		assistance services program, the state has the option of enacting legislation  		clarifying the extent to which functions and decisions regarding CDPAS are  		either immune from or subject to challenge.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note397">397</a></font></sup> This is the approach taken by California  		in its In-Home Supportive Services Program, discussed in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI.A">Section VI.A</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionV.A" id="sectionV.A">A. Failure to Obtain the Consumer's  		Clear Agreement to Participate in CDPAS</a></h3>
<p> In each of the three Cash and Counseling states, the state decided not  		to screen otherwise eligible participants (that is, participants who qualified  		for traditional agency provided personal assistance services) to determine  		whether the consumer would be able to manage the cash allowance and hire and  		supervise the consumer's personal assistant(s).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note398">398</a></font></sup> Instead, the states relied on  		"self-screening" by potential participants.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note399">399</a></font></sup> Athough practical considerations entered  		into this decision, such as the fact that the availability of a representative  		made possible the participation of consumers who were not capable of  		self-directing their care,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note400">400</a></font></sup> there was also a concern about possible  		liability. An attorney involved in the Arkansas program advised "that a  		structured process that denied participation might not be legally defensible.  		If the process was not legally defensible and the consumer chose to contest  		exclusion from the program, a state might be held liable for such  		exclusion."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note401">401</a></font></sup></p>
<p> However, states should fare well in litigation challenging exclusion  		from the program. The primary form of redress for consumers who disagree with  		any such determination is through the Medicaid appeals process, which may  		result in injunctive relief but not a damage award. Moreover, although personal  		injury and a claim for damages might result from wrongful <em>inclusion</em> in  		a CDPAS program, such injury would not result from wrongful <em>exclusion.</em>  		</p>
<p> In addition, even if the plaintiff is able to assert a claim under  		state law, a court is likely to defer to the state's decision that a particular  		consumer is not an appropriate candidate for consumer-directed personal  		assistance services: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Medical judgment</strong>. For example, in <em>Couch v.  			 Visiting Home Care Service of Ocean County</em>, the Appellate Division of the  			 New Jersey Superior Court upheld the county health department's refusal to  			 continue providing home care services to the plaintiff.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note402">402</a></font></sup> Both the county, and a home care agency  			 which had been providing intermittent nursing services to him, had terminated  			 their services because they believed the plaintiff needed more intensive care  			 than they were able to provide.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note403">403</a></font></sup> The trial court entered an order requiring  			 continuation of the services, and the county and the agency appealed.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note404">404</a></font></sup> On appeal, the county pointed  			 "to the well recognized principle that actions of a public body, particularly  			 within its field of expertise, are entitled to a presumption of  			 validity."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note405">405</a></font></sup> However,  			 the appellate court was "persuaded that the real issue is the right of these  			 medical providers to withdraw from a case when in their professional opinion it  			 would be improper and unsafe to continue,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note406">406</a></font></sup> thus apparently viewing the county's  			 decision as a medical decision, rather than a benefit eligibility decision. The  			 appellate court ruled that if on remand the county and the agency still wished  			 to withdraw their services, they should be permitted to do so.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note407">407</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> On the other hand, there may be a greater risk of liability for  		<em>including</em> a consumer who either is not a suitable candidate for  		consumer-directed personal assistance services or lacks the capacity to make a  		choice about participation in CDPAS.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note408">408</a></font></sup> An example of this kind of scenario might  		involve a consumer participant in the program who is injured during the course  		of care and then claims that, had he known the true extent of risk and  		responsibility to be incurred, he (or his authorized representative) would  		never have agreed to participation in the program. Experience to date suggests  		that this is an unlikely scenario, but nevertheless possible. </p>
<p> The decision to participate in CDPAS definitely results in exposure to  		a particular set of risks and responsibilities. To protect the state from  		liability and preserve the defense that the consumer knowingly assumed the  		risks associated with CDPAS, it essential that that either the consumer (or the  		consumer's properly designated legal surrogate or representative, in the case  		of a consumer who lacks capacity<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note409">409</a></font></sup>) agree to participation in CDPAS.  		Agreement to participate involves three elements: </p>
<ol><li>
<p>The consumer's choice to participate is voluntary. To ensure that  			 decisions is truly voluntary, it is important to preserve the availability of  			 traditional agency care as an option so that consumers are not pressured into  			 enrolling or continuing in a consumer-directed personal assistance services  			 program, even though CDPAS may be inappropriate or has become inappropriate. If  			 traditional agency care is not an option, consumers will fear, with reason,  			 that the only alternative to CDPAS is nursing home care, and they will be much  			 more inclined to remain in CDPAS situations that place their health and  			 well-being at risk. If choices do not "include the option <em>not</em> to  			 direct one's own care," "it can be argued that the policy of consumer-directed  			 care translates into a non-bargained for arrangement,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note410">410</a></font></sup> and that the consumer's decision to  			 participate was not voluntary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consumer is adequately informed about relevant information  			 regarding the decision to participate in CDPAS (that is, all information needed  			 to make a voluntary and intelligent decision). Most programs do this orally and  			 in writing. A simple two-page agreement spelling out the respective  			 responsibilities of the consumer and consultant in the Florida program is  			 included at <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>. Florida also provides consumers  			 with a much more extensive "Consumer Notebook" that is used by consultants to  			 train participants about the details of the program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note411">411</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consumer has the capacity to understand the relevant information  			 and make a choice.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note412">412</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ol><p> If the state undertakes the responsibility for verifying the  		individual's agreement to participate and not the responsibility for screening  		for the appropriateness of the consumer's ability to self-direct, it is less  		likely to be found liable for a failure to screen someone who should have been  		found unsuitable. This approach is also consistent with the right of a person  		with disability to opt for consumer-directed services, even if using such  		services may present a greater risk to the consumer than either traditional  		agency care or care in a nursing home.</p>
<p> Finally, regardless of whether the state decides to screen CDPAS  		applicants, it is critical that the state adopt and follow an effective program  		of monitoring, which is the ultimate safety net for the program. The state will  		then be in a position to argue that by engaging in reasonable monitoring, the  		state has satisfied any duty it may have to make sure the consumer can safely  		participate in the program. Such monitoring will also protect the state by  		promptly alerting the state to situations in which action (which may include  		removal from the program) needs to be taken to prevent injury to the  		consumer.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionV.B" id="sectionV.B">B. Failure to Adopt Adequate  		Criteria and Procedures for Selection of an Authorized Representative</a></h3>
<p> As described in greater detail in the previous section (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.A">Section IV.A</a>), each of the original Cash and Counseling  		states elected to adopt relatively informal criteria and procedures for the  		selection of representatives. The lack of more formal criteria and procedures  		for the designation of a representatives does not raise significant liability  		concerns (1) where the consumer has the capacity to designate the  		representative<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note413">413</a></font></sup> and  		is given the relevant information to make an informed decision about whether  		and who to appoint as the representative, or (2) if a guardian or other legal  		surrogate (for example, a parent in the case of a minor) is already in place.  		However, if the consumer does not have such capacity,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note414">414</a></font></sup> and the representative who is designated  		mismanages the consumer's care,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note415">415</a></font></sup> there is the potential for the claim that  		the state is liable because it failed to adopt more formal criteria and  		safeguards that would have ensured appointment of an appropriate  		representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note416">416</a></font></sup>  		Although none of the states have yet experienced problems with their relatively  		informal processes of representative selection, it is certainly possible that a  		representative could engage in negligence or misconduct that results in injury  		to a consumer. The consumer may then elect to pursue claims against both the  		consultant <em>and</em> the state.</p>
<p> Essentially, the consumer will argue that the state was negligent in  		adopting criteria and procedures for the designation of a representative that  		did not adequately protect the consumer. However, in most states, such a claim  		may be barred by governmental immunity because the decision to follow  		relatively informal procedures for the selection of a representative is  		arguably discretionary -- in other words, it is precisely the kind of policy  		decision that the governmental immunity is intended to protect from second  		guessing by the courts in negligence actions.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note417">417</a></font></sup> Because governmental immunity is likely to  		bar a negligence claim, a consumer might consider a claim under the United  		States Constitution, which would not be barred by state sovereign  		immunity.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note418">418</a></font></sup> The  		numerous decisions involving successful challenges to state guardianship  		procedures as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  		suggest the potential for similar challenges to the criteria and procedures for  		appointment of a representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note419">419</a></font></sup> Appointment of a representative, like  		guardianship, is a legal mechanism for substitute decision-making, although the  		consequences of appointment of a representative for personal assistance  		services are certainly less far-reaching. </p>
<p> As a practical matter, an award of money damages in a constitutionally  		based action is unlikely. These actions are typically brought to change a  		practice that adversely affects a class of people. The usual remedy sought is  		injunctive and/or declaratory relief invalidating a policy or procedure -- in  		this case, the procedures regarding the selection of representatives. To avoid  		such a challenge, states may want to consider taking some or all of the  		following steps:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>If a consumer does have capacity to designate an authorized  			 representative, procedures that utilize a representative screening  			 questionnaire and a designation of representative form, similar to those in  			 effect in Arkansas and New Jersey, should be sufficient to protect the  			 consumer's interests. The Arkansas and New Jersey screening and designation of  			 representative forms are included at <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#appendD">Appendix D</a> and  			 <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#appendE">Appendix E</a>, respectively. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even where the consumer clearly has capacity, it would be prudent to  			 have the consumer make an advance designation of a representative to serve if  			 and when needed. This would protect against the possibility that the consumer  			 subsequently loses capacity but is able to continue in CDPAS with the  			 assistance of a representative. Any such designation should be reviewed and  			 renewed periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the consumer has questionable capacity to designate an authorized  			 representative, the state should consider specifying the following procedures  			 for cases in which there is no prior designation by the consumer and a legal  			 surrogate is not in place: </p>
<ul><li>Require an assessment by the consultant or other professional  				that the consumer lacks capacity both to self-direct the consumer's care and to  				designate an authorized representative. A standard assessment tool should be  				developed and validated. Such a tool would focus on relevant functions (for  				example, Can the consumer give directions? Can the consumer review and sign a  				time sheet?).</li>
<li>If the state has a statute that designates a default surrogate  				for medical decision-making, that surrogate can be designated as the  				representative, unless the consultant knows of contraindications.</li>
<li>The consultant should assess reasonably available  				representatives. Relevant screening questions that the Cash and Counseling  				states already use include: Is the candidate willing? What is the candidate's  				relationship to the consumer? Does the candidate have any prior experience  				taking care of the consumer? Does the candidate understand the duties and  				responsibilities of a representative? Based on this information, the consultant  				should determine whether the candidate has demonstrated his or her ability and  				willingness to act as the representative. Candidates who are not selected may  				be provided with a right of appeal to the state.</li>
<li>The state should require heightened monitoring for consumers  				whose care is being directed by a representative, as is currently the practice  				in Arkansas.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note420">420</a></font></sup></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionV.C" id="sectionV.C">C. Negligent Response to Problem or  		Complaint Regarding Consumer's Care</a></h3>
<p> Although in each of the three Cash and Counseling states, consultants  		have the primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of consumer care,  		the state may become involved with serious allegations of abuse, exploitation,  		inadequate care or other problems. In New Jersey, "[w]hen a consultant reported  		that something might be amiss, the state Personal Preference office referred  		the case to a Medicaid nurse, who visited the home to make an  		assessment."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note421">421</a></font></sup> The  		state Personal Preference office then reviewed the nurse's report of the  		assessment.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note422">422</a></font></sup> "If it  		concluded that neglect or exploitation was likely, the case was referred to  		Adult Protective Services, and the consumer was disenrolled from Personal  		Preference and returned to traditional PCA [personal care assistance] if  		appropriate."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note423">423</a></font></sup>  		Similar state oversight procedures were adopted in Arkansas<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note424">424</a></font></sup> and in Florida.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note425">425</a></font></sup></p>
<p> These oversight procedures have the potential to result in liability if  		the state is not careful to take prompt and effective remedial action whenever  		it becomes aware of a serious problem.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note426">426</a></font></sup> As elsewhere, the reality is that  		liability risk follows function, and the entity that assumes the function of  		investigating and evaluating problems of abuse or inadequacy of care also  		assumes the risk of liability for failure to take effective remedial action.  		The decision in <em>Caulfield v. Kitsap County</em>, a case that is described  		in detail in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.D">Section IV.D</a> <em>supra</em>,  		graphically illustrates the harm and potential liability that can result from  		ignoring a serious complaint or problem in connection with consumer-directed  		personal assistance services.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note427">427</a></font></sup> In <em>Caulfield, </em>both state and  		county caseworkers failed to respond to information that indicated that a  		Medicaid recipient's home care worker was not providing adequate care and that  		the recipient's health was rapidly deteriorating. As a result, Caulfield  		sustained serious injuries, and a jury ultimately awarded him substantial  		damages. </p>
<p> In terms of state liability, the case is particularly significant  		because the appellate court rejected the government defendants' arguments that  		they were immune from liability under the public duty doctrine.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note428">428</a></font></sup> The court noted that  		Caulfield's suit was barred by the public duty doctrine unless he could "show  		that 'the duty breached was owed to the injured person as an individual and was  		not merely the breach of an obligation owed to the public in general (i.e., a  		duty to all is a duty to no one).'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note429">429</a></font></sup> If a case falls within an exception to the  		public duty doctrine, the government will be found to owe a duty of care to the  		plaintiff.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note430">430</a></font></sup> Under  		Washington state law, the "special relationship" exception to the public duty  		doctrine applies where "(1) there is direct contact or privity [a legal term  		for mutuality of interest] between the governmental agency and the plaintiff  		'which sets the latter apart from the general public, and (2) there are express  		assurances given by a public official [or agency], which (3) gives rise to  		justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff.'"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note431">431</a></font></sup> The court found that Caulfield's case fit  		these criteria "because (1) there was direct contact or privity between the  		DSHS [Department of Social and Health Services] and Caulfield which set  		Caulfield apart from the general public, and (2) there were express assurances  		given by DSHS caseworker, including case management and crisis intervention,  		which (3) gave rise to justifiable reliance by Caulfield through his acceptance  		of the case manager's detailed duties."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note432">432</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Several factors are likely to determine whether a court would follow  		the <em>Caulfield</em> case in a negligence action against a state program  		modeled on the Cash and Counseling Demonstration. The first is the state's  		immunity law, including whether the state follows the public duty doctrine and  		the extent to which the state recognizes exceptions to the public duty  		doctrine. The second is whether the court would see both the consultant and the  		state, or just the consultant alone, as having had direct contacts with the  		consumer, including assurances of "case management and crisis intervention,"  		which "gave rise to justifiable reliance" by the consumer. The third is the  		specific facts in the case. In <em>Caulfield</em>, the government's negligence  		was blatant, Caulfield was totally dependent on care, and the consequences to  		Caulfield were catastrophic. Facts as dramatic as these frequently influence a  		court's determination of legal issues relating to liability.</p>
<p> Because the risk of liability is uncertain, state programs would be  		well-advised to adopt procedures to ensure timely and effective intervention  		whenever a serious problem is reported to or comes to the attention of the  		state.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionV.D" id="sectionV.D">D. Liability as Alleged Employer of  		Worker</a></h3>
<p> At the inception of the Cash and Counseling program, one of the  		perceived advantages of the program's structure was that "the likelihood of  		successful liability actions against the state (and costly settlements) might  		be reduced because it was not the employer of record."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note433">433</a></font></sup> There are two kinds of tort claims that  		could potentially be asserted against the state as the alleged employer of a  		worker. The first is liability for injuries to the worker during the course of  		employment, which typically take the form of a claim against the state for  		workers' compensation. The second is <em>respondeat superior</em> liability  		(i.e., vicarious liability) for torts committed by the worker during the course  		of employment that result in injury to the consumer or to a third  		person.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note434">434</a></font></sup></p>
<p> By carefully structuring and documenting the consumer-worker employment  		relationship, the Cash and Counseling states have minimized the likelihood of a  		credible claim that the state, rather than consumer, is the worker's employer,  		or even that the state is the joint employer of the worker for purposes of  		personal injury liability.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note435">435</a></font></sup> The precise standard used to determine the  		existence of an employment relationship can vary depending on the context  		(e.g., a claim for worker's compensation, an allegation of a violation of the  		federal Fair Labor Standards Act, etc.), but the central issue, in general  		terms, is always whether the alleged employer exercises control over the  		employee.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note436">436</a></font></sup> Indicia  		that an employment relationship exists include, for example, the "right to  		discharge the employee, payment of regular wages, taxes, workers' compensation  		insurance and the like, long-term or permanent employment, and detailed  		supervision of the work."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note437">437</a></font></sup> With respect to personal assistance  		services, there is no question that an employment relationship exists. Rather,  		the question is between whom -- is the worker employed by the consumer, by the  		agency that oversees the program, or by both? </p>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model the state has no direct contact with  		the worker (although persons other than the consumer, such as the consultant,  		fiscal agent, and authorized representative, may have some involvement in  		employer functions), and therefore none of these indicia are likely to  		apply.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note438">438</a></font></sup> The cases  		discussed below support the conclusion that the state has a low risk of  		employer liability in a program structured like the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration. These cases analyze whether an employer-employee relationship  		exists under differing laws, so it is important to recall that the criteria for  		such a relationship varies depending on the specific law or type of legal  		action involved. Nevertheless, all address variations on the question of who  		controls, and, thus, all are instructive in the context of tort liability.</p>

</ul><p> Several cases have considered the employment status of workers in the  		California In-Home Supportive Services ("IHSS") program, a consumer-directed  		personal assistance services program that initially was structured quite  		differently from the Cash and Counseling Demonstration but now has strong  		similarities.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note449">449</a></font></sup> In  		two early decisions, the courts concluded that the state was an employer of the  		workers (for purposes of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and  		eligibility for workers' compensation), whereas in two later cases, the court  		concluded that the Medicaid recipient (i.e., the consumer) was the employer for  		purposes of collective bargaining and for purposes of vicarious liability for  		torts committed by the worker:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In a 1983 decision, <em>Bonnette v. California Health and Welfare  			 Agency</em>, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that  			 state and county public services agencies were "employers" of chore workers for  			 purposes of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note450">450</a></font></sup> Unlike the states in the Cash and  			 Counseling Demonstration, at that time the state and the counties determined  			 the rate of pay for workers and "exercised considerable control over the  			 structure and conditions of employment by making the final determination, after  			 consultation with the recipient, of the number of hours each chore worker would  			 work and exactly what tasks would be performed."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note451">451</a></font></sup></p>

<p>In 1984, in <em>In-Home Supportive Services v. Workers' Compensation  			 Appeals Board</em>, the California Court of Appeal reached a slightly different  			 conclusion. In that case, an IHSS worker sought workers' compensation from the  			 state. The court ruled in the worker's favor based on its finding that the  			 worker was the employee of both the state and the recipient and that the state  			 workers' compensation law recognized such joint employment  			 relationships.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note452">452</a></font></sup> The  			 court's characterization of the employment relationship with the state and the  			 counties reflects a much greater degree of government involvement than in the  			 Cash and Counseling states: </p>
<blockquote><p> This scheme of engagement of individuals by the state, through  				its agents, to perform IHSS services for recipients required by state  				regulations establishes an employment relationship. The individual must do the  				chores listed in the county assessment of need. Payment for these services is  				provided by the state. The county, under the regulatory scheme, has the right  				to sufficient control over the IHSS provider to make the state chargeable, by  				virtue of the agency relationship with the state, as <em>an</em> employer. Even  				where provider payment is made via the recipient the county retains the right  				to change the payment made and thus exercises direct hiring and firing control  				when it discerns that the work the state is paying for is not being performed  				in accordance with the assessment of need.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note453">453</a></font></sup></p>

</li>
</ul><p> These decisions, which are based on established principles of  		employment law, support the conclusion that states sponsoring programs modeled  		on the Cash and Counseling Demonstration are at minimal risk of being deemed  		employers of CDPAS workers, as key control indicia remain in the hands of the  		consumer -- i.e., paychecks issued in the name of the consumer, and the right  		to hire, fire, assign tasks, and supervise the daily work of workers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note459">459</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionV.E" id="sectionV.E">E. Liability for Torts of  		Consultant or Fiscal Agent</a></h3>
<p> There are two theories under which the state might be found liable for  		the negligent acts of consultants and fiscal agents, one based on vicarious  		liability and the other based on the concept of non-delegable duty:</p>
<h4><a name="sectionV.E.1" id="sectionV.E.1">1. Vicarious Liability for  		Consultant or Fiscal Agent's Negligence and Other Tortious Conduct</a></h4>
<p> The theory of vicarious liability would apply where the state contracts  		with an individual to provide consultant or fiscal agent services,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note460">460</a></font></sup> and the individual is found  		to be an employee of the state, rather than an independent contractor. Of  		course, if the state chose to use state agency employees as consultants --  		which states may choose under the "Independence Plus" waiver templates -- then  		vicarious liability would be a fixed reality of the program. However, the three  		demonstration states each used individual or agency contractors during the  		research stage of Cash and Counseling.</p>
<p> With individual consultant contractors, the state intends the  		individual to be an independent contractor. Yet, a court could find that there  		is in fact an employment relationship based on the totality of the facts, in  		which case the state will be vicariously liable for the individual's negligence  		and other tortious conduct. The critical issue for purposes of tort liability  		is whether the state exercises "a right of control over the manner, means, and  		details of the work" of the consultant or fiscal agent.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note461">461</a></font></sup><em>Reeder v. State of  		Nebraska</em>,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note462">462</a></font></sup>  		which is discussed in the preceding section, illustrates the application of  		this test to a home care worker and the importance of structuring the  		relationship so that the consultant or fiscal agent is clearly an independent  		contractor, rather than an employee of the state. </p>
<p> The state can therefore protect itself from vicarious liability by  		carefully drafting its contracts with individuals who provide consultant or  		fiscal agent services. Specifically, the state's contracts with consultants and  		fiscal agents should not include any provision that could be interpreted as  		giving the state the "right to control the manner, means, and details of the  		work."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note463">463</a></font></sup> On the other  		hand, the state can specify in its contract what services the independent  		contractor is to provide, the ultimate outcomes expected, and the general  		parameters for how those services are to be provided. For example, the contract  		can specify that the consultant is to make monthly phone calls to each  		consumer, but not the specific dates or times when these phone calls are to be  		made. Because there is no absolute assurance of a finding of no liability in  		our sometimes unpredictable system of justice, the state can further protect  		itself through the use of indemnity clauses in its contracts with fiscal agents  		and consultants.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note464">464</a></font></sup></p>
<h4><a name="sectionV.E.2" id="sectionV.E.2">2. Liability Based on  		Nondelegable Duty</a></h4>
<p> The state could also be liable if a tortious act is committed by the  		consultant or the fiscal agent while executing a "nondelegable duty" of the  		state. For example, if the state had a nondelegable duty to ensure the safety  		or welfare of a beneficiary, then the state could not escape that duty by  		transferring that function to an independent contractor. </p>
<p> It is possible that the state could be found to have certain  		nondelegable duties to consumers, such as a duty to monitor the quality of  		their care. This, at heart, is a public policy analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p> When courts conclude that as a matter of policy the enterprise should  		  be responsible for the torts of independent contractors who are carrying out  		  the work of the enterprise, they say that the enterprise had a nondelegable  		  duty of care. What they mean by this is that the enterprise cannot discharge  		  its obligation of reasonable care by hiring independent contractors to fulfill  		  it.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note465">465</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The rationale for applying this doctrine to government duties was  		explained as follows by the Court of Appeals of Georgia: </p>
<blockquote><p> It is against the public interest to allow statutorily defined  		  duties, particularly those related to the protection of the health and safety  		  of citizens, to be assigned away by contract in an attempt to relieve the state  		  of liability for any breach of its duties.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note466">466</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note, however, that before a plaintiff could argue  		that a duty was not delegable, the plaintiff would have to establish that the  		state had a duty of care in the first place.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note467">467</a></font></sup></p>
<p> As with many other aspects of tort law, the states vary in how they  		approach this issue. In <em>Hinckley v. Palm Beach County Board of County  		Commissioners, </em>the plaintiffs' developmentally disabled adult daughter had  		been sexually molested by the driver of a bus operated by a company that had  		contracted with the county to provide transportation for mentally disabled  		individuals.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note468">468</a></font></sup> The  		court noted that "developmentally disabled persons are a particularly  		vulnerable population, and when an agency or entity undertakes to provide  		services for them, it stands in a special relationship with them with respect  		to the provision of those services."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note469">469</a></font></sup> This relationship, especially in the  		context of the "many state obligations and responsibilities toward its  		developmentally disabled citizens,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note470">470</a></font></sup> created a duty to protect her from  		foreseeable harm in connection with the county-sponsored transportation  		services. "That duty was nondelegable,"<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note471">471</a></font></sup> and the county therefore could be held  		liable for the negligence of the driver and the bus company. </p>
<p> In contrast, in the only case in which this theory was asserted in the  		context of a Medicaid funded consumer-directed personal assistance services  		program, the court refused to find the state liable -- in the two decisions in  		the <em>Reeder</em> case, both the Nebraska Supreme Court and the Nebraska  		Court of Appeals rejected the nondelegable duty theory and held that the state  		was not vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of Reeder's care  		provider.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note472">472</a></font></sup> As  		described earlier, the plaintiff, an individual paralyzed from the neck down,  		developed serious decubitis ulcers in his heels while being cared for by an LPN  		who had been provided under the state's Medicaid home care waiver program. The  		court relied on statutory provisions setting forth the responsibilities of the  		Department of Social Service (DSS) to find that the agency did not have a  		nondelegable duty to Reeder:</p>
<blockquote><p> We do not read [Nebraska statutes] §§68-1513 and 68-1519 as  		  conferring a duty upon DSS to directly provide or ensure a certain level of  		  nursing care to persons who qualify for public assistance. These sections are  		  included in the Disabled Persons and Family Support Act,... pursuant to which  		  DSS is authorized to provide financial support for equipment and services  		  necessary to assist disabled persons in independent living situations.... Read  		  in this context, the statutory requirement that DSS review needs of aid  		  recipients and develop standards and procedures for determining qualified  		  programs and services is related to a statutory duty to provide compensation  		  for health services, not a duty to provide the actual services.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note473">473</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Thus, whether there is reason to be concerned about potential vicarious  		liability for the negligence of a consultant or fiscal agent will depend on  		several factors: the court's view of the relevant public policy considerations;  		the content of statutes or regulations setting forth the state's  		responsibilities in connection with consumer-directed personal assistance  		services; and the case law in that particular state applying the nondelegable  		duty doctrine. As a practical matter, the vulnerability of the injured person  		influences the analysis heavily. </p>
<p> If a particular state does have reason to believe that it could be held  		liable on a nondelegable duty theory, the state can protect itself by  		negotiating an indemnification clause with the agencies that provide its  		consultant and fiscal agent services. The state of Arkansas has included such  		an indemnification clause in its contracts with the two agencies that provide  		both consultant and fiscal agent services,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note474">474</a></font></sup> and there is legal authority that such  		indemnification clauses do not violate public policy.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note475">475</a></font></sup> However, such clauses will have practical  		value only if the agency providing consultant or fiscal agent services has  		insurance or assets sufficient to indemnify the state for the amount of the  		damages assessed against the state, which could be substantial. As an  		alternative, and also as a matter of sound policy, the state should consider  		protecting itself by adopting oversight and quality management measures  		designed to alert the state to any deficiencies in the performance of the  		agencies with which it contracts.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionV.F" id="sectionV.F">F. Liability for Failure to Provide  		Effective Emergency Back-up Care</a></h3>
<p> During the Cash and Counseling Demonstration, the state did not have  		responsibility for providing back-up care to the consumer. Instead, the  		consumer alone had responsibility for developing an adequate back-up plan,  		although the consumer's consultant actively provided assistance with this  		process. Accordingly, if the back-up plan fails and the consumer suffers an  		injury as a result,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note476">476</a></font></sup>  		there is little liability risk to the state because the state had no role in  		developing back-up plans or in providing back-up care itself.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note477">477</a></font></sup> In other words, the usual  		rule that liability follows function applies.</p>
<p> However, the Section 1115 and the Section 1915(c) waiver templates  		developed in conjunction with the Independence Plus initiative of the Centers  		for Medicare and Medicaid Services require that state programs have:</p>
<blockquote><p> a viable system in place for assuring emergency backup and emergency  		  response capability in the event those providers of services and supports  		  essential to the individual's health and welfare are not available. While  		  emergencies are defined and planned for on an individual basis, the State also  		  has system procedures in place....<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note478">478</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The template does not specify the kind of "system procedures" the state  		must have in place, and states are just beginning to develop plans to comply  		with the requirement. An example of one approach to a statewide system for  		emergency back-up is the plan Florida is considering:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Florida has identified two primary reasons why consumers may need  			 emergency back-up, the failure of CDPAS workers to report for work and natural  			 or man-made disasters. To protect consumers, the state proposes to adopt a  			 multi-layered approach to emergency back-up, using all of the following  			 resources: the consumer's required emergency back-up plan; an informal family  			 and friends network; back-up services provided by an agency or district;  			 resource lists of emergency service providers and facilities available from  			 consultants, area agencies on aging, and district offices; adult and child  			 protective services; the Division of Emergency Management; and 911 for  			 emergency telephone help in critical situations. As part of the statewide plan,  			 consumers who do not currently include an enrolled Medicaid provider agency in  			 their individual emergency back-up plans would be required add an "agency  			 emergency back-up plan."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note479">479</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p> It is important to note that although the method the state chooses to  		fulfill this requirement may affect the likelihood that emergency back-up will  		succeed or fail, and thus affects liability to an extent, the legal analysis is  		the same whatever approach the state chooses. It is clear that this new duty on  		the part of the state creates the potential for liability if back-up fails and  		injury to a consumer results. Moreover, the degree of liability risk is  		considerably greater than for the risks involved in the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>First, the consumer plays no role in developing the system-wide  			 back-up plan, and the state therefore cannot argue in its defense, in the event  			 back-up fails, that the consumer's negligence caused or contributed to the  			 failure of back-up services. The caveat here, of course, would be a case in  			 which the consumer failed to inform or belatedly informed the state agency of  			 the need for back-up services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, the state may be subject to a liability standard that is  			 considerably more stringent than the negligence standard. Under the  			 Independence Plus waiver templates for consumer-directed personal assistance  			 programs, the state is required to "assure" emergency back-up care for  			 consumers. Undertaking a responsibility to "assure" emergency back-up suggests  			 that the state in essence is guaranteeing that emergency back-up care will be  			 available when needed. This sets the bar at a higher standard than the usual  			 duty to exercise reasonable care in developing and implementing an emergency  			 back-up system. Depending on how strictly a court interprets the duty to  			 "assure" emergency back-up, a consumer asserting a claim against the state may  			 not need to prove negligence to establish liability. The state might even be  			 subject to a duty akin to strict liability for injuries caused by the failure  			 of the back-up system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The language creating a duty to "assure" emergency back-up could  			 also be interpreted as creating a nondelegable duty, in which case the state  			 could be liable for the failure of back-up care provided by government or  			 private agencies with which the state has contracted to provide this service.  			 As noted in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section V.E</a>, the concept of nondelegable  			 duty is applied in those cases where a court concludes that as a matter of  			 policy, the government should be responsible for the torts of independent  			 contractors who are carrying out the work of or executing a responsibility of  			 the government. The doctrine is particularly likely to be applied to duties  			 "related to the protection of the health and safety of citizens."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note480">480</a></font></sup> Here, the language of the  			 Medicaid waiver template can be interpreted as creating a non-delegable duty on  			 the part of the state to protect the safety of CDPAS participants by "assuring"  			 that they receive emergency back-up care. Under such an analysis, a state that  			 has arranged to provide back-up through a local or county agency, such as the  			 911 system, or through a private provider, such as a home care agency, would  			 not be able to defend itself by arguing that the other entity's negligence, not  			 the state's, was responsible for the failure of back-up. On the other hand, if  			 the duty to "assure" emergency back-up <em>is</em> delegable, the state may be  			 able to protect itself from liability by contracting out that  			 function.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI.A.3">Section VI.A.3</a> below describes emergency  		back-up provided by public authorities under the California In-Home Supportive  		Services (IHSS) Program. The variations in back-up in that program illustrate a  		continuum of duty, and therefore liability risk, that results from different  		systemic back-up strategies. The approaches range from:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Providing no formal back-up support. The consumer bears  			 responsibility to arrange adequate back-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining of a list of providers available to work on an emergency  			 basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracting with a community home care agency to provide emergency  			 worker replacement 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiring a pool of on-call workers, employed by the public authority,  			 to provide emergency back-up.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The liability risk increases from the first to the last example above.  		In the last example, back-up provided directly by workers employed by the  		public agency itself creates the full risk that any private health care agency  		incurs in providing services. However, the waiver template requirement that the  		agency "assure" emergency back-up appears to set an even higher standard than  		that to which a private health care agency is subject. A private home care  		agency's obligation is one of reasonable care in providing back-up, not  		guaranteeing back-up in every instance. The regulatory language plays a major  		role in setting the bar to which states will be held.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionVI" id="sectionVI">VI. LIABILITY ISSUE VARIATIONS IN OTHER MODELS OF  		CDPAS</a></h2>
<p> The liability analysis up to this point has focused primarily on the  		Cash and Counseling Demonstration. Of course, other models of CDPAS, besides  		Cash and Counseling, exist and face a similar array of liability issues.  		However, differences in structure and operation may make significant  		differences in liability risk, so this section of the report examines two other  		well-established CDPAS programs in order to determine whether and how these  		liability issues affect them differently. As with the Cash and Counseling  		programs, the methodology for this analysis involved review of authorizing law  		and regulations, review of available literature and reports on the two  		programs, and telephone interviews with key contacts from both programs. The  		first program is California's In-Home Supportive Services Program (IHSS); and  		the second, the New York Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program  		(CDPAP).</p>
<h3><a name="sectionVI.A" id="sectionVI.A">A. California In-Home Supportive  		Services Program</a></h3>
<p> California's In-Home Supportive Services Program (IHSS), created in  		1973, is a state-wide, publicly-funded program that provides a broad range of  		personal assistance and related services to low-income consumers who are  		elderly, blind, or living with disabilities. The program is the largest state  		program of its kind in the country, and enrollment numbers have steadily  		increased, as demonstrated by a 38% increase in average caseload numbers from  		1995 to 2001 -- from almost 190,000 to over 262,000.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note481">481</a></font></sup> As of May 2003, enrollment is over  		300,000.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note482">482</a></font></sup> IHSS pays  		well over 200,000 home care workers throughout the state.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note483">483</a></font></sup></p>
<p> IHSS is funded through a complex array of federal (Medicaid and Title  		XX), state, and county funding sources. One of the funding complexities, for  		example, arises because Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California) will pay only  		enrolled Medi-Cal workers who are not the recipient's spouse or parent. Covered  		cases that do not meet Medi-Cal requirements are funded by non-Medicaid  		monies.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note484">484</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Services that may be provided under the program include:</p>
<ul><li>personal care services (including assistance with ambulation;  		  bathing, toileting, oral hygiene, and grooming; dressing; care and assistance  		  with prosthetic devices; bowel, bladder, and menstrual care; repositioning;  		  skin care, and transfers; feeding and assurance of adequate fluid intake;  		  respiration; and assistance with self-administration of medications),</li>
<li>domestic services such as house cleaning, doing laundry, changing bed  		  linens, and shipping, </li>
<li>heavy cleaning, usually a one-time service, such as scrubbing  		  cupboards or removal of hazardous debris,</li>
<li>accompaniment by a provider when needed during necessary travel to  		  health-related appointments or to alternative resource sites, </li>
<li>yard hazard abatement, </li>
<li>protective supervision of those with a mental condition that makes it  		  unsafe to be alone, </li>
<li>teaching and demonstration directed at reducing the need for other  		  supportive services, and </li>
<li>paramedical services, such as injections, internal catheters, range  		  of motion, and wound care, that make it possible for the recipient to establish  		  and maintain an independent living arrangement.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note485">485</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p> California's approach to providing CDPAS is unique in that it makes use  		of independent, county-based, quasi-governmental entities, called "Public  		Authorities," to perform selected functions within the IHSS program. Public  		authorities were first authorized under California law in 1992, through the  		enactment of Senate Bill 485.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note486">486</a></font></sup> The legislation provided counties the  		option of creating county-level public authorities primarily to serve as  		employer of record of IHSS workers for purposes of collective bargaining over  		wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment of the home care  		workers. It also authorized other tasks such as providing a referral registry  		for consumers and workers and training. </p>
<p> The legislation came about due to increasing demand for personal  		assistance workers combined with the lack of an adequate work force,  		exacerbated by poor pay and benefits. Vigorous union organizing efforts hit a  		roadblock in 1990 when the California Court of Appeals held that, for purposes  		of collective bargaining, a county could <em>not</em> be deemed the employer of  		home care workers, because the county did not exercise any supervisory control,  		and because workers are free to terminate their services without notice to the  		county.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note487">487</a></font></sup> Thus, IHSS  		workers as a group had no one with whom they could bargain for better wages or  		benefits, and consumers had no one to advocate for better service delivery.  		</p>
<p> Consumers and workers came together to back legislation that addressed  		these problems through the creation of public authorities, an entity unique to  		California. Public authorities became a visible advocate for greater access to  		quality consumer-directed personal assistance and stronger worker rights. The  		legislation required a governing or advisory structure that ensured a high  		level of consumer direction of the public authority itself. In those counties  		that established public authorities after the 1992 law, wages and benefits  		substantially improved compared to other counties.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note488">488</a></font></sup> Although only a minority of workers  		actually joins a union, even in counties with well-established public  		authorities, they all benefit from the terms of collective bargaining  		agreements within the particular county, because the union agreement is applied  		to virtually all workers.</p>
<p> Between 1994 and 1999, seven counties created public authorities:  		Alameda, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Francisco, San Mateo, and  		Santa Clara counties. These counties represented over 50 percent of the state  		IHSS caseload.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note489">489</a></font></sup>  		Amendments to the law in 1999 required all counties to establish a public  		authority or to contract with a nonprofit consortium to provide IHSS services,  		setting a deadline of January 2003.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note490">490</a></font></sup> As of mid-2003, all but four of the 58  		California counties have established public authorities for IHSS.</p>
<p> A key feature of the legislation was the inclusion of a statutory  		immunity provision expressly for public authorities. The statute provides:</p>
<blockquote><p> [A]ny public authority created pursuant to this section shall be  		  deemed not to be the employer of in-home supportive services personnel referred  		  to recipients under this section for purposes of liability due to the  		  negligence or intentional torts of the in-home supportive services  		  personnel.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note491">491</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The language makes clear that the public authority cannot be found  		vicariously liable for the actions of personal assistance workers. It does not  		grant immunity for functions <em>directly</em> handled by the public authority.  		In addition to acting as the employer of IHSS workers for purposes of  		collective bargaining, the other functions that public authorities may handle  		directly include the following that are mandated under the public authority  		statute:</p>
<ul><li>Establish a registry and referral system to connect consumers and  		  workers;</li>
<li>Investigate the qualifications and background of potential  		  workers;</li>
<li>Establish a referral system to connect workers to consumers;</li>
<li>Provide training for workers and consumers;</li>
<li>Perform any other function related to the delivery of IHSS; and </li>
<li>Ensure that the requirements of the personal care option under  		  federal Medicaid law are met.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note492">492</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p> Interviews with key contacts indicate that the well-established public  		authorities do provide a registry and referral system to connect consumers and  		workers, and they all do some level of background check on workers, although  		this varies significantly. Some require two work or personal references; some  		do criminal background checks at the local or state level. </p>
<p> All provide basic worker orientation to the program, and skills  		training is made available to varying degrees. Some public authorities do very  		little; some provide general skills training directly; and some link workers to  		training curricula provided through community colleges or other community  		resources. In all cases, the training for workers is optional. Many public  		authorities provide a written program handbook for workers and  		consumers.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note493">493</a></font></sup> Some  		distribute videotapes that describe the role and responsibilities of workers  		and consumers. Little or no formal training for consumers takes place, although  		some counties have had some success with promoting peer counseling among  		consumers and holding conferences with workshops for consumers and workers.  		</p>
<p> The scope of the public authority's work is limited by the practical  		reality that many if not most consumers and workers connect to each other  		without any contact with the registry or public authority. This is because so  		many consumers hire people they already know. Indeed, just over 40% of IHSS  		workers are relatives of the consumer.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note494">494</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The other key participants in the functioning of IHSS -- besides the  		public authority, consumer and worker -- are the state and counties. It is the  		counties that administer the IHSS program at the local level on a day-to-day  		basis. The California Department of Social Services oversees the IHSS program,  		although a large share of IHSS funds come from the Department of Health  		Services which is responsible for administering the MediCal program. The state  		Controller's Office actually cuts the workers' checks and pays the requisite  		employee benefits, including social security, state disability insurance,  		unemployment insurance, worker's compensation, and any benefits such as health  		coverage that may have been negotiated in each county.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note495">495</a></font></sup> Income tax withholding is the worker's  		choice. </p>
<p> The day-to-day administration of IHSS occurs at the county level  		through a county IHSS administrative agency. The county determines eligibility  		for the program, both financial under Medi-Cal criteria and functional under  		the criteria of the IHSS program. The IHSS administrative agency sends out a  		social worker to interview the applicant in the home setting to determine  		eligibility and need for IHSS. The social worker assesses the types of services  		needed and the number of hours the county can authorize for each of the  		services. Up to 283 hours per month can be approved.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note496">496</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Counties may offer IHSS services through any of three modes: (1) a  		contract mode, in which the county contracts with an agency to provide  		services; (2) the individual worker mode, in which the consumer directly  		employs the individual worker; and (3) the homemaker mode, in which the IHSS  		worker is a county employee. In fact, 95% of all IHSS consumers receive  		services through the individual worker mode.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note497">497</a></font></sup> Non-self-directing consumers can utilize  		the independent worker mode if they have a representative authorized by the  		consumer. Under this option, the consumer or authorized representative has the  		responsibility to hire, train, supervise, and fire an individual worker. Thus,  		while the state sets the maximum hours and compensation, the consumer selects  		the worker, determines the worker's schedule and tasks, and trains and  		supervises the worker. State law expressly defines the consumer as the employer  		of the IHSS worker.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note498">498</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The consumer and the individual worker complete, sign, and submit  		timesheets verifying the delivery of authorized services for semi-monthly pay  		periods. The county IHSS administrative agency enters the information into the  		state's computer system to enable the state to generate a check. The county  		agency also assigns a social worker whom the consumer may call with problems,  		questions, re-assessment of hours, or other issues. The social worker must  		re-assess the individual's eligibility at least yearly. </p>
<p> With respect to liability risk, the IHSS statute also provides explicit  		immunity protection to the county and state, similar to that of the public  		authority:</p>
<blockquote><p> Counties and the state shall be immune from any liability resulting  		  from their implementation of this section in the administration of the In-Home  		  Supportive Services Program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note499">499</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not completely clear how far this immunity reaches. It does not  		appear intended to protect the state from failure to maintain required worker  		benefit payments such as social security or workers' compensation, since they  		have borne that duty for several years and continue to do so. Case law in  		California established the proposition long ago that, at least for purposes of  		certain employer obligations such as minimum wage<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note500">500</a></font></sup> and worker's compensation,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note501">501</a></font></sup> the state is the co-employer  		of IHSS independent workers. Accordingly, this immunity language would appear  		to apply primarily or solely to actions for damages based on tort causes of  		action.</p>
<p> The statutory immunity provision goes on to insulate the county and  		state from any liability incurred by a public authority:</p>
<blockquote><p> Any obligation of the public authority or consortium pursuant to this  		  section, whether statutory, contractual, or otherwise, shall be the obligation  		  solely of the public authority or nonprofit consortium, and shall not be the  		  obligation of the county or state.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note502">502</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The overall impact of this structure on liability risk would appear to  		be two-fold. On the one hand, the employment configuration under the IHSS  		program is somewhat more complex than in other models because there are more  		actors involved. <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#figure2">Figure 2</a> illustrates the functional  		relationships among the parties. The complexity itself can cause a risk of role  		confusion, and thus liability risk, if the role differentiation is not crystal  		clear or is not followed. On the other hand, most of the risk is expressly  		eliminated by state statute shielding the state and county quite broadly and  		shielding the public authority from vicarious liability for the actions of  		independent workers.</p>

<p>The analysis of liability risk in the consumer-worker dyad remains  		virtually unchanged under the IHSS model compared to Cash and Counseling, since  		the parties involved and the functions they perform are substantially similar.  		However, the IHSS model does provide additional protection in case of injury to  		workers, since workers' compensation coverage is universal, as well as state  		disability insurance. Moreover, because of the unionization of many IHSS  		workers and the ability to bargain collectively with public authorities,  		increasing numbers of workers are receiving employee health care benefits. On  		balance, the IHSS public authority model provides greater emphasis on the  		development and needs of the personal assistance workforce than does the Cash  		and Counseling model. </p>
<h4><a name="sectionVI.A.2" id="sectionVI.A.2">2. Liability Risk of County and  		State Administrative Agencies for IHSS</a></h4>
<p> Because the county and state agencies involved in IHSS have the benefit  		of broad statutory immunity, their tort liability risk is negligible.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note503">503</a></font></sup> Containing no words of  		limitation, the liability bar would presumably preclude both direct or  		corporate liability for the actions of the state or county, as well as  		vicarious liability for the negligence of IHSS workers.</p>
<h4><a name="sectionVI.A.3" id="sectionVI.A.3">3. Liability Risk of Public  		Authorities</a></h4>
<p> State law, as already noted, grants public authorities protection from  		vicarious liability. In other words, the public authority cannot be deemed  		responsible for the actions of an IHSS worker as an employer.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note504">504</a></font></sup> This immunity eliminates a  		predominant concern that any state, local, or private entity faces when it  		contemplates paying for or arranging consumer-directed services, over which, by  		design, it will have little control.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note505">505</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The immunity provision for public authorities, unlike that for the  		state and counties, does not extend to functions that a public authority  		carries out directly. As a result, public authorities do bear some risk of  		liability for injuries it may cause in performing such functions. These  		functions may include: screening and referral of workers through the registry;  		training; providing emergency worker support if done directly by the public  		authority; and monitoring services, to the extent the public authority takes on  		that task.</p>
<p><strong><em>Screening and Referral Through Registries</em></strong></p>
<p> All the public authorities, except Alameda County's, run a registry  		in-house. Alameda contracts out the registry function to several  		community-based organizations. This in itself provides another level of  		distancing from liability risk. </p>
<p> Based on interviews with public authority directors, it is fairly clear  		that substantial variation exists in the extent of worker screening for  		purposes of registry listings. If screening is done poorly or if red flags are  		ignored, and the registry refers out an axe murderer, for example, the  		potential for liability clearly exists. At a minimum, all the registries ask  		for voluntary disclosure of convictions and all require two prior job  		references, or at least personal references if job experience is lacking. All  		the registries have some criteria for removing a worker's name from the  		registry and some form of appeal process for removal actions. The San Francisco  		public authority spells out six grounds for registry exclusion:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Abusing or being under the influence of alcohol, or using or being  			 under the influence of illegal drugs on the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing false information to the Registry or omitting information  			 that could affect your eligibility to be on the Registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminal behavior, including theft, abuse, or neglect, or felony  			 convictions determined to be inappropriate for a worker on the  			 Registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing confidential information about a consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexual harassment of the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pattern of poor performance, unprofessional conduct, or  			 unreliability.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note506">506</a></font></sup></p>

</ol><p> All the registries ask for voluntary disclosure of criminal records  		from registry applicants, and roughly half of them, including the heavily  		populated county of Los Angeles, require criminal records checks. These checks  		vary from local, to state, to national FBI checks. The last option is rare  		because of the cost. The current cost of the statewide check alone is  		reportedly $52 each, and their practical value is very much a matter of ongoing  		debate within the public authorities. To the extent that convictions are  		reported, the consequences are also somewhat variable among the public  		authorities as to which crimes will disqualify a worker from the registry and  		whether any circumstances, such as the passage of time, will enable a  		disqualification to be waived. Some registries merely provide the information  		about the felony conviction to the consumer as part of the registry  		information. </p>
<p> In referring workers to consumers, all the registries do some level of  		matching consumer needs with worker abilities, at least on the level of  		matching preferences for gender, pet acceptance, smoker status, and scheduling  		needs. And all appear to follow the practice of sending out at least three  		names to consumers or, in some counties, as many as 15, so as to avoid an  		implicit recommendation of particular workers. </p>
<p> It is important to keep in mind that while a criminal record can  		disqualify a worker from being included in the registry, consumers are still  		free to hire workers with criminal backgrounds if they choose. Indeed, most  		workers are not hired through the registry, particularly those who are members  		of the consumer's family. For example, the San Francisco public authority  		estimated that about half the 12,000 consumers in the IHSS program were  		connected to workers through the registry, while the Los Angles public  		authority estimated the number as only 2000 of the more than 100,000 IHSS  		consumers in that county.</p>
<p> A key facet of minimizing liability risk in operating the registry, as  		in any function, is clear communication of rights, responsibilities, and  		expectations. Some of the public authorities have developed detailed  		disclosures and releases that workers and consumers must read and sign in order  		to make use of the registry. For example, the Los Angeles public authority uses  		a three-page form, entitled "Participant's Rights, Responsibilities and Release  		Agreement," that describes in detail the limited role and operation of the  		registry and includes a disclaimer of any responsibility... </p>
<blockquote><p> for any injuries or damages which may arise out of the referral or  		  which may arise out of the employment, or for investigating or resolving any  		  disputes, misunderstandings or injuries which may arise between a Consumer and  		  a Provider or any third party.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note507">507</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The form goes on to include an express release of the registry "from any  		claim, damages, injuries, liability or remedy of any nature relating in any way  		to the Registry, its services or denial of services, or its actions or failures  		to act."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note508">508</a></font></sup> The  		enforceability of such broadly worded releases is always somewhat in doubt  		because courts generally frown upon them for public policy reasons. Although  		legalistic in tone and style, the form goes about as far as reasonably possible  		in articulating the limited functions of the registry and the rights and  		responsibilities of workers, consumers, and registry. At the same time, its  		dense legal language may be somewhat intimidating and difficult to understand  		for many consumers and workers.</p>
<p> Some public authorities, such as the San Francisco public authority,  		accomplish much of their communication of expectations by providing  		well-written handbooks to workers and consumers and by developing  		information-rich web sites.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note509">509</a></font></sup> The limitation and challenge of these  		communication approaches is their reliance on a presumption of English  		reading-based literacy -- a presumption that does not apply to a large  		proportion of IHSS consumers or workers. To illustrate, consumer demographics  		reported by the Los Angeles IHSS program indicate that only 44.7% of its  		consumers spoke English as their primary language. Other primary languages  		include: Spanish (16.5%), Armenian (15.3%), Russian (5.4%), Chinese (5.2%),  		Tagalog (1.9%) and other (11.9%).<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note510">510</a></font></sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Training</em></strong></p>
<p> The mandate to provide training in the California public authority law  		adds another functional area that distinguishes the California model from Cash  		and Counseling. The latter provides consultation and counseling, including  		information about where one may obtain training, but not training itself.</p>
<p> Interviews with public authority directors, as well as review of 25  		public authority profiles posted by the California Association of Public  		Authorities,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note511">511</a></font></sup>  		reveals a tremendous variation in training resources and approaches. At a  		minimum, most provide an initial orientation to the IHSS program and its  		procedures. This may range from a half-hour one-on-one meeting to a two- or  		three-hour formal orientation course. To the extent that caregiver knowledge  		and skills training is provided, most public authorities arrange it through  		outside resources such as a local health department or Red Cross, rather than  		providing training by in-house staff. These training sessions typically cover  		elementary topics such as basic First Aid and CPR; communication and conflict  		resolution skills; and universal health and hygiene precautions. Some public  		authorities arrange more extensive skills training in areas such as bowel and  		bladder care; bathing and transferring techniques; diabetes education,  		nutrition and fluids; and recognizing and reporting abuse. Community colleges  		are often relied upon for such training. None of the public authorities  		reported providing on-the-job training for particular workers and consumers.  		All training, except for basic orientation, is voluntary.</p>
<p> Most public authorities seek to accommodate language diversity by  		providing orientation materials and forms in the major non-English languages.  		Likewise, many offer training or refer workers to classes taught in languages  		other than English.</p>
<p> Given these factors -- the focus on general knowledge and skills, their  		role as arranger rather than provider of training, and the optional nature of  		training for workers -- the risk of liability for poor training is minimal for  		most public authorities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Emergency Back-Up Support</em></strong></p>
<p> The availability of replacement workers in the event of worker no-shows  		varies among the public authorities. Practices cover the gamut:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In Los Angeles, the county provides no formal support. It is the  			 consumer's responsibility to arrange adequate back-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kings County registry maintains a list of providers who will  			 work on an emergency basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda County contracts with a community home care agency to  			 provide emergency worker replacement 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>San Francisco maintains a pool of on-call workers, employed by the  			 public authority, to provide emergency back-up.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> In the Cash and Counseling states, the consultants make sure that the  		consumer has a back-up plan, but the specifics of the plan are the consumer's  		responsibility. As the examples above suggest, some public authorities are even  		less involved in back-up than are the Cash and Counseling States; some are more  		involved and proactive, as exemplified by the Alameda and San Francisco public  		authorities. The more directly public authorities take on responsibility to  		provide and control emergency back-up, the greater become the liability risks.  		Thus, in the above examples, the risk increases from the first to the last  		example. By employing the workers directly, the San Francisco public authority  		assumes the full risk that any health care agency incurs in providing services.  		Alameda removes itself one step by contracting out the function. Of course, the  		importance of emergency back-up is substantial, so even with increased risk,  		the policy objectives of ensuring the welfare and safety of the consumer may  		very well justify assumption of the responsibility and accompanying risk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monitoring Services</em></strong></p>
<p> Monitoring is not a term that any of the public authorities or local  		social services departments would use to describe their function, but we apply  		the term here to mean any activities that enable any of the entities involved  		in the consumer-directed service delivery system to spot and respond to  		problems. In that sense, both the local social services departments and the  		public authorities provide some monitoring. </p>
<p> At a minimum, the social services social worker must visit the consumer  		annually to reassess need and eligibility. Consumers approved for the IHSS  		program are also instructed to call their social worker if problems arise. If,  		for example, on a home visit by the social worker, it is apparent that the  		consumer is not able to self-direct his or her care any longer, the consumer  		may be terminated from the consumer directed-component of IHSS. If the problem  		is one that rises to the level of abuse and neglect, the social worker is  		obligated to report the case to adult protective services. IHSS workers and  		public authority staff are also mandated reporters, legally required to report  		suspected abuse of consumers. Thus, the analysis made elsewhere in this report  		regarding potential liability for abuse or for failure to report abuse applies  		equally as well to the IHSS program.</p>
<p> A couple of counties -- Sonoma and Medocino -- have incorporated a more  		proactive case management type of approach to provide extra support to  		consumers who need it. However, the actual duties of these case managers were  		not investigated in this review. Overall, it can be said that the monitoring by  		the counties is fairly analogous to that described in the Cash and Counseling  		program, and thus, the liability issues are fairly similar, with the  		significant caveat that the counties are given statutory immunity.</p>
<p> The public authorities are less involved in monitoring than the local  		social services offices, but they do receive occasional complaints and hear of  		concerns from those workers and consumers who make use of the registries. Some  		public authorities also survey consumers and workers to assess their  		satisfaction with the registry services. To the extent that they become aware  		of problems through these activities, they may provide some consultation in  		problem solving or referral. They may also determine that a problematic worker  		or consumer is no longer appropriate for a registry listing. Overall, neither  		the public authorities nor consumers see the role of public authorities as  		responsible for quality of care issues. Thus, direct liability risks for  		monitoring are not significant.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionVI.B" id="sectionVI.B">B. New York's Consumer-Directed  		Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP)</a></h3>
<p> New York State's Medicaid program operates one of the most extensive  		personal care programs in the country, accounting for nearly half of the  		national Medicaid spending for the personal care option under state  		plans.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note512">512</a></font></sup> An eligible  		beneficiary can receive 24/7 personal care if need is demonstrated. In  		addition, New York provides broad Medicaid home health care benefits, plus a  		variety of home- and community-based waiver programs, such as the Long-Term  		Home Health Care Program, which provides nursing home level home care for  		chronically ill individuals regardless of age. New York also sponsors some  		state-funded, community-based programs including the Supplemental Nutrition  		Assistant Program and the Expanded In-Home Services for Elderly  		Program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note513">513</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP) represents a  		relatively small subset of personal care services in the state, with only 4783  		persons in the program during calendar year 2003, although the number is  		rising.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note514">514</a></font></sup> However,  		its roots go back to 1980 when a group of self-directing consumers with  		disabilities formed a non-profit, consumer-run group called "Concepts of  		Independence." Concepts won a contract with New York City's Human Resources  		Administration (HRA) to provide consumer-directed personal assistance services  		under the city's Medicaid program. Concepts is paid as a Medicaid personal care  		provider agency, and it in turn pays personal assistants, employed by consumers  		in the CDPAP program. Concepts is the employer of record of the personal  		assistant only for purposes of wages and benefits.</p>
<p> Concepts grew slowly but steadily during its first decade of operation,  		but statewide growth of consumer-directed services did not occur until 1992  		when legislation created a state-wide "Patient-Managed Home Care" demonstration  		program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note515">515</a></font></sup> In  		addition to expanding the consumer-directed model, the legislation also amended  		the state's Nurse Practice Act to permit family members, household members,  		friends or domestic employees to perform skilled nursing tasks, as long as they  		do not hold themselves out as a person licensed to practice nursing and they  		were either unpaid or employed under the Patient-Managed Home Care program.</p>
<p> In 1995, amendments to the statute converted the demonstration program  		to a permanent statewide program and changed its name to its current name, the  		Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program or CDPAP.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note516">516</a></font></sup> As of late 2002, about 48 of 62 local  		districts (county Medicaid agencies) have established CDPAP services.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note517">517</a></font></sup> No formal regulations have  		been adopted for the program as of mid-2003, although the state Department of  		Social Services has issued several memoranda setting forth guidelines for  		districts developing CDPAP programs.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note518">518</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Under the 1995 law, an individual is eligible for CDPAP if the person  		meets Medicaid eligibility requirements for home care services and:</p>
<blockquote><p> has been determined by the social services district, pursuant to an  		  assessment of the person's appropriateness for the program,... as being in need  		  of home care services or private duty nursing and is able and willing or has a  		  legal guardian able and willing to make informed choices, or has designated a  		  relative or other adult who is able and willing to assist in making informed  		  choices, as to the type and quality of services, including but not limited to  		  such services as nursing care, personal care, transportation and respite  		  service.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note519">519</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Concepts is the oldest and largest consumer-directed provider in  		CDPAP, this discussion will be limited to Concepts' operation and experience in  		New York City. Concepts serves about 1,300 consumers in the city and about 300  		in six counties beyond New York.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note520">520</a></font></sup></p>
<p> For consumers, the process begins with a Medicaid application to a  		local social services district. In New York City, the equivalent of the social  		services district is the Human Resources Administration that operates through  		neighborhood "Community Alternative Systems Agencies" or "CASA" offices. The  		consumer must provide a physician's order that describes the consumer's medical  		and functional impairments and the need for home care services. The CASA  		office, through the Home Care Services Program, then conducts an assessment by  		a case manager and another by a nurse to determine whether the applicant is  		eligible for personal care services under Medicaid and, if so, the number of  		hours per week. Once this is accomplished, the CASA office will consider  		enrollment in the consumer-directed program. </p>
<p> The CDPAP application requires the consumer, or the consumer's parent,  		legal guardian, or responsible adult to answer questions demonstrating ability  		and willingness to assume responsibility for:</p>
<ul><li>recruiting, selecting, training and orienting each personal  		  assistant;</li>
<li>directing the personal assistant's daily activities within the  		  service plan authorized by the Home Care Services Program;</li>
<li>obtaining and assigning replacement assistants;</li>
<li>discharging the personal assistant when necessary;</li>
<li>completing and returning all forms as required by Concepts;</li>
<li>resolving all personal assistant complaints;</li>
<li>maintaining contact with the HRA case manager; and</li>
<li>maintaining contact with the appropriate Concepts staff members as  		  needed.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note521">521</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p> Once enrollment is approved, the CDPAP contractor -- Concepts -- is  		notified. Whomever the consumer selects to work as a personal assistant must go  		to Concepts to complete the necessary employment paperwork. One key difference  		between the New York program and Cash and Counseling is that certain family  		members cannot serve as personal assistance workers in the New York program.  		The program follows the state's regulation for Medicaid personal care services  		in this regard, which prohibits payment to "a patient's spouse, parent, son,  		son-in-law, daughter or daughter-in-law...."<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note522">522</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Concepts is responsible for the following duties:</p>
<ul><li>hiring and dismissing personal assistants at the direction of the  		  consumer, legal guardian or responsible adult;</li>
<li>acting as the personal assistant's employer of record in relation to  		  wages and benefits [i.e., Social Security, unemployment compensation, worker's  		  compensation, health benefits, and leave benefits];</li>
<li>establishing the required personnel files;</li>
<li>collecting and verifying the consumer/personal assistant time  		  sheets;</li>
<li>maintaining time and leave records;</li>
<li>paying each assistant's wages and administering each assistant's  		  fringe benefits;<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note523">523</a></font></sup></li>
<li>resolving appropriate complaints; and</li>
<li>submitting records as needed to the HRA-Home Care Service  		  Program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note524">524</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p> Concepts performs two additional functions. One is to administer a  		"consumer classified list" for consumers seeking personal assistants, and a  		"personal assist ad list" for personal assistants seeking work. Personal  		assistants who have worked at least 500 hours for Concepts may use the latter.  		Concepts merely coordinates and periodically updates these lists. They perform  		no recruiting, screening, or assessment of the listings. The second function  		developed only after the 9/11/01 disaster, when HRA asked Concepts to get more  		involved in monitoring the circumstances of the consumers. Concepts now employs  		three "quality assurance specialists" and a supervisor to serve as "point  		persons" for every consumer. They are available in a responsive capacity, to  		answer questions, initially investigate problems, and be available as a  		resource. However, they do not take over the monitoring function of the CASA  		case manager. If problems merit, the quality assurance specialist may refer the  		matter to the case manager.</p>
<p> On an ongoing basis once services begin, the CASA office, through its  		case managers, stays involved in a monitoring capacity. At a minimum, it  		performs semi-annual nursing reassessments and annual case worker visits to  		monitor and reassess services. The relationship among the parties, with their  		respective duties is illustrated in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#figure3">Figure 3</a> below.</p>
<h4><a name="sectionVI.B.1" id="sectionVI.B.1">1. Potential Liability Arising  		from the Relationship between Consumers and Workers</a></h4>
<p> The analysis of liability risk in the consumer-worker dyad remains  		virtually unchanged under New York's CDPAP model compared to Cash and  		Counseling, since the parties involved and the functions they perform are  		substantially similar. However, like California, the New York model provides  		additional protection in case of injury to workers, since workers' compensation  		coverage is universal, along with other basic worker benefits. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure3" id="figure3">FIGURE 3</a>. Parties  			 Involved in New York CDPAP</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/66291/cdliabF3.gif" alt="Organizational Chart: Parties Involved in New York CDPAP" /></td>
</tr></table><p> Although New York does not have the equivalent of the California public  		authority to serve as the employer for collective bargaining purposes, the  		workers in the CDPAP (and in all home care positions in the city) benefit from  		"Living Wage" legislation adopted by the New York City Council in November of  		2002. The legislation raised minimum worker pay for home care workers and  		others to $8.10 per hour with health care coverage or $9.60/hour without  		healthcare coverage, effective July 1, 2003. The amount is adjusted  		annually.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note525">525</a></font></sup></p>
<h4><a name="sectionVI.B.2" id="sectionVI.B.2">2. Liability Risk of County and  		State Administrative Agencies (HRA through CASA offices)</a></h4>
<p> The employer-type duties retained by the Human Resources Administration  		through its local CASA office -- primarily program eligibility and monitoring  		-- fall well below the level of involvement that could give rise to a risk of  		being deemed employer of the personal assistants in the CDPAP. Thus, concern  		about vicarious liability for injuries caused by workers in the program is not  		significant. However, as with all functions, the CASA office and its staff must  		adhere to a duty of ordinary care for the actual functions it takes on. </p>
<p> CASA's initial function is that of eligibility determination. But the  		eligibility process is tempered by Medicaid appeal rights that provide a means  		of redress for consumers who disagree with any determination. Personal injury  		law is not especially relevant with respect to this function, with the possible  		exception of decisions regarding who may be approved as a responsible adult to  		direct care on behalf of the consumer. </p>
<p><strong><em>Appointment of a "Responsible  		Adult"/Representative</em></strong></p>
<p> The worst case scenario for any agency in the position of approving  		consumer-directed care is the negligent approval of a surrogate who  		subsequently exploits and seriously injures the consumer. The liability concern  		in the New York program closely tracks that already discussed under Cash and  		Counseling. The challenge is the creation of a process and standard for  		recognition of the surrogate that sufficiently protects both the consumer and  		the agency approving the arrangement.</p>
<p> The CDPAP statute, quoted earlier, says only that a consumer who is  		unable to self-direct care may still participate in CDPAP if he or she:</p>
<blockquote><p> has a legal guardian able and willing to make informed choices, or  		  has designated a relative or other adult who is able and willing to assist in  		  making informed choices, as to the type and quality of services.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note526">526</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The language on its face indicates that it is the consumer who is the  		designator and not someone else (unless a guardian exists). Thus, some kind of  		appointing process and confirmation of that process would be expected. The  		application materials for CDPAP do provide some criteria for who may be the  		responsible adult, and the application form requires that person's contact  		information and signature, but they are silent on how designation is made or  		confirmed, other than the fact that the person must be interviewed by the case  		worker and registered nurse.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note527">527</a></font></sup> In most cases, the interview process may  		be more than sufficient to make a sound determination, but as with the Cash and  		Counseling program, greater clarity in the appointment process would enhance  		safety and reduce liability risk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monitoring by the CASA Office</em></strong></p>
<p> The liability analysis provided with respect to consultants in the Cash  		and Counseling programs applies quite similarly to the monitoring functions of  		the CASA office. Monitoring constitutes both a safeguard against personal  		injury as well as a responsibility for which the CASA office can be held  		accountable in a tort claim if the function is carried out negligently. The  		challenge again is to define the nature and frequency of monitoring clearly in  		program procedures and materials, carry out the function as envisioned  		consistently, and act upon information gathered in the process, especially if  		the information suggests management or care problems.</p>
<h4><a name="sectionVI.B.3" id="sectionVI.B.3">3. Liability Risk of Concepts of  		Independence</a></h4>
<p> Concepts of Independence is the employer of record of personal  		assistants for purposes of payroll and benefits management and for purposes of  		Medicaid regulations requiring identification of a provider agency to receive  		Medicaid payments. To this extent, it serves as little more than a fiscal  		agent, similar to the fiscal agents under Cash and Counseling. Concepts  		provides no recruiting, screening, or active referral function; instead, it  		merely maintains a referral list on which consumers and workers list  		themselves. In some respects, Concept's involvement with workers is even less  		that of the fiscal agents under Cash and Counseling, because it does not pay  		workers directly. Instead, it sends the paycheck to the consumer who then turns  		it over to the worker. Consumers bear the responsibility for the key employer  		functions: recruiting; hiring/firing; training; and assigning, scheduling and  		supervising the work of independent workers. Under this configuration, the case  		law suggests very low exposure of Concepts under any theory of vicarious  		liability.</p>
<p> As for the functions for which Concepts is directly responsible --  		primarily payroll management functions -- the liability analysis closely tracks  		that of the Cash and Counseling fiscal agents and, similarly, involves fairly  		low risk of tort liability. </p>
<p><strong><em>Monitoring by Concepts of Independence</em></strong></p>
<p> One recently acquired function of Concepts that does go beyond that of  		fiscal agent if that of quality assurance monitoring. As noted above, Concepts  		now employs three "quality assurance specialists" and a supervisor to serve as  		"point persons" for every consumer. They are available in a responsive  		capacity, to answer questions, initially investigate problems, and be available  		as a resource. The key limiting factor of this function is that it is  		responsive to concerns and problems reported by consumers or others and is not  		supervisory in nature. The CASA case manager still bears the primary  		responsibility of supervisory monitoring on a periodic basis, and when Concepts  		becomes aware of problems meriting more active intervention, its most proactive  		option is to refer the matter to the case manager. Of course, even this level  		of monitoring can be done so poorly as to violate a duty of ordinary care,  		resulting in liability for injury. But, the overall risk is modest under this  		scenario, and the key to avoiding even that risk is, as always, is to define  		the nature and extent of monitoring clearly in program procedures and  		materials, to carry out the function as envisioned consistently, and to act  		upon information gathered in the process, especially if the information  		suggests management or care problems.</p>
<p> To recap, two other models of consumer-directed personal assistance  		services -- the California In-Home Supportive Services Program, and the New  		York Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program -- face similar liability  		issues as are found in the Cash and Counseling model. Variations in the issues  		are dictated by (1) authorizing legislation which defines the duties of the  		program participants and/or the limits of liability (as in the immunity  		provisions in the California law), and (2) by the scope and nature of the  		functions the participating entities actually take on. In all these models,  		there is a division of labor of employer and related tasks among the  		participants in the system. The division of tasks limits the liability risk of  		each participant in different ways. However, because liability risk follows  		function, success in appropriately limiting liability risk depends on clarity  		in the division of responsibility, clear communication of expectations, and  		consistent compliance with those expectations.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionVII" id="sectionVII">VII. CONCLUSIONS AND OPTIONS TO ADDRESS LIABILITY  		RISKS</a></h2>
<p> This section summarizes our conclusions regarding the potential  		liability risks for each actor in consumer-directed care -- consumers, workers,  		authorized representatives, fiscal intermediaries, consultants, and states --  		and identifies steps that can be taken to minimize the risk of liability.  		Overall, we conclude that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The risk of liability as between the consumer and the worker is no  			 greater than that encountered under agency provided care. In addition, because  			 in many cases family members serve as CDPAS workers under this model of care,  			 there is, as a practical matter, less likelihood that the parties will seek  			 compensation for personal injuries in the courts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putting aside any impact of familial relationships, personal  			 assistance workers face a heightened theoretical risk of liability if they are  			 negligent in performing caregiving duties, compared to agency provided care,  			 because in the latter structure the plaintiff is more likely to sue the agency,  			 under the doctrine of vicarious liability, than to sue the worker. The agency  			 is likely to have greater assets against which to recover.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note528">528</a></font></sup> Absent the agency, the  			 individual worker employed by the consumer bears the sole legal responsibility  			 for injuries caused by the worker's negligence. However, the practical  			 likelihood of liability is influenced by the extent of assets or insurance  			 owned by a prospective defendant. Individuals providing personal assistance are  			 likely to have insignificant assets compared to agencies and in practical  			 terms, are therefore likely to be "judgment proof." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of injury to workers while on the job, liability risk is  			 affected dramatically by the availability of workers' compensation. Where  			 workers are <em>not</em> covered by workers' compensation benefits, consumers  			 who have assets are more likely to be subject to suit for compensation if a  			 worker is injured on the job, because of the absence of other remedies.  			 Workers' compensation provides a relatively simple administrative remedy to  			 injured workers and, at the same time, bars most personal injury actions by the  			 worker against the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to other actors in the provision of services -- i.e.,  			 the state sponsoring agency, consultants, fiscal agents, public authorities (as  			 in California), or consumer-directed provider agencies (as in New York) -- this  			 analysis finds that their liability risk is limited to the specific tasks they  			 perform, with minimal risk of vicarious liability for personal injury  			 negligently caused by personal assistance workers. The risk of direct liability  			 is also relatively very low because of each actor's limited functions.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p> Thus, in general, delivering home care services through the Cash and  		Counseling model or a similar consumer-directed structure results in a  		relatively low level of liability risk where employer and support functions are  		"unbundled" in a clearly defined and communicated fashion.</p>
<p> In this section, in addition to describing the liability risks in  		greater detail, we identify a number of steps that can be taken to minimize or  		at least reduce potential liability. However, two key framing points about  		liability risk should always be kept in mind. One, liability risk never  		disappears entirely, even under a grant of statutory immunity. Two, the best  		protection against liability in connection with any consumer-directed program  		is first, development and implementation of a well-designed program that  		clearly assigns and communicates responsibilities, and second, careful and  		consistent adherence to the procedures and protocols of the program.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note529">529</a></font></sup> The Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration's final report on Lessons from the Implementation of Cash and  		Counseling in Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey provides excellent advice and  		comprehensive recommendations regarding the design of a CDPAS program which we  		will not repeat here.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note530">530</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionVII.A" id="sectionVII.A">A. Workers</a></h3>
<p> Individual workers face a significant risk that they may be found  		liable if they are negligent in performing their duties under general tort law  		principles. However, this reality is tempered by the fact that if a worker does  		not have sufficient income or assets to pay the judgment in a damage action  		(that is, the worker is "judgment proof"), this is a risk that is not likely to  		materialize.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note531">531</a></font></sup>  		Workers also face the risk that they will be injured on the job, and if they  		are not covered by workers' compensation, they may not, as a practical matter,  		be able to recover damages in connection with the injury. In addition, in some  		states, workers risk civil or criminal liability if they fail to report abuse  		or neglect of the consumer as required by state adult protective services (APS)  		laws. A worker who engages in gross negligence or abuses the consumer may also  		be civilly and/or criminally liable under state APS laws. These abuse and  		neglect related risks are extremely low-frequency risks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Worker Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Negligent caregiving</strong>. Case law demonstrates that  			 individual workers face a significant risk that they may be found liable if  			 they are negligent in performing their caregiving duties, including leaving the  			 consumer unattended. However, if a worker's income and assets are low or  			 modest, as is the case for many in this field, the worker may, in practical  			 terms, be "judgment proof." From this perspective, the risk of enforceable  			 liability for negligent caregiving is a risk that is not likely to materialize  			 (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.1">Section II.A.1</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negligence in non-caregiving matters</strong>. A worker may  			 be found liable for negligence in non-caregiving activities, most notably  			 creating a hazard in the consumer's home, However, here, again, if a worker  			 does not have sufficient income or assets to pay the judgment in a damage  			 action, this is a risk that is not likely to materialize (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.2">Section II.A.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A worker may be  			 a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective services (APS) law and  			 may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for failure to report abuse  			 or neglect that comes to attention of the worker. However, liability can easily  			 be avoided by complying with the APS law (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.3.a">Section  			 II.A.3.a</a>). As a practical matter, workers employed by the consumer or the  			 consumer's representative, especially if the worker is a family member, may  			 have greater emotional or economic barriers to reporting, compared to  			 agency-employed workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for abuse or neglect</strong>. A worker may be  			 criminally liable under the state's APS law if the worker abuses or neglects  			 the consumer. This is a low level risk because of the infrequency of misconduct  			 that rises to the level of abuse or neglect. Of course, on the rare occasions  			 when it does occur, the injury to the consumer can be extremely serious (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.3.b">Section II.A.3.b</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injury to third party caused by  			 worker</strong>. The worker and the consumer are potentially liable for  			 injuries to third parties caused by the worker while acting within the scope of  			 employment. The worker's liability is direct, i.e., flowing directly from his  			 or her own action or inaction, while the consumer's risk of liability is  			 vicarious, arising from the employer-employee doctrine of <em>respondeat  			 superior</em>. Unless the worker or the consumer has sufficient income or  			 assets to pay the judgment in a damage action, this too is a risk that has a  			 low probability of materializing against the worker (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injury to third party caused by  			 consumer</strong>. A third party may claim that an injury inflicted by a  			 consumer was caused by the negligent care or supervision of the worker, thus  			 making the worker liable for damages (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>).  			 However, such claims are rare and are likely to be dismissed for failure to  			 prove that the worker owed a duty of care to the third party.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Other Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Inability to recover compensation for on the job  			 injuries</strong>. The worker may be injured on the job by the consumer (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.1">Section II.B.1</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.2">Section  			 II.B.2</a>), by a third party (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>), or as  			 a result of the negligence of the owner or renter of the consumer's home (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.1">Section II.B.1</a>). If the potential defendant has  			 neither assets nor liability insurance, the worker will not be able to collect  			 damages in connection with the injury, unless the worker is covered by workers'  			 compensation insurance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Options to Address Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Fully inform the worker of the liability risks and document  			 the process</strong>. At the time a worker is hired, the worker can be made  			 aware of the potential liability risks, including the terms of the state APS  			 law, and the steps the worker can take to minimize these risks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Require workers' compensation coverage for all  			 workers</strong>. Workers' compensation coverage would ensure that workers  			 receive compensation for all on the job injuries, regardless of fault or the  			 availability of compensation from responsible parties, and is therefore highly  			 desirable.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note532">532</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make available optional training programs for  			 workers</strong>. Under the Cash and Counseling model, consumers are  			 responsible for providing any necessary training to workers. While for many  			 consumers it is important that they have the right to train their own workers,  			 state programs might consider making available strictly optional training  			 resources and programs for workers who want assistance (for example, provide  			 videos containing instruction on basic skills such as proper bathing  			 techniques; contract with community resources to provide free basic training  			 sessions; seek to expand the availability of community college courses in  			 relevant skills). While the state should not assume responsibility for the  			 quality and effectiveness of such programs, the state should attempt to offer  			 training that is consistent with the philosophy of consumer direction and  			 should avoid "canned" training programs and materials that are inconsistent  			 with that philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionVII.B" id="sectionVII.B">B. Consumers</a></h3>
<p> Consumers face a distinct risk of liability for on the job injuries to  		workers unless the worker is covered by workers' compensation. However, unless  		the consumer or a family member (acting as authorized representative) has  		significant assets, the worker is unlikely to bring a personal injury suit.  		Cases in which consumers with mental impairments engage in negligent or  		aggressive behavior that causes injury to the worker are more complicated,  		because the mental impairment may or may not be recognized as a defense in a  		damage action. Consumers also are subject to employment-related legal claims  		(e.g., unlawful discharge) but can be protected from liability by a carefully  		worded employment agreement and by taking care not to violate any applicable  		state employment laws. Finally, consumers may be vicariously liable as  		employers for injuries caused to third parties by their workers during the  		course of employment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Consumer Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Negligence in maintaining the worker's workplace</strong>.  			 Consumers face a distinct risk of liability for on the job injuries to  			 individual workers they employ unless those employees are covered by workers'  			 compensation. This risk exists with respect to any invitee into the home,  			 whether the invitee is a housekeeper, dog walker, social visitor, or anyone  			 else. The risk to the personal assistance worker is only one of degree -- that  			 is, the personal assistance worker is likely to spend a greater amount of time  			 in the home and perform intimate, hands-on services, thereby giving rise to  			 greater opportunity for injury. </p>
<p> The existence of workers' compensation coverage is a key protection  			 for both workers who risk injury and for consumers who, without it, face  			 significant liability risk. The case law demonstrates that a consumer may be  			 found liable for negligence in maintaining the workplace -- that is, for  			 creating or failing to correct hazardous conditions in the consumer's home. If  			 the consumer lives with a family member or friend who is the owner or renter of  			 the consumer's home, that family member or friend may also be liable on a  			 theory of premises liability (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.1">Section II.B.1</a>). It  			 should be noted that this risk is theoretically the same, regardless of whether  			 the services are consumer-directed or agency-provided. In both circumstances,  			 the consumer or home-owner has an obligation to maintain a reasonably safe  			 workplace. The difference is that under agency-provided care, workers  			 compensation coverage is universal, and where such coverage exits, personal  			 injury suits against the consumer or homeowner are far less likely. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Injuries caused by the consumer's mental  			 impairment</strong>. Cases in which consumers with mental impairment engage in  			 negligent or aggressive behavior that causes injury to the worker are more  			 complicated, because state law varies on whether the consumer's mental  			 impairment will be recognized as a defense in an action for damages. The trend  			 is to recognize the defense when asserted by a defendant who is confined to a  			 residential facility, and there is case law suggesting that in at least some  			 circumstances, this defense will also be accepted in the home care setting (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.2">Section II.B.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrongful discharge and other employment-related  			 claims</strong>. As an employer, the consumer is potentially liable for a  			 variety of employment related claims, such as discharge in violation of an  			 employment agreement or employment actions that are discriminatorily motivated.  			 However, this is a low frequency risk, and consumers can be protected from  			 liability by a carefully worded employment agreement (expressly noting that the  			 worker's employment is terminable at will by the consumer) and by being made  			 aware of any applicable state employment laws (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3">Section  			 II.B.3</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injuries to third parties caused by the  			 worker</strong>. Consumers may be liable as employers on the basis of vicarious  			 liability (also referred to as <em>respondeat superior</em>) for injuries  			 caused to third parties by their workers while acting within the scope of  			 employment. For example, an auto accident caused by the worker while running an  			 errand for the consumer could result in such liability (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>). </p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Other Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Inability to recover compensation for injuries caused by the  			 worker</strong>. Because many, if not most, workers are likely to have limited  			 income and assets, the consumer may not as a practical matter be able to  			 recover damages for injuries caused by the worker (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.1">Section II.A.1</a> and <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.A.2">Section  			 II.A.2</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Options to Address Liability Risk</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Fully inform the consumer of the liability risks</strong>.  			 At the time of enrollment, the consumer can be informed of all potential risks  			 and the steps the consumer can take to minimize those risks (for example, the  			 consumer should be advised of the legal responsibility to maintain a safe  			 workplace and the importance of correcting potentially hazardous conditions in  			 the home). A homeowner's or lessee's insurance policy that includes protection  			 for such liability is advisable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inform the consumer of the possible need for liability  			 insurance coverage if the consumer has assets at risk</strong>. States should  			 consider advising the consumer that if the worker causes injury to a <em>third  			 party</em>, the consumer will be jointly liable to the third party under the  			 doctrine of vicarious liability. If the worker is judgment proof and does not  			 have liability insurance, the consumer may be solely liable and will not be  			 able to obtain contribution for damages from the worker. To protect against  			 this possibility, the consumer may want to consider obtaining liability  			 insurance if the consumer has assets at risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document that the consumer has received this information and  			 agrees to these risks</strong>. It is advisable to provide the information  			 described in paragraphs one and two in writing, preferably as part of the  			 enrollment agreement signed by the consumer. This will provide written  			 documentation that the consumer has been made aware of the risks and has  			 accepted those risks in agreeing to participate in the CDPAS program. It is  			 likely that most applicants for CDPAS will conclude that the benefits far  			 outweigh the risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide workers' compensation coverage for all individual  			 providers</strong>. In states where it is available, it is highly desirable  			 that workers' compensation coverage be provided, or at least made available,  			 for all individual workers through the state program. Placing the burden or  			 option on consumers to obtain the coverage will substantially lessen the  			 likelihood of implementation. Consultants can be directed to explain the  			 importance of coverage to consumers and assist them in enrolling their workers.  			 This will provide protection for both workers and consumers -- the worker will  			 be guaranteed compensation for on the job injuries even if the consumer (or  			 other responsible party) is judgment proof, and the consumer will be protected  			 from suits for damages by workers (this is particularly important in the case  			 of a mentally impaired consumer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offer provider background checks to consumers</strong>. The  			 state can offer worker background checks to consumers, including criminal  			 background checks, as is required in the Medicaid waiver templates for CDPAS  			 programs,<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note533">533</a></font></sup> and  			 consultants can play an important role by explaining to consumers the value of  			 obtaining such checks. This will provide some protection against hiring a  			 worker who is negligent or dishonest or who is likely to abuse or neglect the  			 consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advise the consumer to enter into a written employment  			 agreement with the worker that allows termination of employment at  			 will</strong>. States should advise the consumer and the worker to execute a  			 written employment agreement that clearly states that the consumer may  			 terminate the worker's employment at will. The agreement can also include a  			 provision requiring the worker and/or the consumer to provide advance notice of  			 termination without undercutting the consumer's right to terminate the worker's  			 employment at will. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide information and training regarding employment laws  			 that apply to the consumer</strong>. As part of the consumer's orientation or  			 training, the consultant can include information regarding any state employment  			 laws, such as the state anti-discrimination law, that are applicable to the  			 consumer, and can advise the consumer regarding steps that can be taken to  			 avoid liability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionVII.C" id="sectionVII.C">C. Authorized  		Representatives</a></h3>
<p> Although the liability risks listed below are real, in most cases  		authorized representatives will be relatives or friends whose caregiving  		commitment will be high, as will their level of integrity in performing their  		duties. Such individuals may be informed of these risks, but they are unlikely  		to be deterred from acting as a representative by the threat of liability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Representative Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligence and for breach of fiduciary  			 duty</strong>. In addition to potential liability for negligence (that is,  			 failure to exercise ordinary care) in performing the duties of an authorized  			 representative, an authorized representative may well have a heightened  			 "fiduciary duty" to the consumer. However, in most cases authorized  			 representatives are relatives or friends whose caregiving commitment is high,  			 as is their level of care in performing their duties, thus significantly  			 reducing the likelihood of negligence or breach of fiduciary duty (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent hiring of a worker</strong>. The  			 parent or other legally responsible person who is acting as the consumer's  			 authorized representative could be liable for injuries or damage to a third  			 party that results from a worker's failure to properly supervise or care for  			 the consumer. However, case law on negligent hiring and parental liability  			 strongly suggests that the authorized representative would be liable only if  			 the representative: (1) knew or should have known that the consumer was likely  			 to cause such damage or injuries; and (2) the authorized representative was  			 negligent in hiring the personal assistant responsible for the supervision or  			 care of the consumer The risk of liability is relatively low (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability as the employer of the worker</strong>. The  			 authorized representative normally will be considered the joint employer, or  			 the sole employer of the worker if the consumer has no ability to self-direct  			 his or her care, and therefore will have potential employment related liability  			 (see <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.B.3">Section II.B.3</a>), including vicarious  			 liability for torts committed by the worker that cause injury to third  			 parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for abuse, neglect or exploitation of the  			 consumer</strong>. In states that provide for a civil cause of action for abuse  			 of a vulnerable adult, the representative may be liable to the consumer if the  			 representative abuses, neglects or exploits consumer. The representative could  			 also be criminally liable. Again, this is a very low-incidence risk. Finally,  			 the representative may be a mandatory reporter under the state APS law (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionII.D">Section  			 II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Options to Address Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Fully inform the authorized representative of the liability  			 risks</strong>. The authorized representative can be fully informed of each of  			 these liability risks as part of the screening process for authorized  			 representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document that the authorized representative has been  			 informed of and agrees to these risks</strong>. It is desirable that the  			 authorized representative sign a written document in which the representative  			 agrees to assume the duties and responsibilities of an authorized  			 representative. This document should include a description of the  			 responsibilities and risks associated with the role of an authorized  			 representative.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note534">534</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow the same options for consumers, as  			 appropriate</strong>. The options for addressing liability risks for consumers  			 apply to authorized representatives to the extent that they act in place of the  			 consumer.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionVII.D" id="sectionVII.D">D. Fiscal Agents</a></h3>
<p> For fiscal agents, the risk of personal injury liability is very  		limited. The possible theories of liability are speculative and difficult to  		prove, and even if the plaintiff is nonetheless successful, the amount of  		damages a consumer or worker will be able to recover is probably small. Thus,  		it is unlikely that a consumer or worker will find it worthwhile to pursue a  		legal action against a fiscal agent. </p>
<p><strong><em>FA Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability to consumers for breach of contract</strong>. In  			 some states, the fiscal agent enters into an agreement directly with the  			 consumer, creating the possibility of a breach of contract action by the  			 consumer if the FA fails to issue a paycheck to the worker and the consumer  			 loses the worker's services and suffers injury as a result. However, the  			 possible theories of liability are speculative and difficult to prove, and even  			 if the plaintiff is nonetheless successful, the amount of damages a consumer or  			 worker will be able to recover for breach of contract is likely to be  			 insignificant (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.A">Section III.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tort liability to consumers and workers for failure to pay  			 worker</strong>. Negligence resulting in failure to pay the worker could also  			 give rise to a tort action by the worker or the consumer. Here, too, there are  			 also serious legal obstacles to these claims, such as the difficulty of proving  			 causation, and in any case, the amount of damages at stake are speculative at  			 best (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.B">Section III.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability to consumers for negligent monitoring</strong>. A  			 fiscal agent's negligence in monitoring a consumer's expenses and detecting  			 problems could result in negative consequences for the consumer such as  			 dis-enrollment from the CDPAS program, but here again there are serious legal  			 obstacles to recovery, most notably the consumer's contributory negligence in  			 deviating from the spending plan (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.C">Section  			 III.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A  			 fiscal agent may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective  			 services (APS) law and may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for  			 failure to report abuse, neglect, or exploitation that comes to attention of  			 the FA. Liability can easily be avoided by complying with any applicable APS  			 reporting requirements (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIII.D">Section III.D</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Options for Addressing Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Implement a quality management plan</strong>. The fiscal  			 agent should consider implementing and adhering to an effective quality  			 management plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utilize liability insurance</strong>. The fiscal agent may  			 want to obtain sufficient liability insurance to provide protection against the  			 possibility of a large claim. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek assurances from the state regarding the adequacy of  			 back-up plans</strong>. To protect against claims resulting from loss of a  			 worker's services as a result of nonpayment, the fiscal agent may want to ask  			 for assurances from the county or state agency that administers the CDPAS  			 program that effective procedures are in place to ensure that consumers prepare  			 and maintain an adequate back-up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check applicability of the state APS law</strong>. The  			 fiscal agent can be advised to determine the scope and applicability of the  			 reporting provisions of the state APS law and notify its employees of the law's  			 requirements if they apply to the FA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionVII.E" id="sectionVII.E">E. Consultants</a></h3>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, consultants, rather than the  		state, are assigned the most critical program functions -- assisting the  		consumer in designating an authorized representative and developing the  		spending plan and the back up plan; providing consultation with regard to  		hiring, training and supervising workers; and monitoring program quality and  		initiating action to correct problems. The way the program defines and  		implements these functions of the consultant is critical to the liability risk  		analysis, for liability risk follows function. For example, there is a point at  		which a consultant could become too involved in and exercise too much control  		over the delivery of services, such that a court might deem them to be real  		employer or at least co-employer of the worker. At that point, they would  		become vicariously liable for injury to consumers caused by worker negligence.  		</p>
<p> Fortunately, the risk of vicarious liability of consultants is not  		significant in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration, because the three  		programs appear to effectively communicate and follow the principle that the  		consumer bears primary responsibility for decisions regarding development of  		the spending plan and back-up plan and selection and supervision of workers,  		including hiring/firing, training, and scheduling of workers. This separation  		of responsibility should protect the consultant from being deemed vicariously  		liable for injury to consumers caused by workers or by deficiencies in the  		spending plan or back-up plan. Vicarious liability aside, consultants still  		carry some risk of direct liability for negligence in carrying out their own  		assigned responsibilities. </p>
<p> Consultants can effectively protect themselves against liability by:  		(1) being very clear in practice about staying within the bounds of  		consultation versus case management; (2) complying with program procedures and  		instructions carefully and executing all responsibilities conscientiously and  		with reasonable care; and (3) making it clear all times that it is the role of  		the consumer, not the consultant, to make decisions regarding the consumer's  		care.</p>
<p><strong><em>Consultant Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent designation of an authorized  			 representative</strong>. To the extent that the consultant takes on  			 responsibility for screening and/or approving an authorized representative, the  			 consultant may be liable to the consumer for negligence in investigating,  			 evaluating, or approving that selection if the representative is negligent in  			 performing his or her responsibilities or otherwise fails to act in the  			 consumer's best interest (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.A">Section IV.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent assistance in the development of the  			 spending plan and back-up plan</strong>. If the consultant provides inadequate  			 or incorrect advice, the consultant may be liable for negligent assistance in  			 the development of the spending plan or back-up plan. In states that give  			 consultants authority to approve the spending plan and/or the back-up plan, the  			 consultant may be liable for negligent approval of a deficient plan (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.B">Section IV.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent assistance in hiring, training and  			 supervising workers</strong>. Similarly, if the consultant negligently provides  			 inadequate or incorrect advice regarding hiring, training or supervising  			 workers, the consultant may be liable for negligence if the consumer who relies  			 on that advice is subsequently injured (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.C">Section  			 IV.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent monitoring</strong>. A consultant  			 may be liable if the consultant is negligent in monitoring program quality or  			 fails to initiate action to correct problems identified in the course of  			 monitoring, resulting in injury to the consumer (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.D">Section  			 IV.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A  			 consultant may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective  			 services (APS) law and may therefore face both civil and criminal liability for  			 failure to report abuse or neglect that comes to the attention of the  			 consultant (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV.E">Section IV.E</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Options for Addressing Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Implement a quality management plan</strong>. The consultant  			 agency can consider implementing and adhering to an effective quality  			 management plan. The quality management plan should include provisions to  			 ensure that the consultant follows all written procedures or instructions  			 regarding the consultant's activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utilize liability insurance</strong>. The consultant agency  			 may want to obtain sufficient liability insurance to provide protection against  			 the possibility of a large claim. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clearly communicate and document the consultant's  			 role</strong>. The extent and limitations of the consultant's role can be  			 clearly communicated to the consumer. This should be done both orally and by  			 having the consumer read and execute a Consumer/Consultant Agreement that  			 spells out the respective responsibilities of consumers and  			 consultants.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note535">535</a></font></sup> [See  			 copy at <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure that important decisions are made by the  			 consumer</strong>. In the Cash and Counseling model, although the consultant  			 can and should answer questions and facilitate decision-making by presenting  			 options, all important decisions should be made by the consumer. If the  			 consultant believes a consumer's decision is not just unwise but potentially  			 dangerous, the consultant can communicate the concern to the consumer, while  			 making it clear that the consultant is only giving the consumer advice and that  			 the decision is ultimately the consumer's. If the consumer disagrees with the  			 consultant's advice, the consultant should document the fact that the advice  			 was given and that the consumer elected to disregard the advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt clear and explicit criteria for the approval of  			 spending plans and back-up plans</strong>. In states that give consultants  			 authority to approve the spending plan and/or the backup plan, it is desirable  			 that the state adopt clear and explicit minimum criteria for the approval of  			 such plans, including guidance regarding the circumstances in which consultants  			 are authorized to override a consumer's preference and withhold approval from  			 the plan or to terminate the consumer from the consumer-directed  			 program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check applicability of the state APS law</strong>. The  			 consultant agency can determine the scope and applicability of the reporting  			 provisions of the state APS law and advise its employees of the law's  			 requirements if they apply to consultants.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="sectionVII.F" id="sectionVII.F">F. States</a></h3>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, the state's risk of  		liability for personal injury is greatly reduced. Most of the functions that  		were performed by the state or a provider agency in traditional Medicaid-funded  		home care services are now unbundled and performed by consumers (e.g., hiring  		and supervising workers), consultants (e.g., advising consumers and monitoring  		care), and fiscal agents (e.g., payroll services for workers). The core  		functions that continue to be formed by the state, such as enrolling consumers  		and responding to serious problems in connection with consumer care, carry some  		risk of liability, but if the state program is well structured and operated in  		accordance with that structure, this risk is minimal.</p>
<p><strong><em>State Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to obtain adequate consent</strong>.  			 State programs that elect not to screen applicants to determine whether the  			 applicant is an appropriate candidate for CDPAS risk liability if the state  			 enrolls a consumer without first obtaining the consumer's clear agreement to  			 participate in the program (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.A">Section V.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to adopt adequate criteria and  			 procedures for selection of an authorized representative for consumers who lack  			 the capacity to designate a representative</strong>. The relatively informal  			 criteria and procedures for selection of an authorized representative that are  			 now in effect in the Cash and Counseling states create the risk that the state  			 may be liable if a representative mismanages a consumer's care, particularly  			 the care of a consumer who lacks the capacity to designate a representative (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.B">Section V.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent response to a problem or complaint  			 regarding consumer's care</strong>. The state will be liable if it fails to  			 exercise ordinary care in responding to a problem or complaint regarding a  			 consumer's care. However, this liability risk is no different from that faced  			 in agency-provided care (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.C">Section V.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability as alleged employer of individual  			 provider</strong>. If the state is found to be the employer of the individual  			 provider, the state will be vicariously liable for torts committed by that  			 person while acting within the scope of employment and for worker's  			 compensation if the worker is injured on the job. However, in the Cash and  			 Counseling model, where the consumer, and not the state (or fiscal agent),  			 controls the key employer functions (hiring/firing, assigning and scheduling  			 tasks, training, and supervision), the risk of such liability is negligible (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.D">Section V.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vicarious liability for consultant's or fiscal agent's  			 negligence and other tortious conduct</strong>. Even though the state  			 identifies an individual who provides consultant or fiscal agent services as an  			 independent contractor, if the state exercises sufficient control over the  			 independent contractor, the state can nevertheless be found to be the employer  			 of that contractor and will be vicariously liable for the contractor's  			 negligence and other tortious conduct. In the Cash and Counseling model, the  			 state typically does not exercise such control (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section  			 V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability based on non-delegable duty</strong>. The state  			 will be liable if a tortious act is committed by the consultant or the fiscal  			 agent while carrying out a nondelegable duty of the state. The concept of  			 "nondelegable duty" has been used in those cases where a court concludes that  			 as a matter of policy, the government should be responsible for the torts of  			 independent contractors who are carrying out the work of or executing a  			 responsibility of the government. However, courts vary in how they approach  			 this issue, and the content of statutes or regulations setting forth the  			 state's responsibilities in connection with CDPAS is likely to determine  			 whether a nondelegable duty exists (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section  			 V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to provide effective emergency back-up  			 care</strong>. The Cash and Counseling Demonstration states required consumers  			 to develop back-up strategies as part of the planning process, but if the state  			 takes on a system-wide role in securing or providing emergency back-up, the  			 state will take on significantly greater risk of liability for failure of  			 back-up care, depending upon the level of responsibility and function assumed.  			 As in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration, the state could take on little or  			 no responsibility by placing the responsibility for back-up on the consumer's  			 shoulders. It could assume responsibility to make reasonable efforts to provide  			 back-up, and this could take myriad forms. Or, as required by the current  			 federal Independence Plus Medicaid waiver templates for CDPAS programs, the  			 state could be required to "assure" emergency backup care for consumers.  			 Undertaking a responsibility to "assure" emergency back-up brings with it a  			 high level of liability risk if the state's emergency backup system fails, and  			 the consumer suffers injury as a result (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.F">Section  			 V.F</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Options for Addressing Liability Risks</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Institute procedures to verify the consumer's voluntary  			 choice to participate in the program</strong>. The agreement of the consumer,  			 or the consumer's authorized representative, must be voluntary (that is, a  			 matter of free choice, which means the availability of traditional agency care  			 should be preserved as an option); the consumer should be fully informed about  			 relevant information regarding the decision to participate in CDPAS (that is,  			 all information needed to make a voluntary and intelligent decision); and the  			 consumer must have the capacity to understand relevant information and make a  			 choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider adopting more formal criteria and procedures for  			 the designation of an authorized representative</strong>. To avoid a possible  			 claim that the state's criteria and procedures for designating an authorized  			 representative are inadequate, the state may consider adopting: (1) a procedure  			 whereby consumers who have capacity can make an advance designation of a  			 representative to serve if and when needed; and (2) for consumers who lack  			 capacity, adopt the more formal procedures described in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.B">Section V.B</a>.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note536">536</a></font></sup> In addition, the state should consider  			 adopting heightened monitoring requirements for consumers whose care is  			 directed by a representative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt a quality management plan in connection with  			 consultant monitoring and the state's response to problems that are reported by  			 consultants</strong>. Because failure to detect or respond properly to  			 situations that present a serious threat to the consumer's health or safety can  			 result in a substantial damage award, it is desirable that the state define the  			 nature and frequency of monitoring clearly in program procedures and materials,  			 carry out the function as envisioned consistently, and act upon information  			 gathered in the process, especially if the information suggests management or  			 care problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid vicarious liability as the employer of workers by  			 following the Cash and Counseling model</strong>. If a state divides  			 responsibilities according to the Cash and Counseling model, there is very  			 little risk that the state will be found to be the employer of the worker.  			 Communication of the division of responsibilities is equally important and  			 should include: (1) execution of an employment agreement by the worker and the  			 consumer; and (2) consistent identification of the consumer as the worker's  			 employer on payroll records, government forms, and other documents. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize the risk of vicarious liability for the torts of  			 consultants and fiscal agents by avoiding indicia of an employment  			 relationship</strong>. The state can effectively protect itself against  			 potential vicarious liability for the torts of individuals with whom it  			 contracts for consultant or fiscal agent services by avoiding the indicia of an  			 employment relationship, such as the right of control over the manner, means  			 and details of the work.<sup><font><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note537">537</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take care to avoid assumption of additional potential  			 liability risks when drafting regulations, rules and protocols relating to the  			 CDPAS</strong>. As is discussed in the introduction to <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionIV">Section IV</a> and in <a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionV.E">Section V.E</a>,  			 the courts typically look at government regulations, rules and protocols in  			 determining the scope of the state's duty to its citizens, particularly its  			 vulnerable citizens. Therefore, when drafting such documents, states should be  			 careful to avoid inadvertently creating potential liability issues, such as  			 nondelegable duties or duties to undertake specific responsibilities in  			 connection with CDPAS, by including clear and consistent descriptions of the  			 responsibilities of both the state and of consumers, workers, authorized  			 representatives, fiscal agents, and consultants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negotiate an indemnity clause in contracts with consultants  			 and fiscal agents</strong>. To protect again vicarious liability for the torts  			 of consultants and fiscal agents, the state can include a clause in its  			 contracts that provides for indemnification of the state for claims arising  			 from the consultant or fiscal agent's conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enact legislation limiting liability in connection with  			 CDPAS</strong>. If liability is still a serious concern, the state can consider  			 enacting legislation limiting liability or providing for immunity in connection  			 with some or all claims in connection with CDPAS. This is the approach used by  			 California in connection with its IHSS program (<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#sectionVI.A">Section  			 VI.A</a>).</p>

One of the rare cases that falls  			 outside the three categories listed in the text is <em>Hayes v. Moss</em>, 527  			 So.2d 373 (La. Ct.

In <em>Hayes</em>, a home  			 care attendant sued her employer and her employer's mother, both of whom were  			 invalids, for back injuries she sustained when she attempted to lift her  			 employer's mother while the mother was visiting her daughter. <em>Id.</em> at  			 374. When the mother, who had spent the night at her daughter's house, called  			 out for help getting up from the floor, the attendant tried to locate another  			 employee to help her but could not do so. <em>Id.</em> The employee then told  			 the mother she would go get a mechanical lift, but the mother responded, "'No,  			 Ella, I insist on you getting me off the floor because you're big and strong,  			 you can get me off the floor.'" <em>Id.</em> The attendant did so and  			 immediately felt back pain. <em>Id.</em> After a jury verdict awarding $232,583  			 to the plaintiff, the employer's insurer appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 375. The  			 plaintiff defended the jury's verdict by arguing that the employer was  			 negligent in not having a second person available to take care of her mother,  			 "[t]hereby making the house unsafe because of [the mother's] condition."  			 <em>Id.</em> at 375. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the evidence  			 did not establish that the mother had a propensity for falls, that the daughter  			 therefore did not have "an obligation to have two people on duty when her  			 mother was there," and, in any case, the daughter's home was equipped with a  			 mechanical lift, which, if used, could have prevented the plaintiff's injury.  			 <em>Id.</em> </p>

<p><a name="note347" id="note347">Cash</a> and Counseling: A Second Glance,  			 <em>supra</em> note 253. In general, the state has the ultimate responsibility  			 for taking the necessary action to correct serious problems. For example, in  			 Arkansas, </p>
<blockquote><p> the counselor was responsible for helping a consumer identify and  				carry out his or her own wishes, but not for the consumer's well-being, even if  				that was adversely affected by the consumer's own decisions. A counselor who  				was concerned about consumer safety or well-being was to report these concerns  				to the state, which decided how to proceed. In such a situation, the state  				might (1) order intensive monitoring of the case to better access the  				situation, (2) or problem solving to resolve it, or (3) mandate that a consumer  				return to the traditional program. Thus, final responsibility for solving  				problematic situations rested with the state of Arkansas, not with counselors  				or counseling/fiscal agencies.</p>

<p>In some states, consultants may also be given responsibility for  			 monitoring a consumer's expenditures to make sure they are consistent with the  			 spending plan and do not exceed the consumer's budget. For example, in New  			 Jersey, the training manual for consultants describes the "Consultant's Role in  			 Monitoring" and states that consultants should check every three months and  			 answer the following questions: "Are participants needs met?" "Does cash  			 benefits level have to be adjusted?" "Is there any misuse of funds?"

However, in <em>Pettit,</em> there were  			 indicia that the state was the employer that would not be present in the Cash  			 and Counseling states (for example, the provider's "job tasks were set out in  			 an agreement between Pettit and DSS," 544 N.W.2d 859), and in <em>Reeder,</em>  			 the court did not consider the possibility that Perales was an employee of the  			 consumer, rather than an independent contractor or an employee of the state,  			 because neither party raised this issue before the court.

<td><font>Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS),  			 county, and caregiver</font></td>
<td><font>Court of Appeals</font></td>
<td><font>Through the Community Options Program Entry System,  			 a Medicaid waiver program, the state's DSHS paid for the consumer to receive  			 personal care from an in-home caregiver. Prior to this, the consumer had lived  			 in a nursing facility and was monitored by a DSHS caseworker, who arranged for  			 the transfer to in-home care and hired a caregiver for the consumer. The  			 caseworker failed to visit the consumer until more than a month after his  			 transfer, despite assurances that she would continue to be his caseworker, and  			 at this visit, she observed major adverse changes in the consumer's condition  			 and heard the consumer's complaints about his caregiver. The caseworker  			 transferred the case the next day to a county social worker who noted problems  			 that needed "immediate attention." Nonetheless, the county social worker never  			 contacted or visited the consumer. Eight days later, the caregiver called  			 because of concern about the consumer's condition and was told to call 911. The  			 consumer was admitted to the ER with multiple critical problems. The consumer  			 settled with DSHS prior to trial. At trial, the jury returned a verdict finding  			 that the county, DSHS, and the caregiver were negligent and proximately caused  			 consumer's injuries. </font></td>
<td><font>On appeal, the county contended "that it owed  			 Caulfield no duty because it was immune under the public duty doctrine and  			 Caulfield never showed that one of the exceptions to the public duty doctrine  			 applied." The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the special relationship  			 exception to the public duty doctrine applied: "Caulfield's relationship with  			 his County case manager involved an element of 'entrustment' by virtue of the  			 dependent and protective nature of the relationship.... Given Caulfield's  			 inability to take care of himself, the case manager's responsibility for  			 establishing and monitoring his in-home care plan took on great  			 significance....This responsibility gave rise to a duty to protect Caulfield  			 and other similarly vulnerable clients from the tortious acts of others,  			 especially when a case manager knows or should know that serious neglect is  			 occurring. This duty is limited by the ordinary care a case manager would take  			 in similar situations and by the concept of foreseeability."</font></td>
<td><font>P Jury verdict for the consumer  			 upheld.</font></td>
<td><font>The court found that the "special relationship"  			 exception existed under both state law and the Restatement (2d) of Torts  			 §315 (1965) ("There is no duty...unless (a) a special relation exists  			 between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to  			 control the third person's conduct, or (b) a special relation exists between  			 the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.")

Both  			 the county and the home care agency terminated their services because they  			 believed the patient needed more intensive care than they were able to provide.  			 The trial court (TC) ordered the defendants to continue services. However, it  			 is unclear from the opinion what was the legal basis for the plaintiff's claims  			 and the TC "cited no authority for his action."</font></td>
<td><font>On appeal, the county pointed "to the well  			 recognized principle that actions of a public body, particularly within its  			 field of expertise, are entitled to a presumption of validity." However, the  			 appellate court was "persuaded that the real issue is the right of these  			 medical providers to withdraw from a case when in their professional opinion it  			 would be improper and unsafe to continue." The appellate court ruled that if on  			 remand the county and the agency still wished to withdraw home care services,  			 they should be permitted to do so, but the court's ruling relies on the  			 agreement by the county department of health at oral argument that it "accepted  			 the responsibility for arranging continuing care" and the county's  			 representation to the court that space for the plaintiff was available in a  			 nursing home. </font></td>
<td><font>Ds County not required to continue providing  			 home care services.</font></td>
<td><font>The appellate court deferred to the county's  			 medical judgment because it did not "abandon" the patient: "If defendants, or  			 either of them, feel that in the professional judgment of the nurses who must  			 manage the case, they cannot properly and ethically continue their care,  			 provisions must be made to furnish plaintiff with appropriate alternative  			 in-patient 24 hour care or to furnish plaintiff with a reasonable time in which  			 to make his own alternative arrangement.

<h3>REPRESENTATIVE DESCRIPTIONNew Jersey Department of  		Human ServicesDivision of Disability Services, Personal Preference  		Program(New Jersey Cash &amp; Counseling Demonstration)</h3>
<p>A representative may be a participant's legal guardian, a family member,  		or any other individual identified who willingly accepts responsibility for  		performing cash management tasks that the participant is unable to perform. A  		representative must evidence a personal commitment to the participant and must  		be willing to follow their wishes and respect their preferences while using  		sound judgment to act on their behalf. Representatives receive no monetary  		compensation for this service, and may not serve as an employee of the  		participant.</p>
<p><em><span>Specifically, the  		representative must be willing to</span></em>:</p>
<ul><li>Work with the Cash &amp; Counseling consultant to provide information  		  to develop the cash management plan on the participant's behalf.</li>
<li>Use the cash grant for the items outlined in the Cash Management Plan  		  as the participant wishes.</li>
<li>Maintain records, as required by the State, regarding expenditures  		  and activity with the fiscal intermediary.</li>
</ul><p><em><span>Representatives may be  		necessary for participants under certain conditions as defined  		below</span></em>:</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary Representative</strong></p>
<p>The participant requests that a representative serve on their behalf, or  		a consultant recommends that the participant choose a representative and the  		participant agrees.</p>
<p><strong>Predetermined Representative</strong></p>
<p>The participant has a legal guardian or other court appointed  		representative in place at the time of enrollment and that individual will  		serve as the designated representative on the client's behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Mandated Representative</strong></p>
<p>The client is enrolled in Personal Preferences and has misspent funds  		from the cash allowance, or their functioning has deteriorated in such a way  		that they are no longer able to manage their cash benefit.</p>
<h3>PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUTHORIZED  		REPRESENTATIVENew Jersey Department of Human ServicesDivision of  		Disability Services, Personal Preference Program(New Jersey Cash &amp;  		Counseling Demonstration)</h3>
<p><strong><span>Voluntary  		Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>When a consultant determines that a representative is necessary for a  		participant to be successful, and the participant agrees, the potential  		representative will be identified and given the <em>Representative Description  		</em></p>
<p>to review. The consultant will interview the potential representative and  		complete the <em>Representative Screening Questionnaire. </em>If the potential  		representative volunteers to serve, then the <em>Designation of Authorized  		Representative Form </em>will be signed and witnessed. A copy will be  		maintained in the participant file and the original forwarded to the State  		Program Office.</p>
<p>If the participant cannot identify a person to serve as their  		representative, and have researched all known support systems, the consultant  		will call the State Program Office for advice.</p>
<p><strong><span>Predetermined  		Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>When a participant already has a legal guardian or other court appointed  		representative, the designated representative will be given the  		<em>Representative Description </em></p>
<p> to review and the consultant or marketer  		will complete the <em>Representative Screening Questionnaire. </em>The designee  		will complete and sign the <em>Designation of Authorized Representative Form  		</em>and will indicate that they are the court-appointed representative. A copy  		will be maintained in the participant file and the original forwarded to the  		State Program Office. The court appointed representative may choose to delegate  		this responsibility to another person, but that person can not be a paid  		caregiver.</p>
<p><strong><span>Mandated  		Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>In a circumstance where the participant has misspent the cash benefit or  		has otherwise become unable to manage the cash benefit independently, the  		consultant will advise the participant that they are notifying the State  		Program Office of the need for a representative. The consultant will ascertain  		whether or not the participant is in agreement and then notify the Coordinator  		of Counseling Services at the State Program Office immediately. The consultant  		will then notify the State Program Office immediately. The Program Manager and  		the Coordinator of Counseling Services will conference and review the  		consultant's participant file. A home visit will be made to the participant to  		determine whether or not an agreement can be reached. In those instances where  		a participant refuses to accept the designation of a representative and is not  		adhering to the policies of the program, the State Program Office retains the  		right to withdraw the individual and make arrangements for them to return to  		the traditional PCA service. The participant will be advised in writing of the  		decision and their right to appeal. The participant/representative has 20 days  		from the date of notification of disenrollment to file an administrative review  		of this decision. Administrative Review requests may be mailed or phoned to the  		State Program Office staff and must be postmarked or received within 20 days of  		the termination decision. All notifications of Involuntary Termination must be  		made in writing and sent by Certified Mail with a receipt to assure that the  		date the notification was received is documented. Requests received after this  		20-day limit will not be reviewed. Reviews will be completed and decisions will  		be made within 10 days of the request.</p>
