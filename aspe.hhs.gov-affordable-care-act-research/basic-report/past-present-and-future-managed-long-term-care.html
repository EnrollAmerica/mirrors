</dl><h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>A decade ago, managed long-term care appeared poised for dramatic  		growth, but despite significant activity in a handful of states, today only  		2.3% of persons using public long-term care services are receiving those  		services in managed care programs, and Arizona remains the only state that  		provides all long-term care through managed care. The number of enrollees in  		managed long-term care is likely to grow in the next few years. Texas has  		proposed a large expansion of its initiative. Other states with established  		programs, including Florida, Minnesota and Massachusetts, also expect growth  		but more incrementally and on a smaller base than Texas. States with plans to  		add managed long-term care initiatives in the near future include California  		(San Diego County), Washington, Hawaii and Maryland. </p>
<p>Managed long-term care suppliers are largely local non-profit plans or  		provider organizations that evolved specifically to respond to a single state's  		procurement. However, two national commercial HMOs, Evercare and AmeriGroup,  		have multi-state presence and account for a substantial portion of all managed  		long-term care enrollment. </p>
<p>Several factors have contributed to the slow growth of managed long-term  		care, including complex program design choices (including payment methodology),  		relatively long planning and start-up periods, resistance of long-term care  		providers and advocates, difficult state-federal policy issues, the need for a  		substantial population base, limited interest among potential suppliers, and  		inadequate state infrastructure in an era of government downsizing. </p>
<p>Despite these challenges, managed long-term care is popular in states  		where it is established and is likely to grow in the future. Studies of managed  		long-term care programs have been largely positive, finding high consumer  		satisfaction levels, lower utilization of institutional services and increased  		access to home- and community-based services. Cost studies have been more  		mixed, with no clear consensus emerging as to whether managed long-term care  		saves money for public purchasers. Savings notwithstanding, the budget  		predictability that comes with capitated payments is appealing to state  		policymakers as growing numbers of long-term care consumers place increasing  		pressure on Medicaid budgets. Evolving legal authority has resulted in  		simplified program designs and faster federal approval. Supply may expand as  		commercial HMOs experience aging members and add products to retain them, local  		plans attempt replication in new states, and Medicare Advantage plans  		experiment with the specialized plan provision of the Medicare Prescription  		Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. </p>
<h2><a name="section1" id="section1">1. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<h3>Issue Summary</h3>
<p>In 2003, about 3.1 million older persons and persons with physical  		disabilities received Medicaid-financed longterm care services (<a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table1">Table 1</a>).<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Just over half (55%) were in nursing homes and  		the remainder received services in community-based settings, either through the  		Medicaid home and community-based waiver services program or through a state  		Medicaid plan benefit, such as personal care services. A large majority of them  		were also eligible for Medicare. Total combined Medicaid and Medicare  		expenditures for these 3.1 million persons were approximately $132 billion in  		2003. Although Medicare does not pay for long-term care, its acute and  		post-acute care expenditures are much higher for long-term care users. Average  		expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries with ADL limitations (an indicator of  		long-term care need) are four times higher than for persons with no ADL  		limitations.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> The number  		of people using long-term care and their public expenditures promise to rise  		more rapidly in the coming decades as the baby boomers age and the number of  		non-elderly adults with disabilities increases. </p>
<p>Long-term care users need a variety of services across numerous settings  		(e.g., home, doctor's office, hospital, day center, nursing home), but in the  		Medicaid and Medicare fee for service systems, no single person or organization  		is responsible for or can impact all needed care, resulting in services that  		are often characterized as fragmented, uncoordinated and rife with unintended  		financial incentives. State home-and community-based services (HCBS) programs  		almost always provide case management, but the management does not extend into  		the hospital or nursing home when someone is admitted. Often, a community case  		manager learns about a hospital discharge after the fact, with no ability to  		ensure a smooth transition across settings. Avoidable hospital admissions,  		unnecessary use of nursing home care, and medication mismanagement are among  		the risks faced by the population. </p>
<p>The application of managed care strategies to aged and disabled  		long-term care beneficiaries holds intrinsic appeal. In the mid-1990s, many  		states were actively planning initiatives that would build on their Medicaid  		managed care experience to create managed long-term programs, but by 2004, less  		than 3% of the publicly-funded long-term care population received their  		long-term care benefits through a managed care program. </p>

</tr></table><p>Why has the market grown so slowly, and where is it headed? This study  		assesses the state of the managed long-term care market from the perspective of  		purchasers (states) and suppliers (managed long-term care contractors),  		addressing the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>What is the current state of the managed long-term care market?</li>
<li>What value do managed long-term care products offer relative to the  		  fee-for-service system?</li>
<li>What is the market outlook in terms of future demand from state  		  purchasers and supply from existing and new organizations? </li>
</ul><h3>Methods</h3>
<p>We define managed long-term care as any arrangement in which a Medicaid  		program contracts with an organization to provide a package of benefits which  		includes at least some long-term care benefits on a risk basis. The focus of  		the study is Medicaid-financed long-term care, though the discussion includes  		Medicare since most Medicaid long-term care beneficiaries are dually eligible.  		Thus the study includes both Medicaid-only programs and integrated programs  		that manage both Medicaid and Medicare benefits. We focused on older persons  		and persons with physical disabilities, and excluded programs that are  		primarily targeted to persons with developmental disabilities or severe and  		persistent mental illness. </p>
<p>We collected data from a number of sources. Site visits were conducted  		to programs in three states, in which state officials and managed care  		organization officials were interviewed. Telephone interviews were held with  		key informants in four additional states and at several national organizations.  		A literature review was conducted to identify studies of managed long-term care  		programs. Finally, descriptive information was gathered at the managed care  		organization level for all programs that met our definition. </p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the information gathered, the responses  		of individuals remain confidential. </p>
<h3>History of Managed Long-Term Care</h3>
<p>Most states have similar histories and concerns with Medicaid-funded  		long-term care. The 1970s were marked by large increases in nursing home  		expenditures and growing concern about the sustainability of a long-term care  		system dominated by institutional care. In 1981, Congress created the home- and  		community-based waiver option (HCBS waiver), allowing states to create flexible  		community-based services and cover them under the same financial and clinical  		eligibility provisions as nursing home benefits. The HCBS waiver program grew  		rapidly, from six states spending $3.8 million in 1982 to 48 states spending  		just under $1.7 billion in 1991.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> However, Medicaid nursing home expenditures  		continued to grow in the 1980s, from $10.5 billion to $17.9 billion, making it  		clear that HCBS waiver programs would not alone control the growth of  		institutional care. Despite efforts to control the supply of nursing homes and  		ease consumer entry into community-based services with "single entry point"  		systems, nursing home expenditures in the 1990s continued to grow more rapidly  		than Medicaid expenditures generally, limiting states' fiscal capacity to  		expand HCBS options. </p>
<p>By the early 1990s, managed care had become the dominant mode of acute  		health care financing and delivery in commercial markets, and states were  		enrolling substantial numbers of women and children in Medicaid managed care  		plans. A few early managed long-term care programs (Arizona's Long Term Care  		System, Florida's Frail Elder Option and initial PACE replication of San  		Francisco's On Lok program) had been implemented in the 1980s. The Social HMO,  		a Medicare demonstration that added a limited long-term care benefit to  		Medicare, had also been implemented in the late 1980s. </p>
<p>In the 1990s, a number of states wanted to build on their Medicaid  		managed acute care experience to add long-term care. Minnesota, Colorado and  		Wisconsin were among the states that provided leadership by developing  		innovative models that borrowed concepts from PACE, ALTCS and S/HMO. Minnesota  		was the first state to implement a fully integrated model that combines both  		Medicare and Medicaid financing for the entire spectrum of older people, from  		well to frail. After many years in development, the Minnesota Senior Health  		Options (MSHO) program was implemented in 1997 under a combined Section 1115  		Medicaid demonstration waiver and Section 222 Medicare payment waiver. A key  		design feature of MSHO is the employment of a single contract between the state  		and the MSHO plans for both Medicare and Medicaid terms and conditions. A  		significant effort was made during the MSHO development process to "align"  		Medicare and Medicaid managed care requirements into a comprehensive and  		uniform contract. (Based on its experience with MSHO, Minnesota implemented a  		similar program for people with physical disabilities--the Minnesota Disability  		Health Options (MnDHO) Program--in 2001.) </p>
<p>Many states demonstrated considerable interest in launching  		Minnesota-like initiatives in the mid-1990s, and the Robert Wood Johnson  		Foundation supported a number of planning and development grants in this area  		through the Medicare/Medicaid Integration Program (MMIP) at the University of  		Maryland, which served as a focal point for research and collaboration among  		states for program development activities. </p>
<p>With funding from the Commonwealth Fund, New York State supported  		demonstration programs in managed long-term care beginning in 1994. In 1997,  		New York consolidated its PACE and other managed long-term care plans under one  		legislative authority. The legislation is flexible, and plan sponsors can  		develop varying models of delivery and financing. Currently, there are 15  		separate managed long-term care plans operating under the authority. Four of  		the 15 are fully certified PACE sites, and a fifth is a partially capitated  		"pre-PACE" site. With the exception of the plan operated by the Visiting  		Nursing Service of New York, with an enrollment of 3,700 members, most of the  		New York plans have fewer than 500 members. </p>
<p>In 1995, the Texas Legislature authorized the development of managed  		long-term care pilot programs, which led to the implementation of Texas  		Star+Plus in 1998, the second mandatory program after ALTCS, but only in a  		single county (Harris). Unlike Minnesota, Texas decided to begin its Star+Plus  		initiative as a capitated Medicaid program, while providing beneficiaries with  		access and incentives to join optional companion Medicare managed care plans.  		This was a conscious decision by state program administrators to quickly bring  		Texas Star+Plus to scale as a mandatory Medicaid program, but incorporate  		mechanisms to integrate Medicare incrementally. </p>
<p>In 1996, Wisconsin began implementing its Partnership Program, a  		variation on PACE that includes both older and younger people with disabilities  		and allows beneficiaries to bring their existing doctors into the program  		network. Partnership began operating as a partially capitated Medicaid managed  		care program and added capitated Medicare benefits in 1999. When the  		Partnership Program was held out as a model for statewide comprehensive  		redesign of the long-term care system, advocates and counties opposed the move,  		and in 2000, the state instead piloted the Family Care Program, which capitates  		only long-term care funding. A unique feature of the Family Care program is  		that counties serve as the managed care contractor, accepting financial risk  		for meeting the needs of all persons requiring long-term care services in the  		county. </p>
<p>The creation of the Florida Diversion Program in 1998 added another  		managed LTC option to the already existing Frail Elder Option that had operated  		in Southeast Florida since 1987. The voluntary Diversion program was initially  		implemented in four Florida counties. In 2003, the Florida legislature granted  		additional funding to expand the program to cover 25 counties, and in 2004, it  		further mandated that the Frail Elder Option be folded into the newly expanding  		Diversion program. </p>
<p>While a number of states successfully launched managed long-term care  		initiatives in the 1990s, there were quite a few initiatives in other states  		that were not successful. A number of states announced their intention to  		implement managed long-term care programs, either on a demonstration basis or  		on a larger statewide basis, only to have the initiative cease at some point  		during the development stage. Two major challenges were: (1) resistance from  		long-term care providers and the aging network; and (2) lack of willing  		suppliers, particularly in rural areas. Long-term care providers, particularly  		nursing home providers, often saw the selective contracting aspect of managed  		care as an economic threat. Providers were also concerned about the delegation  		of Medicaid rate setting authority from state agencies to private contractors.  		Elderly advocacy organizations were often unconvinced that improved care  		coordination could lead to better outcomes for program participants. They  		feared that managed care contracting would result in reduced access to medical  		and long-term care services or that plans would pull out as they had done in  		the Medicare managed care market. Another occasional source of resistance was  		state workers, particularly if the initiative involved the outsourcing of case  		management jobs or other administrative positions to managed care contractors.  		</p>
<p>During the late 1990s, and early in the new millennium, there was very  		little activity in the managed long-term care market. Some wondered whether  		managed long-term care was an idea whose time had come and gone. But then after  		almost eight years of development, Massachusetts and CMS finally issued a  		procurement for the Senior Care Options (SCO) program in 2003. A key factor in  		these negotiations concerned the risk adjuster that would be used for Medicare  		capitation payments for SCO members with long-term care needs. CMS agreed to  		use the PACE risk adjuster of 2.39 for this group. Another key provision of the  		agreement was that CMS and Massachusetts would jointly negotiate the Medicare  		contracts with the participating plans. In 2003, Massachusetts selected three  		plans to participate in the SCO program, and enrollment in the program began in  		early 2004. </p>
<h3>Current Status of the Managed Long-Term Care Market</h3>
<p><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table2">Table 2</a> presents estimated enrollment in managed  		long-term care programs in 2003-2004. The estimates include only persons who  		are receiving long-term care benefits in the designated programs. For example,  		total enrollment in the Texas Star+Plus Program is approximately 60,000  		members, but the majority of the members are SSI Disabled beneficiaries who do  		not receive long-term care benefits under the program. Similarly, the Minnesota  		Senior Health Options Program enrolls "well" elderly persons as well as persons  		with long-term care needs. The <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table2">Table 2</a> estimates also  		include only aged individuals and adults with physical disabilities enrolled in  		managed long-term care programs, and do not include persons with developmental  		disabilities or persons with severe mental illness enrolled in managed  		long-term care. </p>

<p>Between passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Medicare  		Modernization Act of 2003, demand for managed long-term care came from 9  		state-developed programs in 7 states and 40 PACE or "pre-PACE" sites in 17  		states.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> Outside of  		PACE, program characteristics vary greatly, as summarized in <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table3">Table 3</a>. </p>
<p><b>Target populations vary</b>. Several of the programs examined include  		older people and younger people with disabilities. The most  		population-inclusive of these is the Texas Star+Plus program, which includes  		all adults who qualify for Medicaid by virtue of SSI status (Aged, Blind or  		Disabled). Other programs enroll only older people (Massachusetts, Florida  		Diversion, MSHO, PACE). </p>
<p>Another important population distinction is functional need. All of the  		programs include persons with very high functional needs who are eligible for  		traditional home- and community-based services (HCBS) waiver programs. These  		are persons at the high end of community services and costs. Some programs  		(ALTCS, Wisconsin Partnership, New York, Florida Frail Elder and Diversion,  		PACE) include <i>only</i> such persons, while others (MSHO, MnDHO, Star+Plus,  		SCO) include persons with the entire range of needs, including those with no  		existing long-term care need. Wisconsin's Family Care program falls in between,  		serving persons who have a range of existing long-term care needs, including  		but not limited to those whose needs rise to the level of HCBS waiver programs.  		</p>
<p><b>Geographical scope varies, but the primary focus is on urban  		areas</b>. With the exception of Arizona, none of the programs covers all areas  		of its state. Most are limited to a county or multiple counties with urban  		centers. Most state and plan officials consulted believe that managed long-term  		care needs an urban base to be viable. Plans want a sufficiently large target  		group to ensure adequate volume, particularly in voluntary programs. They also  		rely on an adequate supply of long-term care providers to establish networks.  		In Arizona, rural counties are generally limited to one ALTCS plan, and it is  		almost always operated by county government. </p>
<p><b>Breadth of managed care benefit package</b>. With the exception of  		Wisconsin Family Care and the New York Managed Long Term Care Plans, programs  		capitate Medicaid-funded primary, acute and long-term care benefits for  		enrolled members. In Family Care and the New York plans, long-term care  		contractors are expected to coordinate with primary and acute providers but do  		not receive capitated payment for those services and are not responsible for  		them. Other service-specific variations exist. For example, Texas has a third  		party prescription drug vendor that it uses to reimburse all Medicaid  		prescription drugs, so the benefit is carved out of Star+Plus and administered  		separately by that vendor. </p>

</tr></table><p>MSHO, Wisconsin Partnership, SCO and PACE programs include fully  		capitated Medicare benefits in addition to Medicaid benefits. These programs  		were designed to include comprehensive care coordination for dually eligible  		members, who typically comprise more than 90% of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries  		and as much as 50% of younger people with disabilities. Most state officials  		interviewed expressed interest in the more comprehensive approach but cited  		long development time as a significant obstacle. There are also significant  		differences among the fully capitated programs, particularly in how they relate  		to providers. MSHO relies on participating plans to interact with and manage  		provider practice across extensive networks, while PACE more closely resembles  		a staff-model HMO, in which the key providers (members of the Interdisciplinary  		Team) are employees of the managed care contractor and are directly  		implementing the integrated care. The Wisconsin Partnership Program falls  		somewhere in between, with core team members on staff (like PACE) but including  		a network of independent practice physicians who must be oriented to the  		philosophy and practice of the program, and whose services must be integrated  		with those of long-term care providers via communication and education (as  		opposed to co-location). </p>
<p><b>Most programs are voluntary, but a large majority of members are in  		mandatory programs</b>. Most of the programs studied are voluntary for Medicaid  		beneficiaries, meaning they can opt instead for the state's traditional  		long-term care services. Many factors impact a state's decision on this  		controversial issue, including:</p>
<ul><li><i>Adequate enrollment levels</i>. A managed care organization's  		  ability to manage risk depends in part on being able to spread risk across a  		  large number of members. The three mandatory programs studied (Wisconsin Family  		  Care, Texas and Arizona) are also the largest in terms of enrollment, ranging  		  from 7,000 long-term care consumers in Wisconsin to over 23,000 in  		  Arizona.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> Also important  		  is having a program of sufficient size to warrant the investments in state  		  infrastructure that must be made to design, implement and monitor these  		  programs.</li>
<li><i>Consumer and provider concerns</i>. Consumers and long-term care  		  providers often argue for voluntary programs. Consumers of long-term services  		  often have established relationships with providers and fear that mandatory  		  programs would force them into new relationships. Providers fear losing their  		  ability to bill the state directly for services and being required to build new  		  business relationships with managed care plans.</li>
<li><i>Medicare</i>. As previously mentioned, PACE, MSHO, Wisconsin  		  Partnership and SCO were all designed with the specific intent to integrate  		  long-term care with acute services, making Medicare inclusion paramount.  		  Freedom of choice may not be waived in Medicare, so programs including Medicare  		  must be voluntary. </li>
</ul><p><b>Some states protect traditional long-term care infrastructure</b>.  		States also differ on how they treat traditional long-term care providers  		(including counties) under managed care. Most states expressed ambivalence on  		this question. A pure market approach would dictate an open and competitive  		procurement of managed care organizations and would give MCOs discretion to  		select and pay network providers as they see fit, allowing the state to focus  		more on outcomes and less on processes and structures. On the other hand, given  		the experience with Medicare HMO retrenchment in the late 1990s, states want to  		ensure that an adequate supply of long-term care providers will remain if  		managed care fails as a strategy. A few programs, like MSHO and the Wisconsin  		Partnership, have not provided any policy protection for long-term care  		providers. Texas, addressing early concerns of traditional long-term care  		providers, gave them three years of transitional protection. During that  		period, the Texas Star+Plus plans were required to contract with any willing  		provider that had been providing Medicaid long-term care services in the  		fee-for-service system. In Massachusetts, Senior Care Organizations are  		required to subcontract with at least one Aging Services Access Point (ASAP),  		the State's traditional portal for community long-term care services. </p>
<p>Another approach to protecting existing long-term care infrastructure is  		to ensure that traditional providers (including counties) can themselves become  		risk-bearing managed care organizations. ALTCS and Wisconsin Family Care both  		give counties, which had substantial stakes in those states' long-term care  		systems, first right of refusal to be MCOs. In Arizona, counties had been the  		primary funders and operators of long-term care services prior to  		implementation of ALTCS, and in Wisconsin, they had administered long-term care  		programs at the local level. In Florida and New York, certain long-term care  		providers were made eligible to become program contractors, giving them an  		opportunity to compete with HMOs and other managed care entities. </p>
<p><b>A seller's market to date</b>. Variation in the processes used by  		purchasers to select plan contractors belies the assertion that nearly all  		states have found managed long-term care to be a seller's market. Some states  		issue RFPs and others do not, but in most states, substantial behind-the-scenes  		work has transpired to ensure that states get an adequate number of bidders.  		Many states have had concerns during the development phase that "no one would  		come to the party." Some states have structured interim rates (to minimize  		start-up risk), some have developed special insurance rules to reduce  		capitalization requirements, and others have explicitly or implicitly linked  		bids on managed long-term care to more popular and profitable TANF or SCHIP  		contracts. There are signs, also, that future procurement may be more  		competitive. Officials in two states with planned expansions report that  		several new organizations have expressed interest in bidding on future rounds.  		</p>
<p><b>Why so much program variation?</b> The early managed long-term care  		experience reflects the variation found across state Medicaid programs  		generally. Despite sharing similar challenges in their long-term care systems,  		states are experimenting with several approaches. Several local factors appear  		to have influenced the policy and program designs of the ten programs studied.  		</p>
<p><b>When did planning for the program occur?</b> In the early 1990s, the  		Minnesota Senior Health Options and Wisconsin Partnership initiatives attracted  		much attention and excitement from other states. Both states proposed models  		that would fully integrate acute and long-term care by combining Medicaid and  		Medicare financing streams, and both experienced protracted planning phases of  		more than five years, in part because of difficult negotiations with HCFA (now  		CMS) regarding Medicare payments, complicated by Office of Management and  		Budget (OMB) concerns that the proposed payments would not be cost neutral. By  		the time Wisconsin and Minnesota implemented their programs in the late 1990s,  		states like Texas and Florida were considering alternatives to the fully  		integrated financing model that would allow them to implement programs in the  		short-term. By taking Medicare off the table and working with CMS to develop  		unprecedented approaches to HCBS waivers, these states were able to implement  		programs within a few years of beginning their planning. Rather than shutting  		the door on Medicare altogether, Texas included incentives for dually eligible  		consumers to join companion Medicare+Choice plans (now Medicare Advantage).  		About 3000 Star+Plus members are enrolled in the one companion Medicare plan  		that is currently offered by Evercare. <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table4">Table 4</a> shows how  		states have moved from more complex demonstration waivers to more mainstream  		statutory authority over time. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>What role has the aging network played?</b> The impact of advocacy  		from the aging network is clearly visible in a few of the programs. In  		Wisconsin, Area Agencies on Aging and Councils on Aging are operated by  		counties, which also administer local eligibility systems for long-term care  		benefits. When the State Department of Health and Family Services released its  		plan for long-term care reform based on the Partnership model of fully  		integrated acute and long-term care, aging and disability advocates organized  		strong opposition at a series of public hearings. They were concerned that  		integrated plans would be dominated by medically-oriented HMOs, and the aging  		network would lose its role in the system. The Department withdrew its plan,  		and the Family Care program was developed instead, featuring a prominent role  		for counties and limiting the program to long-term care. In Massachusetts, a  		network of Aging Services Access Points (ASAPs) serves a number of roles.  		Several are designated Area Agencies on Aging, and several are providers of  		care coordination, home care, and other long-term care services. Like the  		counties in Wisconsin, the ASAPs saw Massachusetts Senior Care Options program  		as a threat to their existing role and feared that it would be a medical model  		that would take long-term care in the wrong direction. The ASAPs appealed  		directly to the state legislature and emerged with a change to the program  		design that requires SCO contractors to subcontract with one or more ASAPs to  		provide community care coordination, in cooperation with the primary care team  		that will oversee members' care plans. </p>
<p><b>How active were long-term care providers?</b> Long-term care  		providers have had varying levels of influence on the design of managed  		long-term care programs. Early in the implementation of Star+Plus, Texas  		nursing home providers successfully lobbied to have their payments removed from  		the managed care plans' capitation rates for long-term admissions (longer than  		30 days). Other Texas providers (including adult day health and personal care  		providers) had expressed concerns that they would go out of business if the  		health plans chose not to contract with them, so the State required that plans  		contract for at least three years with all willing long-term care providers who  		had been participating in the State's Medicaid fee-for-service program. (Texas  		officials note that Star+Plus plans actually contract with more long-term care  		providers now than they did during the 3-year transition period.) In New York  		State, provider agencies were actively involved in developing the state's  		statutory framework authorizing managed long-term care, and all of the state's  		15 managed long-term care plans are sponsored by provider organizations. In  		Florida, certain long-term care providers are statutorily eligible to become  		diversion program contractors by virtue of their state provider licensure  		status. </p>
<h2><a name="section3" id="section3">3. THE SUPPLY SIDE: WHAT HAS EMERGED IN THE  		MARKET?</a> </h2>
<p>While purchasers (states) may be showing growing interest in the use of  		managed care models to purchase Medicaid benefits for long-term care  		populations, the future success of the market also depends upon the development  		of organizations that can provide what purchasers want to buy. This section  		examines the supply side of the managed long-term care marketplace. </p>
<p>In developing managed long-term care programs, states are seeking  		business relationships with managed care entities with expertise in the  		clinical and social management of long-term care populations. Traditional  		health plans do not possess expertise in long-term care, nor do their existing  		networks include the range of long-term care providers needed to serve persons  		with long-term care needs. On the other hand, organizations with expertise in  		providing services to long-term care populations tend to have little or no  		experience in managed care. Therefore, successful development of the supply  		side of the market requires the merging of managed care expertise with  		experience in the management of long-term care populations. </p>
<p>Consequently, two kinds of managed long-term entities are emerging in  		the marketplace: (1) managed care companies that are expanding into the  		long-term business; and (2) long-term care companies that are expanding into  		the managed care business. To date, the marketplace is dominated by the latter  		and this has had important effects on the overall success of the market. </p>
<p>We identified 67 different organizations providing long-term care  		services to aged and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries under risk contracts (<a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table5">Table 5</a>). The vast majority are small private nonprofit  		plans with total enrollments under 1,000 members. This includes all of the PACE  		and "pre-PACE" sites, as well as the Prepaid Health Plans participating in the  		New York Managed Long Term Care Demonstration. Most serve both aged and  		disabled populations, and a high percentage of the members enrolled in the  		plans are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table5">Table  		5</a> also shows that most plans serve an enrolled population that largely  		resides in community-based setting, not in nursing homes. It is fair to say  		that the current managed long-term care market is concentrated on the  		management of long-term care beneficiaries in community-based settings, not on  		the management of people residing in nursing homes. </p>
<p>There are only two major for-profit players currently participating in  		the market--EverCare and Amerigroup. Evercare, an affiliate of UnitedHealth  		Group, is the dominant player in the managed long-term care marketplace. It is  		the one commercial company that has clearly made a long-range investment in  		this product line. Evercare focuses exclusively on products related to the care  		management of frail elders and persons of all ages with physical disabilities.  		Its business strategy reflects a firm belief that government purchasers (CMS  		and state Medicaid programs) will increasingly turn to managed care purchasing  		strategies for providing integrated medical services and long-term care  		supports to frail elders, and Evercare's business strategy anticipates this  		trend. Evercare is aggressively pursuing new market opportunities in managed  		long-term care across the entire country, and is also working actively at the  		state and federal levels to increase market demand. Currently Evercare holds  		managed long-term care contracts (or subcontracts) in Arizona, Texas,  		Minnesota, Florida and Massachusetts, and is expected to bid on the upcoming  		expansions of Texas Star+Plus and the Florida Diversion Program. </p>

</tr></table><p>On the for-profit side, Amerigroup has emerged as Evercare's primary  		competitor, with contracts in Texas Star+Plus and the Florida Diversion  		Program. Unlike Evercare, managed long-term care is not the core product line  		of Amerigroup. Rather, Amerigroup is a publicly traded company focused almost  		exclusively on the Medicaid market, with a total Medicaid membership of over  		850,000 in 2003. Amerigroup's first entry into the managed long-term care  		market occurred in 1997 with the award of one of the Texas Star+Plus contracts  		in Harris County, where Evercare and Amerigroup are the only two remaining  		contractors (a third contractor dropped out of the program). Amerigroup also  		has a small plan in the Florida Diversion Program, through acquisition. Thus,  		Amerigroup represents a Medicaid specialty plan with a core focus on the "moms  		and kids" Medicaid business, but which has expanded into the Medicaid SSI and  		managed long-term care markets, building off its basic Medicaid infrastructure.  		Many of the managed care tools employed by Amerigroup in its managed long-term  		care contracts are variants of the tools developed for its acute care Medicaid  		business. </p>
<p>Minnesota state law requires health plans to be non-profit, and  		accordingly all three MSHO plans--Medica Health Plans, Metropolitan Health  		Plan, and UCare Minnesota--are non-profit. (Evercare participates as a  		subcontractor, in part because its for-profit status precludes it from  		contracting directly with the state.) All are Minnesota-based plans, which do  		not appear interested in expanding their managed long-term care business beyond  		Minnesota's borders. Medica is one of the largest health plans in the state,  		serving over 10,000 employers in Minnesota and bordering states. Metropolitan  		Health Plan and UCare Minnesota are smaller plans that are more focused on  		public programs, with Metropolitan being a spin off of Hennepin County  		government. While these three plans will probably continue to respond to future  		expansions of MSHO in Minnesota, they are not likely to seek contracts in other  		states. </p>
<p>Most organizations that have gotten into the managed long-term care  		business are provider-based organizations that have developed a managed care  		capacity. All 40 current PACE and "pre-PACE" providers are not-for-profit  		provider-sponsored organizations, generally integrated health care systems. All  		15 plans participating in the New York Managed Long Term Care Program (5 of  		which are PACE or pre-PACE programs) are provider-sponsored plans, including  		hospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies, and integrated health care  		systems. Similarly, the four plans in the Wisconsin Partnership Program are all  		community-based multiservice agencies that have decided to accept risk for the  		members they serve. Mercy Health Plan, one of three contractors in Maricopa  		County under the ALTCS program, also grew out of an integrated health care  		system, although it had some prior managed care experience. </p>
<p>A final group of plans participating in the managed long-term care  		market are publicly-owned plans. Pima Health System (Tucson) and Maricopa Long  		Term Care System (Phoenix) are the two largest contractors in the ALTCS  		program. Initially, these two plans were awarded exclusive contracts in their  		respective counties by legislative mandate. In October 2000, the Arizona  		legislature opened up Maricopa County to competitive bids, and now Maricopa  		Long Term Care System vies with two competing private sector plans (Mercy  		Health Plan and Evercare) for members. Three other county-based plans provide  		ALTCS services in six additional Arizona counties. In Wisconsin, all five  		Family Care program contractors are county-based plans. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that two out of the three plans submitting  		bids on the recently-launched Senior Care Options program in Massachusetts are  		start-up organizations. Senior Whole Health is a for-profit start-up company  		backed with venture capital, while Commonwealth Care Alliance is a start-up  		non-profit organization capitalized largely with charitable contributions. Both  		were incorporated for the specific purpose of bidding on the Massachusetts SCO  		contract. </p>
<p>In summary, the supply side of the managed care marketplace is still in  		the early stages of development. The market is dominated by one large  		commercial plan (Evercare) that is actively pursuing managed long-term care  		business on a national scale. Its primary commercial  		competitor--Amerigroup--builds off its core competency in Medicaid acute  		managed care, but tends to only compete in states where it has already  		established a large market presence on the "moms and kids" side of the market.  		Otherwise, the managed long-term care market is made up of a large number of  		relatively small provider-sponsored plans, as well as a number of public plans,  		largely county-based. There is no evidence that any of these small local plans,  		whether they are PACE providers or other provider-based organizations, have  		entrepreneurial ambitions to leverage their local expertise in other markets.  		On the other hand, the purchasers with the largest managed long-term care  		initiatives (Arizona, Texas, and Florida) tend to rely on for-profit plans to  		serve their markets. </p>
<h2><a name="section4" id="section4">4. WHAT VALUE DOES MANAGED LONG-TERM CARE OFFER?</a>  		</h2>
<p>Some observers have questioned whether managed long-term care offers  		value relative to traditional HCBS services. In traditional fee-for-service  		programs, long-term care is typically coordinated by a case manager who is  		involved in the development and management of a care plan. So what exactly does  		a managed care organization add to the equation? Information available from  		evaluations, studies and interviews with program officials remain inconclusive,  		but some important positive patterns are emerging. Most studies have found and  		officials report that managed long-term care programs reduce the use of  		institutional services and increase the use of home- and community-based  		services relative to fee-for-service programs, and that consumer satisfaction  		is high. Undesirable outcomes, such as higher death rates or preventable  		admissions, have not emerged as a concern. Cost findings are mixed and more  		difficult to summarize, though in general studies that examined the costs of  		Medicaid-only programs have found them to be cost-effective more consistently  		than studies looking at both Medicaid and Medicare costs for integrated  		programs. While a few state officials were confident that their programs  		produce savings, most were more circumspect, citing possible favorable  		selection (in voluntary programs), inability to capture savings through  		existing payment structures, and lack of adequate cost data as concerns. </p>
<p>Inconclusive results notwithstanding, state officials consulted for this  		study were largely positive about their experiences with managed long-term care  		and believe that it offers value. </p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p><b>Less inpatient care</b>. One clear outcome across several studies and  		interviews is that managed long-term care, like managed acute care, reduces the  		use of high cost services, including emergency rooms, hospitals and nursing  		homes. In an evaluation for CMS of the Minnesota Senior Health Options program,  		Kane et al. found that MSHO reduced preventable emergency room admissions,  		hospital length of stay and short-stay nursing home admissions.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> Similarly, an Abt Associates  		evaluation of PACE found decreased inpatient hospital admissions and days, and  		decreased nursing home days.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Similar findings emerge from Medicaid-only programs. The Wisconsin  		Family Care program includes only long-term care services; an independent  		assessor found in a pre/post study that hospital length of stay significantly  		decreased following enrollment in Family Care (although no change in hospital  		admission rates).<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> A  		Texas Star+Plus study focusing on Medicaid-only SSI beneficiaries receiving Day  		Activity and Health Services or Personal Assistance Services found reduced  		hospital length of stay and fewer emergency room visits.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Greater access to HCBS services</b>. There is also evidence that  		managed long-term care increases access to HCBS waiver and other community  		services. The ALTCS program has progressively increased the use of HCBS  		services over time by adjusting its rates to assume diminishing nursing home  		use. The Wisconsin Family Care independent assessment found that waiting lists  		for long-term care in Family Care counties were eliminated while the waiting  		lists in comparison counties continued to increase. The Florida Legislature has  		chosen to expand funding for the Diversion program while cutting funds for  		Florida's traditional HCBS waiver programs, reportedly out of frustration that  		past increases to the traditional programs have not had a proportional impact  		on waiting lists. The Massachusetts SCO program will maintain benefits that  		have been cut from the FFS MassHealth program, including vision, dental,  		podiatry and hearing services. The MnDHO program has assisted 61 persons with  		physical disabilities leave nursing homes by providing alternative community  		services. In Star+Plus, plans are required to screen every new member and have  		as a result identified and addressed unmet LTC needs. </p>
<p>People enrolled in managed LTC programs are generally not subject to  		caps on the number of "slots" available for HCBS waiver services. Plans have  		the flexibility to provide LTC services to members who need them when they need  		them, and have incentives to do so when community services can prevent or  		reduce institutional use. In contrast, a recent national survey of 171  		traditional HCBS waiver programs found that 69 of them had waiting lists. Among  		those reporting the length of wait, the average length was 10.6  		months.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>More flexible services, including consumer-directed care</b>. State  		officials report that capitated financing allows more flexibility in services  		than FFS. Examples include provision of pest extermination and air  		conditioners, items not generally covered in FFS systems. At least five  		programs (Wisconsin Family Care and Partnership, MSHO, MnDHO and Star+Plus)  		allow members to select and direct their own personal care attendants, creating  		a self-direction option within a managed care program without a need for  		additional waivers. In FFS, self-direction generally operates as a  		free-standing program that consumers must choose to the exclusion of other  		programs. </p>
<p><b>Lower consumer costs</b>. Until recently, savings to consumers have  		not been a widespread benefit of managed LTC, because many Medicaid programs  		offered full benefits without cost sharing in FFS. Recent fiscal challenges  		have made cost sharing more widespread and benefits less expansive in Medicaid.  		Minnesota and Massachusetts, for example, both enacted new cost sharing  		requirements in their FFS programs in 2003, but MSHO and SCO providers have  		agreed to maintain full access without charging co-payments. Another example is  		PACE, which does not require Medicaid beneficiaries to make co-payments,  		regardless of a state's fee-for-service cost sharing policy. </p>
<p><b>Streamlined access to care</b>. The most commonly cited goal among  		state managed long-term care program administrators is ease of access.  		Long-term care consumers find the fee-for-service system difficult to  		understand and navigate. Managed long-term care generally includes a care  		coordination mechanism to assist consumers and families with the system. While  		this is generally also true in fee-for-service HCBS programs, HCBS programs  		generally are not responsible for consumers when an acute episode results in  		hospitalization, often the time when coordination is most important. Managed  		LTC contractors, on the other hand, usually have financial incentives to manage  		transition periods because of their ongoing risk. (The incentive is greatest in  		programs with the most comprehensive risk designs.) </p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p><b>Cost studies are inconclusive</b>. In the first evaluation of ALTCS,  		McCall et al. found overall savings of 6% and 13% in 1990 and 1991, but nearly  		all of the savings were attributable to members with developmental  		disabilities, and the study was limited by its use of a different state (New  		Mexico) for the comparison group.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> Weissert et al. took a different approach,  		developing a complex model that estimated nursing home savings resulting from  		the expansion of HCBS services in the ALTCS program and concluding that about  		35% ($4.6 million) of estimated nursing home costs had been saved, net of added  		HCBS costs.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> A recent  		analysis conducted for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission by The  		Lewin Group estimated substantial Star+Plus savings if the program were  		expanded to 51 counties in metro areas of the state. Higher savings (8.6%) were  		projected for SSI beneficiaries under 65 years of age than for older people  		(5%).<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> In the  		Wisconsin Family Care Program, savings were found in four out of five Family  		Care counties ($113 per member per month less than FFS comparison counties),  		but overall state savings disappeared when the fifth Family Care county  		(Milwaukee) was included in the analysis. In all three of these studies, only  		Medicaid costs are considered. Given the high proportion of dually eligible  		enrollees, it is possible that Medicaid savings derive from higher FFS Medicare  		costs. </p>
<p>Cost studies that include Medicare are more difficult to interpret and  		no more conclusive. The MSHO evaluation found that Medicare capitation payments  		were higher than FFS payments among comparison group members, but State  		officials have pointed out the study was conducted in the post-Balanced Budget  		Act period. The BBA effectively decoupled Medicare managed care rates from  		fee-for-service, allowing capitated payments to rise above average FFS  		expenditures. In the Abt PACE evaluation, combined Medicare and Medicaid  		payments to PACE were found to be comparable to the fee-for-service  		expenditures of the comparison group. Analyzed separately, Medicare payments  		were found to be lower for PACE enrollees than for the comparison group, and  		Medicaid payments were found to be higher. However, the cost analysis was  		limited to the first year of enrollment. A subsequent evaluation is analyzing  		costs over a longer period of time. </p>
<p><b>Payment systems are imperfect</b>. Most of the state officials  		interviewed felt that they had not yet fully refined their payment systems.  		Texas has had concerns that plans within Star+Plus might experience adverse or  		favorable selection relative to one another. In 2003, the state implemented  		risk adjustment based on Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACGs), and in 2004 switched  		to the Chronic Disability Payment System. Florida reduced Diversion Program  		payment rates after determining that favorable selection resulted in  		overpayment, and has notified contractors that further reductions may be  		forthcoming. New York State believes that more study is needed to determine  		whether its managed long-term care programs are cost effective. Clearly,  		payment is an area of concern, but states believe that rates can be fine-tuned  		as better technology is developed. As long as utilization patterns move from  		higher-cost to lower-cost services (as they appear to be doing in most  		studies), the total costs of delivering care are probably declining. The  		challenge becomes one of appropriate pricing, in order to allow both purchasers  		and suppliers to share in the savings. </p>
<p><b>Budget predictability is a key attribute</b>. As the baby boomers  		move into retirement, states are searching for ways to better manage a growing  		and uncertain liability for future LTC costs. Managed care models allow states  		to share the risk of budgetary cost increases with its managed care  		contractors. As the number of people in the long-term care FFS system increases  		over time, a state's aggregate risk increases. </p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p><b>Clinical indicators mixed</b>. The ALTCS evaluation concluded that  		long-stay nursing home care was of lower quality in ALTCS than in the  		comparison group in New Mexico, based on incidence of decubitus ulcers, fevers  		and catheter insertions, though the authors note that the need to use another  		state for comparison was a serious limitation of the study. The MSHO evaluation  		found that quality indicators for nursing home residents were similar for MSHO  		and comparison groups, and that in general, MSHO resulted in modest benefit for  		enrollees compared to control groups.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> The Abt PACE evaluation was very positive,  		finding improved quality of life, satisfaction and functional status. The study  		also found that PACE enrollees lived longer and spent more days in the  		community than members of the comparison group.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> It is important to note that of all the  		programs mentioned, PACE has the tightest managed care model, including both  		Medicare and Medicaid and using a staff model to deliver most services. </p>
<p><b>Satisfaction mostly high</b>. Most of the programs have found  		consumer satisfaction levels to be high. MSHO, ALTCS and the New York Managed  		Long Term Care programs all report high overall levels of  		satisfaction.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note17">17</a>, <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note18">18</a>, <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> Satisfaction  		levels in Texas Star+Plus have been slightly lower but still favorable overall,  		and Star+Plus satisfaction levels have been higher than those of other Texas  		mandatory managed care programs that do not include long-term care or care  		coordination.<sup><font><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Enhanced accountability</b>. State Medicaid officials value being  		able to hold plans accountable, and being able to work with plans in a  		systematic way on quality goals, something that is not possible in  		fee-for-service, where multiple providers are providing care, but none are  		responsible for overall quality outcomes. In managed long-term care, a negative  		quality indicator in one year can be turned into a focused quality improvement  		effort in the next. By comparison, little is known about quality outcomes in  		the traditional HCBS program. </p>
<h2><a name="section5" id="section5">5. THE FUTURE OF MANAGED LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>After a lull in managed long-term care development activities over the  		last 6-7 years, there appears to be renewed interest among states. The Texas  		Health and Human Services Commission proposed a large expansion of the  		Star+Plus program to seven additional metropolitan counties and a request for  		proposals for bidders was issued in 2004. However, as of April 2005, the  		Star+Plus expansion was still being debated by the Texas Legislature in the  		face of strong opposition from hospitals, which claim they will lose  		significant Medicaid revenue under the plan. If the Star+Plus expansion were to  		proceed, it alone could double the number of persons enrolled in managed  		long-term care nationally. </p>
<p>Florida has also received legislative authorization to increase  		enrollment in its Diversion Program by another 3,000 members in 2004. Minnesota  		will also be adding a long-term care benefit to its mandatory managed care  		program for the aged and disabled (PMAP), which will make PMAP similar to the  		specifications of the MSHO program, except it will not attempt to integrate  		Medicare. At the same time, Minnesota is considering expansions of the MSHO  		program into additional counties. The Massachusetts Senior Care Options Program  		began enrolling members late in 2004 and, as of March 2005 had just under 1000  		members. The Maryland state legislature also recently passed legislation for  		the development of two managed long-term care pilots programs that are under  		development in 2005. Hawaii is seeking federal waivers to enroll all of its  		older beneficiaries and persons with physical disabilities into capitated  		managed care arrangements. Washington state is pursuing two programs that will  		include managed long-term care in the near future. Thus, we are seeing new  		states entering the market, as well as significant expansions in states that  		have successfully implemented managed long-term care programs on a  		demonstration basis. </p>
<h3>Key Issues Affecting Growth</h3>
<p><i><b>Issues for Purchasers </b></i></p>
<p>While there is renewed interest among states in managed long-term care  		expansions, they face important design decisions in shaping the structure of  		their managed long-term care programs. The question for states is not only  		<i>whether</i> to use managed care purchasing models for long-term care  		benefits, but also what kind of models work best. A number of these design  		questions are discussed below.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Complex policy and design questions</i>. The managed long-term  			 care programs that <i>have</i> been implemented by states and PACE programs are  			 highly diverse. Benefit packages, payment methodologies, target populations,  			 types of managed care suppliers, degree of competition, whether enrollment is  			 voluntary or mandatory, and coordination with Medicare-covered benefits all  			 vary from program to program. True to the nature of Medicaid in general, each  			 state has developed its own model specifications based upon local exigencies.  			 Given this diversity, states do not yet have the benefit of clear, replicable  			 program models to consider. Arizona offers an excellent example. Despite having  			 15 years of experience managing and improving a statewide program, other states  			 generally do not view the Arizona Long Term Care System (ALTCS) as a  			 transferable model. Since Arizona never had a Medicaid-financed fee-for-service  			 system prior to the implementation of ALTCS, it did not have to deal with the  			 kinds of political issues that other states typically run into during managed  			 long-term care program development. Furthermore, ALTCS still relies heavily on  			 counties as suppliers, an infrastructure that does not exist in most  			 states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Legal authority</i>. Legal authority for managed long-term care  			 programs has evolved in a positive direction from states' perspectives, but  			 difficult issues will continue to complicate program development. Medicaid  			 authority has largely been streamlined through the use of section 1915(a), (b),  			 and (c) waiver authorities, which allow states to meet most of their program  			 objectives without having to go through the far more rigorous requirements of  			 section 1115 demonstration waivers. For states that want to integrate  			 Medicare-covered benefits for dually eligible beneficiaries, negotiations with  			 CMS over special Medicare payments may cease to be an issue if CMS implements  			 the Medicare Frailty Factor for all Medicare Advantage plans in 2007 as has  			 been stated as a goal by CMS. The Frailty Factor has recently been applied to  			 Medicare payments in the PACE, MSHO, MnDHO, Wisconsin Partnership and  			 Massachusetts SCO programs. (The Frailty Factor is not applied to populations  			 under age 55.) Consensus appears to be emerging within these programs that the  			 frailty factor works reasonably well for older beneficiaries with long-term  			 care needs, and that it could become a mainstream alternative to negotiating  			 Medicare rates program by program. However, less likely to be resolved is the  			 issue of whether states can design programs that mandate managed care  			 enrollment for both Medicare and Medicaid. Many states believe mandatory  			 enrollment is necessary to ensure adequate volume and to attract suppliers.  			 Although states can require mandatory enrollment for Medicaid-covered benefits,  			 it is not permitted under current Medicare law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Payment challenges</i>. Payment rates remain a controversial and  			 technically challenging area. States with existing programs consistently  			 identify this as an area in which they expect to make further refinements in  			 the future. At issue is how a state can set a fair price in managed care when  			 the model is expected to change utilization patterns, making the historical FFS  			 data inadequate for setting price. If a supplier successfully provides care  			 more cost-effectively but is paid based on FFS experience, the state may not  			 capture the savings. Alternatively, if a state sets the price too low, it could  			 jeopardize program viability. When Medicare is included, a similar dynamic  			 exists between states and CMS, with each payer concerned that it pays more than  			 its share in an integrated program. One option is to create shared risk  			 arrangements, in which states, CMS and suppliers all agree to share profits or  			 losses in pre-established risk corridors. This issue is fundamentally about how  			 risk should be distributed across purchasers and suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Constituent concerns</i>. Political resistance to managed  			 long-term care from established constituencies in the fee-for-service system  			 has been strong. Some in the aging network have expressed concerns that  			 "private contracting" of the long-term care system will lead to reduced access  			 to services and lower quality of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Infrastructure Issues</i>. Most states have not made the  			 infrastructure investments needed to implement managed long-term care programs  			 effectively. In managed care, it is particularly important for states to  			 diligently monitor member outcomes, to ensure that managed care contractors are  			 not cutting services and costs inappropriately. Unfortunately, managed care is  			 often viewed by policymakers as a way of privatizing services and reducing  			 state infrastructure. As one state administrator put it, "we are not going to  			 take on a big new complicated program when we're losing staff and are under  			 pressure to find immediate Medicaid savings." Managed long-term care may  			 require states to <i>increase</i> administrative costs. For example, Arizona's  			 AHCCCS program has higher administrative costs, but lower overall costs, than  			 comparable fee-for-service Medicaid programs. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Supply Side Issues</h3>
<p>Suppliers of managed long-term care have and will continue to be a  		diverse group. The type of supplier a state uses will continue to depend on  		program model, political factors, and availability in the local market.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Local provider-sponsored plans</i>. The majority of managed  			 long-term care suppliers are small provider-affiliated plans that have decided  			 to enter the market for local reasons. In the case of PACE, new programs are  			 often initiated by the provider organizations themselves, not in response to  			 state purchasing strategies. In some states, providers have applied political  			 pressure directly to legislatures to ensure a role in a managed care program.  			 In other states, the implementing agency deliberately creates a role for  			 provider-based plans to ensure that traditional infrastructure does not  			 evaporate, to attract an adequate supply or to take advantage of the long-term  			 care expertise in those provider organizations. The challenge is to regulate  			 entities that generally have very little experience managing risk and very  			 little capital to establish reserves. Continued reliance on provider-sponsored  			 plans may result in the market being dominated by many small plans with low  			 enrollments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Start-up plans</i>. There is evidence that venture capitalists  			 are willing to invest in managed long-term care, but new capital will not flow  			 to this market unless investors believe that the level of risk is acceptable,  			 and there are reasonable opportunities for profitability. For this to happen,  			 investors must develop confidence in states as reasonable business partners.  			 Shared risk arrangements may be a useful strategy for attracting new capital to  			 this market. Also, venture capitalists are more interested in developing  			 managed long-term care products that can be more easily replicated across  			 states. Managed long-term care programs that are so state-specific that they  			 cannot be leveraged in other markets will not be as attractive to  			 investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>County plans</i>. The participation of county-based plans in the  			 managed long-term care marketplace is not surprising, given the historical role  			 of county governments in the administration of long-term care and social  			 service programs in some states. The concept of "risk" in county-based models  			 such as the Wisconsin Family Care Program is an odd one though, since it is  			 presumably county taxpayers (or politicians) who are at risk if costs exceed  			 revenues in those plans. While county-based plans appear to be viable suppliers  			 in states with a history of county involvement, their further development  			 remains local by definition and does not increase the number of suppliers who  			 are active on the national market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>National firms</i>. Only two companies have entered this market  			 on a national scale--Evercare and Amerigroup, with Evercare having a much  			 larger market presence. Why aren't more managed care companies interested in  			 this product line? First, entry into this market requires a strong commitment  			 to learning the business of long-term care. Managing long-term care is a  			 totally different business from managing general health care, and requires a  			 considerable investment of resources to develop the kind of management  			 expertise needed to be successful. Second, profitability in this market is, at  			 present, fairly unpredictable, given uncertainties about payment rates and the  			 abrupt Medicaid policy changes that can occur, especially during periods of  			 state fiscal stress. Third, there is no assurance that this market will grow to  			 a mature level, given its history to date. We are not likely to see more  			 national companies venturing into this market until there is a significant  			 increase in demand from states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Medicare Advantage plans</i>. Many observers predicted that the  			 managed long-term care market would grow primarily from Medicare managed care  			 plans developing "wrap-around" agreements with states to serve dually eligible  			 beneficiaries. While several Medicare plans have negotiated premium  			 arrangements with states to cover primary and acute cost sharing, none has bid  			 on managed long-term care products. The Medicare Modernization Act now offers a  			 new opportunity in the form of "specialized plans," authorized under the Act to  			 limit enrollment to dually eligible individuals (normal Medicare Advantage  			 rules requires that plans be open to all Medicare beneficiaries.) This  			 provision of the Act provides new opportunities for states to integrate  			 Medicaid and Medicare benefits for long-term care populations, without the  			 extensive use of waivers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After over 20 years of development, the Medicaid managed long-term  		market is still in a very early stage with less than 3% of the potential market  		enrolled in managed care. Although interest among states in managed long-term  		care purchasing strategies has been high, they have faced numerous barriers in  		efforts to implement managed long-term care programs, and many initiatives have  		been terminated during the development process. However, states which have been  		successful in implementing managed long-term care programs are pleased with the  		outcomes they have achieved, and are seeking further program expansions. After  		a recent lull in managed long-term care program development, it appears that  		there may be a significant expansion in the market over the next two years. The  		Medicare Modernization Act also provides states with new opportunities to more  		easily integrate Medicaid and Medicare-covered benefits for dually eligible  		populations. </p>
<p>On the supply side, the managed long-term care market is dominated by  		small provider-sponsored plans with small enrollments that have not, to date,  		demonstrated intent to expand beyond their current state borders. If the  		managed long-term care market is to expand to a mature level, it will have to  		attract more national companies that can operate in multiple states and manage  		programs with large enrollments. </p>

</ol><h2><a name="append1" id="append1">APPENDIX 1</a>: METHOD FOR DERIVING THE SIZE OF THE  		PUBLIC LONG-TERM CARE MARKET (as presented in <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table1">Table  		1</a>) </h2>
<p>Estimates of the potential size of the Medicaid managed long-term care  		market in FY 2003 are presented in <a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table1">Table 1</a>. The estimates  		are of the total number of aged and physically disabled Medicaid beneficiaries  		receiving long-term care services either in nursing homes or in community-based  		settings, as well as associated Medicaid and Medicare expenditures for these  		persons. The vast majority of this population is comprised of persons over the  		age of 65 who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. </p>
<p>We have excluded from these estimates persons under the age 21 receiving  		long-term care benefits, as well as persons with developmental disabilities or  		serious mental illness. About 90% of all Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing  		homes are over the age of 65. The age distribution of Medicaid beneficiaries  		receiving community-based HCBS waiver and personal care services is more  		difficult to estimate, but most likely includes a somewhat higher percentage of  		non-elderly persons. </p>
<p>In 2003, there were about 3.1 million aged and disabled beneficiaries of  		Medicaid-financed long-term care services. About 55% of this population  		received long-term care services in nursing homes, while 45% were receiving  		long-term care supports in community-based settings, either through the  		Medicaid home and community-based waiver services program or through the  		regular state Medicaid option personal care services benefit. </p>
<p><a href="past-present-and-future-managed-long-term-care.html#table1">Table 1</a> also estimates total Medicaid and Medicare  		spending for these 3.1 million individuals. We estimate total Medicaid and  		Medicare spending of $86.5 billion for Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing homes  		in 2003, and $45.8 billion in total Medicaid and Medicare spending for Medicaid  		beneficiaries receiving community-based long-term care. These estimates each  		include three components: (1) the cost of Medicaid-financed long-term care  		services; (2) the cost of other Medicaid services for long-term care  		beneficiaries, such as prescription drugs, therapy services, and Medicare  		cost-sharing; and (3) the cost of Medicare-financed acute care services. While  		Medicaid accounts for about 74% of total spending for persons in nursing homes,  		Medicare accounts for about 57% of total spending for persons receiving  		community-based long-term care. </p>
<p>Thus, the total estimated size of the potential Medicaid managed  		long-term market was about $132.3 billion in 2003. This averages to about  		$42,955 per long-term care beneficiary per year--$50,882 per person per year  		for nursing home beneficiaries, and $33,188 per person per year for  		community-based long-term care beneficiaries. </p>
<p>If we assume that approximately 90% of this population is dually  		eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, this group comprised about 6% of the total  		Medicaid population in 2003, and about 32% of total Medicaid expenditures. On  		the Medicare side, they constitute about 7% of the Medicare population and 17%  		of total Medicare expenditures. </p>
