</dl><h2><a name="strategy" id="strategy">RECOMMENDED STRATEGY</a></h2>
<p>The task force proposes a three-part strategy for the Secretary's  		consideration. The strategy is a comprehensive departmental action plan that  		addresses the prevention, identification and treatment of elder abuse and  		neglect in home and community-based settings and in nursing homes. </p>
<p>Despite increased media coverage and state and community concern, it is  		premature to try to develop a systematic legislative response to the problem of  		elder abuse and neglect because there is insufficient information and  		understanding about the nature and extent of the problem, how it is changing  		over time and its causes. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the interagency task force recognizes that there is,  		indeed, a problem. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Department to determine  		the barriers faced by practitioners attempting to cope with elder abuse and  		neglect and identify and disseminate strategies to overcome those barriers.  		</p>
<ol><li><b>Develop and fund a national research and data collection strategy.  		  </b>
<ul><li> The National Institute on Aging (NIA) with the support of the  				Administration on Aging (AoA) and the Health Care Financing Administration  				(HCFA) will initiate activities to set research priorities and address  				methodological issues related to the development of both a national data  				collection strategy and a research strategy The purpose of these activities is  				to develop a comprehensive understanding of the problem. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Develop and fund a hands on technical assistance and training  		  program. </b>
<ul><li>Each agency will establish a collaborative mechanism to determine  				the need for information, technical assistance and training in areas such as  				the identification and reporting of abuse and neglect, the investigation and  				resolution of specific incidents and the prevention and treatment of elder  				abuse and neglect. The mechanisms will link various agencies of the Department  				with elder abuse and neglect responsibility to: representatives of state and  				local government, the legal system, including law enforcement officials;  				provider and consumer groups; and practitioners who are knowledgeable about  				areas related to elder abuse and neglect. </li>
<li> Mechanisms such as workshops, regional conferences, agency grant  				programs and the AoA, HCFA and Social Security Administration (SSA)  				communications networks will be used to identify, develop and disseminate "best  				practices" to the elder abuse and neglect network. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Develop and promote targeted public education activities.</b>
<ul><li> These activities will include speeches and testimony given by  				Departmental policy-level officials, and development of the existing  				Departmental communications networks to disseminate information relevant to  				elder abuse and neglect issues. The activities will be directed to professional  				and volunteer groups that administer elder abuse and neglect programs. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol><h3>ACTIVITY 1: Implement a Research and Data Base  		Strategy</h3>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that the Department develop a comprehensive  		research strategy on the prevalence and causes of elder abuse and neglect which  		includes (1) the creation of a national data collection strategy on elder abuse  		and neglect and (2) targeted studies that will lead to a fuller understanding  		of the causes of elder abuse and neglect and effective methods for  		identification, treatment and prevention. This includes research that will  		pro-mote, for example, the identification of precursors of abusive situations  		and in-depth studies of specific situations and conditions related to elder  		abuse and neglect. </p>
<p>Both state and federal policy on elder abuse and neglect issues will  		benefit from a deeper understanding of its causes. A number of state-specific  		data systems exist but they are based on disparate definitions of key terms and  		geared to individual state needs. There is no uniform national system that  		allows us to address such basic issues as the extent of the elder abuse and  		neglect problem, who is involved, the nature and causes of abuse and whether  		the magnitude of the problem is changing over time. </p>
<p><b>Proposed Action Steps</b></p>
<ol type="A"><li><b>Convene a Cross-section of Federal, State and Local Officials with  		  Elder Abuse and Neglect Responsibility and Leading Researchers to:</b>
<ol><li>Review and critique the literature on elder abuse and  				neglect.</li>
<li>Formulate guiding hypotheses for collecting information based on  				the best available data.</li>
<li>Determine new data needs. For example, what kind of information  				is needed to understand and monitor the issue over the next five years? Do we  				need better information about abuse in all settings or only some?</li>
<li> Identify research priorities and key policy questions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>Convene Survey Experts to:</b>
<ol><li>Define the full range of behaviors and situations which should be  				included in studies of elder abuse and neglect.</li>
<li>Recommend data collection instruments and procedures that will  				capture the full range of elder abuse and neglect situations.</li>
<li>Identify data collection strategies, sampling frames, and the  				cost of alternative approaches for measuring the prevalence of elder abuse and  				neglect. For example, should we design a new survey, add on to an existing  				survey, mine state and local data? What are the quality and limitations of  				existing data?</li>
<li> Suggest appropriate scientific approaches for clinical trials  				and intervention research for elder abuse prevention and treatment.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><h3>Lead Agencies</h3>
<p>The National Institute on Aging, in close coordination with the  		Administration on Aging, the Health Care Financing Administration and the DHHS  		Task Force on Aging Research, will be the lead agency for the on-going  		coordination of this strategy. </p>
<h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
<ol type="A"><li> Conduct workshops to determine data needs and identify research  		  priorities.</li>
<li> Prepare a report that identifies the major data needs and research  		  priorities related to elder abuse and neglect issues. The report will be used  		  to provide survey experts with guidance they need to develop data collection  		  procedures.</li>
<li> Conduct workshops to develop data collection options.</li>
<li> Prepare a report that identifies and discusses the data collection  		  options available to the Department.</li>
<li> Prepare periodic syntheses of data to build an understanding of  		  elder abuse and neglect.</li>
</ol><h3>ACTIVITY 2: Develop State and Local Capacity to Address  		Elder Abuse and Neglect Issues</h3>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>Although data must be generated over the long run that will allow us to  		address elder abuse and neglect issues comprehensively, more immediate efforts  		are needed to assist states and localities to respond to the problems they face  		on a day-to-day basis. Each Department agency that serves constituencies  		vulnerable to elder abuse and neglect will develop collaborative networks  		linking them to representatives of state and local government, provider and  		consumer groups, and practitioners knowledgeable about elder abuse and neglect  		issues. Such a mechanism will allow state and community participants to  		articulate their needs and explore how we can best respond to those needs. </p>
<p><b>Proposed Action Steps</b></p>
<ol type="A"><li><b>Identify and Prioritize Information, Training and Technical  		  Assistance Needs.</b>
<ol><li>Participating HHS agencies will use the AoA Eldercare Institute  				on Elder Abuse and State Ombudsman Services to assist in identifying the  				information, training and technical assistance needs of the elder abuse and  				neglect network. The participating agencies will identify the primary methods  				to collect the data.</li>
<li> Based on this information, each agency will develop a plan that  				identifies and sets priorities for the topics of interest to the network. This  				information will be used to identify topics for the workshops and seminars  				cited below, set grant announcements priorities, and develop training  				materials.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>Convene Workshops, Seminars, and Regional and State Conferences  		  to:</b>
<ol><li>Share issues and problems around specified topics, identify  				examples of best practices, identify information and technical assistance  				needs, and locate innovative resources that can be disseminated to states and  				communities in response to their needs.</li>
<li> Identify methods for developing/disseminating information  				including use of state Offices on Aging, the elder abuse and ombudsman  				clearinghouses, SSA field offices, the Area Agency on Aging network, HCFA  				beneficiary counseling, eldercare coalitions, etc.</li>
</ol></li>
<li> <b>Incorporate Information and Technical Assistance Needs into  		  Agency Planning Process.</b></li>
</ol><p><b>Lead Agencies</b></p>
<p>AoA, in conjunction with NIA, HCFA, the Health Resources and Services  		Administration (HRSA), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Indian  		Health Service (IHS) will be responsible for coordinating capacity building  		activities which focus on elder abuse and neglect in family settings and in the  		formal home and community-based services system. </p>
<p>HCFA, in conjunction with AoA and HRSA will coordinate capacity building  		activities addressing elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes. </p>
<p>Each agency will develop plans for incorporating information and  		technical assistance needs into its discretionary program announcements. </p>
<p><b>Expected Outcomes</b></p>
<ol type="A"><li> Identify training, information and technical assistance needs of  		  elder abuse and neglect network.</li>
<li> Convene workshops/seminars or other types of meetings identified  		  above.</li>
<li> Develop plans to incorporate technical assistance and training needs  		  into each agency's research agenda.</li>
</ol><h3>ACTIVITY 3: Promote Targeted Public Eeducation  		Activities</h3>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>Public education activities need to be targeted to support state and  		community efforts to deal with elder abuse and neglect. In the short run, we  		believe the primary audience for public education activities should be  		professional and volunteer groups who administer elder abuse and neglect  		programs rather than the public at large. We do not think it is useful to  		transmit general messages of concern to the public without a concomitant  		improvement in our understanding of the prevalence and causes of elder abuse  		and neglect. This is particularly true in the area of domestic abuse and  		neglect where knowledge is extremely limited and the systems for intervention  		and resolution are not generally well developed. </p>
<p><b>Proposed Action Steps</b></p>
<ol type="A"><li> <b>Speeches, Testimony, etc. by Policy-level Officials</b>
<p>This activity will consist of speeches, testimony, etc. made by  			 policy-level officials such as the Commissioner of AoA, the Director of NIA,  			 the Administrator of HCFA and the Commissioner of SSA. These officials often  			 address professional groups that comprise the aging and health networks and  			 have a direct interest in the Department's elder abuse and neglect activities.  			 </p>
<p>The purpose of this strategy is to educate various professional  			 groups about: the magnitude, nature and causes of abuse and neglect; best  			 practices; and other issues of concern, for example, how to limit the use of  			 restraints in nursing homes, and how to improve the coordination of the various  			 members of the elder abuse and neglect network at the state and community  			 level. The strategy will also support a collaborative process with  			 professionals in the field to identify and resolve problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Federal Interagency Task Force on Elder Abuse </b></p>
<p>There are a number of Federal agencies with a direct interest in  			 elder abuse. They include the Departments of Justice, Housing and Urban  			 Development and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Many victims of'elder abuse  			 receive services from one or more of these Departments. The Secretary will  			 formally invite his counterparts to participate on an Interagency Task Force on  			 Elder Abuse. </p>
<p>The purpose of this strategy will be to encourage coordination and  			 cooperation across agency and programmatic lines within agencies. The strategy  			 win also serve to educate the various government agencies about programs that  			 address elder abuse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>HHS Communication Networks </b></p>
<p>The Department has an extensive communications network that links  			 providers, state and local officials and the elderly with HHS programs. These  			 communication links include SSA field offices, the State and Area Agency  			 network, the HHS regional offices, and the HCFA beneficiary counseling  			 mechanisms among others. These networks can be used as targets of opportunity  			 by each participating agency to disseminate information on specific elder abuse  			 and neglect issues. </p>
<p>For example: HCFA could include in its proposed guide to the  			 selection of a nursing home information to help consumers identify various  			 indices of potential institutional abuse. SSA, in collaboration with the State  			 and Area Agencies on Aging and HCFA, could mail out an information sheet to its  			 field office personnel listing the local numbers and responsibilities of  			 various agencies involved with elder abuse and neglect. </p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>Expected Outcomes</b></p>
<ol type="A"><li> This activity will inform a targeted audience about what is known  		  about elder abuse and neglect and what HHS is doing about the problem.</li>
<li> This activity will be implemented by making the Federal Interagency  		  Task Force on Elder Abuse a sub-task force of the Federal Interagency Task  		  Force on Aging that is chaired by Joyce Berry, the Commissioner on Aging. The  		  strategy will improve coordination and communication across agency lines  		  especially in the content of research and grants announcements that deal with  		  elder abuse. It will also move the activity beyond HHS and potentially broaden  		  the resource base available to address elder abuse and neglect issues. It is  		  hoped the result will be a systematic approach to addressing elder abuse and  		  neglect issues and firm commitment of funds by the participating agencies.</li>
<li> These activities can be implemented quickly within the current  		  framework of Departmental activities.</li>
</ol><h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND PAPER ON ELDER ABUSE</a></h2>
<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide background information which  		summarizes various perspectives on the definitions, incidence and causes of  		abuse of elderly citizens in institutional and domestic settings. Also, this  		paper will describe the range of programs, both in HHS and in the states, that  		address elder abuse. Finally, the paper identifies issues that have been raised  		by practitioners, policymakers and others which should be considered by the  		members of the Task Force on Elder Abuse. Among the issues are: </p>
<ul><li>lack of reliable data and a consistent data collection system; </li>
<li>lack of coordination among state, federal and local agencies involved  		  in elder abuse; </li>
<li>lack of resources to carry out existing mandates; </li>
<li>lack of accurate public knowledge about elder abuse; and </li>
<li>lack of a uniform definition of elder abuse. </li>
</ul><p>The public remedies for preventing and treating abuse in private homes  		are likely to be quite different from the remedies for abuse in institutions.  		The fact that the public pays for most of the care provided in long term care  		facilities provides a strong incentive for sanctions against institutional  		abuse. The result has been extensive uniform standards that address abuse in  		institutions. Abuse that occurs in private homes is less subject to public  		review and has comparatively fewer standards to draw upon. This paper addresses  		both types of abuse. </p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Although elder abuse is not a new phenomenon, it has only recently been  		recognized as a growing social problem. The increasing numbers of older people  		in the population, the success of the child abuse movement in focusing interest  		on family violence, and research findings and Congressional hearings of the  		1970s and 1980s have helped increase public awareness of elder abuse. </p>
<p>Elder abuse has long been a concern of various agencies within the  		Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). For example, the Administration  		on Aging (AoA) manages the state long term care ombudsman program which  		investigates complaints of abuse on behalf of nursing home residents. The  		Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) surveys and certifies the safety of  		residents and the quality of care provided in nursing facilities funded by the  		Medicare and Medicaid programs. It also oversees implementation of the nursing  		home reform provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1987 and  		1990. Other HHS components with some involvement in elder abuse include: the  		Social Security Administration (SSA), with its "representative payee" program;  		the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), which certifies states'  		compliance with the Keys Amendment standards for board and care homes; and the  		National Institute on Aging (NIA) which sponsors research on elder abuse. </p>
<p>In April, 1990, at a meeting on nursing home issues, Secretary Sullivan  		(DHHS) asked the heads of agencies that deal with elder abuse to collaborate on  		the development of an intradepartment strategy to address elder abuse in  		<b>both</b> institutional and home environments. He stressed that the group  		should develop a strategy that combines public and private resources at all  		levels of government--national, state and local. </p>
<h3>DEFINITION OF ELDER ABUSE</h3>
<p>There is no universally accepted definition of the phrase "elder abuse".  		Many definitions of elder abuse have been developed by researchers,  		clinicians, policy analysts and legislators, but these definitions generally  		reflect a single and, often, limited focus. The result is enormous interstate  		variation in the definitions, laws and reporting requirements associated with  		elder abuse and neglect. </p>
<p>In 1985, the American Public Welfare Association (APWA) conducted a 50  		State survey of state definitions of institutional elder abuse. Through a  		review of State statutes on abuse/protective services, APWA staff found that  		"abuse" usually refers to "any intentional act that results in physical or  		psychological injury to a resident in a long term care facility." They also  		determined that "neglect" refers to "a failure to provide for the care that is  		necessary to maintain the physical and mental health of the individual." </p>
<p>Domestic abuse has been defined differently over time by researchers,  		professionals and public policy makers. At the federal level, the 1987  		Amendments to the Older Americans Act focused on three major types of abuse:  		physical abuse; neglect; and exploitation. State statutes, however, vary  		considerably in terms of scope, definitions of the types of elder abuse they  		cover, and other features. </p>
<p>Some researchers maintain that the lack of uniform definitions of elder  		abuse have made it difficult to draw firm conclusions from research findings,  		and inhibited the development of a national database on elder abuse. Since  		legislative and financing decisions are integrally intertwined with how issues  		are defined, it is not surprising that the response to the problem of "elder  		abuse" is uneven in terms of public awareness, funding and strategies to assist  		victims. </p>
<p>Although it may be impossible to completely resolve the definitional  		confusion, an examination of the literature reveals that there are some common  		threads among definitions, which may offer a starting point for consensus. </p>
<ul><li>First, all discussions of elder abuse recognize physical violence as  		  abusive behavior. </li>
<li>Second, most of the literature includes a category of psychological  		  or emotional abuse. </li>
<li>Third, exploitation involving property or finances is widely  		  recognized as a form of abuse. </li>
<li>Finally, neglect appears as a category of abuse in most of the  		  literature. </li>
</ul><p>The challenge, of course, is to define these common components of abuse  		in a way that is useful across research, public policy and service delivery  		settings. </p>
<h3>INCIDENCE OF ELDER ABUSE</h3>
<p>It is very difficult to accurately assess the national incidence of  		elder abuse due to a variety of factors including lack of a universal  		definition, inadequate reporting, lack of interagency coordination and lack of  		national data on the number of substantiated incidences of elder abuse.  		Nevertheless, a review of available sources shows that elder abuse is a  		significant problem for vulnerable elderly individuals in all types of  		settings. </p>
<p><b>A. Institutional Abuse</b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Abuse in Nursing Homes and Board and Care Homes </b></i></p>
<p>There is limited uniform national data on the incidence of abuse in long  		term care facilities, but, based on the findings of numerous researchers and  		policyrnakers, both psychological and physical abuse appear to occur with some  		frequency. A sense of the scope and nature of the problem can be gleaned from  		several sources, including academic research, state and federal program data  		and a recent study by the DHHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG). </p>
<p>Karl Pillerner of the University of New Hampshire is recognized for  		having conducted the broadest study to date involving interviews with direct  		care workers. He interviewed over 500 nurses and nurse aides regarding  		incidences of physical and psychological abuse they had witnessed or committed  		over the previous year. Physical abuse was defined as an act carried out  		with the intention, or perceived intention, of causing physical pain or injury  		to another person. Similarly, psychological abuse was defined as "an act  		carried out with the intent, or perceived intent, of causing emotional pain to  		another person (e.g., threats or insults)." Among his most significant findings  		were: </p>
<ul><li>Eighty-one percent of respondents had ob-served one or more incidents  		  of psychological abuse during the previous year. Forty percent of the  		  respondents admitted committing such acts. </li>
<li>Thirty-six percent of the respondents had observed at least one  		  incident of physical abuse during the previous year. </li>
</ul><p>"Abuse occurs frequently in nursing homes," was a key finding reported  		in "Resident Abuse in Nursing Homes," a study conducted in 1990 by the Office  		of the Inspector General. In conducting this inquiry, the OIG interviewed  		Ombudsmen, State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit staff, and coordinators for  		complaints in nursing homes in 35 States. Those interviewed cited physical and  		emotional neglect, and verbal or emotional abuse as the most prevalent  		manifestations of the problem. The OIG concluded that the problem of abuse in  		nursing homes warrants further federal and state action. </p>
<p>In a review of the formal complaints filed with state Ombudsmen, the  		Administration on Aging found that one half the complaints involved  		resident's care (subsuming physical, sexual and verbal abuse or  		neglect) or "resident's rights" (which includes abuse by other residents, theft  		of personal items and violations of privacy, confidentiality, and civil  		rights). </p>
<p>A recent study done by California's Ombudsman program, the largest in  		the country, found that of the nearly 30,000 complaints received statewide  		regarding skilled nursing facility residents, one half involved potentially  		abusive situations (these included among others, alleged physical or sexual  		abuse, alleged neglect, alleged violations of resident rights, alleged thefts  		and losses). This is especially significant since California's Ombudsman  		program receives approximately one-third of the total complaints submitted to  		Ombudsmen in the country. </p>
<p>Finally, HCFA collects data on the frequency of nursing homes found out  		of compliance with requirements that residents be free from mental and physical  		abuse. The HCFA data show that less than 2 percent of Medicare and Medicaid  		certified nursing homes were found out of compliance with the requirements. It  		should be noted that these are facility-based data that may not accurately  		capture individual incidences of abuse. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Abuse in Board and Care Homes </b></i></p>
<p>Data regarding abuse in board and care homes are less available,  		although what is known suggests that the problem is at least as widespread as  		in nursing homes. Among the reasons for the dearth of data are: </p>
<ul><li>Definitions of the term "board and care home" varied from state to  		  state. </li>
<li>Regulation of board and care homes is primarily a state  		  responsibility, so there are neither national compliance requirements nor  		  national data sources. </li>
<li>There is a high level of interstate variation in licensure and  		  enforcement programs. </li>
</ul><p>Roughly two-thirds of board and care home residents are elderly and  		female, and, because of functional disabilities, must rely on others for their  		care and protection. In its recent report "Board and Care Homes in America: A  		National Tragedy," the House Select Committee on Aging concluded that board and  		care residents are frequently the victims of fraud, neglect and abuse.  		According to the report, of a total of 5,355 complaints of abuse in nursing  		homes and board and care homes reported by 24 states during 1987, 51 percent  		(2,724) of the complaints were in board and care homes. </p>
<p>The Ombudsman program is the only federal program authorized to  		investigate complaints in both types of settings. Yet, Ombudsmen contend  		funding levels limit the ability of most Ombudsmen to receive and investigate  		complaints in board and care settings. A cursory examination of data collected  		in states where Ombudsmen are active in board and care homes indicates that  		complaints of abuse and neglect occur at least as frequently as in nursing  		facilities. </p>
<p><b>B. Domestic Abuse</b></p>
<p>The absence of data also makes it difficult to develop reliable  		estimates on the prevalence and incidence of domestic elder abuse. While the  		prevalence of domestic elder abuse is not known, there have been recent  		national estimates developed on the number of reported incidences of elder  		abuse. These estimates are based on State data limited to "reports of domestic  		elder abuse" because there are no national data on the number of confirmed  		cases of elder abuse. For example, a report by the House Subcommittee on Health  		and Long Term Care estimates that about 1.5 million elderly Americans may be  		the victims of domestic elder abuse each year. </p>
<p>A study conducted by the National Aging Resource Center on Elder Abuse  		(NARCEA) shows the incidence of elder abuse is rising. NARCEA estimated that  		the number of domestic incidents increased from 1.6 millionin FY 1986 to 2  		million in FY 1988. These estimates were derived by applying the rate of  		reported vs. unreported cases developed by Pillerner and Finkelhor (1 in 14).  		NARCEA!s survey of the states disclosed that in 1988 there were 140,000  		reported cases of elder abuse. When this number is adjusted using Pillemer's  		rate of unreported cases, the incidence of elder abuse reaches the 2 million  		level. Nonetheless, many experts view these figures as conservative because of  		the gross under-reporting typically associated with domestic elder abuse. </p>
<p>J. Kosberg identified the following five reasons for under-reporting of  		this form of abuse: </p>
<ul><li>family secrecy; </li>
<li>acts that occur out of sight within family dwellings; </li>
<li>the elderly individual's reluctance to report abuse; </li>
<li>professional lack of awareness of the problem; and </li>
<li>failure of responsible persons to report. </li>
</ul><p>The NARCEA study also produced estimates of the major perpetrators and  		types of abuse occurring in domestic settings. NARCEA concluded that the major  		perpetrators of domestic elder abuse were adult children (30%), spouses (15%),  		and other relatives (17.8%). The major types of domestic abuse were neglect  		(37%), physical abuse (26%), and financial/material exploitation (20%). </p>
<h3>CAUSES OF ABUSE</h3>
<p>To develop a multi-pronged approach to eliminate elder abuse, it will be  		vital to identify and address its causes. In this section we summarize research  		theories and findings on the reasons why people abuse the elderly. </p>
<p><b>A. Causes of Abuse in Institutions and Board and Care  		Homes</b></p>
<p>Many theories have been offered about the causes of abuse in  		institutions and board and care homes. Some point out that <b>advances in  		technology</b> have increased the ability to prolong life. The result has been  		a medical delivery system pushed beyond its capacity to care for increasing  		numbers of "heavy care" patients. Such patients have more debilitating diseases  		that may require not only a more skilled level of care but also more assistance  		with routine activities of daily living. Factors such as inadequate staff  		ratios and high, turnover rates make it difficult for nursing facility staff  		and board and care home operators to maintain the level of care required for  		these patients. Studies of board and care homes showed that operators sometimes  		overuse and misuse medications, and inadequately supervise the dispensing of  		medications. In extreme situations in both institutions and board and care  		homes, the challenge of caring for large numbers of "heavy care" patients has  		resulted in the inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraints. </p>
<p>Another frequently cited cause of institutional abuse is <b>the over-use  		of poorly trained and poorly paid nurse aides and orderlies</b>. They often  		endure poor working conditions and long hours that create stressful conditions  		and become potential breeding grounds for abusive behavior. Respondents to the  		Inspector General's report on nursing homes cited insufficient training in  		behavior skills to cope with confrontational situations and the lack of stress  		management skills as major staff deficiencies. A parallel situation in board  		and care homes is the lack of training available to home operators. Because of  		increased acuity, more and more board and care residents have special needs.  		Often, operators are not able to provide the care needed. </p>
<p>Problems also exist with the <b>nurses</b> who staff nursing homes.  		Nursing homes usually pay much less than hospitals and provide fewer benefits.  		Some contend that this encourages high turnover rates for nurses who work in  		nursing homes with the result that nursing home nurses may be less experienced  		and have fewer qualifications than those in other health care settings. </p>
<p>Some cases prosecuted by the Medicaid Fraud Control Units show that  		<b>drug and alcohol abuse by staff</b> is a factor in the abuse of residents.  		Further, anecdotal information suggests that <b>staff who are victims of  		domestic violence</b> may in turn abuse residents. </p>
<p>Although there are many similarities in institutional abuse and abuse  		that occurs in board and care homes, there is one important difference. Board  		and care residents are often isolated and vulnerable without the protection  		offered by family, friends and the government regulatory apparatus. Abusive  		situations often occur out of the public view and as a result are more likely  		to be unreported. This environment makes it more difficult to develop solutions  		to the problem. </p>
<p><b>B. Causes of Domestic Abuse</b></p>
<p>As with many social problems as complex as domestic elder abuse, the  		causes cannot be easily determined. Pillerner identified five factors  		associated with increased risk of elder abuse. They include: (a)  		psychopathology on the part of the abuser, (b) transgenerational violence, (c)  		dependency, (d) stress, and (e) social isolation. An examination of these  		factors shows that they may be applicable in all settings where abuse  		occurs--the vulnerable elderly may be equally dependent in community or  		institutional environments and caretakers can be subject to stress or prone to  		violent behavior in either setting. </p>
<p>James Callahan (1988) points out that in early studies researchers  		agreed that victims of 'domestic abuse were <b>very old</b>, <b>functionally  		impaired</b>, and <b>abused by relatives</b>. Upon closer examination, Callahan  		found that functional impairment was not a significant contributing factor to  		incidents of elder abuse. Pillemer (1985) found that many cases of elder abuse  		occurred in situations where the <b>caretaker was financially dependent on the  		older person</b>. </p>
<p>If older persons are vulnerable because of the dependency of another  		family member, Callahan suggests that there should be further research into  		social policies that affect families. Along the same lines, Kosberg speculates  		that it may be unwise to consider families as an unchallenged source of care;  		instead, he believes each individual family should be assessed to determine  		whether it is the most appropriate and safest caretaker. Brackman and Adelman  		(1988) advise that each case of elder abuse should be examined to identify  		single and overlapping causes. Examination of the risk factors assists in  		determining the intervention methodology. </p>
<h3>CURRENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS</h3>
<p><b>A. DHHS Role</b></p>
<p>In this section we will briefly summarize the elder abuse policies and  		programs of key components of the DHHS. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Administration on Aging </b></i></p>
<p>AoA administers the Older Americans Act which requires State Units on  		Aging to establish and operate an Office of the State Long Term Care Ombudsman.  		The ombudsmen, who act as advocates for residents in long term care facilities,  		must regularly submit data on complaints and conditions in long term care  		facilities to AoA. Although the ombudsman program provides a mechanism to  		investigate and mediate complaints of residents of long term care facilities,  		it cannot enforce laws or initiate sanctions against the facilities. In  		addition, the program does not mandate that cases of abuse be reported.  		Instead, it relies on voluntary complaints made on behalf of residents. </p>
<p>In addition, under its discretionary program authority, AoA funds  		selected research, training and demonstration projects on elder abuse and  		supports two (2) National Aging Resource Centers with important roles related  		to elder abuse. </p>
<ol type="a"><li> The National Aging Resource Center on Elder Abuse is a joint  		  undertaking of the American Public Welfare Association, the National  		  Association of State Units on Aging and the University of Delaware. It provides  		  data and expertise on elder abuse, operates the Clearinghouse on Elder Abuse  		  and Neglect of the Elderly, publishes a newsletter and conducts special studies  		  on elder abuse. </li>
<li> The National Center for State Long Term Care Ombudsman Resources is  		  run by the National Association of State Units on Aging in collaboration with  		  the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform. The Center provides  		  training, technical assistance and information on the State Long Term Care  		  Ombudsman Program. It also provides assessments, analyses, and advice on elder  		  abuse issues in nursing homes and other institutional settings. </li>
</ol><p>In FY 1991, 3 million dollars was appropriated in Title III of the Older  		Americans Act for an elder abuse prevention program. An additional 2.5 million  		dollars was appropriated for the long-term care ombudsman program. A portion of  		this money was to be made available to the state long-term care ombudsman to  		address complaints in long-term care facilities, including board and care  		homes. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Health Care Financing Administration </b></i></p>
<p>HCFA is responsible for administering the survey and certification  		process for nursing homes and other long term care facilities funded under the  		Medicaid and Medicare programs. Thus, HCFA influences the quality of care in  		nursing homes because it sets the minimum standards for care for all certified  		facilities. It also provides the protocols for state licensure and  		certification agencies to use for monitoring and enforcing compliance with  		Federal and State standards. </p>
<p>HCFA also is responsible for issuing regulations to implement the  		nursing home reform provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA)  		of 1987. Besides establishing requirements for nurse aide competency and  		resident assessment, OBRA includes many other provisions directly related to  		the abuse and neglect of residents. For example, it includes provisions about  		the resident's right to be free from physical or mental abuse and creates a  		process for the receipt and review of alleged cases of abuse. It also requires  		the immediate reporting of suspected cases of abuse and the results of all  		subsequent investigations. It is anticipated that by establishing requirements  		and enforcement processes that focus on patient outcomes, OBRA 1987 will lead  		to improved quality of care in nursing homes. </p>
<p>HCFA will also have responsibility for developing and implementing  		regulations for OBRA 1990 which contains an optional Medicaid home and  		community care benefit for the elderly that became effective on July 1, 1991.  		The measure establishes minimum requirements for residents' care, sets  		standards for surveys of community settings in which care is provided, and  		requires the investigation of allegations of individual neglect and abuse and  		misappropriation of individual property. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Social Security Administration </b></i></p>
<p>In its function as payor of Social Security and Supplemental Security  		Income (SSI), SSA permits beneficiaries who cannot manage their benefits to  		have other persons act as their "representative payee." This includes adult  		beneficiaries who are unable to manage their benefits because of a mental or  		physical impairment, and SSI beneficiaries who are disabled by drug abuse or  		alcoholism. SSA administers the appointment of the payees, and conducts some  		monitoring of their performance. Many beneficiaries in residential facilities,  		particularly board and care homes, have representative payees (usually a  		relative) who provide them some level of care. </p>
<p>In 1989, at SSAs request, the Inspector General's Office conducted  		an examination of representative payees in the Social Security program. The OIG  		found that although there is anecdotal evidence of problems in the  		representative payee program, the problems are not widespread and most  		beneficiaries are well served. The OIG also concluded that SSA could help  		alleviate existing problems by strengthening its role in screening potential  		representative payees and monitoring their performance. Based on this finding,  		SSA has included in the Secretary's FY 1991 Program Directions an objective to  		improve the representative payee system. Although SSA does not have a current  		policy on elder abuse by representative payees, it will explore ways in which  		it can take a more active role in preventing the situations that contribute to  		the abuse of its beneficiaries. SSA will attempt to improve data collection on  		the system, expand payee outreach and resource development, and improve the  		monitoring of payees. </p>
<p><i><b>4. The Administration for Children and Families* </b></i></p>
<p>In 1976 the Congress passed the Keys Amendment (Section 1616(e) of the  		Social Security Act) in response to concerns about the living conditions of  		board and care residents. The Keys Amendment requires States to set and enforce  		standards for facilities in which substantial numbers of SSI recipients reside.  		Each year States certify to the Administration for Children and Families that  		they have standards in place for these facilities. </p>
<p>The only sanction for a facility that does not meet these standards is a  		reduction in the resident's SSI payment, which directly penalizes the resident  		rather than the facility. In addition the circumstances under which sanctions  		may be applied are not clear. Historically, the Department has not applied  		sanctions under the Keys Amendment. </p>
<p><i>*Previously administered by the Office of Human Development Services  		</i></p>
<p><i><b>5. National Institute on Aging </b></i></p>
<p>NIA supports several research projects that directly address elder  		abuse. These include a population-based study of abuse prevalence and one  		clinical investigation to develop alternatives to restraints in institutional  		care. The NIA research mission spans both institutional and domestic abuse.  		Less directly, the NIA supports a broader portfolio of research on elder care  		that is relevant to abuse issues including studies of the burden of care, board  		and care homes, characteristics of demented elders, and predictors of  		institutional placement. </p>
<p><i><b>6. The Indian Health Service </b></i></p>
<p>The Indian Health Service (IHS) is responsible for providing health care  		to all eligible American Indians and Alaskan Natives residing on reservations  		and historical Indian lands. The role of IHS in elder abuse is to provide  		primary, secondary and tertiary acute care, and preventive, rehabilitative and  		environmental health services. Information and referral services are provided  		when direct care is not available. </p>
<p><i><b>7. Health Resources and Services Administration </b></i></p>
<p>Two units of HRSA provide services and support that relate to elder  		abuse. </p>
<p>The Bureau of Health Professions funds grants for Geriatric Education  		Centers, Fellowships in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry and a variety of  		geriatric nursing projects. Many of these projects provide training for  		faculty, students and practicing health professionals in issues of elder abuse.  		</p>
<p>The Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance provides and supports  		primary health care to a wide variety of people. Care is provided and  		opportunities are available for addressing elder abuse through the Community  		and Migrant Health Centers and the National Health Service Corps. </p>
<p><b>B. State Role</b></p>
<p><i><b>1. State Units on Aging </b></i></p>
<p>In all states, the State Unit on Aging (SUA) operates the Office of the  		State Long Term Care Ombudsman. The SUA requires that the ombudsman prepare an  		annual report containing data and findings regarding the nature of complaints  		received. The ombudsman must also provide policy, regulatory and legislative  		recommendations to, address those problems. Further, the ombudsman must provide  		training to Office staff and coordinate ombudsman services with other  		protective services. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Adult Protective Service Agencies </b></i></p>
<p>State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies traditionally provide a  		range of services to vulnerable adults. These services are available to persons  		over 18 who are unable to provide for their needs and have no responsible  		caregivers. The APWA found in a recent survey that the APS agencies are the  		principal agencies responsible for the investigation and follow-up of domestic  		elder abuse cases and are also the primary agencies responsible for  		investigating institutional abuse cases. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Licensure and Certification Agencies </b></i></p>
<p>State Departments of Health and Welfare are typically the agencies that  		license or certify nursing homes and board and care facilities. All states must  		carry out survey and certification activities required by OBRA 1987. These  		activities may be done by a single agency or by several state agencies. </p>
<p><i><b>4. Medicaid Fraud Control Units </b></i></p>
<p>Medicaid Fraud Control Units exist in 38 states to investigate and  		prosecute provider fraud and patient abuse and neglect in health care  		facilities receiving payments under the state Medicaid plan. The units include  		attorneys, auditors, and investigators operating as a unit of the Office of the  		State Attorney General. Besides the unit's responsibility to investigate and  		prosecute Medicaid provider fraud, they have an equal responsibility to  		investigate and prosecute patient abuse or neglect in all health care  		facilities that receive Medicaid funds. </p>
<h3>LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS</h3>
<p>In this section we discuss five perceived problems related to addressing  		and eliminating elder abuse. The Task Force may have additional concerns to add  		to this list. </p>
<p><i><b>1. There is Insufficient Research and Statistical Data on Elder  		Abuse </b></i></p>
<p>Data collection and rigorous research on elder abuse are still in the  		beginning stages in most states. Consequently, there is a lack of data  		regarding confirmed incidences of elder abuse. Problems in gathering national  		data on elder abuse include the lack of uniform definitions; variation among  		states in the characteristics of persons covered by elder abuse laws;  		variations among states in the types of elder abuse covered in their reporting  		requirements; and inability of state data systems to desegregate data by common  		data elements. </p>
<p>Most of the current research on elder abuse is descriptive. While useful  		in shedding some light on the scope of the problem, it does not replace the  		need for analytic studies. According to Pillerner (1989), random sample  		population surveys and rigorous case-control design are sorely needed. He cites  		the most pressing need as information about the incidence and causes of elder  		abuse. Without this knowledge, he asserts, intervention is reduced to educated  		guesses and political compromises. </p>
<p>Schene and Ward (1988) note that once states start to generate accurate  		and consistent statistics, the magnitude of the problem can be documented.  		Also, trends in the data will provide a way to measure progress, keep the issue  		in the public eye, and help set a public policy agenda. Further, data generated  		will support research and provide the basis for preventive efforts. </p>
<p><i><b>2. There is a lack of coordination among the agencies responsible  		for reporting abuse, investigating and following through on complaints, and  		developing policy to address elder abuse. </b></i></p>
<p>A major weakness of current programs to identify, investigate and curb  		elder abuse, is that there is little collaboration among the myriad elements of  		the system. The result is a non-system, with significant instances of  		overlapping responsibilities, lack of follow-through and gaps between programs.  		</p>
<p>NARCEA recently identified <b>30</b> state level agencies that have  		roles in elder abuse. In its report on nursing home abuse, the OIG identified  		at least four state entities that might be involved in the resolution of  		nursing home residents' complaints. These were: (a) the complaint coordinator;  		(b) the Ombudsman; (c) the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; and (d) local law  		enforcement officials. However, the OIG noted that <b>no single state or  		federal agency has the responsibility for the overall resolution process</b>.  		</p>
<p><i><b>3. There is a lack of accurate public knowledge about the aging  		process in general and. the extent and causes of elder abuse. </b></i></p>
<p>Obstacles faced in addressing abuse include the public's lack of  		knowledge about elder abuse and a general lack of knowledge about the elderly  		and the aging process. The public is usually educated about problems such as  		elder abuse through media coverage, hearings held by public officials, or a  		personal experience of a friend or relative. The news media recently provided  		extensive coverage of elder abuse and Congressional committees also held  		hearings. While drawing attention to the problem is a vital step, the coverage  		usually tends toward the sensational. This captures interest on a short-term  		basis but quickly fades from the front pages. Public education, however, is  		important and needs to be broadened beyond horror stories to include  		professional training of those involved in providing services to the aged. </p>
<p>As the population ages, more people are having personal experiences with  		the problems faced by an aging friend or relative. Identifying with specific  		cases can help people relate to the needs of the elderly. Unfortunately, the  		poor understanding that many people have of the aging process supports false  		assumptions and creates negative attitudes about older people. in turn, these  		negative attitudes create environments in which elder abuse can readily occur.  		For example, many people believe diminishing physical and mental capacities are  		inevitable outcomes of aging. Such attitudes help legitimize behavior such as  		the widespread use of physical and chemical restraints in nursing facilities.  		Only recently recognized as forms of abuse, this behavior once represented the  		norm in dealing with frail elderly people who were believed to be  		"non-productive and infantile." </p>
<p>Traditional assumptions, now being challenged by more informed research  		findings, have also helped foster misdirected public policy toward elder abuse.  		It has been largely accepted that elder abuse is generally committed by younger  		caretakers, usually against older women, and that most cases do not involve  		physical violence. Recent research suggests that physical violence is a common  		form of abuse, that spouses are frequent perpetrators, and that men are as  		likely to be victims as women. Unfortunately, most state elder abuse statutes  		and social service programs are based on the traditional assumptions (Wilson,  		1989). The result has been resources directed toward portions of the social  		service system not equipped to deal with the problem. </p>
<p><i><b>4. There is a lack of resources to carry out existing mandates.  		</b></i></p>
<p>Most states and jurisdictions have enacted some type of legislation  		addressing elder abuse; most also have policies and regulations in place to  		enforce these statutes. Despite the presence of these measures, enforcement is  		often less than adequate. Many State and local officials contend that they lack  		the resources that are required to carry out vigorous programs to identify  		elder abuse situations and intervene on behalf of the victim. In fact, a 1985  		survey by NARCEA found that only <b>11</b> States appropriate discrete funding  		to provide services to victims of elder abuse. Further, as many experts in the  		field have noted, practitioners may ignore the law because they recognize that  		there is no service system to address cases of abuse. </p>
<p><i><b>5. There is a lack of a uniform definition of elder abuse.  		</b></i></p>
<p>One common issue found in a review of the literature on elder abuse is  		the serious lack of consensus on a uniform, comprehensive definition of elder  		abuse. Although many researchers and policymakers include the same categories  		of behavior in their definition of elder abuse, the meanings of the categories  		vary considerably. For example, Tanya Johnson (1988) points out that the term  		"withholding of personal care", has been variously defined as physical  		abuse. active neglect, physical neglect and  		"psychological neglect." Other issues also remain unresolved. For example, in  		dealing with self abuse or self neglect, the issue causes of the of self  		determination by the elder becomes an essential part of any intervention  		strategy. Another issue concerns differentiating between intentional and  		unintentional abuse. </p>
<p>This definitional confusion extends to the laws and protective services  		statutes that exist in all 50 states. According to Rosalie Wolf (1988), the  		circumstances leading to the passage of elder abuse legislation were unique in  		each state. Social and political climates played an important role, and states  		approached the problem from very different perspectives. </p>
<p>In 1988, NARCEA conducted an analysis of state laws. They confirmed that  		in most states, "abuse" generally refers to physical harm. But, in some states  		it also includes psychological harm as well. Some laws include "self abuse" in  		their definition; others do not. The State laws also vary in what they define  		as neglect and exploitation. </p>
<p>These disparities in definition have caused a number of problems in the  		field. From a research perspective, it is difficult to compare findings,  		develop measurement instruments or explore causal theory. From a legal and  		public policy perspective, it means that major resources are applied to what is  		still a vaguely defined social problem, the causes of which remain unclear and  		the magnitude unknown. From the perspective of the practitioner, everyday  		decisions become complicated: Is intervention in this case justified? Do I  		offer services or file criminal charges? As Callahan points out, ultimately  		definitions shape the total response to the question. </p>
