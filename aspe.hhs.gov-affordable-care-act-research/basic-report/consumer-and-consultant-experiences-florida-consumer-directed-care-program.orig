<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Roughly 1.4 million people with physical or developmental disabilities  		receive Medicaid-funded supportive services at home or in the community each  		year. Home care agencies provide many of these services: under professional  		supervision, agency workers help beneficiaries with bathing, preparing meals,  		light housework, and other basic activities. Consumer-directed  		care, wherein Medicaid beneficiaries hire, train, supervise, and pay  		workers of their choice, is an alternative to the professional service model.  		Consumer direction increases beneficiaries autonomy and control, but it  		also increases their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Cash and Counseling is a model of consumer-directed care that offers  		eligible Medicaid beneficiaries the opportunity to receive a monthly allowance  		to hire workers, including family members, and purchase other  		disability-related services and goods. Parents manage the allowance for  		consumers younger than 18, and adult consumers can designate a representative,  		such as a family member or friend, to help them manage their care. Cash and  		Counseling also offers counseling and fiscal services to consumers and  		representatives. Florida, along with Arkansas and New Jersey, has tested the  		Cash and Counseling model as part of a three-state demonstration. Mathematica  		Policy Research, Inc. is the demonstration evaluator.</p>
<p>In Florida, the demonstration was open to children and adults with  		developmental disabilities, frail elderly adults, and adults with physical  		disabilities who were receiving Medicaid home and community-based services  		(HCBS) through the states Developmental Disabilities (DD) or  		Aged/Disabled Adult (ADA) waiver programs. The evaluation randomly assigned  		demonstration enrollees to participate in Floridas Consumer Directed Care  		(CDC) program (the treatment group) or to receive HCBS as usual (the control  		group).</p>
<p><b>Goals of the Report</b>. This report describes the implementation of  		CDC by synthesizing information from in-person discussions with program staff,  		a mail survey of program consultants, telephone interviews with consumers in  		the treatment group, and program records. It discusses the programs goals  		and features, the ways beneficiaries managed their program responsibilities and  		took advantage of increased flexibility, and the degree to which beneficiaries  		were satisfied with the program. (Other reports from the evaluation estimate  		the programs impacts on beneficiaries, their caregivers, and public  		costs; describe the types of beneficiaries and workers who chose to participate  		in the demonstrations; and explain demonstration implementation and program  		operations in greater detail.)</p>
<p><b>The CDC Intervention</b>. The CDC program allowance was based on the  		value of consumers waiver care plans or claims histories. At enrollment,  		consumers were eligible for monthly allowances of $1,186, on average ($1,108  		for children, $1,641 for nonelderly adults, and $818 for elderly adults). To  		receive the allowance, consumers or their representatives had to develop a  		written purchasing plan that met the approval of the CDC program. Consultants  		helped consumers develop their purchasing plans and monitored their well-being.  		They were also available to train consumers on program rules and employer  		responsibilities. The fiscal agent was available to write checks for goods and  		services purchased with the allowance and to process payroll taxes and  		employment forms for consumers who hired workers. The program did not charge  		consumers directly for consulting services, but consumers did pay for the  		fiscal services they used, up to a maximum of $25 a month. </p>
<h3>Major Findings</h3>
<p><b>Outreach and Enrollment</b>. Florida began enrolling consumers in the  		demonstration and evaluation in June 2000. Initially, case managers from the  		ADA waiver program and support coordinators from the DD waiver program were  		responsible for outreach and enrollment activities. However, some did not  		support the concept of consumer direction--particularly for elderly adults--or  		were occupied with other responsibilities, and enrollment lagged far behind  		evaluation targets. About six months into the enrollment period, CDC hired 20  		temporary state employees to work as enrollment specialists and build  		demonstration caseload. It also arranged to send a letter describing the  		demonstration from the governors office to eligible participants. The  		pace of enrollment then increased considerably, especially among children and  		nonelderly adults with developmental disabilities. </p>
<p>Florida enrolled 1,002 children in the demonstration and evaluation by  		August 2001 (15 months), 914 nonelderly adults by November 2001 (18 months),  		and 904 elderly adults by July 2002 (26 months). The evaluation randomly  		assigned 501 children, 456 nonelderly adults, and 453 elderly adults to the  		treatment group. All children in the treatment group, 90 percent of nonelderly  		adults, and 2 percent of elderly adults joined the demonstration through the DD  		waiver. Ninety-eight percent of elderly adults and the remaining 10 percent of  		nonelderly adults joined through the ADA waiver. </p>
<p><b>Consumer Characteristics</b>. Despite differences in age and  		disability, consumers who enrolled in the demonstration had some  		characteristics in common. Most were White, and either they or their  		representative were high school graduates. Nearly all consumers were receiving  		help with household and community activities and personal care when they  		enrolled in the demonstration, but many said they needed more help. A larger  		proportion of nonelderly than elderly consumers had representatives (84 versus  		70 percent), which reflects the prevalence of developmental disabilities in the  		younger group. </p>
<p><b>Planning for, and Using, the Allowance</b>. It took many consumers a  		long time to develop purchasing plans and begin receiving their monthly  		allowance, if they did so at all. Twelve months after being assigned to CDC,  		only 57 percent of all consumers had received the allowance--71 percent of  		children, 58 percent of nonelderly adults, and only 41 percent of elderly  		adults. Allowance delays stemmed from consumers individual circumstances  		(such as illness or not having family or friends to hire), staff workloads and  		procedural delays (such as the purchasing plan review and approval process),  		and an initial uncertainty about whether consumers were suitable for CDC if  		they could not develop a purchasing plan mostly independently. The program  		eventually began offering consumers more help with their purchasing plans if  		they had not started on the allowance within 90 days of enrollment.</p>
<p>Consumers who received the allowance used it to meet a variety of  		care-related needs. Among consumers receiving the allowance around the time of  		a nine-month follow-up survey, 78 percent (82 percent of children, 71 percent  		of nonelderly adults, and 81 percent of elderly adults) said they used it to  		hire one or more workers. Nearly 60 percent of these consumers hired family  		members, but the proportion was smaller for children (52 percent) than for  		elderly adults (64 percent). Most workers helped consumers with household and  		community activities and personal care, and many provided assistance with  		routine health care and transportation. According to program records, consumers  		used at least half their monthly allowance to pay workers. Four in ten  		consumers opted to receive some of the allowance (up to 20 percent) as cash for  		incidental purchases identified in the purchasing plan. Some also used the  		allowance to buy personal care supplies (16 percent) or community services (15  		percent). </p>
<p>Hiring workers was difficult for some consumers. Nineteen percent of all  		consumers (15 percent of children and approximately 21 percent of nonelderly  		and elderly adults) tried to hire but were not able to. Two-fifths of those who  		did hire said it was difficult, often because of a lack of interested or  		qualified candidates. Parents who hired for minor children were more likely  		than adult consumers to report difficulty (46 percent versus roughly 37  		percent).</p>
<p><b>Consulting and Fiscal Services</b>. Consultants reported that they  		spent most of their time helping consumers develop purchasing plans, performing  		administrative tasks, and encouraging or listening to consumers. Most  		consultants believed their services were of value to consumers. Likewise, most  		consumers said they received useful help from their consultants. According to  		program staff and consultants who took part in site visit discussions, however,  		consultants initial reluctance to provide hands-on assistance while  		consumers were developing their purchasing plans might have led some consumers  		to drop out of the program without completing a plan or receiving the program  		allowance.</p>
<p>Nearly all allowance recipients used the programs fiscal services;  		the availability of these services undoubtedly contributed to consumers  		success in the program. The fiscal agents performance of some of its CDC  		responsibilities was hampered, however, by slow cash flow, higher-than-expected  		costs, and inadequate reimbursement from the program. For example, about 18  		months elapsed before the fiscal agent was able to produce timely, easily  		understood financial statements, which consumers and consultants needed to  		monitor spending. </p>
<p><b>Consumer Satisfaction</b>. Nine months after being assigned to CDC,  		88 percent of consumers said they would recommend the program to others  		who wanted more control over their personal care services. Among  		consumers who received the allowance, roughly 60 percent said the allowance had  		greatly improved their life, and another quarter said it improved  		life somewhat. Satisfaction with the program was fairly uniform  		across age groups. In addition, 56 percent of childrens parents, 67  		percent of nonelderly adults, and 50 percent of elderly adults were very  		satisfied with their overall care arrangements nine months after enrollment.  		Among consumers who hired workers with the CDC allowance, 25 percent of  		childrens parents, 29 percent of nonelderly adults, and 37 percent of  		elderly adults reported unmet needs for personal care. Thirty-two percent of  		all consumers said program rules kept them from purchasing things that would  		have enhanced their independence or that of their child. Parents of minor  		children were most likely to report this constraint (38 percent). </p>
<p><b>Disenrollment</b>. As in the other demonstration states, about  		one-quarter of consumers chose to leave the CDC program within a year of  		enrolling. Elderly consumers were most likely to disenroll (38 percent), and  		children were least likely (16 percent). Consumers most commonly said they  		disenrolled because they changed their minds or were satisfied with their usual  		waiver services. Elderly adults were more likely than younger consumers to say  		they disenrolled because they had problems with their responsibilities as  		employers or with fiscal tasks. </p>
<p><b>Experiences of Different Types of Consumers</b>. Multivariate models  		used to assess the experiences of different types of consumers suggested that,  		all else being equal, consumers eligible for fairly generous allowances and  		those who enrolled during the first 12 months of demonstration  		intake--presumably the most eager and self-motivated consumers--were more  		likely than others to receive the allowance and remain in the program for their  		follow-up year. Consumers who were interested in paying family and friends for  		caregiving, those who had informal caregivers, and those with prior hiring  		experience or a representative with such experience also were especially likely  		to fare well in CDC.</p>
<h3>Policy Implications</h3>
<p>Of the Cash and Counseling demonstration states, only Florida targeted  		the demonstration to people with primarily developmental disabilities, and only  		Florida enrolled children. Moreover, whereas Arkansas and New Jersey based the  		consumer-directed allowance only on Medicaid state plan personal care services,  		Florida based it on a wide range of Medicaid HCBS benefits, including  		professional therapies. Our analysis of data from discussions with program  		staff, consultant questionnaires, and consumer surveys shows that  		Floridas CDC program is worthwhile from a consumer perspective and  		feasible from an administrative one. In terms of enrollment, retention, and  		satisfaction, the program was most attractive to the families of children with  		developmental disabilities and least attractive to frail elderly adults.</p>
<p>Consumer direction of public funds raises concerns among policymakers,  		however. These concerns include: (1) whether all Medicaid beneficiaries should  		be able to direct their own supportive services if they want to; (2) whether it  		is appropriate for consumers to pay family members for caregiving; (3) how to  		ensure the quality of consumer-directed services; (4) how to ensure that  		workers are trained and fairly treated; and (5) how to avoid fraudulent use of  		the allowance. CDC procedures addressed each of these concerns to at least some  		extent.</p>
<p><b>Assessing Suitability for Consumer Direction</b>. Floridas  		policy was to <i>not</i> screen prospective enrollees for their suitability for  		consumer direction, but rather to inform them of their responsibilities and  		rights under the program and let them decide whether to enroll and whether to  		select a representative. In practice, however, some case managers appear to  		have discouraged the enrollment of elderly adults. Likewise, some consultants  		were reluctant to help consumers develop their purchasing plans, believing that  		consumers needing extensive help were not fit for the program. Florida  		addressed these issues by hiring temporary state employees to conduct outreach  		and enrollment activities, and by instructing consultants to give consumers  		more assistance in developing their purchasing plans if they needed it. It also  		allowed consumers to receive HCBS as usual until the CDC allowance started and  		to disenroll from the program and revert to traditional HCBS on the first day  		of the following month. Thus, Florida made procedural adjustments and learned  		about consumers suitability for consumer direction without undue risk to  		the consumers.</p>
<p>Paying Family Members.<i> </i>While policymakers debate the use of  		public funds to pay family members for caregiving, Florida allowed CDC  		consumers to hire family members, including (legally responsible) spouses and  		parents of minors. The option to hire relatives probably was critical to the  		programs success. Nearly 60 percent of all consumers who hired workers  		hired family members. Although 38 percent of consumers who hired workers hired  		at least one person unrelated to them, the proportion that successfully hired  		nonrelatives was considerably smaller than the proportion that tried to do  		so.</p>
<p><b>Exploitation of Workers</b>. Although CDC had no formal mechanism for  		workers to report grievances, worker abuse does not seem to have been a serious  		problem in the program. Furthermore, although few CDC consumers provided fringe  		benefits to their workers, nearly all workers were paid on a part-time basis,  		and fringe benefits are rare in most part-time jobs.</p>
<p><b>Ensuring Consumer Safety</b>. Data for this analysis yielded no  		evidence that participation in CDC led to adverse effects on consumers  		health and safety. CDC monitored consumer safety and care quality primarily  		through consultants contacts with consumers and representatives, which  		occurred through telephone calls and home visits. Moreover, while there was  		very little evidence of consumer neglect or exploitation in CDC, program staff  		developed formal arrangements for consultants to refer suspicious cases to  		protective-services agencies. </p>
<p><b>Preventing Fraud</b>. The CDC program developed several policies to  		prevent misuse of the allowance: (1) consultants were to review monthly  		financial statements with the consumer or representative each month; (2)  		consumers were to retain receipts for incidental purchases made with cash; and  		(3) the fiscal agent was to pay only for purchases listed in consumers  		purchasing plans. It took time to implement these policies, especially the  		provision concerning financial statements. Any misuse of the allowance seemed  		to result from honest error on the part of consumers. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Despite challenges Florida faced in implementing the CDC program, many  		consumers successfully arranged supportive services that met their individual  		needs and enhanced their sense of self-sufficiency. Program staff adhered to  		the tenets of the relatively expansive Cash and Counseling model of service  		delivery and made operational adjustments in areas where practice fell short of  		policy. Florida continues to offer the CDC program as an option to eligible  		HCBS recipients. In summer 2002 the state legislature passed the Florida  		Consumer-Directed Care Act, which directed several state agencies to develop  		and seek Medicaid waivers for consumer-directed programs like CDC.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3>Consumer Direction of Medicaid Supportive Services</h3>
<p>Each year in the United States, about 1.4 million people with  		disabilities receive Medicaid supportive services benefits to help them live at  		home or in other community settings, instead of in institutions (Harrington and  		Kitchener 2003). Whether states offer such benefits as Medicaid home and  		community-based services (HCBS) or state plan personal care services (PCS),  		they cover them in limited amounts and select the providers or vendors who can  		supply them. Often, case managers decide which benefits people need, and nurses  		supervise home care workers. This system of service delivery has been  		criticized for over-medicalizing supportive services and for being too  		inflexible to meet individual needs. Moreover, home care workers are  		perennially in short supply. Shortages worsen when the economy is strong, and  		they will likely deepen as the United States population ages and demands more  		supportive services.</p>
<p>As an alternative to traditional models of service delivery, states are  		increasingly offering Medicaid beneficiaries and their families opportunities  		to obtain supportive services directly from individual providers (OBrien  		and Elias 2004; Velgouse and Dize 2000). This alternative has become known as  		consumer-directed care, because beneficiaries who use individual  		providers assume the employers role of hiring, managing, and, possibly,  		terminating their paid caregivers (Eustis 2000). Consumer-directed care is  		based on the premise that, because supportive services are low tech  		and nonmedical, they do not require the intervention of medical professionals.  		Rather, beneficiaries should be empowered to direct their own benefits, as  		service consumers (Benjamin and Matthias 2001; Stone 2001; Eustis 2000; Doty et  		al. 1996). In 1999, an estimated 139 publicly-funded consumer-directed programs  		served adults or children with physical or developmental disabilities in the  		United States (Flanagan 2001).</p>
<p>From the perspective of many people affected by disabilities, consumer  		direction has the potential to meet individual needs better than traditional  		HCBS or PCS and to promote autonomy and independence. These two basic American  		values have recently been affirmed in policies such as President George W.  		Bushs New Freedom Initiative. Consumer direction also could help address  		the shortage of home care workers by allowing people to pay family and friends  		for caregiving, thereby expanding the pool of potential workers. Finally,  		consumer direction has the potential to lower public costs by eliminating home  		care agency involvement in hiring, training, and supervising workers (Stone  		2000; Eustis 2000).</p>
<p>Publicly-funded consumer-directed programs do raise some concerns. These  		include: (1) whether consumer direction should be available to all users of  		supportive services; (2) whether to allow family members to be paid for  		caregiving; (3) how to ensure care quality; (4) how to ensure that workers are  		trained adequately and treated fairly; and (5) how to avoid fraudulent use of  		the cash benefit (Simon-Rusinowitz et al. forthcoming; Benjamin 2001; Feinberg  		and Whitlach 2001; Kane and Kane 2001; Kapp 2000; Tilly et al. 2000; Doty et  		al. 1996). </p>
<h3>The Cash and Counseling Model</h3>
<p>Cash and Counseling, which is a fairly expansive model of  		consumer-directed care, provides a flexible monthly allowance that consumers  		may use to hire providers, as well as to purchase the other services and goods  		they may need (within state guidelines). Parents manage the allowance for  		consumers under 18, and adult consumers can designate a representative (such as  		a family caregiver) to manage, or help them manage, their care. In addition,  		Cash and Counseling offers counseling and fiscal services to help consumers and  		representatives handle their program responsibilities. These tenets of Cash and  		Counseling--a flexible allowance, use of representatives, and availability of  		counseling and fiscal services--are meant to make consumer direction adaptable  		to consumers of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey have each tested the Cash and  		Counseling model in their Medicaid systems as part of a three-state  		demonstration. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services funded the demonstration. The Centers for Medicare  		&amp; Medicaid Services approved the demonstration programs under Section 1115  		authority of the Social Security Act. The National Program Office for the  		demonstration, at Boston College and the University of Maryland, coordinated  		the overall demonstration, provided technical assistance to the states, and  		oversaw the evaluation. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) is the  		demonstration evaluator.</p>
<h3>The Cash and Counseling Evaluation</h3>
<p>The evaluation addresses four broad questions: (1) Who participated in  		the Cash and Counseling demonstration? (2) How were the demonstration programs  		implemented? (3) How did the programs affect consumers and their caregivers?  		(4) How did they affect public costs? To estimate program impacts on consumers,  		caregivers, and costs, the evaluation randomly assigned demonstration enrollees  		either to participate in Cash and Counseling (the treatment group) or to rely  		on HCBS or PCS as usual (the control group). With data from telephone  		interviews and Medicaid and Medicare claims, the evaluation compares the  		groups outcomes at designated follow-up intervals. The evaluation also is  		describing eligible beneficiaries reasons for agreeing or declining to  		participate in Cash and Counseling, and it is examining trends in the use of  		HCBS and PCS for indirect evidence that the demonstration affected the number  		of beneficiaries who used such services.</p>
<h3>Guide to This Report</h3>
<p><b>Research Questions</b>. This report addresses the second broad  		evaluation question by describing the implementation of Floridas Cash and  		Counseling demonstration program, Consumer Directed Care (CDC). Unlike a  		companion report that describes demonstration design and program operations in  		greater detail (Phillips and Schneider 2004), this report focuses on program  		implementation as experienced by consumers and the program consultants who  		worked with them. The report considers:</p>
<ul><li>The major goals and features of CDC.</li>
<li>The characteristics of treatment group consumers.</li>
<li>How consumers handled their CDC responsibilities and how they availed  		  themselves of the programs flexibility.</li>
<li>Whether consumers were satisfied with CDC and their personal  		  care.</li>
<li>Reasons consumers left the program.</li>
<li>Whether the program worked better for some types of consumers than  		  for others.</li>
<li>Consultants assessment of the programs strengths and  		  weaknesses.</li>
<li>The lessons that CDC offers policymakers and program developers.</li>
</ul><p><b>Sources and Methods</b>. This report draws on information and data  		from several sources:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i><b>Florida Site Visit</b></i>. Researchers held discussions with  			 Florida state officials, state employees at the regional level, CDC staff  			 members, and staff members of organizations providing fiscal and consulting  			 services under CDC. (Florida used the term consulting rather than  			 counseling in its demonstration.) The discussions were conducted in  			 January 2002, about 18 months after the demonstration began random assignment.  			 The discussions were in person, except for three conducted by telephone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Consultant Survey</i></b>. Also about 18 months into the  			 demonstration, MPR administered a mail survey of CDC program consultants. The  			 survey questionnaire contained sections on consultants education and  			 professional background, program caseload, uses and perceived misuse (if any)  			 of the program allowance by consumers or representatives, and abuse of  			 consumers by workers or representatives. It also contained sections on  			 consultant activities, recommended changes to those activities, and  			 consultants overall assessment of the program. Questions eliciting  			 consultants recommendations and overall program assessment were  			 open-ended. Questionnaires were sent to all 213 consultants who had active CDC  			 caseloads when the survey was administered, and 195 consultants returned them.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Consumer Surveys</i></b>. MPR conducted telephone interviews  			 with consumers or knowledgeable proxy respondents immediately before consumers  			 were randomly assigned to participate in CDC, and six and nine months later.  			 Each survey instrument covered a range of topics (listed in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Interviews were completed by 1,410 treatment group  			 respondents at baseline; 1,340 respondents at six months; and 1,213 respondents  			 at nine months.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a>, <a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> To obtain a complete picture of  			 consumers CDC experiences, we conducted follow-up interviews even if  			 consumers had disenrolled from CDC, were not receiving the monthly allowance,  			 or had died. </p>
<p>We interviewed a parent or guardian of consumers younger than 18;  			 questions eliciting opinions referred to those of the respondent. When  			 interviewing the proxy respondent of an adult consumer, however, we measured  			 the consumers opinion. Thus, questions eliciting opinions were skipped if  			 the consumer was unable to form opinions (for example, because of a severe  			 cognitive impairment) or the proxy was not comfortable assessing the  			 consumers opinion. During the six and nine-month interviews, questions  			 about the consumers satisfaction and unmet needs were skipped if the  			 proxy respondent was also a paid caregiver, because the proxy may have been  			 unable to answer objectively.</p>
<p>Many adult consumers used proxy respondents during the interviews.  			 At baseline, for example, 60 percent of adults age 60 or older used proxy  			 respondents, as did 77 percent of younger adults, nearly all of whom had  			 developmental disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Program Records</i></b>. CDC program records were available  			 for the 1,410 consumers who were randomly assigned to participate in the  			 program. The records included data on receipt and use of the monthly allowance  			 and reasons for disenrollment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Survey and program data were analyzed primarily through an examination  		of frequency distributions, means, and cross-tabulations of constructed  		variables. Researchers also reviewed and coded open-ended responses to the  		consultant and consumer surveys. Logistic regression analysis was used to  		assess whether certain types of consumers fared better than others in the  		program (for example, by starting on the allowance and remaining in the program  		for at least a year). The regression models included a set of explanatory  		variables from baseline interviews and program records.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Presentation and a Limitation</b>. The body of this report consists  		of a narrative text and tables of selected descriptive statistics. The  		reports <a href="#append">appendix</a> also contains many statistical  		tables, some of which are discussed in the report. Many of the tables in the  		report and the <a href="#append">appendix</a> present statistics by consumer  		age group (3-17 years, 18-59 years, and 60 or older) because we hypothesized  		that consumers in these groups may have experienced the CDC program differently  		from each other and because policymakers have long debated the suitability of  		elderly adults for consumer direction. In addition, key measures of  		satisfaction are presented by whether adult consumers responded to evaluation  		surveys themselves or through proxy respondents. </p>
<p>The report covers a period beginning in February 1996, when Florida  		submitted its demonstration proposal, and ending in July 2003, a year after the  		last demonstration enrollees were randomly assigned for the evaluation.  		Nonetheless, the report is limited in that we conducted site visit discussions  		and administered the consultant survey at one point in time (winter 2002),  		although the CDC program of course continued to evolve, learn from experience,  		and make improvements thereafter. The report notes some programmatic changes  		that occurred after the site visit, but it was not possible to document them  		all.</p>
<h2><a name="feature" id="feature">KEY FEATURES OF CASH AND COUNSELING IN  		FLORIDA</a><sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></h2>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>In implementing the Cash and Counseling demonstration, Floridas  		main goals were to promote the independence of people with disabilities, offer  		services that would better meet the needs of individual families, and encourage  		the prudent use of public resources. The state viewed the demonstration as an  		opportunity to learn--to determine which policies and procedures worked well  		and which did not. Cost savings were not a goal for Florida, but the Federal  		Government required that the demonstration be budget-neutral.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Target Populations</h3>
<p>The demonstration was open to Florida Medicaid beneficiaries who were  		receiving HCBS under the states Developmental Disabilities (DD) waiver or  		Aged/Disabled Adult (ADA) waiver and living in selected areas of the  		state.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Together, these  		waivers serve children and adults with developmental disabilities, frail  		elderly adults, and adults with physical disabilities. For children, the  		demonstration catchment area was the entire state. For adults with  		developmental disabilities, it was the entire state, except several northern  		counties where a state-funded consumer-directed program was being piloted. For  		elderly adults and those with physical disabilities, the catchment area  		consisted of 19 counties, including most of the states major metropolitan  		areas. </p>
<p>Florida did not screen prospective enrollees or any person who might be  		their representative in the program for their suitability for consumer  		direction. In keeping with the Cash and Counseling credo of autonomy, as well  		as its own wish to learn from the demonstration, the state relied on  		prospective enrollees and their families to decide whether to enroll. Consumers  		would receive HCBS as usual until they began receiving their program allowance,  		and they could disenroll from CDC at any time and revert to their usual  		services on the first day of the following month.</p>
<h3>Government Stakeholders</h3>
<p>A number of government entities were involved in the design and  		implementation of CDC. Floridas Department of Elder Affairs (DOEA), which  		serves the elderly adults who were eligible for the demonstration, drafted much  		of the states demonstration proposal and was the official demonstration  		grantee and host agency. Two programs in the Department of Children &amp;  		Families (DCF) also were involved, to different extents. The Developmental  		Disabilities Program (DDP), which serves children and adults with developmental  		disabilities, devoted substantial resources to demonstration design and  		implementation, including the time of four staff members.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> The Adult Services (AS) program,  		which serves nonelderly adults with physical disabilities, played a limited  		role in design and implementation. In fact, although nonelderly adults could  		enroll in the demonstration through DDP or AS, nearly all (90 percent) were DDP  		clients and only 10 percent were AS clients. Finally, the Florida Agency for  		Health Care Administration prepared the application for the federal Section  		1115 waiver needed to run the demonstration and ensured that the state met the  		waivers terms and conditions.</p>
<p>DOEA formed an interdepartmental work group to coordinate the activities  		of the relevant government entities. Nonetheless, it was not always possible to  		have a single set of procedures for some important aspects of the CDC program.  		As described in the following sections of this report, procedures for  		determining the amount of program allowances, training and paying consultants,  		and approving consumers purchasing plans varied by target population.</p>
<h3>Outreach and Enrollment</h3>
<p>For the evaluation, Florida initially set out to enroll 1,550  		beneficiaries in each of three age groups in about 12 months, beginning in June  		2000. Generating enrollment for the demonstration proved demanding, however.  		Sample size targets eventually were reduced, to 1,000 beneficiaries in each age  		group, and evaluation enrollment remained open until the targets were met (or  		nearly met). By the time evaluation enrollment closed for all age groups, in  		July 2002, Florida had approached outreach and enrollment in two distinct ways.  		</p>
<p>In the first approach, CDC program staff made presentations to advocacy  		organizations and conducted other community outreach, but case managers from  		the ADA waiver program and support coordinators from the DD waiver program were  		responsible for reaching consumers directly. (Case managers and support  		coordinators have different titles but similar functions in their respective  		programs.) During routine visits with the waiver beneficiaries in their  		caseloads, case managers and support coordinators were to introduce the  		demonstration to beneficiaries and their families, give them informational  		brochures, and invite them to complete a reply card to request more  		information. If beneficiaries expressed interest in the demonstration, their  		case manager or support coordinator was supposed to follow up with them or  		arrange for a CDC consultant to do so. If beneficiaries decided to enroll in  		the demonstration, a support coordinator, case manager, or CDC consultant was  		to collect their informed written consent and basic intake data, such as  		contact information. Cases were then forwarded to MPR for interviewing and  		randomization. </p>
<p>Florida used this approach for about six months. According to people who  		took part in site visit discussions, however, many case managers were skeptical  		about consumer direction, particularly for elderly beneficiaries. For their  		part, many support coordinators were overwhelmed with other responsibilities.  		Florida had recently been compelled by a court order to serve thousands of  		people who had been on a waiting list for HCBS and reassess the needs of  		existing HCBS users. For these reasons, outreach was not as successful as  		anticipated. During this period, few consumers expressed interest in the  		program, and those who did often had to wait to receive additional information.  		Enrollment lagged well behind monthly targets. </p>
<p>Remedial efforts were implemented. CDC staff and senior state officials  		began meeting frequently with the executives of case management agencies to  		boost enrollment among eligible elderly beneficiaries. The meetings were meant  		to make case managers more comfortable with the concept of consumer direction  		for elderly beneficiaries, but they were largely unsuccessful, according to  		people who took part in site visit discussions.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> For its part, the DDP began including  		district-level enrollment statistics in monthly reports to the governors  		office hoping that the reports would motivate district offices to pay more  		attention to enrolling beneficiaries with developmental disabilities. This  		tactic seemed somewhat effective, but it did not increase enrollment enough to  		meet evaluation targets. </p>
<p>Florida implemented its second approach to outreach and enrollment in  		fall 2000. It hired about 20 temporary employees, split between DOEA and DCF,  		to build demonstration caseload. It was hoped not only that these enrollment  		specialists would devote more time to the CDC project, but also that they would  		not have preconceived notions about which types of beneficiaries were suitable  		for consumer direction. After the enrollment specialists had been hired, the  		CDC program arranged to send an informational letter from the governors  		office to eligible demonstration participants. </p>
<p>The governors letter generated a lot of interest in the  		demonstration. In response, enrollment specialists were expected to visit five  		or six prospective enrollees a day. Neither the DOEA nor the DDP set enrollment  		quotas, however, lest the specialists resort to selling the  		program. Like the case managers and support coordinators who preceded them,  		enrollment specialists were to explain CDC to beneficiaries and their families,  		tell them what their CDC allowance would be if they were randomly assigned to  		the treatment group, and help them complete enrollment and consent forms. (MPR  		continued to handle baseline interviewing and randomization.) The enrollment  		specialists, enthusiastic about CDC and not distracted by other duties, did  		increase the pace of enrollment into the demonstration (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA1">Table A.1</a> and <a href="#tableA1a">Table A.1a</a>). </p>
<p>Having begun outreach and enrollment activities in June 2000, Florida  		enrolled 1,002 children into the demonstration and evaluation by August 2001  		(15 months), 914 nonelderly adults by November 2001 (18 months), and 904  		elderly adults by July 2002 (26 months).<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> After these dates, eligible beneficiaries  		continued to enroll into the demonstration but were not part of the evaluation.  		</p>
<h3>The CDC Allowance</h3>
<p><b>Cashed Out Services</b>. A monthly CDC allowance was offered instead  		of the benefits in beneficiaries usual HCBS care plans or support plans,  		as they are known in the DD waiver. Cashed out services might  		include help with personal care, in-home nursing, professional therapies,  		care-related supplies and equipment, or caregiver respite, among other  		benefits.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> Only case  		management or support coordination services were not cashed out as part of the  		CDC allowance; funds for those services would be used to pay CDC consultants.  		</p>
<p><b>Allowance Calculations</b>. Allowance amounts were based on the  		beneficiarys HCBS claims history or care/support plan and multiplied by a  		discount factor. If past claims data were available for at least six months,  		the allowance was set equal to the monthly average of Medicaid expenditures. If  		claims were available for fewer than six months, or if the beneficiarys  		condition or situation recently had changed, the allowance was based on the  		care/support plan.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup>  		Using care plans to calculate allowances was more arduous than using claims,  		because staff had to look up the rates that would be paid to all vendors  		specified in the plans. Discount factors were applied to help keep the program  		budget-neutral: Florida had determined that planned costs for waiver services  		consistently exceeded actual costs (for example, because services were  		suspended during hospitalizations). The discount factors were 0.89 for elderly  		adults, 0.83 for nonelderly adults with physical disabilities, and 0.92 for  		adults and children with developmental disabilities. </p>
<p>At enrollment, the average monthly allowance after discounting was  		$1,108 for children, $1,641 for nonelderly adults, and $818 for elderly adults.  		Consumers with primarily developmental disabilities--children and nearly all  		nonelderly adults--had relatively generous allowances, on average, because they  		tended to have relatively high needs for care. </p>
<p><b>Flexibility in Purchasing</b>. The CDC allowance, like the program  		allowances in the other demonstration states, could be used to purchase a range  		of goods and services that would help consumers function more independently.  		Consumers could use the allowance to pay workers, including legally responsible  		family members (spouses and parents of minors) and, in some cases, a  		consumers CDC representative.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> The program generally did not pay for  		workers, services, and goods unless they were specified in consumers  		purchasing plans. However, CDC allowed some leeway if purchases that had not  		been specified in advance met needs the plan identified. For example, in a  		given month, consumers could purchase extra care supplies to take advantage of  		sales without preapproval from the program. Florida also allowed consumers to  		receive up to 20 percent of the monthly allowance as cash for incidental  		expenditures that could not be readily invoiced, such as taxi fare or paying a  		neighbor for yard work.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> To receive cash, consumers could specify  		such purchases in their purchasing plan or request an ad hoc payment from the  		fiscal agent up to twice monthly. </p>
<h3>Organization of Consulting and Fiscal Services</h3>
<p>Florida asked existing providers of case management or support  		coordination services to provide consulting services to CDC consumers. This  		choice was practical--state funds to pay these providers had already been  		committed--but Florida also believed that consumers would benefit from the  		continuity of the arrangement. All consultants completed a day and a half of  		training before they began working with CDC consumers.</p>
<p>CDC adopted different payment structures for consulting by case managers  		than for consulting by support coordinators. Under the ADA waiver, one  		lead agency provides case management services to all beneficiaries  		in a given county. Under the DD waiver, multiple agencies and independent  		contractors provide support coordination services to children and adults in  		groups of contiguous counties, or districts. Under the CDC program, consultants  		who were also case managers conducted up to two home visits to help consumers  		(frail elderly adults and younger adults with physical disabilities) develop  		purchasing plans. The state paid the lead agencies $125 for the first visit and  		$75 for the second. The state paid lead agencies an hourly rate for other  		consultant services, such as advising consumers about hiring workers.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> In contrast, the state paid  		consultants who were also support coordinators a flat monthly fee of $148 for  		each consumer in their CDC caseloads, the rate paid under the usual waiver  		program.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> Monthly  		payments began as soon as cases were assigned to consultants. </p>
<p>Although CDC consulting services were decentralized, Florida selected  		one organization, a human services firm in another eastern state, to provide  		fiscal services to all consumers. The state did not charge consumers directly  		for consulting services, but consumers did pay for the fiscal services they  		used. Under a comprehensive fiscal services plan, consumers paid the fiscal  		agent $5 to cut a check, up to a $25 monthly maximum.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> Alternatively, consumers could manage the  		allowance themselves and pay the fiscal agent $10 a month to audit their CDC  		account and records. </p>
<p>Over time it would become clear that providing fiscal services for the  		CDC project was a financial drain on the selected agency. There were three main  		causes of financial drain. First, the fiscal agent received no payments, apart  		from an upfront payment for design tasks, until consumers developed approved  		purchasing plans. Second, the monthly costs incurred by the fiscal agent per  		consumer far exceeded the maximum fee ($25) each consumer might pay (for  		example, because many consumers hired more workers than expected). Third, the  		unexpectedly slow buildup of caseload made it difficult for the fiscal agent to  		realize economies of scale. Although the fiscal agent persevered through these  		difficulties, and contract amendments were being considered at the time of our  		site visit, the fiscal agents performance of its CDC responsibilities was  		sometimes hampered.</p>

<p>The evaluation randomly assigned 1,410 beneficiaries to the CDC  		program--501 children, 456 nonelderly adults, and 453 elderly adults (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA2">Table A.2</a>). All of the children, 90 percent of  		nonelderly adults, and 2 percent of elderly adults joined the demonstration  		through the DD waiver program. Ninety-eight percent of elderly adults and the  		rest of the nonelderly adults joined through the ADA waiver program.</p>
<p>Despite differences in age and type of disability, consumers had some  		characteristics in common. Most were White, and either they or their  		representatives were high school graduates (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and  		Appendix <a href="#tableA3">Table A.3</a>). Nearly all consumers were receiving  		help with personal care and household activities when they enrolled in the  		demonstration, but many said they needed more help with each of these  		activities. In addition, roughly half of consumers said they lived in areas of  		Florida that were rural or had high levels of crime or poor public  		transportation--places where obtaining services from home care workers might be  		difficult. </p>
<p>Consumers in the three age groups also differed from each other in  		important ways. For example, 80 percent of elderly adults were female, compared  		with 38 percent of children (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and Appendix  		<a href="#tableA3">Table A.3</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> Across the two adult age groups, elderly  		consumers were more likely than nonelderly consumers to live alone (27 percent  		versus 9 percent) and to be in poor health relative to their peers (39 percent  		versus 14 percent). Elderly consumers were less likely than other adult  		consumers to have no paid caregivers at the time of random assignment (12  		percent versus 40percent), but notably more likely to have no unpaid caregivers  		(18 percent versus 7 percent). Childrens parents were more likely to be  		dissatisfied with their childs overall care arrangements than were adult  		consumers to be dissatisfied with their own care arrangements. Finally, while a  		majority of consumers had participated in HCBS waiver programs for at least six  		months at the time of random assignment, the proportion was higher for elderly  		consumers than for children (71 percent versus 59 percent) (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA2">Table A.2</a>).</p>

</tr></table><p>At baseline, consumers also were asked about program features that may  		have been important to them. More than nine in ten said having a choice about  		the type of help they received was very important (Appendix <a href="#tableA4">Table A.4</a>). More than eight in ten said having a choice  		about when caregivers came was very important. More than half said the ability  		to pay family members was very important, and a similar proportion said the  		same about paying friends. </p>
<h3>Consumer-Consultant Interactions</h3>
<p>Consumers could begin using CDC consulting services as soon as they were  		assigned to the program. Of the 195 consultants who completed the MPR  		questionnaire, nine in ten had been working for the CDC program for six months  		or less when surveyed (Appendix <a href="#tableA5">Table A.5</a>). Each had an  		average of three consumers in their caseloads at that time. (The median was two  		consumers.)</p>
<p>Consultants potentially had many responsibilities. During initial visits  		to consumers homes, they helped consumers or representatives write  		purchasing plans for the monthly allowance. Consultants reviewed these plans,  		signed them, and sent them to the appropriate agency for final approval. (The  		state CDC office granted final approval for elderly consumers and those with  		physical disabilities. Medicaid specialists in DCF district offices did so for  		consumers with developmental disabilities. Allowances were not disbursed until  		purchasing plans were approved.) The program required consultants to speak with  		consumers by telephone each month and visit them at home two and 12 months  		after their enrollment. Consultants also were expected to review receipts for  		incidental cash purchases, compare purchasing plans to monthly financial  		statements from the fiscal agent, and help consumers revise their purchasing  		plans as needed. </p>
<p>Unlike case managers and support coordinators in the usual waiver  		programs, CDC consultants were to serve as advisers, not decision makers. Thus,  		if consumers wished, consultants could advise them about recruiting and hiring  		workers or about choosing community programs and vendors, but they were not to  		access goods and services on consumers behalf. Consultants could contact  		the fiscal agent or the CDC program office for consumers, but consumers were  		expected to make most such contacts themselves. </p>
<p>According to questionnaire data, consultants spent most of their time on  		a few tasks and devoted four hours per week, on average, to CDC duties  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA6">Table A.6</a>). The most time-consuming tasks  		were: (1) helping consumers develop purchasing plans; (2) performing  		administrative activities such as record keeping, updating case notes, and  		contacting other program staff; and (3) listening to or encouraging consumers.  		Most consultants believed that these services were of value to consumers.  		Forty-four of 195 consultants (23 percent) reported that at least one consumer  		required extensive monitoring (Appendix <a href="#tableA7">Table A.7</a>). The  		most common reasons for this were that consumers had difficulty completing  		paperwork or staying on budget (reported by 29 and 20 consultants,  		respectively). </p>
<h3>Starting on the Allowance</h3>
<p>It took many consumers a long time to develop purchasing plans and begin  		receiving their monthly allowance, if they did so at all. Three months after  		being assigned to CDC, only 18 percent of consumers had begun receiving the  		allowance (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> and Appendix <a href="#tableA8">Table  		A.8</a> and <a href="#tableA8a">Table A.8a</a>). By month six, the percentage  		had risen to 44 percent, though it was higher for children (54 percent) and  		lower for elderly adults (36 percent). By month 12, only 57 percent of all  		consumers, and only 41 percent of elderly consumers, had begun to receive the  		allowance. </p>

</tr></table><p>Many factors contributed to the delays. Some consumers became ill or did  		not have family members to hire as workers. However, program procedures, staff  		workloads, and uncertainty about how much hands-on assistance consultants  		should provide to consumers also delayed allowances. </p>
<p>During site visit discussions, program staff described two types of  		procedural delay. The first concerned allowance-planning. Consultants were  		supposed to schedule consumer training visits after consumers had received and  		read a training and reference manual--the CDC notebook. Because the state  		program office did not always distribute notebooks promptly, however, training  		visits and, thus, allowance-planning could both be delayed. The second type of  		procedural delay concerned the first allowance disbursal. Once consumers wrote  		purchasing plans, their allowance could start as early as the first day of the  		following month, but only if all paperwork, employment forms, and approvals  		were complete by the 20th day of the prior month. Otherwise, the allowance was  		held up until the first day of the month <i>after</i> the following month. </p>
<p>Large workloads for consultants, CDC state office staff, and district  		staff also contributed to allowance delays. The especially long delays elderly  		consumers experienced may have stemmed in part from state regulations allowing  		case managers to have caseloads of up to 80 clients, including CDC consumers.  		In contrast, the maximum caseload for support coordinators is 38 clients,  		including CDC consumers. Large workloads resulting from a court order unrelated  		to the demonstration may also have kept state and district staff from reviewing  		and approving consumers purchasing plans quickly, as some consultants  		suggested during site visit discussions. </p>
<p>Finally, consultants were generally uncertain about how much assistance  		to provide to consumers, and this confusion contributed to allowance delays.  		According to people who took part in site visit discussions, many in the CDC  		project expected that consumers and representatives would quickly grasp the  		requirements of the program and develop their purchasing plans with little  		difficulty. When this was not the case, some consultants questioned  		consumers suitability for consumer direction. Doing the paperwork and  		arithmetic for the purchasing plan was difficult for many consumers and could  		require several sessions with consultants. Some consumers who did not get the  		help they needed dropped out of the program. During site visit discussions,  		some consultants reported that many consumers enrolled in CDC without a clear  		understanding of it, a problem that consultants attributed to the explanations,  		or lack thereof, provided by enrollment specialists.</p>
<p>With experience, CDC program staff realized that, although arithmetic  		and paperwork were difficult for many consumers, most were able to make  		decisions about the services and goods they wished to include in their plans.  		Moreover, once the purchasing plan was completed, most consumers and  		representatives could manage other program responsibilities independently.  		Thus, in early 2002, the program began instructing consultants to provide more  		help with the purchasing plan if consumers needed it. The program also began  		sending letters to consumers who had not begun receiving the allowance within  		90 days of their random assignment to ask if they needed more help with their  		purchasing plan. At the same time, the program contacted consultants about  		consumers who had fallen behind and offered to help the consultants expedite  		completion of purchasing plans. Nonetheless, after a year in the program, less  		than 60 percent of all consumers were receiving a program allowance.</p>
<h3>Consumer-Fiscal Agent Interactions</h3>
<p>Once consumers were receiving the monthly allowance, as noted, they  		chose between two levels of fiscal services. Under the more comprehensive  		level, chosen by nearly all consumers, the fiscal agent processed employment  		forms, payroll taxes, worker time sheets, and vendor invoices, and disbursed  		funds for any incidental expenditures included in the consumers  		purchasing plan. Alternatively, consumers who took and passed a skills  		examination could manage the allowance on their own, but the fiscal agent would  		still conduct a monthly audit of their CDC accounts. The fiscal agent was  		required to send monthly financial statements to all consumers and their  		consultants. </p>
<p>According to people who took part in site visit discussions, the fiscal  		agent handled many tasks very well but had difficulty producing timely, easily  		understood financial statements. There were two periods of several months in  		which the fiscal agent did not produce any statements, once because of the  		financial difficulties described earlier, and once because the statements had  		to be adapted for new accounting software. Other times, the statements were  		prepared on schedule but mailed late, because the fiscal agent did not have  		up-to-date contact information for consumers or, more often, for consultants,  		who exhibited fairly high turnover. When statements were distributed, many  		consultants and consumers found them lacking in detail and difficult to  		understand. The fiscal agent twice redesigned the statements in response to  		such feedback. </p>
<h3>Consumer Management of Program Responsibilities </h3>
<p>Consumers themselves bore important responsibilities in the CDC program.  		They decided whether to use a representative, what that representative would  		do, and which of the optional consultant and fiscal services they would use.  		Most important, consumers were responsible for recruiting and hiring workers if  		they chose to, and for otherwise using the allowance responsibly.</p>
<p><b>Use of Representatives</b>. As noted, CDC let adult consumers  		designate a representative to manage or help them manage their program  		responsibilities, and it required that children be represented by a parent or  		guardian. Representatives could help consumers decide how to spend the  		allowance (for example, whether to hire a worker, whom to hire, and how much to  		pay), supervise workers and monitor care, sign worker time sheets, and handle  		other program paperwork. </p>
<p>When they enrolled in the demonstration, 84 percent of all consumers,  		including children, had designated a representative to help them manage their  		CDC responsibilities (Appendix <a href="#tableA2">Table A.2</a>). As noted, a  		larger proportion of nonelderly than elderly consumers had representatives (84  		percent versus 70 percent), which probably reflects the prevalence of  		developmental disabilities in the younger group. Program staff reported that  		the need for representatives usually was obvious to consumers and consultants.  		Consumers with severe developmental disabilities or dementia were generally not  		able to manage the allowance themselves. In addition, consultants who  		participated in site visit discussions said they usually suggested that  		visually impaired consumers use a representative because program paperwork  		could be difficult without one. </p>
<p>According to program staff, representatives were usually family members  		who were already helping consumers with personal care or household tasks.  		Adults with developmental disabilities who were living with their families  		usually selected a parent as a representative. Many elderly consumers named  		their daughters as representatives. </p>
<p>Nearly all the consultants who completed the MPR questionnaire (96  		percent) said they worked with at least one consumer who used a representative  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA9">Table A.9</a>). Although 19 percent of those  		consultants indicated they questioned the suitability of at least  		one representative, 94 percent said every representative they worked with did  		his or her best to act according to the wishes or best interests of the  		consumer. (Quotes indicate the wording of closed-ended questions, not  		responses. The questionnaire did not ask consultants to elaborate about any  		unsuitability they perceived in representatives.) During site visit  		discussions, two consultants said they occasionally visited consumers who used  		representatives because they thought telephone calls with the representative  		were insufficient for monitoring consumer well-being. </p>
<p><b>Use of, and Satisfaction with, Consulting and Fiscal Services</b>.  		Like representatives, program consultants and fiscal agent staff helped  		consumers manage their program responsibilities. Despite allowance delays, many  		consumers were pleased with the consulting and fiscal services they received.  		During six-month follow-up interviews, roughly two-thirds of consumers said a  		CDC consultant helped them or their representative develop a purchasing plan  		(<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> The proportion was higher for children (75  		percent) and lower for elderly consumers (62 percent) (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA10">Tables A.10</a> to A10c). Nine in ten consumers who  		received help found it useful. These consumers most commonly said  		consultants explanations of program rules were useful (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA11">Table A.11</a>). A substantial minority of consumers (10  		percent) said consultants helped them get approval for special uses of the  		allowance. In addition, some nonelderly adults and childrens parents (9  		percent and 15 percent, respectively) used peer support before their six-month  		interviews (Appendix <a href="#tableA10a">Table A.10a</a> and  		<a href="#tableA10b">Table A.10b</a>). All found it useful to speak with others  		in the program. No elderly consumers reported using peer support. Of consumers  		who started receiving the cash allowance within nine months of their random  		assignment, 97 percent said they used the programs fiscal services, and  		87 percent of them said the services were useful. These proportions varied  		little by age group.</p>

</tr></table><p>Consultants confirmed that hiring or retaining workers was difficult for  		some consumers. One-fourth of consultants said they worked with consumers who  		had serious turnover problems because their workers quit or were fired  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA14">Table A.14</a>). Still, some consumers did find  		success with inventive recruitment strategies. One consultant reported that a  		consumer used newspaper ads to attract young, energetic students of  		speech, occupational, and physical therapy who provided services that were  		outlined by licensed professionals.</p>
<p>In addition to recruiting and hiring workers, consumers had to decide  		whether and how to train them, how much to pay, whether to offer fringe  		benefits, and whether to describe such arrangements in a contract or written  		agreement. About 61 percent of consumers who hired workers by the time of their  		nine-month interviews had trained them in some way (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA12">Table A.12</a>). Fifty-three percent said they showed their  		worker how to perform tasks, and the other 8 percent arranged for outside  		training. Only 15 percent of these consumers said that training workers was  		difficult, and about half of those (ten consumers) said workers  		inexperience made it so. Adult consumers paid workers $10.26 an hour, on  		average, and parents paid $11.81 an hour, on average, for childrens  		workers. Eight percent of consumers (overall and by age group) provided fringe  		benefits, such as paid sick time, to their workers. Finally, 50 percent of  		consumers who used their allowance to pay workers, including family members,  		signed contracts or work agreements with them. (Data on wages, benefits, and  		work agreements are not shown in tables.)</p>
<p><b>Neglect, Exploitation, and Abuse</b>. The possibility that consumers  		could be exploited by workers or representatives, or vice versa, and the  		possibility that the CDC allowance would be misused or squandered were major  		concerns for all involved in the program, as they were for the demonstration  		programs in Arkansas and New Jersey. At the same time, everyone directly  		involved in the demonstration realized that extensive control and oversight of  		consumers and their families were incompatible with the philosophy of consumer  		direction. Consumers had to be free to make their own choices, even if others  		disagreed with them. At the time of the Florida site visit and the consultant  		survey, neither neglect or exploitation, nor abuse of the allowance, seemed to  		be serious problems.</p>
<p>Consultants interactions with consumers and representatives were  		the CDC programs key means of monitoring for possible physical or verbal  		abuse or financial exploitation of consumers. Consultants used their monthly  		telephone calls and home visits to monitor consumers well-being. For  		example, one consultant listened for subtle clues during the monthly calls,  		such as hesitant responses to questions, and probed for more information if in  		doubt. Another consultant reported that she made unannounced home visits if  		something seemed amiss over the telephone. To assess a childs well-being,  		one consultant made a point of speaking with the child and watching for changes  		in the childs appearance. Florida directed consultants to refer cases of  		possible neglect or exploitation to the states protective-services  		agencies.</p>
<p>In responding to the consultant questionnaire, no consultants reported  		verbal or physical abuse of consumers by representatives or workers, but two  		indicated they had seen evidence of consumer self-neglect. Four consultants (of  		195 who responded to the survey) indicated they had seen evidence that one of  		the consumers in their caseloads was being financially exploited by a  		representative or worker (Appendix <a href="#tableA15">Table A.15</a>).  		Financial abuse may be a matter of opinion, however. For example, one  		questionnaire respondent considered it financially exploitative for the mothers  		of young consumers to pay themselves for caregiving while forfeiting other paid  		services the consultant believed were needed. </p>
<p>CDC used three methods to prevent abuse of the monthly allowance. First,  		consultants were to review the consumers monthly financial statement (to  		be prepared and distributed by the fiscal agent) with the consumer or  		representative during the monthly call. Second, consumers were to maintain a  		record of purchases they made with any portion of the allowance they received  		as cash and keep receipts for those purchases. Third, in most cases, the fiscal  		agent was to pay only for purchases specifically identified in the purchasing  		plan.</p>
<p>In responding to the consultant questionnaire, less than 10 percent of  		consultants reported seeing evidence of allowance misuse (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA16">Table A.16</a>). Of 17 consultants who did report misuse,  		12 said consumers overspent their allowances, which was possible because  		allowances were prospectively credited to consumers accounts. During site  		visit discussions, we heard of several cases of overpayment stemming from  		consumers not being aware of laws governing overtime rates. These appeared to  		be honest errors, not deliberate misuse of the allowance. In addition,  		according to questionnaire data, seven consultants said some consumers failed  		to document incidental cash purchases as they were supposed to.</p>
<h3>How Consumers Took Advantage of Increased  		Flexibility</h3>
<p>Consumers who used their allowance to hire workers determined how many  		to hire, what tasks they would perform, and when they would help. Most  		consumers with primarily developmental disabilities (children and nonelderly  		adults), and thus a variety of professional and personal care needs, used the  		allowance to pay more than one worker. In comparison, elderly adults were as  		likely to hire one worker as they were to hire more than one (<a href="#table6">Table 6</a> and Appendix <a href="#tableA17">Table A.17</a>).  		About 45 percent of consumers had paid caregivers who lived with them at the  		time the nine-month interviews.</p>
<p>Roughly nine in ten consumers received paid help with household tasks  		and with personal care, and roughly seven in ten received paid help with  		routine health care tasks. Compared with elderly adults, larger proportions of  		children and nonelderly adults received paid transportation assistance. More  		than 80 percent of consumers paid someone to help them on weekends. Consumers  		who used the allowance to pay workers typically received at least two hours of  		paid care a day during a two-week period shortly before the nine-month  		interviews (Appendix <a href="#tableA17">Table A.17</a>). Children and  		nonelderly adults were especially likely to receive more than five hours of  		paid care per day.</p>
<p>According to program records, nonelderly adults and children used about  		half their allowances to pay home care workers or therapists whom they did not  		hire through home care agencies. Elderly adults, whose allowances tended to be  		smaller, used about 64 percent to pay workers. A substantial fraction of all  		consumers (11 percent) also hired workers and therapists through home care  		agencies (Appendix <a href="#tableA18">Tables A.18</a> to A.18c).<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Consumers also used the allowance in ways other than to pay caregivers.  		Substantial proportions of consumers in all three groups received cash for  		incidental expenditures during the observed month, and these payments  		represented the biggest portion of allowance spending after workers were paid.  		Forty-two percent of childrens parents received cash, at an average of  		$90 a month. Thirty-five percent of nonelderly adults did so, at an average of  		$51 a month. Sixty-three percent of elderly adults received cash, at a monthly  		average of $115. In addition, one-third of nonelderly consumers used the  		allowance to pay for community services, such as adult day care,  		transportation, and meal delivery. One-quarter of childrens parents and  		16 percent of nonelderly adults used the allowance to pay for personal care  		supplies. According to program staff who participated in site visit  		discussions, consumers were often able to purchase supplies from commercial  		establishments for less than Medicaid typically paid vendors.</p>

</tr></table><p>Consultant questionnaire data provide detailed examples of the types of  		goods and services consumers included in their purchasing plans. For example,  		72 percent of consultants worked with a consumer whose purchasing plan included  		incontinence supplies (Appendix <a href="#tableA19">Table A.19</a>). Other  		items and services--each reported by roughly 20 percent of  		consultants--included devices to aid mobility, dietary supplements,  		transportation by taxi or van, training or education for the consumer, and  		over-the-counter medications. </p>
<p>Few consultants mentioned particularly creative uses of the allowances  		in their questionnaire responses, but some did. Among a handful of consultants  		reporting that a consumer used the allowance to hire workers with special  		skills, for example, one noted that a consumer purchased services from a  		psychiatrist who was able to communicate with the consumer in sign language  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA20">Table A.20</a>). Several consultants also  		mentioned that parents used the allowance for special summer camps or  		extracurricular activities. One consultant worked with a child with autism  		whose behavior suffered during interruptions to daily routines. The parents  		used the childs CDC allowance to pay for recreational programs during  		school vacations, which made breaks from school less disruptive. Finally, a  		consultant described a wheelchair-bound consumer who used the allowance to dine  		outside the home twice a month with a friend. Before enrolling in CDC, the  		consumer had not been on social outings in several years. </p>
<p>Although spending rules were quite flexible under CDC, consumers were  		not entirely unfettered in using the allowance. The CDC notebook listed gifts,  		loans, rent or mortgage payments, clothing groceries, and entertainment as  		examples of prohibited purchases. According to questionnaire data, about  		one-fourth of consultants denied consumers requests to use the allowance  		for certain purchases (Appendix <a href="#tableA20">Table A.20</a>). One  		questionnaire respondent did not approve use of the CDC allowance for a  		swimming pool alarm, which parents requested after the child learned to open  		the latch of the fence around the pool. Another respondent, apparently helping  		a family conserve scarce allowance dollars, did not approve a plan to spend the  		allowance on dietary supplements that Medicaid ordinarily covers. Still another  		respondent reported that a CDC district office denied a familys request  		to pay for services provided by a school for the deaf, although the consultant  		thought the request was allowable. For their part, 32 percent of consumers said  		during interviews that CDC spending rules preventing them from obtaining goods  		or services that would have enhanced their independence. (They were not asked  		to provide examples.)</p>
<h3>Consumer Satisfaction</h3>
<p><b>Satisfaction with CDC</b>. Consumers were largely satisfied with the  		CDC program. Eighty-eight percent of respondents to the nine-month evaluation  		interview said they would recommend CDC to others who wanted more control  		over their personal care services (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a> and  		Appendix <a href="#tableA21">Table A.21</a>). Among allowance recipients,  		roughly 60 percent said the allowance had greatly improved their lives, and  		another quarter said life improved somewhat. Satisfaction was fairly uniform  		across age groups. </p>
<p>Asked about the most important way the allowance improved their lives,  		consumers most often cited having the ability to choose their own caregivers  		(cited by 25 percent of all consumers) (Appendix <a href="#tableA21">Table  		A.21</a>). Many consumers (20 percent) said managing the allowance contributed  		to their sense of independence or control, or that the care they purchased with  		the allowance contributed to their childs emotional well-being. Another  		common improvement, cited by 14 percent of consumers, was the ability to obtain  		higher-quality services than they were used to in the usual waiver program.  		</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Satisfaction with Personal Assistance Services</b>. Nine months after  		enrollment, most consumers reported they were somewhat or very satisfied with  		their overall care arrangements and with specific aspects of their paid care.  		Nonetheless, sizable proportions of consumers needed help or more help with  		various activities or needed more personal care supplies. Across age groups,  		the proportions of consumers who were very satisfied with their overall care  		arrangements were 56 percent of childrens parents, 67 percent of  		nonelderly adults, and 50percent of elderly adults (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA22a">Table A.22a</a>). Not only were nonelderly adults most  		likely to be very satisfied, they were least likely to be dissatisfied (at 6  		percent).<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> Regardless  		of age group, consumers who used their allowance to hire workers were uniformly  		satisfied with the <i>way</i> workers performed their tasks and with their  		relationships with workers. Asked about aspects of paid workers  		reliability, promptness, and disposition, childrens parents were somewhat  		more satisfied than were other consumers. For example, 92 percent of parents  		said paid workers always or almost always completed their tasks, compared with  		83 percent and 74 percent of nonelderly and elderly consumers, respectively.  		Likewise, 94 percent of childrens parents said paid workers were never  		rude or disrespectful, compared with an average of 85 percent of consumers in  		the adult age groups. In an exception to this pattern, elderly consumers were  		more likely than others to say their paid workers never tried to help them when  		they did not want help. This may be because elderly consumers, who had physical  		rather than developmental disabilities, may have been more able than other  		consumers to express their preferences. </p>
<p>As noted, sizable proportions of consumers who used the allowance to pay  		workers reported having unmet needs for personal care supplies and for help  		with tasks around the house, personal care, routine health care, and  		transportation. Overall, the proportions reporting unmet needs ranged from 20  		percent (for help with routine health care) to 33 percent (for help with tasks  		around the house and community) (Appendix <a href="#tableA22a">Table  		A.22a</a>). In each instance, elderly consumers were more likely than others to  		report unmet needs. Like the other demonstration states, however, Florida did  		not expect that consumer direction would eradicate all unmet needs, which may  		be impossible at any cost. </p>
<h3>Disenrollment</h3>
<p>As in the other demonstration states, a substantial proportion of  		Florida consumers--35 percent--disenrolled from the CDC program within a year  		of enrollment (Appendix <a href="#tableA23">Table A.23</a>). Most did so  		voluntarily, according to program records, but others were disenrolled because  		the program could not locate them through available contact information, or  		because they lost Medicaid or HCBS eligibility. In addition, 4 percent of all  		consumers died. Both disenrollment and death were much more common in the  		elderly age group than in the other two. Nearly half of all elderly consumers  		disenrolled from the program during the follow-up year, compared with 34  		percent of younger adults and 20 percent of children. Ten percent of elderly  		consumers died during the follow-up year, compared with about 1 percent of  		other consumers.</p>
<p>During six or nine-month interviews, consumers who disenrolled  		voluntarily were asked why they had done so. Overall, consumers most commonly  		said they disenrolled because they changed their mind or were satisfied with  		their usual waiver benefits (reported by 35 percent of voluntary disenrollees)  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA23">Table A.23</a>). Others said the allowance was  		not enough (21 percent), that they had a conflict with program staff or found  		program rules too restrictive (13 percent), or that they had difficulty with  		their responsibilities as employers under the program (13 percent). Across age  		groups, elderly consumers were considerably more likely than consumers in the  		other age groups to disenroll because they had problems with their  		responsibilities as employers or with their fiscal responsibilities. Nonelderly  		consumers were more likely than the others to disenroll because of a conflict  		with program staff or because of program rules. </p>
<p>It is notable that two-thirds of consumers who disenrolled from the  		program did so within six months of enrolling, and 88 percent did so without  		receiving the allowance. This suggests that these consumers quickly determined  		that consumer direction was not for them and chose to continue with their usual  		HCBS. In contrast, consumers who succeeded in starting on the allowance tended  		to stay with the program.</p>
<h3>Experiences of Different Types of Consumers</h3>
<p>Because demonstration enrollment was voluntary, CDC presumably attracted  		beneficiaries who wished to direct their own supportive services or those of  		their child. Nonetheless, participating in the program--developing a purchasing  		plan, hiring workers, and buying others services and goods--may have required  		more effort than some consumers and representatives were willing to expend.  		Satisfaction with the program was high, but not universal. What types of  		consumers found CDC worthwhile and satisfying? One could speculate that  		consumers who felt ill served by Floridas usual HCBS programs would be  		more willing than others to undertake the responsibilities of consumer  		direction. This group might include consumers who found agency workers or other  		providers unreliable or too unlike them ethnically or culturally. Consumers  		with a strong desire to pay family or friends for caregiving might also be more  		motivated than others to fully participate in the program once enrolled.  		Conversely, one could speculate that consumer direction might be difficult for  		consumers with poor health or functioning, for those without hiring or  		supervisory experience, or for those without someone in mind to hire.  		Understanding the relationship between the characteristics, circumstances, and  		motivation of consumers and their probability of success at consumer direction  		could help program administrators hone their outreach efforts, identify  		possible shortcomings in program services, and dispel any prejudices about  		beneficiaries suitability for consumer direction. </p>
<p>In this analysis, key indicators of consumers experiences with CDC  		were regressed against a fairly comprehensive, but selected, set of  		characteristics measured during consumers baseline interviews. The  		outcomes were whether consumers:</p>
<ul><li>Started receiving the allowance within nine months of  		  enrollment.</li>
<li>Voluntarily left the program within nine months or one year of  		  enrolling.</li>
<li>Found it difficult to hire a worker or tried to hire but failed.</li>
<li>Said the programs spending rules kept them from buying things  		  that would have increased their independence.</li>
<li>Said the allowance had greatly improved their life (if they received  		  the allowance).</li>
<li>Were very satisfied with overall care arrangements at the nine-month  		  interview.</li>
<li>Had an unmet need for personal care at the nine-month interview.</li>
</ul><p>The following discussion considers characteristics that were associated  		with outcomes at the 0.05 significance level. Coefficient estimates and  		p-values are found throughout Appendix <a href="#tableA24">Tables A.24</a> to  		A.28, as noted.</p>
<p>Several characteristics were positively associated with consumers  		starting on the CDC allowance and remaining in the program (Appendix  		<a href="#tableA24">Table A.24</a> and <a href="#tableA28">Table A.28</a>).  		These were allowance amount at baseline, early enrollment, and considering it  		very important to be able to pay family or friends for caregiving. Compared  		with consumers eligible for the smallest allowances (less than $150 per week),  		consumers eligible for larger ones were more likely to actually receive the  		allowance within nine months of enrolling. Furthermore, consumers eligible for  		allowances of $500 a week or more were less likely than consumers with the  		smallest allowances to disenroll within nine months or a year. Some consumers  		eligible for smaller allowances, and presumably with lesser needs, may have  		decided that program responsibilities were not worth the bother once they  		received their CDC notebooks or met with consultants. All else being equal,  		consumers who joined the demonstration during the first half of the evaluation  		enrollment period, June 2000 to June 2001, were more likely to receive the  		allowance and remain in the program than consumers who enrolled later. CDC  		employed both of its outreach strategies during this early period, relying  		first on case managers and support coordinators and then on enrollment  		specialists. Thus, the association between early enrollment and success in the  		program may be more a function of the self-motivation of early enrollees than  		of the outreach strategy employed by the program. Finally, consumers who  		considered it very important to be able to hire family and friends when they  		enrolled in the demonstration were more likely than others to receive the  		allowance and remain in the program. Again, success in the program appears to  		be linked to ones motivation for joining in the first place. </p>
<p>Two demographic characteristics were associated with success in the  		program or lack thereof. All else being equal, Black consumers were less likely  		than White consumers to receive the allowance and remain in the program for a  		year (Appendix <a href="#tableA24">Table A.24</a> and <a href="#tableA28">Table  		A.28</a>). Compared with adults ages 18-59, adults ages 60 or older were more  		likely to disenroll from the program within nine months. However, it is  		noteworthy that, among consumers who received the CDC allowance, elderly adults  		were more likely than younger adults to say it had greatly improved their lives  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA27">Table A.27</a>).</p>
<p>Allowance amount and early enrollment were associated with positive  		outcomes in addition to starting on the allowance and remaining in the program.  		Consumers eligible for allowances of more than $150 a week were less likely  		than others to find hiring difficult and more likely than the others to say  		that the allowance had greatly improved their life or their childs life  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA25">Table A.25</a> and <a href="#tableA27">Table  		A.27</a>). Similarly, consumers eligible for allowances between $300 and $499 a  		week were more likely than consumers eligible for the smallest allowances to  		say they were very satisfied with their overall care arrangements at follow-up  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA27">Table A.27</a>). Early enrollees were also less  		likely than later ones to find hiring difficult or program rules restrictive  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA25">Table A.25</a> and <a href="#tableA26">Table  		A.26</a>). </p>
<p>Consumers caregiver networks and having past hiring experience  		were also associated with success in the program. Not surprisingly, consumers  		with informal caregivers at baseline were less likely than those with none to  		say hiring was difficult (Appendix <a href="#tableA25">Table A.25</a>). In  		addition, compared with allowance recipients who had no informal caregivers at  		baseline, those with one informal caregiver were more likely to say the  		allowance greatly improved life and less likely to say CDC program rules were  		too restrictive (Appendix <a href="#tableA26">Table A.26</a> and  		<a href="#tableA27">Table A.27</a>). In contrast, consumers who received help  		from paid caregivers during the week before the baseline interview were more  		likely than consumers without paid caregivers to disenroll from the program  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA28">Table A.28</a>). It could be that consumers with  		paid caregivers felt well served by their HCBS waiver program and ultimately  		decided not to stay in consumer direction. Finally, consumers or  		representatives who had hired someone on a private basis, such as a housekeeper  		or babysitter, were more likely than other consumers to start on the allowance  		within nine months of enrolling in CDC, presumably because they were undaunted  		by the idea of recruiting workers and, perhaps, already had workers in mind  		(Appendix <a href="#tableA24">Table A.24</a>). Among allowance recipients,  		consumers with hiring experience were more likely than others to say the  		allowance greatly improved their lives, perhaps because they made successful  		hires (Appendix <a href="#tableA27">Table A.27</a>). </p>
<p>Few other patterns emerged; however, characteristics that were  		<i>not</i> associated with program outcomes bear mentioning. All else being  		equal, the outcomes we examined were not related to whether consumers or their  		representatives had graduated from high school, or whether consumers lived  		alone. There also was no evidence to suggest that poor health or functional  		impairments interfered with consumer direction. In fact, among allowance  		recipients, consumers in poor health at baseline were more likely than  		consumers in good or excellent health to say the allowance greatly improved  		life (Appendix <a href="#tableA27">Table A.27</a>).</p>
<p>In summary, the analysis suggests that no segment of the CDC consumer  		population had consistently negative experiences in the program. Those who with  		consistently positive experiences were early enrollees--presumably the most  		eager and self-motivated consumers--and those with fairly generous allowances.  		Consumers who were very interested in paying family or friends for caregiving,  		who had informal caregivers when they enrolled in the program, and who had  		prior hiring experience also had positive experiences in the program. This  		pattern suggests that consumers who enroll in CDC without a hiring strategy in  		mind may need additional advice about hiring from program consultants.</p>
<h3>Consultant Assessment of CDC</h3>
<p>Consultants also were asked to assess the experiences of different types  		of consumers. In questionnaire responses, consultants said CDC worked best for  		consumers who were dissatisfied with their usual HCBS (reported by 33 percent  		of consultants), wished to purchase services or goods not covered by Medicaid  		(24 percent), or had a relative or friend in mind to hire as a worker (15  		percent) (Appendix <a href="#tableA29">Table A.29</a>). Thirteen percent of  		consultants said the program did not work well for consumers who needed more  		care than they could obtain with the allowance. In addition, 47 percent of  		consultants said they worked with at least one consumer or representative who  		required extensive assistance from them (Appendix <a href="#tableA30">Table  		A.30</a>). Consumers who required the most help had little experience in  		preparing budgets and solving problems, or in recruiting, hiring, and training  		workers. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know how consultants defined  		extensive assistance when responding to the survey, in light of  		expectations that appropriate consumers should need limited assistance to  		succeed in the program.</p>
<p>In assessing the program more generally during site visit discussions  		and in response to the questionnaire, consultants identified three main  		weaknesses in program implementation. First, some consultants reported that  		many consumers enrolled in the demonstration without clearly understanding the  		CDC program. According to the consultants, this problem may have stemmed from  		enrollment specialists not having enough time to thoroughly explain the program  		to the consumers they visited or from efforts to boost enrollment. As a result,  		the consultants had to explain CDC in detail to newly enrolled consumers, some  		of whom quickly disenrolled. Second, consultants reported that fiscal agent  		staff were unresponsive to them or to consumers who called the fiscal agent  		directly. This problem seems to have stemmed partly from staffing levels. The  		fiscal agent reduced its staff size while enrollment lagged only to find it  		inadequate when enrollment surged in response to letters from the  		governors office. At the time our site visit, the CDC program, unsure  		whether consumer complaints originated with a vocal minority or represented  		widespread dissatisfaction, was preparing to conduct a postcard survey of  		consumer satisfaction with the fiscal agent. Third, some consultants reported  		that consumers were unhappy with the timeliness of worker payment, especially  		for the first paycheck. For procedural reasons, payroll- processing normally  		took at least three weeks, and the initial processing took somewhat longer. The  		fiscal agent reduced payroll-processing time by instituting a direct-deposit  		service for workers paid with the CDC allowance. </p>
<p>As for their own CDC responsibilities, one-quarter of consultants  		indicated in questionnaires that they would change those responsibilities in  		some way, but few offered specific recommendations. Ten consultants said they  		should do more for consumers--for example, by behaving more like social workers  		or spending more time with the consumers (Appendix <a href="#tableA31">Table  		A.31</a>). In contrast, seven consultants thought they should do less for  		consumers, by behaving more like advisers or not explaining the program to them  		in great detail.</p>
<p>Only 39 percent of consultants thought they were adequately trained for  		their CDC responsibilities. Of those who made suggestions about program  		training, 53 consultants would change its content. Some wanted less emphasis on  		training philosophy and more on the practicalities of helping consumers develop  		purchasing plans and do paperwork. Some consultants said they wished to be  		better informed about changes in program policies. Twenty-five consultants  		suggested either that Florida reduce the time between training and actually  		working with consumers or that the state provide refresher training during  		lengthy delays. (This comment in particular may reflect that program  		implementation was unexpectedly delayed by protracted contract negotiations  		between the state and the organization chosen as the CDC fiscal agent. Some  		consultants had been trained well before those negotiations began and had to be  		retrained later, when it was time to actually work with consumers.) During site  		visit discussions, we learned that, after the initial consultant training  		session, CDC program staff developed separate training curricula for  		consultants who were to work with consumers who had developmental disabilities  		and those who were to work with elderly adults or adults with physical  		disabilities.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY, LESSONS, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Floridas CDC program tested the Cash and Counseling model of  		consumer-directed Medicaid supportive services. Like the two other  		demonstration programs, in Arkansas and New Jersey, CDC offered consumers a  		monthly allowance and counseling and fiscal services, and let them designate a  		representative decision maker if they wished. Of the three demonstration  		states, however, only Florida targeted the demonstration to people with  		primarily developmental disabilities, and only Florida enrolled children.  		Whereas Arkansas and New Jersey based the consumer-directed allowance only on  		state plan PCS, Florida cashed out a full range of HCBS benefits, including  		some specialized professional services. Moreover, the portion of the allowance  		that consumers could receive as cash for incidental expenditures was larger in  		Florida than in the other states (20 percent versus 10 percent). For these  		reasons, it could be argued that Florida granted consumers and representatives  		more responsibility than did the other two demonstration states. In addition,  		unlike the other states, Florida relied on case managers and support  		coordinators from the traditional HCBS programs to provide consulting services  		to CDC consumers. It also initially relied on them to conduct outreach and  		enrollment.</p>
<p>In implementing CDC, Florida was challenged by sluggish enrollment and  		delays in starting consumers on the program allowance. The state addressed both  		problems, but they did not disappear altogether. </p>
<p>Despite the challenges the program encountered, most consumers said they  		would recommend it to other people wanting more control over their personal  		care. Consumers who developed purchasing plans said they received helpful  		guidance from program consultants, and consumers who received the allowance  		took advantage of the ability to use it flexibly. Allowance recipients  		successfully hired workers and were very satisfied with them, and some used the  		allowance to purchase supplies and community services. Consultants generally  		reported that CDC was well received by consumers, despite room for  		administrative improvement.</p>
<h3>Implementation Lessons from CDC</h3>
<p><b>Outreach and Enrollment</b>. During the first six months of the  		demonstration, when Florida relied on case managers and support coordinators to  		enroll eligible HCBS recipients into the demonstration, enrollment lagged far  		behind evaluation targets. Many case managers did not support the concept of  		consumer-directed care, particularly for elderly beneficiaries, and many  		support coordinators were distracted from the demonstration by other duties.  		Enrollment increased somewhat when program staff began reporting monthly  		enrollment statistics to the governors office. It increased even more  		when the governors office sent an introductory letter to eligible  		beneficiaries and temporary state employees were hired as enrollment  		specialists. Children and young adults with developmental disabilities enrolled  		in the demonstration rather quickly, possibly because their parents were  		experienced advocates and thus undaunted by the prospect of consumer direction.  		In contrast, elderly adults enrolled much more slowly, at least in part because  		many case managers disparaged the demonstration during visits with them. </p>
<p><b>Consultants, Fiscal Agents, and Representatives</b>. Consultants,  		fiscal agents, and consumer-designated representatives all contributed to  		consumers participation in CDC. Floridas decision to recruit CDC  		consultants from the ranks of case managers and support coordinators was  		fiscally practical, and it was thought that consumers would benefit from the  		continuity of the arrangement. However, the decision also had a serious  		downside. Some consultants were the very case managers who had been reluctant  		to enroll beneficiaries in CDC in the first place. Now they were expected to  		help beneficiaries on their way to consumer direction, and their reluctance did  		seem to delay the allowance for some consumers, particularly elderly  		ones.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> Moreover, most  		consultants thought they were not adequately trained for their CDC roles. Some  		recommended longer training, refresher training, or training that emphasized  		the practical aspect of their jobs rather than the philosophy of consumer  		direction. For the most part, however, consumers were satisfied with the  		consultant services they received, and many consultants reported positively  		about consumers experiences in the program. </p>
<p>The organization that Florida retained to provide consumers with fiscal  		services had some trouble meeting its CDC responsibilities. Most important, CDC  		had been operating for many months before the fiscal agent was able to supply  		consumers and their consultants with timely, understandable, and detailed  		financial statements. The trouble seemed to stem partly from slow cash flow,  		higher-than-expected costs, and inadequate reimbursement from the program. Most  		of the fiscal agents compensation for CDC was in the form of consumer  		fees; program enrollment lags translated into revenue lags for the fiscal agent  		and, in turn, affected its ability to serve a small caseload efficiently. Even  		after caseloads grew, however, the fiscal agents costs far exceeded what  		it earned in consumer fees.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Representatives were key to many adult consumers success with CDC.  		Children, of course, could not have participated without one. Consultants  		believed that nearly all representatives acted in consumers best  		interests. Floridas decision to allow (unpaid) representatives to also  		serve as consumers paid workers raised questions about conflicts of  		interest. During the evaluation period, Florida permitted such arrangements if  		they could not be readily avoided (as might be the case in a single-parent  		family of a minor consumer). In addition, it asked someone identified by the  		consumers family to check on the consumers well-being, and the  		consultant telephoned that person and the representative for monitoring  		purposes.</p>
<p><b>Starting on the Monthly Allowance</b>. For many consumers, getting  		started on the monthly allowance was not easy or quick. Personal circumstances,  		such as declining health and lack of family caregivers, undoubtedly prevented  		some consumers from developing a purchasing plan. More commonly, however,  		consultants and program staff attributed allowance delays to the slow  		processing of paperwork by program staff and the fiscal agent and to consumers  		needing more help in developing purchasing plans than consultants or the  		program initially expected. </p>
<p>We considered other possible reasons that so few consumers received the  		allowance during the follow-up year. For example, because consumers received  		HCBS as usual during the allowance-planning process, they might not have been  		motivated to work on their purchasing plans. Service continuity was an  		important, perhaps indispensable, consumer protection; however, it may have  		contributed to the finding that, across age groups, being satisfied with  		traditional services and changing ones mind about CDC were the most  		common reasons for voluntary disenrollment. It might also be argued that more  		consumers would have been able to develop and implement a purchasing plan if  		PCS alone had been cashed out as the program allowance, leaving consumers to  		receive any specialized professional services, such as occupational therapy,  		through the usual system of service delivery.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> Although assuming responsibility for the  		full range of HCBS might have deterred some people from enrolling in the  		demonstration, it is also true that the group of consumers who enrolled most  		quickly were those with developmental disabilities and, thus, those most likely  		to have services other than personal care in their waiver support plans.  		Moreover, the multivariate models we used to identify factors associated with  		allowance receipt and staying in the program suggested that having a relatively  		large allowance--and hence relatively high service needs--was strongly  		associated with success in the program. Being eligible for a generous allowance  		does not necessarily mean consumers care plans included services other  		than personal care, but our findings do not cast doubts on Floridas  		decision to cash out the full range of HCBS benefits. </p>
<p>Over time, the CDC program office realized that once consumers cleared  		the allowance-planning hurdle, they managed other CDC responsibilities ably.  		The program instructed consultants to provide more hands-on assistance to  		consumers who needed it and it offered more help to consumers who had not  		started on the allowance within 90 days of enrollment. Even after this change,  		consultants in Florida had much less responsibility than their counterparts in  		Arkansas for helping consumers with allowance-planning. The Arkansas  		fiscal/counseling agency was contractually obligated to start consumers on the  		allowance within 45 days (originally 60) of random assignment, and a program  		database generated periodic reminders to counselors about consumers who were  		not yet allowance recipients. The strategy seemed effective; 80 percent of  		Arkansas consumers received the program allowance within three months of random  		assignment, compared with 18 percent of Florida consumers. The lesson for other  		states is to expect that many consumers will need considerable hands-on  		assistance in developing purchasing plans and that needing help should not  		preclude program participation. </p>
<h3>How CDC Addressed Policy Concerns</h3>
<p>As noted in the introduction, consumer direction in a publicly-funded  		program like Medicaid raises certain concerns among policymakers, including:  		(1) whether consumer direction should be available to all users of supportive  		services; (2) whether to allow family members to be paid for caregiving; (3)  		how to ensure care quality; (4) how to ensure that workers are trained  		adequately and treated fairly; and (5) how to avoid fraudulent use of the cash  		benefit. We conclude this report by discussing how the structure and procedures  		of Floridas CDC program addressed each of these concerns.</p>
<p><b>Assessing Suitability for Consumer Direction</b>. Like the other two  		Cash and Counseling states, Florida had a policy to<i> not</i> screen  		prospective enrollees on their suitability for consumer direction. The state  		instead decided it would inform prospects of the rights and responsibilities of  		CDC consumers and let them decide for themselves whether to enroll.  		Importantly, Florida granted consumers the right: (1) to disenroll from CDC and  		return to their HCBS waiver program by the first day of the following month,  		without risk of being placed on a waiting list; and (2) to receive HCBS waiver  		benefits until the CDC allowance started. </p>
<p>In practice, at least initially, the judgments of case managers and  		program staff may have discouraged the enrollment and active participation of  		some consumers more than the states take-all-comers policy would suggest.  		As noted earlier, some case managers appear to have discouraged elderly adults  		from enrolling in the program because they did not think consumer direction was  		suitable for them. Likewise, some consultants were reluctant to help consumers  		develop their purchasing plans believing that consumers who needed extensive  		help were not fit for the program. </p>
<p>Once it recognized these tendencies, CDC made two important changes: (1)  		it shifted outreach responsibilities from case managers and support  		coordinators to enrollment specialists who proved less likely to prejudge  		beneficiaries fitness for consumer direction; and (2) it offered  		consumers more help in developing their purchasing plans, and instructed  		consultants to provide that additional help. Our analysis did not identify any  		subgroup of consumers with consistently negative program experiences. Despite  		some skepticism about the programs suitability for elderly consumers,  		elderly adults who received the CDC allowance were more likely than nonelderly  		adults to say the program greatly improved their quality of life.</p>
<p><b>Paying Family Members</b>. There is a long-standing debate about the  		appropriateness of using public funds to pay family members (Simon-Rusinowitz  		et al. forthcoming; Doty 2004; Benjamin 2001; Benjamin et al. 2000; Tilly and  		Weiner 2001; Doty et al. 1999). Proponents of paying family members contend  		that the practice may help postpone caregiver burnout or compensate for  		constraints on labor force participation. Some opponents argue that payment may  		erode traditional values about familial responsibility, while others worry that  		consumers may feel obligated to hire family members and thus not exercise full  		autonomy. Other opponents worry about the effects of payment on public costs.  		Will consumer direction lead government to pay for services that family  		caregivers have long provided free? Will it induce caregivers to demand  		payment?</p>
<p>This report has shown that the ability to hire family members was an  		important aspect of consumers success in CDC. Before random assignment,  		83 percent of consumers said hiring family members was important to them; among  		consumers who hired workers, 58 percent hired family; and among allowance  		recipients, 30 percent said the ability to choose caregivers or compensate  		informal caregivers was the greatest benefit of program participation.  		Moreover, program consultants did not mention observing frayed family  		relationships as a result of consumers paying relatives. </p>
<p>Current federal law allows relatives to be paid for caregiving only if  		they are not legally responsible for their care recipient. (Parents are legally  		responsible for minor children, as are spouses for adults.) In contrast, the  		federal waivers for the Cash and Counseling demonstration did allow consumers  		to hire legally responsible relatives. In Florida, less than 3 percent of  		adults who used the allowance to hire workers hired their spouse, and 29  		percent of minor children had a parent for a paid worker. We conducted  		sensitivity tests to compare the experiences of children whose parents were  		paid with those of other children. (Paid spouses were too few to support such a  		comparison.) The tests suggested that children with paid parents were more  		likely than other children to receive their program allowance within nine  		months of random assignment (not shown). Parents of these children were more  		likely than other parents to say their childs life had been greatly  		improved by the allowance, and they were less likely to report that their child  		had unmet needs for personal care. That children with paid parents got started  		on the allowance promptly is not surprising. Parents who paid themselves did  		not have to spend time recruiting other caregivers (unless they also hired  		others), and the prospect of becoming paid may have induced them to develop a  		purchasing plan quickly. Consultants who took part in site visit discussions or  		responded to the questionnaire suggested that only rarely did parents even  		appear to take undue advantage of the opportunity to be paid. </p>
<p><b>Ensuring Consumer Safety</b>. Ensuring the health and safety of  		vulnerable consumers without oversight from home care agencies and hands-on  		involvement from case managers is a major concern for consumer direction. For  		many years, regulations for agency delivered home care have existed to ensure  		care quality through requirements about agency structure and worker training  		and supervision (Kapp 2000; Doty et al. 1996). Researchers and policymakers  		disagree, however, about how to define and assess care quality in  		consumer-directed models. Should the uniform professional standards of  		agency-based care apply? Or are consumers the more appropriate arbiters of  		quality? In 1999, most United States consumer-directed personal assistance  		programs (74 percent) required workers to have specific qualifications; nearly  		half (45 percent) required some type of worker training; and most (88percent)  		conducted quality monitoring activities such as case management, consumer  		satisfaction reviews, and program evaluations (Flanagan 2001).</p>
<p>Consumers, consultants, and CDC program staff gave no evidence that  		participation in CDC led to any adverse effects on consumers health and  		safety. CDC monitored consumer safety and care quality primarily through  		consultants contacts with consumers and representatives, which occurred  		by telephone and in consumers homes. The program found that the  		appropriate frequency of monitoring visits varied for different types of  		consumers. For those who could articulate their needs and concerns, telephone  		calls to the consumer and representative were usually enough to identify the  		rare cases of potential neglect. For adults with developmental disabilities and  		for children, visits helped ensure the safety of consumers who may have had  		difficulty communicating their needs. While there was little evidence of  		consumer neglect or exploitation in CDC, project staff did develop formal  		arrangements for consultants to refer suspicious cases to protective services  		agencies. </p>
<p>For the most part, consumers were satisfied with their care arrangements  		and with the CDC program, as this report shows. Furthermore, they fared as well  		as, or better than, their counterparts in a randomly assigned control group on  		objective, care-related outcomes such as falls, bed sores, and injuries (Foster  		et al. 2004; Carlson et al. 2005). </p>
<p><b>Preventing Exploitation of Workers</b>. Mistreatment of workers is a  		potential problem in consumer-directed programs. Although CDC workers had no  		formal mechanism for reporting grievances, exploitation does not seem to have  		been a serious problem in CDC. During our site visit, consultants mentioned two  		cases that involved seemingly insensitive or arbitrary behavior on the part of  		consumers as employers. In our survey of consultants, just two out of 195  		reported evidence of possible worker abuse by consumers, representatives, or  		other family members. </p>
<p>In addition to concerns about worker abuse and exploitation, critics of  		consumer-directed care worry that workers hired directly by consumers will  		suffer from low pay and a lack of fringe benefits. It is true that few CDC  		consumers offered fringe benefits; however, nearly all worked for the consumer  		part-time, and fringe benefits are rare in most part-time jobs. Although  		consumers set workers wages, the CDC fiscal agent helped protect workers  		by adhering to state labor laws regarding overtime pay that some consumers were  		unaware of. </p>
<p><b>Preventing Misuse of Public Funds</b>. The CDC project developed  		three policies to prevent abuse of the allowance. First, consultants were to  		review the consumers monthly financial statement with the consumer or  		representative during the monthly call or visit. Second, consumers were to  		retain receipts and maintain records of incidental purchases made with cash.  		Third, in most cases, the fiscal agent was to pay only for purchases listed in  		consumers purchasing plans. </p>
<p>Practice did not initially adhere to policy. The CDC fiscal agents  		difficulty in producing timely, well-designed financial statements seriously  		impeded the ability of consultants and consumers to monitor use of funds and  		prevent overspending. This problem seems to have persisted for much of the  		first 18 months of the life of CDC. Consultants differed in their understanding  		of, and willingness to follow, the programs policy that they review  		consumers receipts for cash purchases. However, since cash purchases  		could not exceed 20 percent of the monthly allowance, receipt review may not  		have been critical to preventing major abuses of the allowance. Overall,  		unintentional misuse of the allowance, such as overspending, did occasionally  		result from difficulties in program implementation.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Floridas CDC program offered a diverse group of HCBS recipients  		the opportunity to control the who, what, how, and when of their  		disability-related supportive services. Our analysis suggested consumers most  		likely to find success in the program were early enrollees, those eligible for  		relatively generous allowances, those interested in paying family or friends,  		and those with informal caregivers. Having prior hiring experience, or having a  		representative with such experience, was also associated with positive  		outcomes. Information from several sources suggests that, had the program  		decided differently on a few design decisions and been less firm in initial  		expectations about how much assistance consumers might need to get started in  		the program, positive outcomes might have been more common within other  		subgroups, including elderly consumers.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the demonstration in Florida addressed many important  		concerns about publicly-funded consumer-directed care. Program staff developed  		policies that adhered to the tenets of the Cash and Counseling model of service  		delivery and made adjustments in those areas where practice fell short of those  		policies. Encouraged by evidence that consumer direction improves quality of  		life for many participants, Florida continues to offer the CDC program as an  		option to eligible HCBS recipients. Moreover, in summer 2002 the state  		legislature passed the Florida Consumer-Directed Care Act, which directed  		several state agencies to develop and seek Medicaid waivers for  		consumer-directed programs like CDC.</p>

The focus group moderator observed that the case managers were very  			 skeptical of the ability of their elderly clients to participate in CDC. They  			 believe the clients are too frail, too sick, and with a much too limited  			 support system to be able to participate.

Overall, demonstration participants represented 8.2  			 percent of eligible HCBS recipients--16.0 percent of children known to be  			 eligible, 5.6 percent of nonelderly adults, and 7.6 percent of elderly adults  			 (Foster et al. 2005).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">In</a> cashing out a full range of HCBS benefits,  			 Florida differed from the other demonstration states, which cashed out only  			 state plan PCS. All treatment and control group members in Florida received  			 HCBS before enrolling in the demonstration--as the state required--but not all  			 received PCS, per se. Some HCBS care/support plans include benefits such as  			 therapy or supplies, but not personal care, according to individual  			 needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">In</a> fact, all consumers with developmental  			 disabilities had experienced a recent change in the care plans because of the  			 aforementioned court order. Therefore, for this segment of the demonstration  			 population, Florida was not able to implement its initial plan to determine the  			 monthly budget from claims history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">During</a> the evaluation period, Florida sometimes  			 allowed the same person to be a consumers representative and paid worker  			 if: (1) two people were not available, as in a single-parent family, for  			 example; and (2) someone else from the consumers circle of  			 support verified that the representative/worker had performed the  			 agreed-upon services. The state later modified its operational protocol so that  			 no one could serve as both a representative and paid worker. This restriction  			 is currently enforced in Floridas CDC+ program, which operates under a  			 Section 1115 waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">Payments</a> for incidental expenditures were later  			 limited to $250 per month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">Hourly</a> rates differed by agency, but they were  			 the same as those paid for case management under the usual waiver program.  			 Quarterly average payments per CDC consumer, including training visits, were  			 capped at the historical average of quarterly payments per client for case  			 management services at that agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">Rates</a> for consultants serving consumers with  			 developmental disabilities varied over time; $148 per month was in effect at  			 the time of our site visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">Per-check</a> fees increased slightly during the  			 second year of the demonstration, but the monthly maximum charge remained  			 $25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note16" id="note16">The</a> predominance of women among the elderly may  			 reflect the fact that women tend to live longer than men, while the  			 predominance of boys among the children may reflect correlations between sex  			 and certain types of developmental disabilities. Autism, in particular, is more  			 commonly diagnosed in boys than in girls. Floridas DD waiver program  			 serves children with autism (as well as cerebral palsy, mental retardation,  			 Prader-Willi syndrome, and spina bifida).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note17" id="note17">Although</a> consultants were required to help  			 consumers develop their purchasing plans, some consumers disenrolled from CDC  			 without ever getting to that stage of program participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">Our</a> analysis of how consumers used their cash  			 is limited in that the data do not differentiate the purchase of professional  			 services, such as behavior therapy and nursing, from the purchase of personal  			 care. In a companion analysis, we will examine consumers preenrollment  			 Medicaid claims for use of professional services to assess the magnitude of  			 this limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note19" id="note19">Where</a> sample sizes permitted, we also examined  			 satisfaction by whether adult consumers responded to the nine month interview  			 themselves or through a proxy (Appendix <a href="#tableA22b">Table A.22b</a>).  			 Among nonelderly adults, self-respondents were somewhat less likely than proxy  			 respondents to say they would recommend the program, and they were  			 substantially less likely to be very satisfied with their overall care  			 arrangements. Among elderly adults, self-respondents also were substantially  			 less likely than proxy respondents to be very satisfied with their care  			 arrangements; however, they were slightly more likely than proxies to say they  			 would recommend the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note20" id="note20">This</a> problem was eventually mitigated by  			 Floridas decision to have CDC caseloads shared by a limited number of  			 consultants per agency. The consultants who applied for the job tended to be  			 those who supported consumer direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note21" id="note21">Florida</a> capped consumer fees at $25 per month,  			 as noted, but experience showed that the fiscal agent would need to earn $70  			 per consumer per month to break even.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note22" id="note22">This</a> hypothesis arose during focus group  			 discussions about why eligible HCBS recipients chose not to enroll in the Cash  			 and Counseling Demonstration. Focus group participants were nonelderly adults  			 with developmental disabilities or their surrogates. The Herron Group, Inc.,  			 Tampa, Florida, conducted the discussions, in October 2003.</p>
