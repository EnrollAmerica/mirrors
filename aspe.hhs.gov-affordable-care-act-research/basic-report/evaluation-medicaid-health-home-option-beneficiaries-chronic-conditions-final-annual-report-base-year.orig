<p>This report presents first-year findings of the long-term evaluation of  		Medicaid health homes, a new model of care authorized in Section 2703 of the  		Affordable Care Act for high-need, high-cost beneficiaries with chronic  		physical conditions or serious mental illness (SMI). The Urban Institute is  		conducting the long-term evaluation for the U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation to  		assess the care models and processes states are using, the extent to which  		health homes result in increased monitoring and care coordination, and whether  		these models result in better care quality, reduced hospital, skilled nursing  		facility, and emergency department use, and lower costs. Findings will inform a  		2017 Report to Congress.</p>
<p>Distinct features of Section 2703 health home model include the elevated  		importance placed on integrating physical health care with behavioral/mental  		health care and on linking enrollees to social services and other community  		supports. States with health home State Plan Amendments (SPAs) approved by the  		Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) receive eight quarters of 90%  		federal match for seven defined services: comprehensive care management, care  		coordination, health promotion, comprehensive transitional care, individual and  		family support services, linkage and referral to community and social support  		services, and use of health information technology (HIT). States have  		flexibility with respect to chronic conditions selected, geographic coverage,  		providers designated, and the payment system for health home services. The  		minimum eligibility criteria are having two chronic conditions, one chronic  		condition and being at risk of a second, or one serious and persistent mental  		health condition.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Structure, Timeline, and Methods</h3>
<p>The long-term evaluation began October 1, 2011, and will continue for  		five years. This report examines the first four states with approved  		SPAs--Missouri, Rhode Island, New York, and Oregon. Additional states will be  		selected for evaluation as their SPAs are approved. For each SPA, initial  		evaluation activities are developing background materials on program design and  		implementation context and conducting site visits. These activities provide a  		qualitative foundation for tracking and interpreting program progress over the  		eight-quarter intervention period during which the enhanced federal match is  		available. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted roughly annually  		after in-person site visits. Quantitative analysis of key outcomes will occur  		largely in the final two years of the evaluation and will examine utilization  		and costs for health home participants and comparison groups of  		beneficiaries.</p>
<h3>Profile of First-Year State Health Home Initiatives</h3>
<p>Health homes in the first four states focus on beneficiaries with SMI,  		substance abuse, and chronic physical conditions. New York and Oregon have  		chosen to combine all three populations in single broadly focused SPAs. Health  		home providers in New York are lead agencies that have assembled comprehensive  		service networks, while in Oregon they are the patient-centered primary care  		homes (PCPCHs) that form the foundation of a statewide health system reform.  		Missouri and Rhode Island each have one SPA focused on people with  		mental/behavioral health issues and community mental health centers as health  		home service providers, and a second SPA targeting a different population.  		Missouri's second SPA focuses on beneficiaries with multiple chronic physical  		conditions served by federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics,  		and hospital-operated primary care centers. Rhode Island's second program  		focuses on younger beneficiaries with special health care needs receiving care  		from specialized providers known as Comprehensive Evaluation, Diagnosis,  		Assessment, Referral, Re-evaluation (CEDARR) Family Centers.</p>
<p>With one exception, all four states are relying on per member per month  		(PMPM) payment for health home services. Missouri bases its PMPM on staffing  		needs assumptions. Rhode Island uses a similar methodology for its community  		mental health organizations, based on personnel costs and staffing ratios. New  		York uses regional and case-mix adjusted PMPM payments for health home  		enrollees and pays providers 80% of the PMPM during the period when they are  		attempting to enroll eligible beneficiaries. Oregon's PMPM payments are set at  		three levels based on the extent to which providers meet established criteria  		for PCPCHs. The exception to PMPM payments is Rhode Island's CEDARR Family  		Center-based health homes, which are paid through a mix of fixed service fees  		and established rates per quarter hour of effort.</p>
<h3>Implementation and Emerging Issues</h3>
<p>Our first year activities have yielded a number of insights regarding  		key program features and early implementation lessons we will continue to track  		over the intervention period. </p>
<p><b>Health home models</b>: The six program models vary in terms of how  		much flexibility is afforded to participating providers, which is evident  		across four general areas: provider designation and qualifications (i.e., who  		can be a health home); structure (i.e., how services are provided, and by what  		staff); specification of service requirements; and accountability or reporting  		requirements.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>More prescriptive models (Missouri, Rhode Island) may entail greater  			 up-front provider investments to meet required staffing and make  			 under-enrollment or enrollment discontinuities more of a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A centralized approach to identifying and assigning potential  			 enrollees to providers (Missouri, New York) may identify eligible beneficiaries  			 more comprehensively but may entail greater costs for locating and recruiting  			 enrollees; provider-based enrollment (Oregon, Rhode Island) may run a greater  			 risk of cherry-picking or missing beneficiaries with low connectivity to the  			 health system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration of physical health, mental health, and nonclinical  			 support services is crucial to the success of health homes, but is a challenge  			 even in states with more experience with integration. In all four states,  			 mental health and primary care providers report that paying attention to both  			 physical and mental health issues represents a culture change in the approach  			 to patient care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All four states are struggling with incorporating children into the  			 health home model, which is viewed as more applicable to adults and their  			 providers because of its focus on beneficiaries with chronic conditions,  			 although the extent to which this presents a challenge varies.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Communication</b>: Modes and patterns of communication are still  		being developed within and across sites of care, and particularly between  		health home providers and hospitals and managed care organizations. The extent  		to which new patterns of communication and new protocols are needed depends in  		part on how much of a change from the existing care system the health home  		program represents. In all programs the lack of widespread and interoperable  		information technology systems, and regulatory restrictions on sharing patient  		information created barriers to communication at all levels.</p>
<p><b>Provider issues and challenges</b>: Depending on the program,  		providers are either taking on new roles or becoming a part of a more  		integrated system. Common themes we heard related to who would incur costs and  		who would benefit from the return on investments, the inadequacy of data  		systems to meet provider needs, and the pace and effects of practice  		transformation.</p>
<p><b>HIT infrastructure and issues</b>: Providers in all states noted the  		inadequacy of current electronic health records (EHRs) in supporting care  		integration, the documentation of nonclinical services, or cross-site  		communication. The lack of federal funding to support EHR adoption by  		behavioral health providers was seen as a significant barrier.</p>
<p><b>Role of complementary programs</b>: All four states are building on  		structures and programs that already exist, are attempting to align their  		health home programs with other reforms, and have been able to draw on  		resources and technical assistance made available at both the state and federal  		level in the last several years to support practice transformation, care  		coordination, and mental health integration more generally.</p>
<p><b>The enhanced match</b>: In all four states, the availability of the  		enhanced match was cited as an important part of the motivation for  		implementing health homes.</p>
<h3>Overview of Evaluation Design and Challenges</h3>
<p>Our research design uses a mixed-methods approach employing both  		qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. We have identified  		several challenges to the quantitative aspects of the evaluation and potential  		strategies for addressing them. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Primary challenges are the two-year implementation window, which is  			 a short time over which to realize measurable improvements, and implementation  			 of health homes statewide and alongside a range of other reforms, which makes  			 it difficult to isolate a health home effect and to identify "uncontaminated"  			 comparison groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The variety in state approaches to health home design and enrollment  			 practices may present opportunities to identify state-specific or  			 program-specific design adaptations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Second Year Activities</h3>
<p>In the next year, we will continue to monitor the first four states and  		begin work with new states, which to date include North Carolina, Iowa, and  		Ohio. We also will be receiving administrative data from CMS that will allow us  		to begin developing profiles of the health home eligible populations in each  		state. We will continue to work with states to identify suitable comparison  		groups, obtain identifiers for health home enrollees, and obtain information on  		quality monitoring measures the states are collecting from health home  		providers.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>All states studied in this first year have used the Medicaid Health  		Homes option to augment existing programs, to accelerate movement down an  		established pathway, as one part of larger system reform efforts, or all of the  		above. Even so, implementation appears to be a slow process, at least with  		respect to the eight-quarter intervention period. Particular issues revealed  		through the site visits are those relating to the need to improve communication  		between provider types and settings, as well as the special challenges  		associated with integrating care. In the second evaluation year, the four  		states examined in this report and North Carolina will complete their first  		intervention year and move well into their second years. This will allow us to  		observe how progress toward full implementation and system reform may differ  		across these maturing programs and to document these and other implementation  		issues for new programs in their first intervention year. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This report presents base year findings of the long-term evaluation of  		Medicaid health homes, a new model of care authorized in Section 2703 of the  		Affordable Care Act (ACA) that targets high-need, high-cost beneficiaries with  		chronic conditions or serious mental illness (SMI).<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> We introduce a first group of states implementing the  		health homes option, describe the programs they have designed and the  		programmatic and health system context in which they are being implemented, and  		discuss themes and emerging issues that affect implementation.</p>
<p>The long-term evaluation, one of two called for in Section 2703, is  		being conducted by the Urban Institute for the U.S. Department of Health and  		Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation.  		Ultimately, it will inform a 2017 Report to Congress on the effect of the  		health homes option on reducing hospital admissions, emergency room (ER)  		visits, admissions to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and costs. The second  		evaluation is a survey of states and interim evaluation being conducted by a  		Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) contractor to inform a 2014  		Report to Congress.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Section 2703 Health Homes Model</h3>
<p>Although the Section 2703 health home model is closely related to the  		"patient-centered medical home" model for integrating and coordinating health  		care, distinctive features are the elevated importance the health home model  		places on integration of physical health care with behavioral/mental health  		care and on linking enrollees to community social services and other long-term  		services and supports for the enrollee and family. The vision is that the model  		will ensure coordination and continuity of care across care settings and over  		time by providing a "cost-effective, longitudinal home' to facilitate  		access to an inter-disciplinary array of medical care, behavioral health care,  		and community-based social services and supports for both children and adults  		with chronic conditions."<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>States implementing health homes do so by submitting and obtaining CMS  		approval for a Medicaid State Plan Amendment (SPA) to add health home services  		as an optional benefit. States with approved health home SPAs receive eight  		quarters of 90% federal match for specific health home services identified in  		Section 2703: comprehensive care management; care coordination and health  		promotion; comprehensive transitional care; individual and family support  		services, linkage and referral to community and social support services; and  		use of health information technology (HIT). Consistent with the aim of  		integrating physical and mental/behavioral health care and supportive services,  		Section 2703 requires states to consult with the Substance Abuse and Mental  		Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in developing their proposals,  		regardless of whether the eligible population is defined primarily by chronic  		physical conditions or primarily by mental health/behavioral conditions.</p>
<p>The law allows states considerable flexibility in choosing providers and  		payment systems. States may designate a wide range of health home providers or  		groups of providers other than primary care practices (e.g., mental health  		centers, home health agencies), so long as these providers have the required  		systems and infrastructure to provide health home services and meet  		qualification standards. Payment methodologies for health homes may include  		tiered payments for individuals according to the number or severity of their  		conditions and for providers based on their capabilities, and states may design  		methodologies other than capitated per member per month (PMPM) payments,  		subject to CMS approval.</p>
<p>States also have flexibility in choosing the eligible population. The  		minimum eligibility criteria are having two chronic conditions, one chronic  		condition and being at risk of a second, or one serious and persistent mental  		health condition. Section 2703 specifies a list of eligible chronic conditions  		(a mental health condition, a substance use disorder, asthma, diabetes, heart  		disease, or being overweight). States may select particular conditions, all of  		the conditions, or, with CMS approval, other conditions, such as HIV/AIDS.  		States also may choose to focus on persons with a larger number of conditions  		or greater severity than the minimum. All SPAs must include a requirement that  		hospitals serving Medicaid beneficiaries have procedures for referring eligible  		emergency department patients to health homes, consistent with the aim of  		reducing avoidable use of hospital services.</p>
<p>Section 2703 allows states to focus on particular geographic areas and  		to provide services to health home participants that are different in scope,  		duration, or quantity to those offered to other Medicaid beneficiaries without  		obtaining a waiver of statewideness or comparability. States are required to  		offer health home enrollment to <i>all</i> persons meeting the state's chronic  		condition eligibility standards who are categorically needy, including those  		who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and those receiving services  		under a Section 1915(c) home and community-based services waiver. States also  		may choose to include the medically needy and participants in Section 1115  		Demonstrations.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Aims and Content of Baseline Report</h3>
<p>The primary aims of the long-term evaluation are to assess: (a) what  		models, providers, and processes states are choosing for health homes; (b) the  		extent to which state health home designs result in increased monitoring and  		coordination across the specified clinical and nonclinical domains of care; and  		(c) whether the models result in better quality of care and outcomes, reduced  		use of hospital, SNF, and emergency departments, and lower costs.</p>
<p>This first annual data analysis report focuses primarily on the design,  		motivations and goals, monitoring measures to be collected, and other basic  		parameters for each CMS-approved SPA in the first four states to be selected  		for evaluation. <a href="#structure">Section II</a> discusses the basic  		evaluation structure, methods used, and activities in this base year.  		<a href="#profile">Section III</a> summarizes health home program(s) in each of  		the four states and the context in which they are being implemented.  		<a href="#implement">Section IV</a> discusses emerging themes and issues for  		implementation. <a href="#overview">Section V</a> summarizes the initial  		evaluation design, challenges for the design presented by the programs states  		are implementing and the context for their implementation, and ways in which  		the design may need to be adapted. <a href="#second">Section VI</a> briefly  		concludes and discusses second year activities.</p>
<p>Future annual reports will present similar baseline findings for  		additional states selected for the evaluation as their SPAs are approved, as  		well as findings from follow-up analyses of interim progress and outcomes for  		each health home program. The final report to be produced in the last year of  		the evaluation will summarize findings on the structure, process, and outcomes  		of health homes, including analyses of the impacts of health homes on  		utilization and costs to inform the Secretary's 2017 Report to Congress.</p>
<h2><a name="structure" id="structure">II. EVALUATION STRUCTURE, TIMELINE, AND  		METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The long-term evaluation began October 1, 2011 and is scheduled to  		continue for five years. We anticipate evaluating a total of 15-20 programs,  		depending on the number of SPAs for health homes that are approved in the first  		three years of the evaluation.<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> Four states and  		six programs selected in the first year are discussed in this report (see  		<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>). Additional states will be selected as their  		SPAs are approved.</p>
<p>For each SPA, the intervention period is defined as the eight quarters  		of enhanced federal match for health home services. The intervention period  		begins with the SPA effective date selected by the submitting state. For  		quantitative analyses of effects of each program on service use and costs, we  		also have defined a baseline period for comparison as the eight quarters  		immediately preceding the effective date.</p>
<p>For each state, initial evaluation activities include developing  		background materials summarizing the design and the implementation context of  		each health home program and conducting site visits. These activities will  		create a qualitative data foundation for tracking and interpreting program  		progress and adjustments during the intervention period. Follow-up telephone  		interviews will be conducted roughly annually after in-person site visits.  		Quantitative analysis of the key outcomes largely will be confined to the final  		two years of the evaluation, primarily because of lags in the availability of  		Medicare and Medicaid claims and/or encounter data, but also to allow time for  		full implementation of the health home programs.</p>
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<p>Our first task was to develop research questions in the domains of  		structure, process, and outcomes that will be addressed by the evaluation and  		will guide our activities (see <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Questions in the  		top panel of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> address state choices of target  		populations and providers, the design of programs, the rationale for the  		design, and fundamental elements of structure and process. These questions will  		guide base year data collection and follow-up for each state. Questions in the  		lower panel of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> relate to outcomes and relative  		performance of different providers and models for different target populations,  		which will be monitored and assessed over the intervention period. </p>
<h3>Qualitative Data and Activities</h3>
<p>Qualitative data activities in the base year were the production of  		detailed memoranda profiling each approved health home program and the context  		in which it is being implemented, and site visits. In preparation for site  		visits we developed generic site visit interview protocols based on the  		research questions (provided in <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>). Both the  		formats developed for these state profiles and the generic protocols will also  		be used to profile the programs and guide site visits, respectively, for the  		remaining states selected for evaluation.</p>
<p><i><b>State Profiles</b></i></p>
<p>Development of health home profiles entails a systematic process of data  		collection for each state with an approved SPA, drawing on existing reports,  		background from state websites and other publicly available sources, and review  		of each approved SPA.</p>
<p>The SPAs provide data on the target population; the types of providers  		who will be health homes and the qualifications they must meet to participate;  		definitions of each of the six health home services; methodology for monitoring  		avoidable hospital readmissions and cost savings from improved chronic care  		coordination and management; how HIT will be used to improve service delivery  		and care coordination across care settings; information to be collected from  		health home providers to monitor hospital admissions, ER visits, and SNF  		admissions; and the frequency of reporting this information.</p>
<p>In their SPAs, states also identify measures for quality monitoring  		corresponding either to each of the required health home services or to  		specific program goals (e.g., improve health outcomes for persons with chronic  		conditions, improve diabetes care). For either service-based or goal-based  		approaches, states are asked to identify measures in the three domains of  		clinical outcomes, experience of care, and quality of care. In addition, CMS  		will specify a "core" set of common measures across all health homes programs.  		Future annual reports will include assessments based on these performance  		measures once they begin to be available.</p>
<p>Based on the information collected, we produced a memorandum for each of  		the first four states covering central structural dimensions of their  		program(s) and the larger policy and health system context within each state to  		identify existing or anticipated programs and initiatives that may have  		implications for implementation and evaluation. (Final memoranda are provided  		in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.) Similar memoranda will be produced for  		all states ultimately included in the evaluation.</p>
<p><i><b>Site Visits</b></i></p>
<p>We arranged conference calls with contacts in each state to introduce  		the long-term evaluation team, explain the purpose and aims of the evaluation,  		answer any questions, and discuss the scope and logistics for site visits,  		including the types of informants to be interviewed. At a minimum, informants  		included the state Medicaid Director (SMD), the health home program director, a  		HIT officer, the official leading the state's evaluation of the initiative,  		selected participating providers, and patient and provider advocacy groups.  		Based on these initial discussions, we tailored the generic protocols to  		reflect the specifics of the state's program and the role of each person to be  		interviewed.</p>
<p>We conducted site visits to Rhode Island from May 14-17, Missouri from  		June 18-22, New York from July 25-27, and Oregon from September 12-14. (Because  		Rhode Island and Missouri each had two approved health home programs, the site  		visits to these states involved more informants and thus required additional  		time.) Following each site visit, we drew on detailed notes to develop  		high-level observations summarizing the major findings. We also identified key  		issues to be tracked over the course of the evaluation.</p>
<h3>Quantitative Data and Activities</h3>
<p>Activities related to quantitative data collection and analysis in the  		first year of the evaluation were limited to developing a provisional plan for  		analyses to be conducted (see <a href="#overview">Section V</a>), refining  		plans based on what we learned about the design of programs in the first four  		states, and identifying and requesting the administrative data required to  		address the primary evaluation questions relating to utilization and costs  		using consistent methodology across states and programs. During the site  		visits, we identified contacts who were involved in state evaluations and data  		systems and would be willing to work further with us on data issues. These  		issues include potential comparison groups, identifiers for enrollees, and  		eligibility algorithms that can be applied to claims data to identify the  		eligible pool from which enrollees are drawn.</p>
<p>After the first group of states was known, we submitted a data use  		agreement (DUA) request to CMS for the data needed for our quantitative  		analyses. The design calls for examining utilization and costs for participants  		and a comparison group in both the eight-quarter baseline period prior to the  		each program's effective date and the eight quarters of the intervention  		period. Because states are determining eligibility and participation on a  		rolling basis and may make adjustments depending on the number of eligibles  		successfully enrolled, our data request includes beneficiary, claims, and  		managed care encounter data for all Medicaid enrollees in each state for the  		full 16 quarters of the baseline and intervention periods, as well as Medicare  		beneficiary and claims information for enrollees who are dual eligibles. Data  		collection for the central quantitative analyses specified in Section 2703  		(effects on hospital, ER, and SNF use, and costs) will continue past the end of  		the intervention period because of lags in availability of claims and other  		administrative data. The DUA will be amended as needed over the course of the  		evaluation to include additional years of data as they become available and to  		add data for additional states as their SPAs are approved.</p>
<h2><a name="profile" id="profile">III. PROFILE OF THE FIRST FOUR STATE HEALTH HOME  		INITIATIVES</a></h2>
<p>The first group of health home programs comprises the six programs in  		four states that had been approved by CMS by April 1, 2012: two programs each  		in Missouri and Rhode Island, and one each in New York and Oregon (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>). Although all four states are targeting people with  		SMI, substance abuse, and chronic physical conditions, their approaches differ.  		New York and Oregon target all three of these populations through one SPA,  		while Missouri and Rhode Island each have one SPA focused on people with  		behavioral health issues, and a second SPA targeting a different population.  		Missouri's second SPA focuses on those with multiple chronic conditions, while  		Rhode Island's second program focuses on younger beneficiaries with special  		needs. All four states are implementing their programs statewide, or, in the  		case of New York, plan to expand statewide over a short time period. Another  		common element is that this first set of programs reflects the use of health  		homes to enhance existing programs and providers, or to move further down a  		path the state already was taking.</p>
<p>This section provides brief summaries of these programs, with key design  		features shown in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>. Detailed information is  		provided in the state memoranda in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<h3>Missouri</h3>
<p>Missouri's health home program builds on the state's relatively long  		history of behavioral and physical health care integration. The selected  		populations--beneficiaries with SMI and chronic physical conditions--have been  		the target of several previous initiatives aimed at integrating physical and  		behavioral health and coordinating care for patients with multiple chronic  		conditions. Community mental health centers (CMHCs) are the designated  		providers for the behavioral health population, while primary care  		centers--specifically, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health  		clinics, and hospital-operated primary care clinics--are the designated  		providers for persons with chronic physical conditions. The qualifying chronic  		physical conditions are the same in the two SPAs. The primary distinction is  		that substance use and mental illness are not qualifying conditions to receive  		health home services through a primary care center; such beneficiaries would be  		assigned to a CMHC health home. The Missouri Department of Social Services  		estimates that about 43,000 Medicaid beneficiaries are eligible statewide, and  		about 34% of these are dual eligibles.</p>
<p>Missouri uses a claims-based algorithm to identify eligible persons and  		auto-assigns them to the relevant type of provider, based on their conditions.  		Enrollees in both health home types may opt out of the program or change  		providers. Hospitals also may refer unassigned patients to a health home.  		Though both fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care enrollees are eligible for  		health home enrollment, Missouri's managed care program (MC+) is offered in  		only certain geographic regions and serves primarily children, youth, and  		pregnant women. In addition, some CMHCs serve only adult populations.  		Consequently, managed care enrollees represent a relatively small percentage of  		health home enrollment (about 10% overall).</p>
<p>The care teams are explicitly defined in both SPAs and similarly  		structured. Both teams include a Director, Nurse Care Manager, and  		administrative support staff. However, the CMHC team includes a primary care  		physician consultant, while the primary care team includes a behavioral health  		consultant and a care coordinator, as well as additional clinical staff (such a  		physician or nurse practitioner). The staffing ratio for each of these roles is  		also defined in the SPA.</p>
<p>The payment rates for health home services are based upon staffing needs  		assumptions. Health home services are reimbursed through a PMPM capitation  		payment. Services at CMHCs will be reimbursed at $78.74, while services  		delivered at primary care centers will be reimbursed at $58.87. The state plans  		to adjust these amounts annually and will re-evaluate the PMPM determination  		method after 18 months.</p>
<p>The HIT infrastructure that underpins the initiative is still being  		developed, and is based primarily on the existing Medicaid HIT infrastructure.  		MO HealthNet maintains a web based electronic health record (EHR) called  		CyberAccess, which is accessible to all enrolled Medicaid providers, including  		CMHCs. This system also includes a web portal called Direct Inform, which  		allows enrollees to look up information on their care utilization, calculate  		their cardiac and diabetic risk levels, and develop a personal health plan. In  		addition, MO HealthNet maintains an authorization-of-stay tool that requires  		hospitals to notify MO HealthNet within 24 hours of a new Medicaid-financed  		admission of any Medicaid enrollee, as well as to provide information about  		diagnosis, condition, and treatment, which triggers a notification email to the  		health home provider. The system does not yet include Medicare-financed  		admissions of dually eligible enrollees or ER visits that do not result in  		admission.</p>
<h3>Rhode Island</h3>
<p>Rhode Island's two health home programs target two populations served by  		existing specialized providers. The first population is persons with SMI served  		by community mental health organizations (CMHOs), which are overseen by the  		Department of Behavioral Health, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, and  		the second is children and youth with SMI and/or other disabling or chronic  		physical or developmental conditions served by Comprehensive Evaluation,  		Diagnosis, Assessment, Referral, Re-evaluation (CEDARR) Family Centers, which  		are overseen by the state Department of Human Services. CEDARR centers provide  		care exclusively to children and youth with special health care needs,  		including needs assessment, referral to resources, integration of services  		provided through different state systems, and limited direct services. An  		estimated 7,000-8,000 enrollees are eligible for health home services  		statewide, about 5,300 of them through CMHOs. Of this latter population, about  		60% are dually eligible.</p>
<p>The CEDARRs and the CMHOs submit lists of their clients who are  		potentially eligible to Department of Health Services, which verifies their  		eligibility and enrolls them in the health home program. To be eligible to  		receive health home services through a CMHO, an enrollee must have SMI and meet  		additional criteria related to their level of impairment. (These criteria are  		the same as those used to determine eligibility for the state's existing  		Community Support Services Program, which targets persons with SMI who can be  		managed outside of institutional settings.) Eligible beneficiaries are  		auto-assigned to receive health home services based on qualifying conditions  		and existing relationship with a CMHO, but may opt out or change provider.  		Hospitals also may refer eligible beneficiaries in cases where they are  		identified. Beneficiaries may be referred to CEDARR Centers through a number of  		channels, including through primary care providers (PCP) and self-referral.  		Children and youth receiving care through a CEDARR are eligible for health home  		services if they have a mental health condition, two chronic conditions, or one  		chronic condition and the risk of developing another. About 95% of current  		CEDARR clients meet these diagnostic criteria. </p>
<p>The state has two Medicaid managed care providers, which between them  		cover 60% of CEDARR participants and 35% of eligible CMHO participants (through  		capitated plans known as RIte Care and Rhody Health Partners, respectively).  		The remaining adult Medicaid population is enrolled in a FFS-based primary care  		case management program called Connect Care Choice. In order to avoid  		duplication of services, the state developed operational protocols outlining  		which care management activities will be conducted by managed care  		organizations (MCOs) and which will be conducted by CEDARRs and CMHOs.</p>
<p>The required health home care team for CEDARR-HH includes two members, a  		licensed clinician and a family service coordinator, who share responsibility  		for the core health home services but will collaborate with other health  		professionals and CEDARR staff, including the enrollee's PCP, as needed. The  		required team for CMHO-HH includes at least seven members with behavioral,  		clinical, or social support expertise.</p>
<p>CMHOs will be paid on a PMPM basis, with the rate reflecting personnel  		costs and staffing ratios based on estimates of client need. The estimated  		staff needs for a team serving 200 clients is 11.25 full-time equivalent, or  		approximately nine staff hours per client per month. CMHOs are required to  		submit highly detailed encounter data to document services provided. CEDARR  		centers will continue to be paid on a FFS basis. Three existing CEDARR  		activities--family intake and needs assessment, family care plan development  		following initial needs assessment, and annual family care plan review--re paid  		at fixed rates ranging from $347 to $397. Two additional services--health needs  		coordination and therapeutic consultation--are reimbursed at established hourly  		rates paid per quarter hour of effort and tiered according to the type of  		professional providing them.</p>
<p>The HIT infrastructure underpinning these two initiatives is built on  		the existing systems used by CEDARR Family Centers and the two state Medicaid  		MCOs. Neither group of providers is required to have an EHR, but CMHOs that  		have an EHR or registry may be required to participate in a pilot study to  		measure their effect on both care and patient outcomes. CEDARR centers will use  		their existing electronic case management system as well as the Rhode Island  		KIDSNET Child Health Information System, which provides access to a range of  		public health and social services information. CEDARR-HHs also will offer to  		enroll all clients into CurrentCare, Rhode Island's electronic health  		information exchange (HIE).</p>
<h3>New York</h3>
<p>New York currently has one health home program with a target population  		of those who have HIV/AIDS and are at risk of developing another chronic  		condition, and those with two or more chronic conditions (including substance  		abuse) and/or SMI in ten counties. The state envisions this program as the  		first phase in a health home initiative that will be rolled out in three  		geographically-based phases and will reach statewide coverage over a relatively  		short time frame, subject to CMS approval. SPAs have been submitted for Phase  		II, which will cover an additional 12 counties, and Phase III, which will  		expand health homes to the remaining 39 counties. The expected retroactive  		effective dates for the latter phases are April 1, 2012, and July 1, 2012,  		respectively. Ultimately, the state estimates that approximately 700,000  		Medicaid beneficiaries will be enrolled statewide in Phases I-III of health  		home implementation, about 20% of them dual eligibles. The state plans to  		implement a second and third wave of health home expansion in the next year,  		with the second wave expanding eligibility to the long-term care population,  		and the third targeting enrollees with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>New York does not designate specific providers as health homes.  		Providers are identified through an application process in which a lead health  		home organization demonstrates how it will meet health home requirements  		through its network of partners and affiliated providers. Approved health home  		providers include hospital networks with affiliated physical health, behavioral  		health, and community support providers, existing condition-specific Targeted  		Case Management (TCM) programs, and community-based organizations.</p>
<p>The Department of Health identifies and assigns beneficiaries to a  		health home using a series of algorithms that identify an individual's level of  		risk and connectivity to the health system. Eligible beneficiaries with a  		higher level of clinical risk and a lower level of connectivity have higher  		assignment priority. For FFS enrollees, the state provides candidate "tracking  		lists" directly to health homes. For managed care enrollees, the state  		transmits the list to the relevant managed care plan, which is then responsible  		for assigning candidates to the lead health home organization that can best  		serve their needs. A little over 65% of eligible health home beneficiaries are  		enrolled in managed care; the rest are in Medicaid FFS.</p>
<p>Payment for health home services is made on a PMPM basis at two levels:  		Outreach and Engagement, and Active Care Management. The active care management  		group consists of participants who have agreed to enroll in a health home.  		Beneficiaries in the outreach and engagement group are those who have been  		assigned to the provider but have not yet consented to enrollment. Services for  		this group are reimbursed at 80% of the active care management rate. Payment  		for FFS enrollees goes directly to the health home, while payment for managed  		care enrollees goes through the plans, which may retain up to 3% of the payment  		for administrative services. Rates are currently adjusted by region and  		case-mix.</p>
<p>Standards for HIT use by health homes will be phased in. Providers must  		meet a set of initial standards in order to qualify and have 18 months to meet  		final standards. Final standards require that health homes have interoperable  		HIT systems and policies that allow for the development and maintenance of the  		care plan, that they use a certified EHR that complies with the official  		Statewide Policy Guidance on HIT, that they participate in Regional Health  		Information Organizations (RHIOs) for the purposes of sharing data, and that  		they employ clinical decision-making tools where feasible.</p>
<h3>Oregon</h3>
<p>Oregon's program builds on the state's Patient-Centered Primary Care  		Home (PCPCH) program, established in 2009. PCPCHs are intended to be a key  		component of primary care reform in the state and will also serve other  		populations, including all Medicaid enrollees, government employees, and state  		education personnel. To be eligible for health home services, enrollees must  		have SMI, two or more chronic conditions, or one chronic condition and be at  		risk of developing another. The state specified 11 chronic illnesses and nine  		mental health conditions in the list of qualifying conditions, and based its  		definition of "at-risk" on guidelines from the United States Preventive  		Services Task Force, the Health Resources and Services Administration Women's  		Preventive Services, and Bright Futures. Under these criteria, about 118,000  		people are eligible for health home services.</p>
<p>Health home services are to be delivered through qualified PCPCHs. To be  		recognized as a PCPCH, a provider must demonstrate the ability to meet certain  		measures and standards. The state assigns providers to one of three levels base  		on the number and type of standards met: Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3, with Tier 3  		reflecting the most advanced level of functioning as a PCPCH. Any recognized  		PCPCH can apply to provide health home services by submitting an addendum to  		its PCPCH agreement with the state. A recognized PCPCH will receive a health  		home payment (described below) for each qualified patient for whom specific  		service and documentation requirements are met. These requirements include: (1)  		providing at least one state-defined core service each quarter; (2) performing  		panel management at least once per quarter, using data for all clients or for  		sub-groups of clients for such functions as care management or quality  		assurance; (3) performing patient engagement and education and obtaining  		patient agreement; and (4) developing a person-centered health plan. A PCPCH is  		not required to provide all health home services on site, but no provider can  		qualify as a PCPCH if they do not offer primary care services on site. Thus,  		CMHCs are only eligible to be health homes if they also offer primary care. All  		of these services are available to all patients enrolled with a PCPCH who may  		need them, but services for patients identified as health home eligible are  		reimbursed at a higher rate.</p>
<p>Eligible beneficiaries are identified by the providers, who draw up  		lists of their patients they believe to be qualified and submit them to the  		state for approval, either through the patient's MCO or directly, if the  		patient is not enrolled with an MCO. (About 80% of the state's Medicaid  		population is enrolled in managed care.) Once approved and assigned, the  		enrollee is informed of their assignment and may then opt out or select a  		different provider. The provider must update and resubmit this list of patients  		each quarter. This process serves as attestation of meeting the quarterly  		health home service requirements and triggers payment. The state guidelines for  		achieving PCPCH recognition specify the information that a practice should be  		able to demonstrate in support of its attestation, which is also subject to  		audit.</p>
<p>Payment for health home services provided to qualified enrollees is made  		on a PMPM basis that varies by the provider's qualification level: Tier 1 - $10  		PMPM; Tier 2 - $15 PMPM; and Tier 3 - $24 PMPM. The state is awaiting CMS  		approval of a similar payment structure for beneficiaries who are not health  		home eligible, under which these services would be reimbursed at a lower rate.  		For FFS patients, payments go directly to providers; for MCO-enrolled members,  		payments pass through the MCO. Any portion of the payment that is retained by  		the MCO must be used to carry out health home-related functions and is subject  		to approval by the state.</p>
<p>Health home providers will be encouraged to develop or use their current  		HIT capacity to perform a range of functions, including EHR use and data  		gathering and reporting. Oregon also links certain of its PCPCH measures to HIT  		capacity. For example, although implementation of an EHR is not required,  		providers who have an EHR are able to earn additional points towards their  		qualification as a Tier 3 PCPCH. The state also maintains a provider portal and  		patient panel management system, run by a contractor. Use of this system is  		required as part of the provider's service provision, but it also allows the  		provider to review data on their patient panel and identify any gaps in  		care.</p>
<h2><a name="implement" id="implement">IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND EMERGING ISSUES</a></h2>
<p>In this section we report what we learned in site visits about key  		features across the state programs and early implementation. Some features  		reflect the health care landscape prior to implementation and may not be  		generalizable. Others reflect state choices that may provide lessons for other  		states and for CMS as it considers health home policies. It is important to  		remember that what we present reflects an early stage of implementation.  		Findings are organized according to areas that we will track over the  		intervention period.</p>
<h3>Health Home Models</h3>
<p>The six programs vary in the degree of flexibility afforded to  		participating health homes and in what is expected from them. The flexibility  		is evident in four areas: provider designation and qualifications (i.e., which  		providers can be a health home and what capabilities they must have or  		develop); structure (i.e., how health home services are provided, including  		staffing); service requirements (i.e., specification of services to be  		provided); and accountability or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Rhode Island is prescriptive as to structure of the intervention in all  		four areas, although less so for CMHOs than for CEDARRs. Payment is effectively  		FFS for designated health home services provided to an identified subset of  		Medicaid beneficiaries. CEDARR health home services are services that CEDARRs  		have been providing since their inception with only minor additions. CEDARRs  		are paid on FFS basis, with fixed payments for initial needs assessment, care  		plan development, and annual reassessments, and billing by quarter hour for two  		other professional services at established rates. In contrast, CMHOs are  		required to submit detailed encounter data supporting service provision to  		receive PMPM payments, and must provide at least one hour of service, recorded  		in five minute increments, to each enrollee every month. </p>
<p>Missouri is prescriptive as to the providers that can be health homes  		and their staffing, although less so than Rhode Island. For both CMHC and PCP  		PMPM payments are triggered by submission of a list of enrollees and attesting  		that they have received services. Attestation is made via quarterly reports on  		each of the required core services.</p>
<p>New York is prescriptive as to provider designation--providers must  		apply and satisfy state requirements to be recognized as a health home--but  		accountability is for outcomes (e.g., inpatient and mental health services  		utilization) rather than for structure or process (i.e., staff involved or  		services provided). Individual practices can participate in more than one  		health home. Payment is PMPM for each enrollee for whom at least one core  		service was provided and documented in the month. Patient records are subject  		to audit.</p>
<p>Oregon is prescriptive as to the standards a health home must meet, but  		any provider that meets the standards can be designated as a health home.  		Accountability is by attestation to meeting the standards and providing  		designated core services, with monitoring through random audits. The standards  		are to be gradually strengthened to include outcome measures.</p>
<p>A prescriptive model with respect to provider qualifications may entail  		greater up-front investments to meet the required staffing, so that  		under-enrollment or enrollment discontinuities are more of a problem for  		providers. For example, providers were facing this problem in Missouri, where  		PCP-health home enrollment was lower than expected at the time of the site  		visit. Payment levels had been calculated based on a set staffing ratio, and  		some providers had added staff in anticipation of the projected increase in  		enrollment. The delays in enrolling new patients meant that they were unable to  		generate the expected amount of health home payments to cover these costs.</p>
<p><i><b>Enrollment</b></i></p>
<p>Identification of potential eligibles can be centralized, as in Missouri  		and New York, or dispersed, as in Rhode Island and Oregon. In centralized  		identification, the state uses enrollment and claims data to identify persons  		potentially eligible for health home services by conditions and sometimes level  		of expenditure. In dispersed enrollment, health home providers identify clients  		who meet the conditions criteria and who they believe could benefit from health  		home services. Centralized identification of the eligible population has the  		benefit of yielding a potentially more complete list of eligibles. But Medicaid  		enrollees, especially those with mental health and/or substance abuse issues,  		are a hard population to track. Individual health homes have found it difficult  		to locate and enroll people identified centrally, as contact information or  		qualifying conditions may have changed, and enrollees may be wary of such  		contact. Dispersed identification decreases search costs and time but risks  		missing eligibles who are not well-known to the health home staff and those  		with low provider connectivity. Provider-based identification also has the  		potential to allow cherry-picking of enrollees, although we heard no concerns  		in that area on our site visits. Most programs appear to be planning eventually  		for a mixed system.</p>
<p>In Missouri, the state directly auto-enrolls and assigns enrollees to a  		health home, informing the beneficiary by mail. Assignment is typically to the  		practice the beneficiary has been using most, since lists are generated from  		claims data. The state also informs the health home of the assignment. The plan  		for the long run plan is that providers will identify beneficiaries who become  		eligible for health home services. In New York, patients are identified by the  		state based on a series of algorithms designed to target people with high needs  		who are not already being seen regularly by providers in the community, those  		with "low ambulatory connectivity." Lists of eligibles are sent to the health  		homes or the MCOs for outreach and enrollment. Health homes can also refer  		people to the state (or through the MCO, if appropriate) for enrollment, as can  		"local government units," although this had not yet happened at the time of the  		site visit. In Rhode Island and Oregon, health home providers send lists of  		clients they believe to be eligible to the state for approval.</p>
<p>Some providers report that lists identified centrally do not always  		match the clients they believe are most in need of health home services.  		Dispersed provider-based enrollment also may miss good candidates for health  		home services. CEDARRs report that there are more eligible children than they  		can handle. They do not conduct outreach but are over-capacity, suggesting that  		there may be eligible children who are not being served.</p>
<p>The general expectation appears to be that enrollees will remain in the  		program for the duration of the initiative unless they lose Medicaid  		eligibility. CMHOs/CMHCs were most likely to express concerns about program  		discontinuities stemming from loss of eligibility, which present challenges for  		continuity of care and connections to needed services in the community. On the  		other hand, in Rhode Island, the expectation was that some CEDARR enrollees  		could leave the program if their circumstances stabilized. The Missouri program  		allows for disenrollment, and the New York program has a procedure for  		returning enrollees to management by their PCP if reassessment indicates that  		intensive services are no longer needed. In contrast, the Oregon program did  		not expect anyone to leave the program for reasons other than loss of Medicaid  		eligibility.</p>
<p><i><b>Integration of Care</b></i></p>
<p>Integration of mental health, physical health, and nonclinical supports  		is a key component of the health home concept. States have approached  		integration in a variety of ways. All of these relationships are likely to  		evolve, and their final form will depend in large part on where each provider  		started. Our site visits suggest that integration issues differ depending on  		the provider, and particularly on the direction of the integration, in the case  		of physical and mental health. Issues for integrating mental health care into a  		primary care-based health home are not symmetric to those for integrating  		physical health care into a mental health provider-based health home. Both  		CMHCs and PCPs in all states report that paying attention to both physical and  		mental health issues requires a culture change in the approach to patient care.  		</p>
<p>Mental health advocates reported that mental health historically has  		been underfunded and applauded the health home initiative for bringing greater  		attention and funding to mental health care. They also felt that PCPs have a  		new incentive to look for mental health issues among their patients because  		mental health diagnosis can qualify an enrollee for health home services. The  		health homes focus on whole-person care also has enhanced attention to  		nonclinical aspects of care. CMHCs traditionally have paid more attention to  		nonclinical supports, such as housing, school, and employment, than have  		primary care practices. Many participating primary care health home practices  		seem to struggle somewhat with the mechanism for integrating community  		supports, though they recognize the importance and welcome the availability of  		funding.</p>
<p>In Rhode Island, each health home program focuses on a specialized type  		of provider for a defined population. CEDARR family center clientele are  		children with special health care needs, which may include mental or behavioral  		health problems. The traditional function of CEDARR centers is needs  		assessment, referral to other resources, and the integration of services  		provided through different systems (education, social services, Medicaid, child  		welfare), so that such linkages are already in place. CEDARR health home staff  		members are expected to collaborate regularly with the enrollee's PCP and must  		document annual "outreach" to the primary care physician or MCO. Providers  		report that the addition of a requirement under health homes for Body Mass  		Index (BMI) and depression screening has given them an opening to address these  		issues with both clients and their caregivers. There is greater variation among  		the participating CMHOs, and the change brought through the health home  		initiative has been greater. CMHOs have used either co-location (at two sites)  		or establishing or strengthening referral networks and follow-up to foster care  		integration. They must submit a list of primary care practices and hospitals  		with which they expect to establish referral relationships and must have a  		memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a PCP.</p>
<p>Missouri, with its separate and complementary PCP and CMHC health homes,  		comes closest to symmetry, with behavioral health consultants located in  		PCP-health homes and primary care consultants located in CMHC-health homes.  		However, the two types of consultants have different functions, with behavioral  		health consultants providing brief treatment, and physician consultants most  		often providing referrals and team consultation. State-level implementation is  		highly coordinated; at the provider level, this coordination is still being  		developed. Some co-located providers are participating in both health home  		initiatives, which may yield insights into the differences between the two  		models. Having both types of providers as health homes allows the state to  		assign enrollees to the health home that most fits the enrollee's primary  		diagnosis.</p>
<p>In New York, each health home chose how to approach integration,  		including arrangements with nonclinical community support services. Each health  		home can choose to partner or otherwise affiliate with the behavioral health  		providers that best fit its chosen path to integration. For example, in one  		county, the mental health clinic is developing satellite clinics located at  		primary care sites, and mental health workers are being trained to look for  		physical health problems. In another county, mental health providers are full  		partners in the health home.</p>
<p>In Oregon, the integration of mental health services is a requirement  		for qualifying as a health home. Although mental health providers may qualify  		as health homes, they are required to have on-site primary care to do so.  		Primary care health home service providers are not required to provide on-site  		behavioral health care, but must develop agreements with external providers of  		mental health services.</p>
<p><i><b>Applicability to Children</b></i></p>
<p>All of the states are struggling with incorporating children into the  		health home model, which is viewed as more applicable to adults and their  		providers because of its focus on beneficiaries with chronic conditions. The  		CEDARR model in Rhode Island is <i>de facto</i> child-focused although some  		CEDARR enrollees are no longer children. Missouri is discussing whether  		children can be well served by a health home model that also serves adults  		because children have different care needs. The state found that parents and  		guardians of children opted out of health home enrollment at a higher rate, for  		example, because they did not want another care manager for their child's  		asthma. New York is considering developing a child-focused health home SPA to  		complement its current program. Informants in New York and elsewhere also cited  		the lower prevalence of the target conditions among children as an issue. Many  		general pediatric practices may be unwilling to participate because health home  		enrollees would represent a very small share of patients over which to spread  		the fixed cost of practice transformation. Potential problems associated with  		including children seem to be less of a concern in Oregon where health homes  		are part of a larger system transformation.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Communication within and across providers is a fundamental component in  		achieving the health homes model's aims of care integration, management, and  		coordination. The health home initiative is in its early stages at all sites,  		and communication patterns are still being developed both within and across  		sites of care, and particularly with hospitals and MCOs. The extent to which  		new patterns of communication and new protocols are needed depends in part on  		how much of a change from the existing care system the health home program  		represents. For example, in Rhode Island, the change in basic functions and  		responsibilities is relatively small for CEDARRs; for CMHOs the changes are  		greater. Some CMHO health home providers reported that their previously  		informal relationships (e.g., between a CMHO and a nearby FQHC) have been  		strengthened and formalized through MOUs so that health home clients can be  		flagged in the FQHC's data system. This area is very much a work in progress in  		all programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Intra-organization Communication</b></i></p>
<p>Communication within care teams and across teams within health homes  		supports care coordination and integration of mental and physical health and  		community supports. Common forms of intra-team communication are the patient  		"huddle," a mini-team meeting of relevant team members before a patient's  		appointment to discuss his or her health problems and treatment needs, or,  		alternatively, regular team meetings. Informants at some sites reported that  		such intra-organization processes are productive, while at other sites  		informants said they have been difficult to integrate into the work flow. Other  		reported challenges to team communication include EHRs or other patient records  		that must be modified to support such the full range of team input,  		particularly nonclinical information.</p>
<p><i><b>Primary Care and MCOs</b></i></p>
<p>Where the health home is not the PCP, issues can arise when  		communication beyond the team or health home is necessary. Education may be  		needed to help the PCP understand the importance of communicating with the  		health home and coordinating well with them. Many nonhealth home physicians are  		not clear on what health homes are and what their role in them should be. Thus,  		training about health homes may need to extend beyond the health home itself,  		and communication processes may need further development. For some health  		homes--some of Rhode Island's CEDARRs, for example--an internal EHR allows  		communication within the health home, but external communications still require  		email or fax. The communication issues are different not only in different  		states and initiatives but also for different health homes within the states,  		reflecting different existing patterns of care and communication and different  		capacity for change.</p>
<p>Responsibilities for communication between health homes and MCOs vary.  		In New York, MCOs are required to assist with identification of eligibles. In  		Rhode Island, they are to provide care profiles to the health home for their  		health home enrollees; and in Oregon, they are contractually obligated to  		encourage practice transformation. In New York and Oregon, health homes are  		required to report service provision through the MCOs, who then transmit the  		data to the state. These responsibilities are also still being systematized and  		fine-tuned, a process that will likely be easier than with hospitals since,  		unlike hospitals, MCOs share the health home goal of better care coordination  		and decreased hospital and emergency department use.</p>
<p><i><b>Hospitals</b></i></p>
<p>Transitional care to better manage patients after hospitalization is a  		critical health home service to support reductions in avoidable readmissions,  		but getting timely information from hospitals is seen as a challenge in all  		programs. The size of the challenge varies across the states. New York  		providers saw hospital cooperation as a smaller problem, perhaps because  		hospitals were often members of the health home, and the catchment areas for  		the first phase were chosen in part due to the presence of "forward-thinking"  		hospitals. In Oregon, each PCPCH must have written agreements with its usual  		hospital providers on how communication will happen. In some cases hospital  		communication is indirect. For example, Missouri has an authorization-of-stay  		tool that requires hospitals to alert the program when any Medicaid enrollee is  		admitted for a Medicaid-financed stay, which triggers an email from the  		Medicaid agency to the health home. Such alerts are not triggered by emergency  		department use, however, unless it is associated with an admission. Informants  		reported that this system misses even some inpatient hospital use--most  		glaringly, admissions of dual eligibles, for which Medicare is the first payer.  		Some Missouri health homes report that they may learn about an admission weeks  		or months later and sometimes only when reported by the health home enrollee.  		MCOs are sometimes able to serve as intermediaries between hospitals and health  		homes, as is seen in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Some informants reported hospital communication problems specific to the  		mental health component of the initiative. Mental health providers may have  		more problems getting access to hospital floors because they often are not  		credentialed at the hospital, making it difficult to provide coordination for  		their enrollees who are admitted. In Rhode Island, the CMHOs have had hospital  		liaisons in the past, and this concept has been reintroduced under health  		homes. Medication reconciliation post-discharge is seen as a particular  		challenge for health homes. Although usually thought of as a hospital quality  		measure, health homes recognize the importance of medication reconciliation for  		care management and good outcomes. Establishing good post-discharge  		communication with hospitals is key to meeting this important quality goal.  		</p>
<p>All programs see hospital communication as an area that needs work.  		Until real-time/same-day communication is established and is the norm for both  		inpatient stays and emergency department visits, communication will continue to  		rely on personal relationships with personnel in the medical and psychiatric  		wards and the emergency department, with disruptions associated with personnel  		turnover.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential for New Silos</b></i></p>
<p>Barriers to improved communication among all parties include lack of  		widespread and interoperable information technology systems, different rules  		covering different types of information sharing (particularly substance abuse,  		mental health, and HIV/AIDS, which are all prevalent in the target population),  		and competing priorities of the concerned entities. The nature of the health  		home itself can create a barrier. Health homes are designed to reduce silos  		across the health care system, in part by improved communication. But as they  		have developed, at least in these early days, they may have created silos  		across types of patients. Because health homes apply only to a subset of  		patients and therefore often require development of targeted rather than  		broadly applied communication strategies.</p>
<h3>Provider Issues and Challenges</h3>
<p>Depending on the program, providers are either taking on new roles or  		becoming a part of a more integrated system. Common themes we heard related to  		who would incur costs and who would benefit from the return on investments,  		inadequacy of data systems to meet provider needs, and the pace and effects of  		practice transformation.</p>
<p><i><b>The Role of MCOs</b></i></p>
<p>The management of care for high-need, high-cost enrollees could  		logically be thought of as the responsibility of MCOs. The development of a new  		entity for care management, paid according to a separate structure, can be seen  		as usurping the role of the MCO. The health home guidelines require that there  		not be duplication of payment for services, which requires careful  		specification of the different roles that health homes and MCOs take in care  		coordination. The states are approaching this revision of the role of MCOs in  		different ways. In New York, MCOs can keep no more than 3% of the health home  		PMPM unless they provide specific health home services. In Oregon, the MCO  		cannot keep any of the health home payment unless it shows the state what  		services it is providing to justify the amount withheld. Rhode Island MCOs do  		not receive any of the health home payment. (In Missouri, managed care is  		limited to children, youth, and pregnant women in defined geographic areas; few  		health home enrollees are included.)</p>
<p>The different responses from the MCOs reflect to some degree the history  		and structure of the MCO sector in the state, and even within states, different  		MCOs have reacted differently. Some have welcomed the clarification of roles of  		providers and plan, as in the case of the protocols for care coordination  		developed in Rhode Island. Some are taking advantage of the opportunity to  		participate in health homes even if, as in Oregon, it means a dilution of their  		role because health homes are part of a larger system transformation.</p>
<p><i><b>Distribution of Savings and Effects on Revenues</b></i></p>
<p>In each state, at least one and often more than one informant expressed  		concern that although savings will be generated by actions taken by providers  		those savings will accrue to the Medicaid program. Similarly, they fear that  		hospitals will find some way to recoup any savings realized from reduced  		emergency department use or hospitalizations. Some health homes see the  		practice making the investment in transformation, not all of which is  		reimbursed by the health home payments, and the return on that investment going  		elsewhere.</p>
<p>Section 2703 allows states to pay providers for services that previously  		were not reimbursable under Medicaid, but the effects of participation on  		provider revenues differs widely across the programs, from mildly negative to  		strongly positive. In New York, most providers will see increased revenues  		under health homes.<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> However, rates for  		practices that had been providing TCM services will be reduced over the life of  		the initiative. The effect will be mitigated to some extent as their case-mix  		is also likely to change, and they will have greater flexibility in how the  		services are provided. In Rhode Island, neither the CEDARRs nor the CMHOs will  		see a change in their revenue associated with health home enrollees. In Oregon,  		providers expected additional work commensurate with the higher rates for  		health home enrollees. In Missouri, providers saw the health home reimbursement  		as very attractive.</p>
<p><i><b>Data Issues</b></i></p>
<p>Complete, timely, and accurate data is important both for health homes  		services--case management, care coordination, and care transitions--and for  		program evaluation. Yet, data from other payers, particularly Medicare for the  		dually eligible, typically is not available to health home providers, leaving a  		gap in their knowledge of enrollee utilization and needs.</p>
<p>Data on specific services of particular importance to the health home  		population also need special attention. The rules governing sharing of patient  		information on substance abuse, mental health, and HIV status require  		additional patient agreements. Getting the necessary consent forms in place has  		proved challenging. Some states are working to "centralize" permissions (e.g.,  		signing up with Rhode Island's voluntary patient portal, CurrentCare, gives  		implicit consent for data to be shared with providers). In Oregon, the  		Department of Health has developed a consent form that health home enrollees  		sign to give consent for data to be shared with all Medicaid providers;  		additional service providers, such as for housing or social services, can be  		added to the list of providers. This issue is still being worked out in all  		programs at both the provider and the state level.</p>
<p><i><b>Practice Transformation</b></i></p>
<p>For most providers, practice transformation requires investment of time,  		staff, and money. Infrastructure costs include investment in developing the HIT  		necessary to support many of the health home services and in training staff in  		new processes and routines, which also may result in temporary productivity  		losses. For the most part, providers must make these investments well in  		advance of receiving any additional payment from the initiative. Lack of  		start-up financing may have been a bar to recruiting practices to be health  		homes.</p>
<p>The acuity of this problem varies across the states. For CEDARRs, whose  		care model was very close to the health home, the problem is minimal. In  		Oregon, where requirements are being phased in and gradually made more  		rigorous, practices may be able to spread out the practice transformation  		costs. Early adopters are predominantly qualified at the highest current level,  		suggesting that health home participation is most attractive to practices that  		are already well down the practice transformation road.</p>
<p>Training is provided through a variety of mechanisms. Some programs have  		a specific focus, such as training for wellness coaches or peer counselors,  		while others seek to impart the health home concept. Mental health or primary  		care associations have provided some training for their members through planned  		peer learning activities or responses to questions from practices. The Rhode  		Island Medicaid agency provides training directly for CMHOs through weekly  		meetings, although providers do not seem to consider this as formal training.  		Rhode Island provided separate training for the CEDARRs at the beginning of the  		initiative and is developing a training curriculum for new CEDARR staff. Each  		CEDARR also has its own internal training program. In other states, learning  		collaboratives are frequently mentioned but their reported effectiveness  		varied. Missouri's training effort is designed to extend over the life of the  		initiative with funding from local foundations. New York's learning  		collaboratives were scheduled for fall 2012. Oregon is developing the PCPCH  		Institute Learning Collaborative as a central resource for PCPCHs. Additional  		training is expected to take place in conjunction with the audits that will  		occur during the state's monitoring site visits. Oregon health homes are  		expected to help participating practices meet health home standards, and some  		are designing their own training programs or even providing funding to  		participating practices for implementation of health home principles.</p>
<p>Although training is provided for the health homes free of charge,  		practices still must invest staff time and sometime travel costs. Thus,  		practices must weigh the value of the training against the cost of  		participation and practice transformation. Providers expressed a preference for  		training focused less on vision and more on best practices.</p>
<p>Almost all health homes are struggling to fully implement the  		initiative, and many noted the need for a ramp-up period of six or even 12  		months. Some informants indicated that greater certainty about the permanence  		of the model would allow practices to commit to the health home model more  		fully. Most states expect that some practices will not be able to transform  		fully over the two year span of enhanced match. How nearly practices succeed at  		transformation depends in part on where they started from, their existing  		strengths and weaknesses, and leadership at the practice level. Oregon's  		experience with earlier, similar initiatives showed that two years is a very  		short period in which to put in place all of the needed health home components  		and achieve the necessary culture change.</p>
<h3>HIT Infrastructure and Issues</h3>
<p>Use of information technology affects three important health home  		components--care coordination, use of community services and supports, and  		integration of behavioral and primary health care. Information technology  		requirements that health homes must meet vary, and EHRs are not yet the norm  		nor are HIEs reliably in place to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>Some issues are specific to moving care outside the clinic walls. Saving  		data to a laptop while providing or supervising community services poses  		security issues. Often the services provided in the community are not easily  		documented on current EHRs and may be less adaptable to coding in an EHR. More  		generally, EHRs may need to be modified to incorporate health home services,  		especially the nonclinical community support services.</p>
<p>Other information technology issues are specific to the effort to  		integrate mental and physical health care. Behavioral health providers may have  		higher costs for acquiring information technology infrastructure since they are  		not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare EHR incentive payments. Even if they  		were, the structure of a behavioral health visit differs from that of a  		physical health visit and so the content of an EHR, where available, will be  		different, hampering sharing. Many behavioral health providers feel that  		available EHRs are less well-suited to their practices than to primary care  		practices. Lack of integration in the past has meant that often parallel  		systems have developed. For example, in Missouri, behavioral health providers  		have access to one data system for pharmacy management and another for routine  		reporting and outcomes while PCPs have access to a different system through the  		local primary care association. The state plans to adapt the behavioral health  		outcomes reporting system for primary care health home use.</p>
<p>Practices must also have the necessary infrastructure to communicate  		within and across sites of care, and staff must be trained in how to use it  		effectively. A central information technology infrastructure is needed to  		facilitate communication across sites of care. Central infrastructure can also  		push data to practices to improve individual care management as well as patient  		panel management. Communication through a central site may come with costs  		(e.g., connectivity costs associated with a RHIO) which may be hard for some  		providers to afford or to justify.</p>
<p>Rhode Island expects to phase in HIT use over the life of the  		initiative. The state is developing a data warehouse, but it will have only  		claims, not clinical data such as test results or BMI. Providers can enroll  		their patients in CurrentCare, the state's HIE, which is key to promoting  		patient engagement and patient-centered care. CMHOs must submit a description  		of each participating provider's information technology and EHR capability and  		its capacity to use patient registries. CEDARRs will use an existing electronic  		case management system that supports linkages across medical, human services,  		and school providers, and Rhode Island's KIDSNET. The hope is that as patients  		get accustomed to using KIDSNET they will want to start using CurrentCare as  		well.</p>
<p>Missouri is building on existing infrastructure including a web-based  		EHR, CyberAccess, that is accessible to all Medicaid providers, and a patient  		portal, Direct Inform, to promote patient self-management. CyberAccess was seen  		as a tool for getting people used to sharing information. The existing systems  		are being revised to include health home metrics. Through the Missouri Primary  		Care Association, primary care practices also have access to the Quality  		Improvement Network for reporting quality measures for health homes.</p>
<p>Oregon has contracted with an external vendor to provide a data  		warehouse that not only allows providers to extract patient information but  		also pushes data reports to practices for patient panel management. Data lags,  		however, may limit the usefulness of this portal for care coordination and  		management at the provider level. Information technology and electronic  		communication capability requirements at the practice level are phased in  		across the three Tiers.</p>
<p>New York also recognized that information technology might be a problem  		for some practices and designed information technology requirements that  		allowed health homes to gradually build up to full connectivity. Health homes  		are not required to meet the core information technology requirement until 18  		months into the health home period. Before that time, they must establish  		structures and processes that lay the groundwork for meeting the final  		standard.</p>
<h3>Role of Complementary Programs (Building on What  		Works)</h3>
<p>This first group of health home programs shows the importance of  		evolution over revolution, building on what exists to further the state's  		vision for its Medicaid program or to meet other state goals. Though the state  		programs vary substantially in the particulars, all four states are building on  		structures and programs that already exist and attempting to align the health  		home initiative with other reform initiatives already underway. The extent to  		which each state is able to identify additional resources and coordinate across  		programs is variable and depends on a range of factors, including the extant  		administrative structures and funding streams, the political and financial  		context, and state health system infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of these complementary initiatives predate passage of the ACA. For  		example, Rhode Island's Section 1115 Global Waiver--in place since 2009--has  		facilitated the state's attempts to streamline administrative processes and  		align funding streams between the Medicaid office and the mental health  		department. Oregon built its health home program directly within its existing  		PCPCH initiative in an effort to align the two programs as much as possible,  		while Missouri used Health Home funding to advance a reform process that began  		in 2005. Both Missouri and New York are also proposing to align health homes  		with their duals demonstration program.</p>
<p>States have taken steps to align Health Homes with broader HIT  		transformation. Both New York and Rhode Island have made additional funding and  		technical assistance available to health home providers. In Rhode Island, this  		funding comes primarily through Beacon Community grants, while New York  		provides grants through the state's Health Care Efficiency and Affordability  		Law for New Yorkers (HEAL NY) Capital Grant Program.</p>
<p>States have also been able to use various resources and technical  		assistance made available in the last several years to support practice  		transformation, care coordination, and mental health integration more  		generally. The sources of this funding and technical assistance vary. Some has  		been made available directly through the state, as in the case of New York's  		statewide medical home program, or Rhode Island's Chronic Care Sustainability  		Initiative. Other initiatives have been the fruit of partnerships between the  		state and private organizations. Missouri partnered closely with its provider  		associations and the Missouri Foundation for Health to implement a series of  		reforms to its mental health system, including a pilot care integration program  		involving collaborations between FQHCs and CMHCs. Some health home  		providers--such as the Providence Center in Rhode Island and the Bronx Lebanon  		Hospital Center in New York--have also been the recipients of SAMHSA  		co-location grants and thus have prior experience on which to build their  		internal care structures and processes.</p>
<h3>Halo Effects of Health Home Implementation</h3>
<p>When a practice transforms, the new models for providing care can be  		expected to spread to all patients in the practice. Because the health home  		enrollees are a specific group with high needs, some of the new practices may  		be less applicable to a broader clinic population. Still, many providers say  		that when they are caring for patients they do not consider what reimbursement  		might be attached to that person, so changes in how they operate will likely  		spread to other patients with needs that are similar to health home enrollees.  		Such spread may be more complete in practices where the health home enrollees  		are a larger share of the total client population, such as CMHOs, CEDARRs, and  		FQHCs.</p>
<p>An example of the potential for the spread of the health home concept  		can be seen in the nonhealth homes across the country that have incorporated  		health home concepts into their practices. In several cases, these have served  		as models for the health home practices. For example, Oregon practices have  		looked to South Central Alaska clinics, and Missouri practices have looked to  		the Cherokee Health System in Tennessee. Cherokee offers formal training on  		care integration for practices that are interested in its model.</p>
<p>Some components of the initiatives are not dependent on a complete  		change of culture at the practice or the system level to have a broader effect.  		Specifically, improved information technology infrastructure will benefit the  		whole practice as will greater electronic connectivity among sites of care.  		</p>
<h3>The Enhanced Match</h3>
<p>The enhanced match for health home services is meant to encourage states  		to take up the optional health home benefit. All of the states said that the  		availability of the enhanced match was an important part of their motivation  		for implementing health homes. In Rhode Island, the match allowed Medicaid to  		continue to fund the CEDARR centers and to extend an integrated model into  		CMHOs, something they would have been unable to do in the current budget  		environment. Similarly, in Missouri, the match allowed progress on integration  		to continue under budget stringency; the expectation is that continuation of  		the program will be justified by the achieved savings. In Oregon, the match  		allowed the state to add financial incentives to its plan for primary care  		delivery system transformation, which was said to have been an important  		enticement to practice participation in that larger initiative. In New York, as  		well, the match made financial incentives to system change more attractive.  		</p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">V. OVERVIEW OF EVALUATION DESIGN AND  		CHALLENGES</a></h2>
<p>For the long-term evaluation our design uses a mixed-methods approach  		employing both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. In  		this approach, qualitative data collected through program review, site visits,  		and follow-ups as described above, provide context and rich profiles of  		programs, insights into the motivations behind state choices, common patterns  		across programs and states, implementation progress over the implementation  		period, and provider and participant perspectives. These data also generate  		information that can be used in quantitative analyses to identify key factors  		in achieving favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>A key design element of the quantitative component is the use of  		comparison groups of beneficiaries in analyzing trends and relative gains in  		the target outcomes for health home enrollees versus comparisons in both the  		baseline and intervention periods. Analysis of experience in the baseline  		period serves two purposes. First, it will establish utilization patterns and  		cost prior to implementation. Second, it will improve our ability to isolate  		effects associated with health home participation by allowing us to control for  		common Medicaid program and other factors that may affect both a comparison  		group and health homes participants before and during the intervention. A  		pre/post-only design without a comparison is likely to make it more difficult  		to discern marginal improvements for health home enrollees over the relatively  		short intervention period.</p>
<h3>Challenges to Quantitative Evaluation</h3>
<p>As the design of state programs has begun to be known, a number of  		potential challenges for quantitative analysis of the effects of health homes  		on the key outcomes of hospital, emergency department, and SNF utilization and  		costs have become clear, some of which we anticipated in our provisional  		design. These challenges will make it more difficult to detect changes  		associated with the health homes model.</p>
<p>An overarching issue is the eight-quarter duration of the intervention  		period. Under the best of circumstances, two years is a short time over which  		to realize improvements. As noted above, implementation necessarily moves at a  		slow pace, owing to the transformations in structures, processes, and care  		culture necessary for the health home model.</p>
<p>A second fundamental issue is that health homes implementation is not  		occurring in a vacuum. All four states are either building marginally on a  		system that has some components already in place, using health homes as a part  		of a broader system reform, or both. All of these states are participating or  		planning to participate in other initiatives. These include the Integrated Care  		for Dual Eligibles Demonstration and the Financial Alignment Initiative, both  		of which aim to support care coordination and integration for duals by allowing  		states to integrate Medicare and Medicaid financing; the Multipayer Advanced  		Primary Care Practice Demonstration; the Child Health Insurance Program  		Reconciliation Act (CHIPRA) ten-state Children's Health Insurance Program  		(CHIP) Evaluation; and the CHIPRA Quality Demonstration. Participation in these  		initiatives implies that the considerable practice transformation occurring  		outside of Section 2703 may contribute to the success of the model but also  		will make it more difficult to isolate effects attributable to it. At the same  		time, state participation in other initiatives makes it much more difficult to  		find "uncontaminated" comparison groups that could help isolate health home  		effects.</p>
<p>The decision of all four states to implement their programs statewide  		eliminates the possibility of using Medicaid enrollees in nonparticipating  		geographic areas for comparison. In theory, statewide implementation implies  		that the only "similar" beneficiaries with respect to their condition profile  		receiving care outside of health homes would be those who refused enrollment or  		could not be found, which also could mean they would be hard to find through  		eligibility algorithms applied to claims data. An additional issue elucidated  		through our qualitative activities over the base year was the potential for  		biases from differential enrollment practices--centralized selection of an  		eligible population versus provider referrals. Provider referrals could, in  		theory, promote cherry-picking of enrollees, but more generally is subject to  		inter-provider variability, relative to a consistently applied central  		eligibility determination process.</p>
<h3>Potential Approaches to Address Challenges</h3>
<p>Given the variety in state approaches to health homes, it may be  		possible to identify state-specific or program-specific design adaptations. We  		will continue to work with states toward this end.</p>
<p>In Rhode Island, enrollment is primarily through provider  		identification. The CEDARR Centers are at capacity, and expansion does not  		appear to be contemplated. Therefore, it may be possible to identify similar  		beneficiaries who are not enrolled as comparisons. The same may be true for  		CHMO health homes, since initial enrollment was of beneficiaries already  		receiving services through CMHOs.</p>
<p>In Missouri, the initial selection of health home enrollees was based on  		a combination of conditions and expenditure patterns over a consistent calendar  		year, and, to date, provider identification of eligible enrollees contemplated  		for the future is not in effect. This may allow identification of a similar  		population based on a different reference period not captured in the initial  		state identification. The state indicated that only 16% of enrollees fall into  		the high-expenditures category for more than one year, so that selection using  		a different year may be able to generate a comparable but nonoverlapping  		comparison group.</p>
<p>In New York, enrollment prioritizes eligibility based on condition  		severity and low connectivity to PCPs, although low connectivity has presented  		enrollment challenges. In this case, it may be possible to develop a comparison  		group of those with low connectivity who could not be located but could be  		tracked in claims data.</p>
<p>In Oregon, enrollment is through provider recommendation, so that it may  		be possible to identify similar beneficiaries using nonparticipating providers  		as comparisons. </p>
<h2><a name="second" id="second">VI. SECOND YEAR ACTIVITIES</a></h2>
<p>In the upcoming year, we will continue to monitor the first four states  		and begin work with additional states as their SPAs are approved. We also  		anticipate receiving administrative data through our DUA with CMS that may  		allow us to develop baseline comparative profiles of the health home eligible  		populations in each state in our second annual report. In addition to working  		with states on issues relating to comparison groups and identifiers for health  		home enrollees, we hope to begin obtaining information from states on quality  		monitoring measures they are collecting from health home providers.</p>
<p>As of this report, additional states with approved SPAs are North  		Carolina, Iowa, and Ohio, each with one health home program. North Carolina's  		program is statewide, focusing on a population with chronic physical  		conditions, excluding persons with mental illness or developmental  		disabilities. Like the programs examined in this report, North Carolina's  		health home option is being incorporated into a longstanding care coordination  		structure, and, like Rhode Island and Oregon, the state selected an effective  		date of October 1, 2011, so that it was seven months into its intervention  		period by the time it was approved in late May 2012. Iowa, which received  		approval of its SPA in early June 2012 with an effective date of July 1, also  		is implementing its program statewide and is focusing on persons with selected  		chronic physical conditions and mental conditions or substance use disorders.  		Ohio's program was approved in mid-September 2012, effective October 1, and  		focuses on persons in five counties with serious and persistent mental illness,  		which the state defines as a SMI in adults and serious emotional disturbance in  		children.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">VII. CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>All states studied in this first year of the long-term evaluation have  		in common that they have used the Medicaid Health Homes option to augment  		existing programs, to accelerate movement down an established pathway, as one  		part of larger system reform efforts, or all of the above. Even so,  		implementation appears to be a slow process, at least with respect to the  		eight-quarter intervention period, over which the programs are to be evaluated.  		Particular issues revealed through the site visits are those relating to the  		need to improve internal and external communications and systems needed to  		underpin the aims of health homes. This was especially true in some states for  		communications between hospitals and health home providers. This avenue of  		communication is critical to improving transitional care and to the key health  		homes aim of reducing inappropriate or unnecessary use of hospital-based care  		and avoidable readmissions. Integrating behavioral and physical health is a  		particular area in which systems integration faces special challenges that  		differ depending on the direction of integration. In general, our site visits  		suggest that both functional aspects of system transformation, such as  		improving or adapting the HIT infrastructure, and human aspects, such as  		adapting to new processes and routines and culture change, are a work in  		progress to varying degrees in all the states studied.</p>
<p>In the second year of the evaluation, all of the states examined in this  		report and North Carolina will complete the first year of their intervention  		periods and move well into their second years. Thus, we will be able to follow  		up on the emerging issues identified in this report, observe how progress  		toward full implementation and system reform may differ across these maturing  		programs, and document these and other implementation issues for new programs  		in their first intervention year.</p>

<h4>This paper also available at:  				<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/HHOption-MO.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/HHOption-MO.pdf</a></h4>
</div>
<p>Missouri has two approved Medicaid Health Home State Plan Amendments  		(SPAs), the first targeting beneficiaries with serious mental illness (SMI) or  		behavioral health conditions, and the second targeting beneficiaries with  		multiple chronic physical conditions. The former was approved on October 20,  		2011, while the latter was approved on December 23, 2001; both SPAs went into  		effect on January 1, 2012. Community mental health centers (CMHCs) are the  		designated providers for the behavioral health population, while primary care  		centers--specifically, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health  		clinics (RHCs), and hospital-operated primary care clinics--are the designated  		providers for the population with multiple chronic physical conditions.  		(Throughout this memorandum, we denote the initiative targeting persons with  		behavioral health conditions as the CMHC-HH, and the second targeting  		beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions as the primary care  		provider-health home [PCP-HH].)</p>
<p>Missouri's CMHC catchment system divides the state into 25 geographic  		areas, each of which is served by at least one, but in some case more than one,  		CMHC. In total, there are 21 full-service CMHCs--which serve all age ranges and  		provide psychiatric services, counseling, case management, crisis intervention,  		and housing support, among other services--and nine affiliate sites--which  		focus primarily on case management and housing support, and are not required to  		serve all ages.<sup><a href="#note1-MO">1</a></sup> As of January 2012, the  		state had selected 18 FQHCs operating 67 clinic sites, six public hospitals  		operating 22 clinic sites, and one Independent RHC to participate.<sup><a href="#note2-MO">2</a></sup> The Health Home program will be statewide, and the  		Missouri Department of Social Services estimates that about 43,254 Medicaid  		beneficiaries are eligible. As of April 2012, 37,720 individuals were enrolled;  		17,262 in CMHC-HHs, and 20,458 in PCP-HHs.<sup><a href="#note3-MO">3</a></sup></p>
<h3>Implementation Context</h3>
<p>The Missouri Medicaid program (known since 2007 as MO HealthNet)  		operates both a managed care and a fee-for-service (FFS) program. Participation  		in Medicaid managed care is largely a function of geography, though certain  		eligibility groups are also required to enroll, under the state's 1915(b)  		waiver.<sup><a href="#note4-MO">4</a></sup> Those who are dually eligible for  		Medicaid and Medicare, those meeting disability standards for Supplemental  		Security Income, and those receiving adoption subsidy benefits can choose to  		receive FFS benefits, enroll in managed care, or disenroll at any time, under  		the waiver.<sup><a href="#note5-MO">5</a></sup> The state contracts with five  		managed care organizations (MCOs) (Molina Healthcare, HealthCare USA, Harmony  		Health Plan, Missouri Care Health Plan, and Blue Advantage Plus of Kansas City)  		who jointly manage care in the Central, Eastern, and Western regions. These  		regions are roughly located along the I-70 corridor, which runs east to west  		and includes the state's major urban areas. Counties to the north and south of  		this corridor are more rural and sparsely populated; these operate on a FFS  		basis. (See <a href="#figure1-MO">map</a>.)</p>
<p>The Missouri Health Home initiative is taking place within a broader  		context of state-sponsored care coordination and integration initiatives, many  		of which predate the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Though Missouri began  		implementing targeted care coordination and integration programs for its SMI  		population in 2003,<sup><a href="#note6-MO">6</a></sup> the major push for  		reform began in 2005. In that year, the state convened the Missouri Medicaid  		Reform Commission to develop recommendations for restructuring the entire  		Medicaid program. Among its many recommendations, the final report endorsed the  		concept of the medical home for Medicaid recipients, citing the need for better  		continuity and coordination of care. It also developed several recommendations  		relating to the integration of behavioral and physical health services.<sup><a href="#note7-MO">7</a></sup> These recommendations for the mental health system  		were developed in consultation with the state Department of Mental Health  		(DMH),<sup><a href="#note8-MO">8</a></sup> which subsequently would act as the  		lead agency on the state's mental health reform efforts. In collaboration with  		MO HealthNet, the Missouri Coalition of Community Mental Health Centers, and  		the Missouri Primary Care Association (MPCA), DMH led a series of  		programs--collectively referred to as DMH Net--which were intended to improve  		the quality of care for persons with SMI, as well as support the clinical  		integration of primary and behavioral health care. These initiatives would  		eventually form the basis of the Health Home initiative.<sup><a href="#note9-MO">9</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, the state received a Transformation Grant from the federal  		Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to support  		its reform efforts.<sup><a href="#note10-MO">10</a></sup> The subsequent  		Comprehensive Plan for Mental Health, which was published in early 2008,  		underscored the state's commitment to care integration, and specifically cited  		the efforts of DMH Net as part of the reform plan.<sup><a href="#note11-MO">11</a></sup> In 2007, DMH secured state funding for a pilot  		care integration program involving collaborations between FQHCs and CMHCs. In  		this pilot, FQHCs were required to open primary care clinics on site at the  		partnering CMHC, while CMHCs provided behavioral health consultants to the  		FQHC's primary health care teams. Of 13 applicants, seven pilot sites were  		selected. Each received $100,000 for the first six months of 2008, then  		$200,000 per year for the next three fiscal years. The six sites that were not  		selected were awarded one-time planning grants of $30,000, to allow them to lay  		the groundwork for subsequent funding cycles.<sup><a href="#note8-MO">8</a></sup> Technical assistance for these pilot sites was  		funded by the Missouri Foundation for Health (MFH), which is a grant-making  		organization focused on supporting health improvement programs for underserved  		and uninsured populations. The 13 collaborative sites vary in structure; one  		CMHC also has FQHC status, while another merged with an FQHC. Other CMHCs  		contract with FQHCs to provide services to patients.<sup><a href="#note12-MO">12</a></sup></p>
<p>More broadly, DMH implemented a range of reforms to both the structures  		and processes in place within the mental health system. The Community  		Psychiatric Rehabilitation Program (CPRC) established a team approach to care,  		and focused attention on meeting a broad array of needs (housing, work,  		recreation, etc.) to support patients with SMI.<sup><a href="#note13-MO">13</a></sup> A range of health information technology (HIT)  		tools were developed to support that care (e.g., the Behavioral Pharmacy  		Management Program, Medication Adherence Report, and CyberAccess, which are  		discussed in further detail below). In 2007, the Missouri Coalition of CMHCs  		began training case managers to improve care coordination and develop treatment  		plans that include physical health interventions.<sup><a href="#note12-MO">12</a></sup> Nurse liaisons were also added to CMHC teams to  		educate behavioral health staff on physical health issues and review patient  		charts.<sup><a href="#note9-MO">9</a></sup> CMHCs also introduced a number of  		prevention and wellness services, such as screening for metabolic and  		cardiovascular conditions, smoking cessation counseling, and nutrition  		education. More recently, DMH and MO HealthNet collaborated on a two-year  		disease management project targeted at the 3,700 highest-cost, nondual Medicaid  		enrollees with SMI and chronic medical conditions. Under this initiative, DMH  		agreed to contact identified clients, enroll them in the CPR program, and  		manage their care. The project, known as DM 3700, began in November  		2010.<sup><a href="#note14-MO">14</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these reforms to the mental health system, Missouri also  		introduced a major primary care case management program, which ran from 2007 to  		2010. The Chronic Care Improvement Program (CCIP) was aimed at improving  		quality of care for MO HealthNet clients with chronic conditions, decreasing  		their complications, reducing the cost of their care, and connecting them with  		a "health care home." The program was managed by APS Healthcare, a disease and  		care management company, and covered all active FFS Medicaid enrollees (roughly  		10% of whom are CMHC clients<sup><a href="#note15-MO">15</a></sup>) with a  		diagnosis of asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,  		gastroesophageal reflux disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and sickle cell  		anemia.<sup><a href="#note3-MO">3</a></sup> Under this program, APS conducted  		outreach and education, telephone support for beneficiaries with questions  		about medical concerns, and a web-based plan of care that was accessible to any  		provider with an Internet connection and a password.<sup><a href="#note16-MO">16</a></sup> Providers were paid an incentive to conduct and  		initial health risk assessment, as well as to develop and use these care plans  		on a regular basis.<sup><a href="#note6-MO">6</a></sup> As of 2010, CCIP  		provided additional care management and coordination services to approximately  		180,000 patients.<sup><a href="#note15-MO">15</a></sup> Due to budgetary  		constraints, the program was discontinued in August 2010.</p>
<p>On the private sector side, in 2011 the MFH announced a Request for  		Applications for a multi-payer patient-centered medical home (PCMH)  		collaborative project.<sup><a href="#note17-MO">17</a></sup> Though this  		medical home project is distinct from the Health Homes initiative, the  		framework for it was developed to resemble Missouri's Health Home SPA, and the  		two initiatives will share in learning collaboratives. The project is funded  		for two years, and at present includes Anthem Blue Cross. Unlike the Health  		Homes initiative, it is not statewide--it covers the 84 counties served by the  		MFH.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid are a  		significant sub-population of Health Home enrollees (12,230 of the current  		Health Home beneficiaries are dually enrolled, roughly 29% of the overall  		population). The state is currently finalizing a proposal to the Centers for  		Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for a demonstration project that targets  		the dual eligible population through its Health Home initiative. Under the  		current draft, the state proposes to share with CMS the Medicare savings that  		Health Homes generate, which the state will in turn share with providers  		through a pay-for-performance program.<sup><a href="#note3-MO">3</a></sup> As a  		part of the demonstration, the state is seeking CMS funding to support three  		additional staff positions: two analysts to work with Medicare data, and a  		coordinator who will facilitate integration of the two Health Home  		programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Implications for Missouri Section 2703 Medicaid Health Homes  		Evaluation</b></i></p>
<p>These various pre-existing initiatives have several key implications for  		both the implementation and evaluation of the health homes demonstration. The  		state has worked with CMHCs for several years to provide care coordination and  		disease management services to Medicaid enrollees with multiple chronic  		conditions and SMI. Thus, CMHC providers and state officials have a substantial  		base of experience in organizing and providing health home-type services. It  		will be critical to establish how the enhanced federal match will be used by  		the state, and to what extent the health home demonstration represents a new  		kind of service rather than an expansion of an existing initiative. In the  		latter case, the evaluation may find few changes in structure, process, or  		outcomes. However, the demonstration may serve as a proof of concept for the  		health home model, as well as provide valuable insight into the issues and  		challenges surrounding its implementation.</p>
<p>Given that health home-type services have been provided by some  		providers for a number of years, while others will be relatively new to the  		program, it will be necessary to clearly identify and describe the structures  		and processes that are in place at baseline, and to characterize the changes  		that providers make to these structures and processes as a consequence of  		becoming health homes. It will also be necessary to adjust the analysis for  		both the participants' and providers' time in program. Some of these structures  		and processes are not yet in place, and the state will likely make adjustments  		to certain aspects of the program based on feedback from providers and periodic  		internal review. For example, the delineation between the care coordination  		activities provided through Health Homes and that provided by MCOs is not yet  		fully detailed, and the payment system may be altered following the 18-month  		review planned in the SPA. The relationship between the hospitals and Health  		Homes--a critical piece of the picture given that admissions, readmissions, and  		emergency room (ER) use are three of the major outcomes being tracked--is still  		being formalized in many cases. Though much of Missouri's HIT infrastructure  		was already in place, the state is still making changes necessary to implement  		and support Health Home activities. In addition to the information gathered  		during the site visit, the Urban Institute team will conduct follow-up calls at  		regular intervals to discuss the progress of these and other implementation  		activities.</p>
<h3>Population Criteria and Provider Infrastructure</h3>
<p><a href="#table1-MO">Table 1</a> summarizes the population criteria for  		both SPA programs and the designated providers and requirements regarding the  		minimum composition of the Health Home teams. As noted above, the CMHC-HH SPA  		targets beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions, including both mental  		illness and substance use, while the PCP-HH SPA targets those with chronic  		physical conditions. The qualifying chronic physical conditions are the same in  		the two SPAs: diabetes, asthma, CVD, obesity (defined as having a Body Mass  		Index [BMI] over 25), developmental disability, and tobacco use. The primary  		distinction is that substance use and mental illness are not qualifying  		conditions to receive Health Home services through a primary care center; such  		beneficiaries would have their Health Home services managed by a CMHC.</p>
<p>The two types of providers on which Missouri is building its Health Home  		infrastructure have varying experience with Health Home-type services, and have  		care teams that reflect the different needs of their respective populations. As  		<a href="#table2-MO">Table 2</a> shows, both teams include a Director, Nurse  		Care Manager, and administrative support staff. The CMHC-HH team adds a primary  		care physician consultant, while the PCP-HH team adds a behavioral health  		consultant and a care coordinator, as well as additional clinical staff (i.e.,  		a physician or nurse practitioner, as well as a licensed nurse or medical  		assistant). Both SPAs indicate that additional team members may be included,  		depending on beneficiary needs. These members can include the treating  		physician (if the participant is enrolled in a CMHC-HH), a  		dietician/nutritionist, and school personnel, among others.</p>
<p><a href="#table2-MO">Table 2</a> is adapted primarily from the current  		draft of the state's dual eligible proposal to CMS, which outlines the specific  		roles and responsibilities of each key care team member. Certain CMHC staff  		roles will continue unchanged (or largely unchanged), though these individuals  		will play a role in patient care. Behavioral health clinicians and the CPRC  		teams will remain unchanged, while Community Support Specialists will receive  		enhanced training to enable them to serve as health coaches who promote  		lifestyle changes and preventive care, support participants both in managing  		their health conditions and accessing primary care.</p>
<h3>Service Definitions and Provider Standards</h3>
<p>Definitions of health home services are identical for the two SPAs,  		though the providers who have primary responsibility for managing those  		services differ slightly. (<a href="#table3-MO">Table 3</a> provides the  		full-service definitions.) Nurse Care Managers play a key role in all of the  		defined services across both provider categories, with support from the other  		team members.</p>
<p>The qualifications for Health Home status are also similar between the  		two SPAs. All Health Home providers must meet initial and ongoing  		qualifications in addition to those qualifications that are already required  		for designation as a CMHCs, FQHCs, RHCs, or hospital-operated primary care  		clinic. The full list of Health Home qualifications is provided in  		<a href="#table4-MO">Table 4</a>. In order to meet these qualifications, both  		types of Health Home will transform their practices over a two-year period by  		participating in ongoing training sessions or learning collaborative.<sup><a href="#note18-MO">18</a></sup> These learning collaboratives are funded jointly  		by MFH, the Greater Kansas City Health Care Foundation, and the Missouri  		Hospital Association.</p>
<p>Training began in August 2011, and will continue throughout 2012. These  		training modules focus on three components: understanding and implementing the  		Health Home initiative as mandated under state law; transforming practice in  		order to improve care quality and efficiency, as well as meet Health Home  		accreditation standards; and a care team training module focused on  		understanding the Healthcare Home model, incorporating "whole-person"  		strategies into service delivery, understanding and assisting in managing  		chronic diseases, and working with children and adolescents on their basic  		health literacy.<sup><a href="#note2-MO">2</a></sup></p>
<h3>Use of Health Information Technology</h3>
<p>Missouri's Health Home initiative is supported primarily through the  		existing Medicaid HIT infrastructure, though the state is building on this  		infrastructure in several ways that relate to broader statewide initiatives as  		well as Health Homes, specifically, the state's EHR incentive program,  		meaningful use compliance, and the development of the health information  		exchange. MO HealthNet maintains a web based EHR called CyberAccess, which is  		accessible to all enrolled Medicaid providers, including CMHCs. This system  		also includes a web portal called Direct Inform, which allows enrollees to look  		up information on their care utilization, calculate their cardiac and diabetic  		risk levels, and develop a personal health plan. This feature is intended to  		facilitate patient self management and monitoring. In addition, MO HealthNet  		maintains an initial and concurrent authorization-of-stay tool that requires  		hospitals to notify MO HealthNet within 24 hours of a new admission of any  		Medicaid enrollee, as well as to provide information about diagnosis,  		condition, and treatment.</p>
<p>The state is currently working with its HIT vendor to extend its data  		transfer capabilities between hospitals and outpatient providers, which would  		allow Health Home providers to use hospitalization episodes to identify  		eligible beneficiaries, facilitate the necessary outreach and transfer of care  		between inpatient and outpatient, and coordinate with the hospital on the  		discharge process. The state will also encourage Health Home providers to  		monitor Medicaid eligibility using the Family Support Division (FSD)  		eligibility website (FSD determines client eligibility for the MO HealthNet  		program and database), and will refine the process for notifying Health Home  		providers of impending eligibility lapses. The state requires all Health Home  		providers to implement an EHR if they do not already have one, which they will  		also use for extracting and reporting data.</p>
<p>In addition to these umbrella activities, CMHC-HHs and PCP-HHs will each  		have provider-specific HIT resources on which to draw. CMHC-HHs will continue  		to make use of two systems: the Customer Information Management, Outcomes and  		Reporting (CIMOR) for routine reporting, and ProAct for Care Management  		Reports. Under the Health Home initiative, the capacity of the CIMOR system  		will be expanded to enable assignment of enrollees to a CMHC-HH based on  		enrollee choice and admission for services, and the system will be  		cross-referenced with the above-mentioned inpatient pre-authorization system to  		enable concurrent reporting of inpatient authorizations to the appropriate  		CMHC-HH. The ProAct Care Management Reports include the BPMS, Medication  		Adherence Report and the Disease Management Report. The BPMS report is used for  		tracking and reporting on prescribing patterns. The Medication Adherence report  		alerts to medication adherence concerns. The Disease Management Report provides  		information on treatment gaps based on diagnosis and EBP. PCP-HHs will have  		access to the Missouri Quality Improvement Network, which is maintained by the  		MPCA and will serve as a patient registry as well as a platform for gathering  		quality measures. The data will be refreshed daily, and will be used to  		generate reports to support meaningful use requirements, quality improvement,  		and best practice identification.</p>
<h3>Payment Structure and Rates</h3>
<p>Both types of health homes will be paid a per member per month (PMPM)  		capitation rate. The PMPM rate for each enrollee in CMHD-HHs will be $78.74,  		and the rate for PCP-HHs will be $58.87.</p>
<p>These rates are built up from the assumed staffing ratios for each type  		of health home personnel. (These are listed above, in the description of the  		various types of staff that will be involved in the health homes.) In addition  		to staffing ratios, the input to the PMPM rates included the annual salary (and  		benefits and overhead) of each type of staffer, which Missouri determined from  		2011 surveys of organizations likely to become health homes. For example, if  		the surveys showed that salary, benefits, and overhead for a given type of  		staff person came to $60,000 annually, and the assumed staffing ratio was one  		FTE per 400 patients, then the costs of this type of staff within the total  		PMPM would be $60,000 divided by 400 divided by 12 months, or $12.50 PMPM.</p>
<p>For both types of health homes, the assumed staffing ratios total to  		1-1¼ staff hours (for all types of staff combined) per patient per  		month. Activities covered by current Medicaid funding streams are not being  		counted in the planned staffing. PMPM rates reflect only marginal health  		home-specific staffing requirements.</p>
<p>Missouri plans to adjust the PMPM annually, based on the consumer price  		index. In addition, the PMPM determination method will be reviewed 18 months  		after the first PMPM payments "to determine if the PMPM is economically  		efficient and consistent with quality of care." Consideration will be given at  		that point to a "tiered rate"--that is, to different PMPM amounts for patients  		with different characteristics and perhaps to health homes with different  		characteristics.</p>
<h3>Quality Improvement Goals and Measures</h3>
<p>Missouri has defined eight overarching quality improvement goals for its  		Health Homes, each with defined clinical outcome and quality of care measures,  		summarized in <a href="#table5-MO">Table 5</a>. The measures are generally  		similar, with the few differences noted in the table. The only experience of  		care measure identified is patient satisfaction, which will be obtained from  		patient surveys, for the goal of empowerment and self-management. Most measures  		will come from claims, disease registry, medical records, and the web-based  		health record (CyberAccess).</p>
<h3>Evaluation Measures and Methods</h3>
<p>The evaluation measures and methodology, as described in the SPAs and  		reproduced in <a href="#table6-MO">Table 6</a>, are the essentially the same  		for CMHC-HHs and PCP-MHs, with the exception of estimated cost savings,  		discussed below. Four of the evaluation areas--chronic disease management,  		coordination of care, assessment of program implementation, and processes and  		lessons learned, and assessment of quality improvements and clinical  		outcomes--pertain to performance and progress toward health homes goals and  		rely on a combination of processes, including examination of reports on the  		goals and quality measures in <a href="#table3-MO">Table 3</a>, audits of  		practices, and ongoing assessment and oversight of implementation by a Health  		Homes Work Group and the Steering Committee of the Missouri Medical Home  		Collaborative. The clinical outcome and quality measures in  		<a href="#table5-MO">Table 5</a> also will be used to assess improvements over  		time at the health home practice level and for health home practices as a  		group, with comparisons to regional and national benchmarks where feasible,  		although it is noted that such benchmarks will not be available specifically  		for persons with chronic conditions.</p>
<p>The final two measures specify comparison groups in one or both SPAs,  		but will need clarification in our discussions with the state. For both  		CMHC-HHs and PCP-HHs, hospital admission rates will be assessed for  		beneficiaries with the clinical conditions targeted during the learning  		collaborative year, and for similar beneficiaries, using combined FFS claims  		and encounter data for participating health home sites and a control group of  		nonparticipating sites, not otherwise specified. For CMHC-HHs the comparison  		beneficiaries will have SMI, two or more chronic conditions, or one chronic  		condition and at risk for developing a second. Selection criteria are the same  		for PCP-HHs, except that SMI is omitted. Because the description of the timing  		of the assessments for the two groups and the nature of the comparison sites is  		not clear, we will need to explore the design of this assessment further with  		the state. Finally, for estimates of cost savings, both SPAs provide details of  		the computation of savings, but only the CMHC-HH SPA specifies an analysis  		design, a pre/post analysis of both Health Home providers and a group of  		comparison practices selected to be as similar as possible to participating  		practices. Comparison practices will be identified by practice type (e.g.,  		FQHC), geographic region, and number of Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI or two  		or more chronic conditions. The definition of the pre and post-periods is not  		given and will need to be explored with the state. We will also have to clarify  		with the state whether a similar pre/post design is intended for the PCP-HH but  		was inadvertently omitted.</p>

</tr><tr><td scope="row">Hospital admission rates</td>
<td>The state will consolidate data from its  			 FFS Medicaid Management Information System-based claims system and from  			 MCO-generated encounter data for the participating health home sites to assess  			 hospital admission rates, for the participating health home sites and for a  			 control group of nonparticipating sites. The analysis will consider: (a) the  			 experience of beneficiaries with the clinical conditions of focus during the  			 learning collaborative year (expected to grow from year 1 to year 2); and (b)  			 all beneficiaries with SMI, 2 or more chronic conditions, or 1 chronic  			 condition and at risk for a second, drawn from a list of chronic conditions  			 defined by the state.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Chronic disease  			 management</td>
<td>The state will audit each practice.  			 Audits will assess: (a) documented self-management support goal setting with  			 all beneficiaries identified by the practice site as high-risk; (b) practice  			 team clinical telephonic or face-to-face beneficiary follow-up within 2 days  			 after hospitalization discharge; (c) documentation that there is a care manager  			 in place; and (d) that the care manager is operating consistently with the  			 requirements set forth for the practices by the state.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Coordination of care</td>
<td>The state will measure: (a) care manager  			 contact during hospitalization; (b) practice team clinical telephonic or  			 face-to-face beneficiary follow-up within 2 days after hospitalization  			 discharge; (c) active care management of high-risk patients; and (d) behavioral  			 activation of high-risk patients. The measurement methodologies for these 4  			 measures are described in the preceding section.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Assessment of program  			 implementation</td>
<td>The state will monitor implementation in  			 2 ways. First, a Health Homes Work Group comprised of Department of Social  			 Services and DMH personnel and provider representatives will meet regularly to  			 track implementation against: (a) a work plan; and (b) against performance  			 indicators to assess implementation status. The meetings will initially occur  			 on a biweekly basis, and then will transition to monthly meetings 6 months into  			 implementation. Second, the 2 departments will join private payers and provider  			 representatives on the Steering Committee of the Missouri Medical Home  			 Collaborative to review monthly practice data submissions and analysis by the  			 MFH, as well as the status of practice transformation activities in conjunction  			 with a MFH-funded learning collaborative and possible practice coaching to be  			 provided to at least some of the participating practices.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Processes and lessons  			 learned</td>
<td>The aforementioned work group, as well as  			 the Steering Committee of the Missouri Medical Home Collaborative will approach  			 the health home transformation process for the participating practices as an  			 ongoing quality improvement exercise. Using a combination of evaluation data,  			 information from the learning collaborative Quality Improvement Advisor who  			 will be reviewing regularly submitted practice narrative and data reports,  			 feedback from any practice coaches, and feedback provided to the Health Homes  			 Work Group and the Collaborative Steering Committee by practice  			 representatives, the state will assess what elements of its practice  			 transformation strategy are working--and which are not. Critical attention will  			 be paid to: (a) critical success factors, some of which have already been  			 identified in the literature; and (b) barriers to practice transformation.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Assessment of quality  			 improvements and clinical outcomes</td>
<td>The state will utilize the quality  			 process and outcome measures described in the prior section to assess quality  			 improvements and clinical outcomes. For registry-based, claims-based and  			 audit-based measures, assessment will occur both at the individual practice  			 level, and at the aggregate level for all participating health homes. For  			 registry and claims-based measures, the state will track change over time to  			 assess whether statistically significant improvement has been achieved. For  			 registry-based measures for which national Medicaid benchmark data is available  			 for Medicaid managed care plans, comparisons will be made to regional and  			 national benchmarks.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Estimates of cost  			 savings</td>
<td><b>CMHC only</b>: The state will annually  			 perform an assessment of cost savings using a pre/post-period comparison with a  			 control group of Medicaid primary care practices serving clinically similar  			 populations but not participating as Health Homes. Control group practices will  			 be similar to participating practices to the extent that it is feasible to do  			 so. They will be identified by practice type (e.g., FQHC), geographic region,  			 and number of Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI or 2 or more chronic conditions.  			 Savings calculations will be risk-adjusted, truncated claims of high-cost  			 outliers annually exceeding 3 standard deviations of the mean, and will net out  			 the value of supplemental payments made to the participating sites during the  			 8-quarter period.<b>PCP</b>: Methods for calculating cost savings for  			 inpatient hospital, ER, and skilled nursing facility use, and how those inputs  			 will be used to calculate savings net of Health Home PMPM are illustrated, but  			 no parallel structure is given for a pre/post comparison of costs for  			 participating Health Home practices with those for similar nonparticipating  			 practices, as was provided in the CMHC SPA.</td>

</div>
<p>New York currently has one Medicaid Health Home State Plan Amendment  		(SPA) approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on  		February 2, 2012, with a retroactive effective date of January 1, 2012.<sup><a href="#note1-NY">1</a></sup> The state envisions this program as the first step  		in a Health Home initiative that will be rolled out in three  		geographically-based phases and ultimately will cover Medicaid enrollees with  		chronic physical or behavioral conditions statewide. The currently approved SPA  		represents Phase I and will cover ten counties. Separate SPAs have been  		submitted for Phase II, which will cover an additional 12 counties, and Phase  		III, which will expand Health Homes to the remaining 39 counties. The expected  		retroactive effective dates for the latter phases are April 1, 2012, and July  		1, 2012, respectively. </p>
<p>The current Phase I and planned Phase II and III initiatives cover  		enrollees in two groups: (1) those who have a serious mental illness (SMI); and  		(2) those who have two or more chronic conditions (including substance abuse),  		and those who have HIV/AIDS and are at risk of developing another chronic  		condition. New York estimates that these two groups covered by Phase I, II, and  		III SPAs represent about 700,000 of the state's approximately five million  		Medicaid members. The state also plans to extend statewide coverage to two  		additional population groups in later SPAs: enrollees with developmental  		disabilities and enrollees in need of long-term care services. Another 275,000  		Medicaid enrollees are estimated to fall into these two groups.</p>
<p>The state identifies Health Home providers through an application  		process in which a Health Home lead organization demonstrates how it will meet  		the Health Home requirements through its partners and affiliated providers.  		Health Home lead organizations have already been designated for Phases I and II  		and will be designated shortly for Phase III. Approved Health Home providers  		include hospital networks with affiliated physical health, behavioral health,  		and community support providers, existing condition-specific Targeted Case  		Management (TCM) programs, and community-based organizations.</p>
<p>The second Health Home wave will expand coverage to the long-term care  		population. The design of this wave is currently under discussion, but it is  		expected that the program will be based on the existing managed long-term care  		program and a network of nursing home and noninstitutional providers. The third  		wave will target enrollees with developmental disabilities. Care for this  		population is currently managed by a TCM program, which is expected to convert  		to a Health Home in conjunction with implementation of the state's Section 1115  		Medicaid Waiver program, People First, currently under development.</p>
<h3>Implementation Context</h3>
<p>In January 2011, Governor Andrew Cuomo convened a Medicaid Redesign Team  		(MRT) to assess the Medicaid program overall and develop recommendations for  		reform, with a focus on quality of care and cost containment and a vision of  		care management for all. The state's Medicaid program currently has both  		fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care components. About 70% of all  		beneficiaries are currently enrolled in managed care, although the share in  		managed care varies across different eligibility groups. The state has asserted  		that care for most enrollees is being managed well within a primary care  		setting but that population groups with increasingly costly and complex  		medical, behavioral, and long-term health care needs could benefit from  		additional care management. One of the MRT's 78 approved recommendations was to  		initiate a statewide Health Home program. A second key recommendation was to  		extend managed care to all program enrollees.</p>
<p>A wide range of programs similar to Health Homes has informed the  		development and implementation of the state's initiative. Some are  		geographically-based initiatives; others are statewide and target enrollees  		with specific conditions. Many programs are limited to Medicaid enrollees, but  		a substantial number include other payers as well.</p>
<p>The TCM programs have given the state a decade of experience in  		comprehensive case management and community support services for particular  		populations. Three existing case management initiatives will eventually be  		incorporated into Health Homes. The Office of Mental Health (OMH) has a TCM  		program that supports people with behavioral or mental health issues.The  		AIDS/COBRA program provides case management for people who are HIV-positive,  		and an Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) Managed  		Addiction Treatment Services (MATS) program serves enrollees with substance  		abuse problems.</p>
<p>Some programs, such as the New York Care Coordination Program (NYCCP)  		and the Chronic Illness Demonstration Projects (CIDPs), are particularly  		relevant for Health Home implementation, as they both focus on care  		coordination for patients with mental/behavioral health conditions. The NYCCP  		is a regional consortium of mental health providers and state and county  		governments, which over the past decade has developed and implemented a program  		aimed at coordinating physical and behavioral health care for Medicaid  		patients.<sup><a href="#note2-NY">2</a></sup> The CIDP initiative began in  		2009, when the state-funded six provider groups to provide FFS comprehensive  		care management for enrollees with both physical and mental health conditions,  		as well as to address their social service needs. The state has identified the  		CIDPs as a direct precursor to the Health Home initiative.<sup><a href="#note3-NY">3</a></sup> One significant lesson from CIDP was that outreach  		and enrollment costs were much higher than expected. The state found that the  		complexity and severity of enrollee needs often made it difficult to interest  		this population in joining a CIDP when they were struggling with other life  		issues.<sup><a href="#note4-NY">4</a></sup> This experience led to enhanced  		consideration and provisions for community outreach in the development of  		health homes, as well as for strong community supports, especially those  		related to housing and services following hospital discharge. The state's  		demonstrations and past initiatives have also highlighted the importance of the  		existing health information technology (HIT) infrastructure and the changes  		necessary to implement and support Health Home activities.</p>
<p>The state also is engaged in two patient-centered medical home (PCMH)  		initiatives authorized in the state's 2009 legislative session. The Adirondack  		Medical Home Demonstration is a five-year regional multi-payer initiative to  		improve care, expand access, and contain costs in the rural upstate  		region.<sup><a href="#note5-NY">5</a></sup> Participating payers include  		Medicare, Medicaid, and the state's civil service system along with several  		private payers.<sup><a href="#note6-NY">6</a></sup> The pilot was initiated in  		2010 and focuses on preventive care and coordination of care for people with  		chronic conditions. Reimbursement includes a FFS component, a care coordination  		fee, and performance-based payment for improved patient outcomes. Providers  		must achieve National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Physician Practice  		Connections--Patient-Centered Medical Home (PPC-PCMH) level 2 or 3 status  		within one year of the beginning of the pilot, and they must report on quality  		improvements for access of care, coordination and disease management, and  		hospitalization rates/readmission rates.<sup><a href="#note7-NY">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The second PCMH initiative, also begun in 2010, is a statewide program  		for individuals enrolled in Medicaid, Family Health Plus (the state's public  		health insurance program for adults), or Child Health Plus (the state's  		Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]).<sup><a href="#note8-NY">8</a></sup> Eligible providers include office-based practices,  		federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), and mental health diagnostic and  		treatment centers, and may serve both FFS and managed care beneficiaries. As in  		the Adirondack pilot program, the state adopted NCQA standards for practice  		certification. The MRT recommended that the PCMH program be expanded to new  		payers and a broader patient population. The 2011 legislative session  		authorized the Department of Health (DOH) to establish additional multi-payer  		medical home initiatives throughout the state. In response, Medicaid submitted  		a SPA to CMS in June 2011 to test new payment models for qualifying medical  		home practices, including risk-adjusted global payments and pay-for-performance  		(P4P).<sup><a href="#note8-NY">8</a></sup></p>
<p>In August 2011, DOH announced a three-year initiative to improve the  		quality and coordination of primary care services provided to Medicaid patients  		by teaching hospitals under a grant from CMS.<sup><a href="#note9-NY">9</a></sup> This initiative had two components: (1) the  		Hospital-Medical Home project, which will provide financial incentives for the  		transformation of hospital teaching programs; and (2) the Potentially  		Preventable Readmissions (PPR) project, which will provide competitive grants  		to hospitals to develop strategies to reduce the rate of preventable medical or  		behavioral health-based readmissions.<sup><a href="#note9-NY">9</a></sup> The  		agreement includes increased financial support for mental health clinics that  		serve uninsured patients through grants to diagnostic and treatment centers for  		services provided to uninsured individuals throughout the state. These programs  		are authorized to operate through December 31, 2014, and are supported under a  		Section 1115 waiver called the Partnership Plan.<sup><a href="#note9-NY">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The Capital District Physicians' Health Plan (CDPHP) Enhanced Primary  		Care Program pilot is a medical home initiative in the Albany region that is  		considered a "virtual all-payer" system. It began in 2008 and now encompasses  		24 practices, 50,000 members, and nearly 160 network physicians.<sup><a href="#note10-NY">10</a></sup> The CDPHP payment is a capitation model with a  		bonus incentive based on quality and efficiency.<sup><a href="#note10-NY">10</a></sup> Participating practices receive payments under a  		risk-adjusted capitation model based on expected levels of care utilization and  		costs associated with a patient's individual risk profile.<sup><a href="#note11-NY">11</a></sup> The plan keeps "shadow" FFS billing in place.  		Further, it promised to help doctors if their costs were higher than predicted  		by the model and to give them the difference if the practice billed less than  		the model predicted.<sup><a href="#note11-NY">11</a></sup> Data on clinical  		quality (based on 18 HEDIS measures), cost and efficiency (utilization-based  		hospital and emergency department rates, population-based metrics, and  		episode-based medical costs), and patient/provider experience (from surveys)  		are collected for evaluation.<sup><a href="#note10-NY">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The Hudson Valley P4P Medical Home Initiative was created under a 2008  		grant from DOH to Taconic Health Information Network and Community. It targets  		adults with chronic conditions in the Mid-Hudson Valley region. The five-year  		initiative brings IBM, a dominant employer in the region, together with six  		commercial health plans, who are underwriting the pilot with DOH. This project  		also bases quality and care coordination benchmarks and incentives on the NCQA  		level 2 PPC-PCMH standards. The program also seeks to facilitate adoption and  		use of electronic health records (EHRs) in office practices in the Hudson  		Valley.<sup><a href="#note12-NY">12</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these state-level initiatives, New York is involved in  		several CMS projects. It is one of eight states selected to participate in the  		Medicare Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration program, and it is also  		participating in the CMS duals demonstration program.<sup><a href="#note7-NY">7</a></sup> In addition, the Capitol District-Hudson Valley  		Region of New York has been selected to participate in the CMS's Comprehensive  		Primary Care Initiative, a multi-payer initiative promoting collaboration  		between public and private health care payers to strengthen primary care.  		Medicare will work with these payers and offer bonus payments to primary care  		doctors who better coordinate care for their patients.<sup><a href="#note7-NY">7</a></sup></p>
<p>DOH staff has developed a comprehensive Medicaid reform action plan  		based on the work of the MRT.<sup><a href="#note13-NY">13</a></sup> In  		particular, the action plan recommends the development of a comprehensive  		Section 1115 Medicaid waiver to ensure that the state has flexibility to enact  		all of the reforms proposed by the MRT. This new waiver is designed to allow  		the state to reinvest in its health care infrastructure in preparation for  		national health care reform and to work to contain the overall health care cost  		growth rate.<sup><a href="#note13-NY">13</a></sup> The state expects to use the  		1115 savings to assist Health Homes in attaining long-term sustainability,  		including help with costs, HIT investment, and recruitment and training of care  		managers.<sup><a href="#note14-NY">14</a></sup></p>
<p>The state has also undertaken a numbered series of state-funded  		initiatives, the Health Care Efficiency and Affordability Law for New Yorkers,  		known as HEAL NY, to improve its information technology capacity, several of  		which are relevant for health homes. In particular, HEAL 10 provides financial  		support to PCMH projects throughout New York to help providers improve care  		coordination and enhance the continuum of care through HIT linked through the  		Statewide Health Information Network for New York (SHIN-NY).<sup><a href="#note15-NY">15</a></sup> HEAL 17 builds on this funding for PCMH  		projects, and HEAL 22 authorizes state funding to support EHR implementation  		specifically for behavioral health providers.<sup><a href="#note16-NY">16</a>,  		<a href="#note17-NY">17</a></sup></p>
<h3>Implications for New York Section 2703 Medicaid Health  		Homes Evaluation</h3>
<p>These various initiatives have several key implications for both the  		implementation and evaluation of the health homes program. The state has worked  		with a range of providers over many years to improve care coordination and  		disease management services to Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions and  		SMI, targeted variously to particular conditions, specific geographic areas,  		and particular providers. Thus, both providers and state officials have a  		substantial base of experience in organizing and providing health home-type  		services. It will be critical to establish how the enhanced federal match will  		be used by the state and to what extent the Health Home initiatives represent a  		new kind of service rather than an expansion of an existing initiative. The  		variety of models that are being developed means that the evaluation will need  		to pay close attention to changes in structure and process across the  		individual health homes and any differences in outcomes.</p>
<p>Given that some providers have offered services that are similar to  		health home services for a number of years while other providers will be  		relatively new to the program, it will be necessary to clearly identify and  		describe the structures and processes that are in place at baseline and to  		characterize the changes that providers make to these structures and processes  		as a consequence of becoming health homes. The state and the participating  		Health Homes will likely make adjustments to the program based on feedback from  		providers and periodic internal review, so it will also be necessary to conduct  		regular follow-ups with key stakeholders over the course of the evaluation.  		</p>
<h3>Population Criteria and Provider Infrastructure<sup><a href="#note18-NY">18</a></sup></h3>
<p>New York's Health Home program both builds on existing provider  		relationships and encourages development of new provider partnerships. Eligible  		health home providers include any type of provider that is enrolled in the  		Medicaid program and meets the state's designated Health Home requirements.  		Health homes are empowered to determine the most appropriate composition of the  		Health Home team for the members it will serve, the state only requires that  		the team be "multidisciplinary" and led by a dedicated care manager. Health  		Homes can use teams consisting of medical, mental health and substance abuse  		treatment providers, social workers, nurses, and other care providers. All  		members of the team are responsible for reporting to the care manager and for  		ensuring that care is patient-centered, culturally competent, and  		linguistically appropriate. <a href="#table1-NY">Table 1</a> summarizes the  		population criteria, the designated providers, and the Health Home team  		composition requirements.</p>
<p><i><b>Enrollee Identification and Assignment<sup><a href="#note19-NY">19</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>The identification of eligible health home enrollees is based on a set  		of algorithms and is the same for FFS and managed care enrollees, although the  		process for assigning eligible enrollees to specific Health Homes differs. DOH  		identifies the enrollees eligible for health home services using a proprietary  		clinical risk group (CRG) software and an "intelligent" assignment algorithm  		that predicts for negative events using claims and encounters. The state uses  		an Ambulatory Connectivity Measure to help determine enrollees' Health Home  		assignment priority, with priority given to assigning enrollees with high costs  		and low ambulatory care connections. The state is also exploring ways to  		include information on housing and other social services needs and use.  		Assignment to a particular Health Home is made using a "loyalty" algorithm to  		match beneficiaries with providers based on their existing relationships with  		providers. MCPs may use the same assignment algorithm to assign their members  		to an appropriate Health Home if they so choose, but may also use additional  		information.</p>
<p>Health Home beneficiaries are categorized into mutually exclusive CRGs  		using claims data and, when available, additional data. These CRGs can be used  		to predict the amount and type of health care services that individuals should  		have used in the past and can be expected to use in the future. CRG-based  		attribution modeling is being used for group selection, and CRG-based acuity  		modeling is being used to establish different Health Home payment tiers. The  		state then assigns enrollees to a specific Health Home based on their level of  		clinical risk and their current level of connectivity to an outpatient  		provider. Eligible beneficiaries with a higher level of clinical risk and a  		lower level of connectivity have higher assignment priority. Health Homes may  		also accept members that are referred to them from providers or other sources  		such as local health districts; these are known as community referrals.</p>
<p><a href="#table2-NY">Table 2</a> shows how each of the state Health Home  		Analytical Products is used in enrollee identification and assignment.</p>
<p>For FFS enrollees, the state provides candidate "tracking lists" to  		Health Homes electronically via the Health Commerce System (HCS). Lead Health  		Homes send out welcome letters to these candidates and assign them to  		individual providers for outreach and engagement, with participant data to be  		reported to the lead Health Home. For managed care enrollees, the state  		provides candidate "tracking lists" to the MCPs for their members via the HCS,  		based on the same intelligent assignment algorithm, loyalty model, and risk  		scores as used for FFS members. MCPs are responsible for assigning candidates  		to the lead Health Home that can best serve their needs. The lead Health Homes  		receive these member assignments and again assign candidates to individual  		providers for outreach and engagement. Established case management providers  		(OMH TCM, MATS, HIV/COBRA TCM, and CIDPs) that choose to convert to Health  		Homes will determine the most appropriate assignment for each of their members.  		DOH is designing portals to allow real-time access to beneficiary-level  		data.</p>
<h3>Service Definitions and Provider Standards</h3>
<p>There are six core Health Home services (identified in  		<a href="#table3-NY">Table 3</a>) that must be provided by designated Health  		Home providers. Health Homes must provide at least one of the first five core  		services (use of HIT is excluded for first 18 months as a billable service) per  		month to receive payment. Service "touches" include face-to-face meetings,  		mailings, telephone calls, consultation meeting with family, and referrals.  		Providers must provide written documentation that clearly demonstrates how the  		core service requirements are being met for each patient.</p>
<p>Health Home provider qualification standards were developed to ensure  		that Health Homes adhere to the federal Health Home model and state Medicaid  		standards. Representatives from the DOH Offices of Health Insurance Programs,  		Office of Health Information Technology Transformation (OHITT), the AIDS  		Institute, the OASAS, and OMH participated in the development of these  		standards. Designated Health Homes must be enrolled (or be eligible to be  		enrolled) in the Medicaid program and they must agree to comply with all of the  		Health Home requirements. Providers can either directly provide or subcontract  		for Health Home services but remain responsible for all the Health Home program  		requirements.</p>
<p>Health homes are required to have dedicated care managers to lead care  		management and coordination, and the care managers must be involved in all  		aspects of transitional care management. The Health Home provider standards do  		not require that any other roles be specifically assigned to particular care  		team members.</p>
<p>As described in the SPA, Health Home providers must meet six general  		qualifications: </p>
<ol><li>
<p>They must be enrolled (or be eligible for enrollment) in the New  			 York State Medicaid program and agree to comply with all Medicaid program  			 requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can either provide services directly, or subcontract for their  			 provision, but they remain responsible for all health home program  			 requirements, including services performed by the subcontractor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care coordination and integration of heath care services will be  			 provided by an inter-disciplinary team of providers, under the direction of a  			 care manager who is accountable for ensuring access to services and community  			 supports as defined in the enrollee care plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hospitals that are part of the health home network must have  			 procedures in place for referring eligible individuals who seeks treatment in a  			 hospital emergency department to a designated health home provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must demonstrate their ability to perform the 11 core functions  			 as defined in the CMS State Medicaid Director's Letter of November  			 2010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must meet standards for delivery of six core health home  			 services (see <a href="#table3-NY">Table 3</a>), and they must provide written  			 documentation that clearly demonstrates how the requirements are being  			 met.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In order to guide Health Home providers as they implement the new  		program, DOH has held a series of teleconferences and webinars; several Health  		Homes were also awarded a contract from the Department of Labor and DOH to  		provide workforce retraining for current TCM providers as they transition into  		their new roles as health home providers.<sup><a href="#note20-NY">20</a></sup>  		This training will include both web-based and face-to-face training and will be  		based on curriculum developed by the NYCCP. DOH will also convene a Learning  		Collaborative for Health Home providers, which will allow providers to share  		best practices around health home design and implementation.</p>
<h3>Use of Health Information Technology</h3>
<p>DOH developed standards for HIT use by Health Homes that will be phased  		in over time. Providers must meet the initial standards on becoming a Health  		home; final, more comprehensive standards must be met within 18 months. Under  		the initial standards, qualified Health Homes must have a systematic process to  		follow referrals and services provided, and must have a health record system to  		ensure that protected health information and an individual's plan of care is  		accessible to the Health Home team. Final standards require that Health Homes  		have interoperable HIT systems and policies that allow for the development and  		maintenance of the care plan, that they use a certified EHR that complies with  		the official Statewide Policy Guidance on HIT, that they participate in the  		RHIOs for the purposes of sharing data, and that they employ clinical  		decision-making tools where feasible. (See <a href="#table4-NY">Table 4</a> for  		a full list of the initial and final requirements.)</p>
<p>Health Home providers will be encouraged to use wireless technology as  		available to improve coordination and management of care and patient adherence  		to provider recommendations. In order to support providers in their efforts to  		meet final HIT requirements, New York has made additional funding and learning  		opportunities available to them through the HEAL NY program and upcoming  		Learning Collaborative. OHITT is also working to identify additional  		opportunities for Health Homes to enhance their HIT capacity.<sup><a href="#note1-NY">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Payment Structure and Rates</h3>
<p>Payment is made on a per member per month (PMPM) basis at two levels:  		Outreach and Engagement, and Active Care Management. Members in the outreach  		and engagement group are those who have been assigned to the provider but have  		not yet engaged in active care management. The active care management group  		consists of actual Health Home participants.</p>
<p>Health Homes are reimbursed directly by the state for FFS members and  		through the MCPs for managed care members. MCPs may keep up to 3% of payments  		for administrative services. TCMs, MATs, and CIDPs bill the state directly for  		a limited period of time. All monthly payments will be made through eMedNY (the  		New York State Medicaid program claims processing system).</p>
<p>Health Home providers' payment rates vary based on region and case-mix.  		Rates are calculated and paid at a member-specific level directly by eMedNY.  		The state intends to adjust the rates by member functional status once such  		data is available. Outreach and engagement for Medicaid FFS and managed care  		members will be paid at 80% of the active care management rate. Once a patient  		is fully engaged in the program and receiving active care management services,  		the provider receives full active care management group PMPM rate.</p>
<p><i><b>Rate Information and Determination</b></i></p>
<p>The Health Home care management rates were calculated based on caseload  		variation, case management cost, and patient-specific acuity. Caseload  		variation data was developed based on experience in the TCM programs, CIDPs,  		and other states' demonstrations related to chronic illness management. Case  		management cost analysis is based on financial data reported to DOH from  		existing programs. Patient-specific risk factors were developed using CRG  		software. DOH is currently developing an additional adjustment for functional  		status,</p>
<p>Converting TCMs and CIDPs will bill eMedNY directly for their existing  		caseload at their historical rates. These rates will be phased out over two  		years for TCMs and over one year for CIDPs, at which time only Health Homes and  		MCPs will be reimbursed through eMedNY for Health Home services.</p>
<h3>Quality Improvement Goals and Measures</h3>
<p>The state has identified five quality improvement goals:</p>
<ul><li>reducing utilization associated with avoidable inpatient stays,</li>
<li>reducing utilization associated with avoidable emergency room (ER)  		  visits,</li>
<li>improving outcomes for persons with mental illness and/or substance  		  use disorders,</li>
<li>improving disease-related care for chronic conditions, and</li>
<li>improving preventative care.  </li>
</ul><p><a href="#table5-NY">Table 5</a> lists each goal with its corresponding  		measures. Most of the measures are based on HEDIS specifications; two are  		measures proposed in the Affordable Care Act,<sup><a href="#note21-NY">21</a></sup> and two are specific to New York. Data for these  		measures are to be drawn entirely from administrative and pharmacy claims.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Measures and Methods</h3>
<p>Care management metrics are divided into process metrics and outcome  		(quality) metrics. The state's goal is to have a uniform platform and a  		standard set of process metrics in place by fall 2012. Outcome metrics will be  		taken from Medicaid records--enrollment, claims, encounter, and pharmacy  		data--as well as other state databases that record provisions of substance  		abuse treatment services. The selected outcome metrics are described in full in  		<a href="#table6-NY">Table 6</a>.</p>
<p>The state will work with CMS to develop a patient experience survey that  		draws from both the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems  		survey, and behavioral health-specific items from the Mental Health Statistics  		Improvement Program. It will work with academic partners to supplement these  		databases with additional data.</p>
<p>The state proposes a variety of approaches to measuring the impact of  		Health Homes on selected quality and cost outcomes (hospital admission rates,  		chronic disease management, assessment of quality improvements and clinical  		outcomes, and estimates of cost savings). It will analyze historical  		utilization and cost data, employ statistical matching, and explore the  		possibility of using propensity score methods by region to identify comparison  		groups of people with similar demographic, geographic, and medical  		characteristics as Health Home enrollees. It expects that the phased nature of  		enrollment will allow identification of variations in outcome measures between  		enrollees and the eligible but not yet enrolled beneficiaries. Finally, it may  		look at the differences in outcomes across the designated health homes,  		adjusting for differences in client characteristics. The state will be working  		with local academic partners in completing these analyses.</p>

</tr><tr><td scope="row">Hospital admission rates</td>
<td>New York State has been monitoring  			 avoidable hospital readmissions for Medicaid populations since 2009 using 3M  			 software called PPRs. This software has an algorithm for determining whether a  			 readmission is plausibly connected to an initial admission. New York State will  			 calculate PPRs within 30 days of an initial inpatient discharge. New York State  			 will calculate the rate across all conditions and also within condition (i.e.,  			 mental health condition, substance use disorder, asthma, diabetes, heart  			 disease, HIV/AIDS, and hypertension). As indicated, New York State will  			 calculate historical avoidable readmission rates for statistically matched  			 comparison group. New York State will also compare avoidable readmission rates  			 across Health Home providers.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Chronic disease  			 management</td>
<td>Data on chronic disease management will  			 be collected in two ways. First, New York State will examine how the Health  			 Homes implement disease management across key chronic illness management  			 functional components of state Health Home qualification criteria. With the aid  			 of state and academic partners, New York State will work with stakeholders to  			 assess the key functional components to include: (1) inclusion of preventive  			 and health promotion services; (2) coordination of care between primary care,  			 specialty providers and community supports; (3) emphasis on collaborative  			 patient decision-making and teaching of disease self-management; (4)  			 structuring of care to ensure ongoing monitoring and follow-up care; (5)  			 facilitation of evidence-based practice; and (6) use of clinical information  			 systems to facilitate tracking of care as well as integration between  			 providers. New York State will modify standardized assessment tools, as well as  			 use qualitative interviews with Health Home administrative staff and providers  			 to determine the implementation of these functional components. Additionally,  			 the patient Experience of Care measure will provide information on  			 self-management support from the health home. Second, New York State will  			 conduct cohort analyses as part of the evaluation focusing on groups at-risk to  			 incur high costs.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Coordination of care</td>
<td>New York State will use claims,  			 encounter, and pharmacy data to collect information on coordination of care. As  			 indicated in the quality measures section of this SPA, New York State will use  			 claims, encounter, and pharmacy data to collect information on post-inpatient  			 discharge continuation of care (e.g., persistent beta-blocker treatment after  			 hospitalization for AMI) or transition to another level of care (e.g.,  			 outpatient care following hospitalization for a behavioral health condition).  			 This coordination of care measures will be compared to historical controls, to  			 statistically matched comparison groups, and across Health Home providers. In  			 addition New York State is considering the feasibility of more closely  			 examining provider behavior through medical chart reviews, case record audits,  			 team composition analysis, and key informant interviews. As part of this  			 process, New York State will carefully monitor the use of HIT as a primary  			 modality to support coordination of care.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Assessment of program  			 implementation</td>
<td>As indicated above, Learning  			 Collaboratives will be constituted with a group of providers of Health Homes to  			 identify implementation challenges, as well as potential solutions. Other data  			 related to implementation including responses to the Health Home experiences of  			 care survey and, if feasible, provider audits and surveys, and stakeholder  			 interviews will be collected. All implementation data will be shared with the  			 Health Home Advisory Group (comprised of state, provider, community, and  			 academic members) and a compilation of lessons learned.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Processes and lessons  			 learned</td>
<td>Learning Collaboratives will be  			 constituted with a group of early adopter providers of Health Homes to identify  			 implementation challenges as well as potential solutions. New York State will  			 use the Health Home Advisory Group to monitor, comment, and make  			 recommendations on implementation strategies that are working as well as those  			 that are not. The group will use the Health Home functional components as well  			 as the provider qualification criteria as guides in assessing program processes  			 and outcome success. The Advisory Group will use information gathered through  			 assessments of program implementation as well as from ongoing quality  			 monitoring using administrative data to review program successes and  			 failures.</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Assessment of quality  			 improvements and clinical outcomes</td>
<td>New York State has identified an  			 extensive list of quality and outcome measures that will be derived from  			 administrative claims and encounter data. The quality measures are indicators  			 of chronic illness management while the clinical outcome measures are  			 indicators of poor disease management leading to high-cost treatment episodes.  			 Ongoing assessments of these quality measures will be conducted at the levels  			 of Health Home providers, region, and statewide. The endpoint evaluation will  			 be designed as a quasi-experimental longitudinal study where endpoint outcomes  			 will be patient-level indicators of poorly managed care of chronic conditions;  			 indicators of stable engagement in guideline concordant care; and high-cost  			 utilization of services. There are a number of clear indicators of poorly  			 managed care across disorders: emergency department visits, hospital  			 readmissions, poor transition from inpatient to outpatient care, etc. In  			 addition, New York State will attempt to define, where possible, more refined  			 measures that are disease-specific (e.g., repeated detox in substance  			 abuse).</td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">Estimates of cost  			 savings</td>
<td>New York State will work with state and  			 academic partners to devise a sophisticated econometric analysis of the overall  			 Health Home initiative as well as of each vendor. First, New York State will  			 monitor costs savings through by tracking high-cost forms of utilization (e.g.,  			 preventable hospitalizations, emergency department use, and detoxification).  			 Utilization of high-cost events will be compared with historical rates, as well  			 as with statistically matched comparison groups as indicated  			 above.Additionally, New York State will compare total costs of care for  			 Health Home enrollees--including all services costs, health home costs and  			 managed capitation--to statistically matched comparisons. The econometric  			 analyses will begin with descriptive statistics and increase in complexity to  			 the minimal level necessary to address the question of cost savings. Analyses  			 will focus on PMPM expenditures of enrollees compared to controls as described  			 in this section's preamble. For regression analyses that examine changes in  			 cost relative to controls, New York State employs longitudinal nested designs  			 that account for serial correlation within person and within provider and  			 region. Regression analyses will account for prior year costs by type of  			 utilization (e.g., emergency department, inpatient, mental health), clinical  			 complexity (e.g., PPR risk score), regional utilization characteristics, and  			 demographic factors. Parameter estimates for Health Home participants will  			 indicate differences in PMPM relative to controls while controlling for  			 historical utilization patterns, regional practice variation, and individual  			 demographic characteristics.</td>

<h4>This paper also available at:  				<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/HHOption-OR.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/HHOption-OR.pdf</a></h4>
</div>
<p>Oregon's Medicaid State Plan Amendment (SPA) instituting a Section 2703  		Health Home benefit was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS) on March 13, 2012, with a retroactive effective date of October  		1, 2011.<sup><a href="#note1-OR">1</a></sup> Oregon's Health Home program  		builds on the state's Patient-Centered Primary Care Home (PCPCH) program,  		established in 2009.<sup><a href="#note2-OR">2</a></sup> To be eligible for  		Health Home services, enrollees must have a serious mental health condition,  		two or more chronic conditions, or one chronic condition and be at risk of  		developing another. The state specified 11 chronic illnesses and nine serious  		mental health conditions in the list of Health Home qualifying conditions. It  		based its definition of "at-risk" on guidelines from the United States  		Preventive Services Task Force, the Health Resources and Services  		Administration Women's Preventive Services, and Bright Futures. (See  		<a href="#table1-OR">Table 1</a> for a full list of qualifying conditions.)</p>
<p>The Health Homes program represents just one component of a larger state  		effort to transform how medical care is delivered in Oregon. Health Home  		services, which are aligned with the state's PCPCH Standards, are to be  		delivered through qualified PCPCHs and are available to a PCPCHs entire patient  		population. However, the state will provide a supplemental per member per month  		(PMPM) payment only for those clients identified by the provider as meeting the  		Health Home eligibility criteria. The state is also working toward providing  		supplemental payments to PCPCHs for other populations including all Medicaid  		enrollees, government employees, and state education personnel. The state's  		goal is to make PCPCH services available to 75% of all Oregonians by  		2015.<sup><a href="#note3-OR">3</a></sup> Anyrecognized PCPCH can apply to  		become a Health Home through submission of an addendum to its PCPCH agreement  		with the state, as described below.</p>
<p>PCPCHs (inclusive of their Health Home services) are also a central  		component of Oregon's health system transformation efforts, particularly  		through their role in Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs, described in more  		detail below). The CCO program was proposed by the Legislature June 2011, and  		the first CCOs began operations in August 2012. A CCO is a community-based  		network of health care providers who have agreed to collaborate in the  		provision of services for people with Medicaid and/or Medicare coverage. CCOs  		receive a fixed global payment for mental and physical health care services  		and, in return, are accountable for the health outcomes of the population they  		serve.<sup><a href="#note4-OR">4</a></sup> These CCO payments are separate from  		the Health Home payments, which go to the PCPCHs. The state also plans to  		integrate oral health care services in the future. The state's hope is that  		these integrated health care organizations will provide more efficient delivery  		of and better access to care, strengthen primary care networks while  		integrating services, and better align incentives to generate substantial  		savings. CCOs are required to include recognized PCPCHs in their networks of  		care to the extent possible and to support their member practices in achieving  		PCPCH recognition.<sup><a href="#note4-OR">4</a></sup> The emphasis on  		coordinated care, integration of physical and mental health care services, and  		community linkages is consistent with Health Home goals but, under the state's  		PCPCH program, they are applied to a broader population.</p>
<p>Oregon's Health Home benefit is managed through the Oregon Health  		Authority (OHA), which was established in 2009 and is charged with purchasing  		health insurance for approximately 850,000 Medicaid enrollees, government  		employees, and state education personnel (representing about one in four people  		in Oregon).<sup><a href="#note4-OR">4</a></sup> Oregon has approximately  		645,000 people enrolled in its Medicaid program [known as the Oregon Health  		Plan (OHP)], which it has operated under a Medicaid Section 1115 waiver  		(described below) since 1993.<sup><a href="#note4-OR">4</a>,  		<a href="#note5-OR">5</a></sup> The state managed care program covers  		approximately 80% of OHP beneficiaries. Prior to August 2012 and the formation  		of CCOs, acute and ambulatory physical health care services were provided by  		managed care organizations (MCOs), while mental health, chemical dependency,  		and dental services were carved out and paid for on a capitated basis.<sup><a href="#note4-OR">4</a></sup> Oregon does not have large, national health plans  		participating in its Medicaid program; most of the MCOs and CCOs are local,  		community-based nonprofits that serve only publicly insured enrollees; many are  		physician-owned and run. In some sparsely populated areas, the state contracts  		directly with providers for primary care case management.</p>
<h3>Implementation Context</h3>
<p>Oregon has several initiatives underway that have goals that are similar  		to those of the Health Home benefit or involve the same type of provider. Some  		of the initiatives have been developed by the state, while others are part of  		national demonstration projects. These initiatives are seen as complementary  		and as part of a broad evolution towards a more integrated system of care in  		the state.</p>
<p>In 2009, the state legislature passed two Bills (HB 2009 and HB 2116)  		that included provisions to provide health insurance coverage for all children  		and bring more low-income adults into Medicaid. The HB 2009 legislation also  		created the OHA and the Oregon Health Policy Board and established the PCPCH  		Program within the Office for Oregon Health Policy and Research.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup></p>
<p>As the state began to implement the PCPCH program, many stakeholders  		felt that the 2008 National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) medical home  		standards for care coordination did not include a strong enough emphasis on  		health outcomes and accountability, and so encouraged the state to develop its  		own. In response, the state convened the Patient-Centered Primary Care Home  		Standards Advisory Committee and charged it with developing the framework of  		core attributes, standards, and measures that would be used to define a  		PCPCH.<sup><a href="#note7-OR">7</a></sup> These standards were released in  		2010. (See <a href="#appendixB-OR">Appendix B</a> for a list of PCPCH  		attributes and standards.)</p>
<p>During the 2011 legislative session, the state authorized the creation  		of the Oregon Integrated and Coordinated Health Care Delivery System, which  		aimed to move the Medicaid managed care system towards an integrated care  		management model, and passed legislation to establish CCOs.<sup><a href="#note4-OR">4</a></sup> As noted above, CCOs are community-based networks  		that are to contract with the state to provide integrated, comprehensive health  		care, mental health care, and eventually dental care for a defined patient  		population. CCOs focus on patients with chronic conditions as well as on people  		with addiction problems and mental illnesses who have traditionally received  		care through the OHA's Addictions and Mental Health Division.<sup><a href="#note8-OR">8</a></sup> CCOs have flexibility within their budgets to  		provide services alongside traditional OHP medical benefits with the goal of  		meeting the "Triple Aim" of better health, better care, and lower costs for the  		population they serve, but they are required to include PCPCHs within their  		networks to the extent possible.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup> By making  		CCOs responsible for the full array of services and paying a fixed global  		payment, the state hopes these coordinated networks will improve quality  		outcomes and be more cost-efficient. The state plans a staggered rollout of  		CCOs; the first wave of eight CCOs launched August 1, 2012, with more expected  		to start later this year. The state expects CCOs to serve nearly 500,000  		Oregonians by September 1, 2012, including virtually all Medicaid  		enrollees.<sup><a href="#note2-OR">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Oregon was also one of 15 states that received a grant from CMS to  		develop a pilot program to better "coordinate care across primary, acute,  		behavioral health and long-term supports and services for dual eligible  		individuals."<sup><a href="#note2-OR">2</a></sup> Under the state  		demonstrations to Integrate Care for Dual Eligible Individuals program, CMS has  		provided funding and technical assistance to the selected states to develop  		enhanced patient-centered methods to coordinate the entire continuum of care  		for dual eligible individuals and to identify delivery system and payment  		models that can be replicated in other states.<sup><a href="#notea-OR">a</a></sup></p>
<p>As part of the state's efforts to align payment methods to support its  		primary care home model, Oregon is participating in the CMS Comprehensive  		Primary Care Initiative, which will begin in fall 2012. In this multi-payer  		initiative, Medicare will collaborate with public and private insurers in the  		selected regions with the goal of strengthening primary care. Participating  		practices will receive a PMPM care management fee and be given technical  		assistance to help them better coordinate and manage care. After two years,  		providers will also have the opportunity to participate in a shared savings  		model.<sup><a href="#note9-OR">9</a></sup> In Oregon, six health insurance  		plans and 70 practices were selected to participate.<sup><a href="#note10-OR">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Oregon is also participating in the Tri-State Child Health Improvement  		Consortium (T-CHIC), a Child Health Insurance Program Reconciliation Act  		(CHIPRA) Quality Demonstration Project funded by CMS. T-CHIC is an alliance  		among the Medicaid/CHIP programs of Alaska, Oregon, and West Virginia, led by  		Oregon, with the goal of improving children's health care quality. In February  		2010, the consortium was awarded approximately $11.5 million over a five-year  		period ($2.2 million was awarded in the first year). The overarching goal of  		the CHIPRA quality demonstration is to establish and evaluate a national  		quality system for children's health care.<sup><a href="#note11-OR">11</a></sup> In Oregon, this demonstration is linked to two  		additional pediatric medical home practice improvement projects through the  		Oregon Pediatric Improvement Partnership, which aims to improve children's care  		through a range of collaborative and educational activities.<sup><a href="#note12-OR">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Many practices in Oregon have been or are in the process of being  		recognized as a Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs) by the NCQA.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup>  		Whilethe two models share many common concepts, there are a few areas that are  		not fully aligned. PCMH practices attempting to gain recognition as PCPCHs must  		contractually attest to being NCQA-certified but must also submit additional  		information, centered on the contractual attestation of screening strategies  		for mental health and substance abuse conditions, hospice and palliative care,  		and quality measurement and patient tracking.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup></p>
<h3>Implications for Oregon Section 2703 Medicaid Health  		Home Evaluation</h3>
<p>These various initiatives have several implications for both  		implementation and evaluation of the health homes program. The state has  		envisioned health homes as an integral part of its effort to transform the  		primary care delivery system across the state for all payors. Other initiatives  		are key to this overall transformation as well, particularly the development of  		CCOs and the contractually required encouragement of PCPCHs by the CCOs. The  		providers of health home services are not designated as "health homes" but  		rather health home enrollees are identified within the PCPCHs by their receipt  		of health home services once they meet the qualifying criteria. The state  		intends for the changes that providers make to care delivery for health home  		beneficiaries to permeate the PCPCH practice for all patients, but the enhanced  		payments for health home services currently apply only to identified eligibles.  		The state's plan is to institute a care coordination payment for other  		beneficiaries in the future but at a much lower level.</p>
<p>In many practices that have become PCPCHs and are thus eligible to serve  		health home beneficiaries, practice transformation began before the  		implementation of the health homes initiative, and providers are charged with  		identifying health home services recipients. Thus, it will be difficult--and  		may be impossible--to disentangle a Health Home effect from the effect of  		ongoing transformation.</p>
<h3>Population Criteria and Provider Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Oregon is offering Health Home services to categorically needy  		beneficiaries<sup><a href="#noteb-OR">b</a></sup> who have two or more chronic  		conditions, one chronic condition and are at risk of contracting another, and  		those with a serious mental illness.<sup><a href="#note1-OR">1</a></sup>  		(Oregon uses the term "ACA-qualified" for beneficiaries meeting the condition  		criteria for Health Home eligibility.) Both fee-for-service (FFS) and managed  		care enrollees are eligible for these services. <a href="#table1-OR">Table  		1</a> below provides a full list of the population criteria, the designated  		providers, and the Health Home team composition requirements.</p>
<p>Health Homes are based on the state's PCPCH model, described in further  		detail below; thus, PCPCH standards are Health Home standards and the two  		designations will be used interchangeably with respect to providers. Payment  		for Health Home services, however, is limited to the health home eligible  		population and this distinction will be maintained. Any designated PCPCH is  		eligible for a Health Home payment if specific service and documentation  		requirements are met for each patient.<sup><a href="#note7-OR">7</a></sup>  		These requirements include: (1) providing at least one Core Service each  		quarter (described in <a href="#table2-OR">Table 2</a>); (2) performing panel  		management at least once per quarter, using data for all clients or for  		sub-groups of clients for such functions as care management or quality  		assurance; (3) performing patient engagement and education and obtaining  		patient agreement; and (4) developing a person-centered health plan.</p>
<p>PCPCH/Health Homes include, but are not limited to, physical and  		behavioral health care providers, solo practitioners, family and group  		practices, community mental health centers, drug and alcohol treatment  		facilities, rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, and  		school-based health centers.<sup><a href="#note1-OR">1</a></sup> A PCPCH/Health  		Home is not required to provide all of the health home services on-site, but it  		is responsible for coordinating and/or offering those services through  		partnerships within their community.</p>
<p>All PCPCH-recognized providers wishing to participate in Medicaid and  		provide health home services must submit an addendum to their Medicaid provider  		enrollment agreement to the OHA's Division of Medical Assistance Programs  		(DMAP).<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup> This is true for providers serving  		both FFS and MCO/CCO-enrolled members. PCPCH providers serving MCO/CCO-enrolled  		members will also have a contract with the MCO/CCO, and the payment arrangement  		will be negotiated between the MCO/CCO and the provider.<sup><a href="#note13-OR">13</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Member Identification and Assignment</b></i></p>
<p>Health home eligible beneficiaries will be identified through a referral  		process managed by DMAP. The process begins with providers, who draw up a list  		of the patients they believe are eligible from among their FFS and MCO/CCO  		clients. They then submit the list of FFS patients directly to DMAP and the  		list of MCO/CCO-enrolled patients to the appropriate MCO/CCO, which will in  		turn submit the list to DMAP.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup> DMAP then  		screens these patients for eligibility and sends a report to each recognized  		provider or health care entity identifying which of their patients were  		successfully assigned to their Health Home. This list must be updated and  		submitted quarterly. DMAP is working with CMS to determine how best to  		coordinate sending a letter to the qualified Health Home patients notifying  		them that their provider is now their primary care Health Home. Enrollees will  		be informed that they may opt out of Health Home coverage or may select a  		different provider. </p>
<h3>Service Definitions and Provider Standards</h3>
<p>There are six Core Health Home Services, at least one of which must be  		provided once per quarter for each patient on a provider's list. (See  		<a href="#table2-OR">Table 2</a> for the service definitions found in the SPA.)  		These services do not require an office visit and can be performed by any  		member of the health care team. Health Home services do not require or replace  		treatment or medical services, and they cannot include services for which a  		provider is already billing. The provider attests to providing one of these six  		core services through submitting the quarterly list of health home eligible  		enrollees, and must document the services provided in each patient's medical  		record.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Core Attributes and corresponding Standards for Patient-Centered  		Primary Care Homes</b></i></p>
<p>Oregon is basing their provider qualifications on the six attributes of  		the state's pre-existing PCPCH model, which are cross-walked in the SPA with  		the core Health Home functions outlined by CMS in the State Medicaid Director's  		letter of November 2010.<sup><a href="#note14-OR">14</a></sup> These six core  		PCPCH attributes (Access to Care, Accountability, Comprehensive Whole-Person  		Care, Continuity, Coordination and Integration, Person- and Family-Centered  		Care) each have corresponding standards and measures, divided into "Must-Pass  		Measures" and "Tiers 1-3". These are described in greater detail below.</p>
<p><i><b>PCPCH Measures and Tiers</b></i></p>
<p>To practice and be recognized as a PCPCH, a provider must demonstrate  		the ability to meet the guideline PCPCH measures that correspond to each  		standard. PCPCH measures are divided into ten "Must-Pass" measures and a range  		of other measures that place the PCPCH practice in one of three Tiers.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup> Must-Pass and Tier 1 measures focus on the basic  		foundational structures and processes of a PCPCH. Foundational elements should  		be achievable by most practices, and are not considered to require significant  		financial expenses. Tier 2 measures reflect intermediate PCPCH functions,  		demonstrating performance, structural, and process improvements. Tier 3  		reflects advanced PCPCH functions, in which the provider demonstrates mature  		performance improvement capacity, and is accountable for quality. [See  		<a href="#appendixB-OR">Appendix B</a> for a full list of attributes,  		standards, and measures.]</p>
<p>Except for the ten Must-Pass measures, each measure is assigned a point  		value corresponding to a tier. Tier 1 measures are worth 5 points, Tier 2  		measures are worth 10 points, and Tier 3 measures are worth 15 points. For a  		practice to be recognized as a PCPCH, it must meet all of the ten Must-Pass  		measures. Practices must score 30-60 points to qualify as Tier 1, 65-125 for  		Tier 2, and 130 or more for Tier 3.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Practices demonstrate their current level of practice by contractually  		attesting to meeting certain of the standards and by submitting data on others.  		Contractual attestation is contained in the agreement negotiated between a  		practice and any payer the practice contracts with and is also submitted to the  		state through a web-based process described in further detail below.  		(Contractual attestation measures are marked with a "C" in  		<a href="#appendixB-OR">Appendix B</a>.) No other documentation on these  		measures is required at the time of application, but practices are subject to  		random audit by the OHA, and all contractual attestation measures must be  		reported annually for a practice to maintain its PCPCH status.</p>
<p>Six of the PCPCH measures require quantitative data submission (marked  		with a "D" in <a href="#appendixB-OR">Appendix B</a>).<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup> These measures will be used by the state to track  		PCPCH progress and will also be reported to the PCPCHs to help them identify  		trends in care and identify areas for quality improvement. Recognized PCPCH  		providers must also submit patient experience of care survey data. Tier 2 and 3  		providers are required to use the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers  		and Systems (CAHPS) survey tools for this purpose.<sup><a href="#note6-OR">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The OHA has developed a web-based provider portal system where practices  		can submit all required data to the state. (See health information technology  		(HIT) section below for more details.) Based on the point system, the OHA will  		score PCPCHs by combining the contractual attestation information with the  		quantitative data received. Practices and various plans, insurance carriers,  		and/or other entities will then be notified of their score.</p>
<h3>Use of Health Information Technology</h3>
<p>Health Home providers will be encouraged to develop or use their current  		HIT capacity to perform a range of functions, including:</p>
<ul><li>gather and report data and group it by subset;</li>
<li>create and maintain electronic health records (EHRs);</li>
<li>share clinical information with clients and other providers;</li>
<li>link to, manage, and track health promotion activities and referrals  		  to community-based or social services; and</li>
<li>communicate with other providers, family members, and local supports.  </li>
</ul><p>Oregon links certain of its provider measures to HIT capacity. For  		example, although implementation of an electronic medical record (EMR) is not  		required, those who have an EMR are able to earn additional points towards  		their qualification as a Tier 3 PCPCH. The state has indicated that they will  		encourage providers to implement an EMR that contains at a minimum a problem  		list, medication list, allergies, basic demographic information, preferred  		language, BMI/BMI percentile chart, and immunization record. Another of the  		measures for Tier 3 qualification is the ability of a PCPCH to share clinical  		information electronically in real-time with other providers and care  		entities.</p>
<p>As noted above, OHA also maintains a provider portal and patient panel  		management system. This system is run by a contractor, Quality Corporation. Use  		of this system is required as part of the provider's demonstration of  		"comprehensive care management", but it also allows the provider to review data  		on services they have provided to their patient panel, and identify any  		gaps.</p>
<h3>Payment Structure and Rates</h3>
<p>Payment for Health Home services is made on a PMPM basis that varies by  		the provider's qualification level: Tier 1 - $10 PMPM; Tier 2 - $15 PMPM; and  		Tier 3 - $24 PMPM.<sup><a href="#note1-OR">1</a></sup> For FFS patients, DMAP  		makes payments directly to PCPCH/Health Home providers; for MCO/CCO-enrolled  		members, DMAP makes payments to the MCO/CCO, which then make payments to the  		Health Home. Any portion of the payment that is retained by the MCO/CCO must be  		used to carry out Health Home-related functions and is subject to approval and  		oversight by the OHA.<sup><a href="#note15-OR">15</a></sup> Providers are  		eligible for the PMPM payment if the service and documentation requirements are  		met for each patient. Submission of the quarterly patient list serves as  		attestation of meeting the quarterly health home service requirements.</p>
<p>The Health Home must engage in panel management activities at least once  		quarterly. One team member from each Health Home provider practice must log on  		to the OHA's provider portal, which can be used as a panel management tool and  		for tracking quality measures. A Health Home has six months to engage and  		obtain consent from each eligible patient assigned to their care.<sup><a href="#note15-OR">15</a></sup> Educationabout PCPCH/Health Home services and  		benefits can be done in-person, by phone, or by mailing a letter or brochure.  		(OHA will provide patient brochures to all PCPCH/Health Home providers.)  		Engagement and member agreement to participate must be active but does not  		require a patient visit; if a patient declines to participate or the Health  		Home is unable to get agreement after six months of attempts, the provider  		should notify DMAP and omit that patient from future patient list  		submissions.<sup><a href="#note15-OR">15</a></sup></p>
<h3>Quality Improvement Goals and Measures</h3>
<p>The state has identified five quality improvement goals, each with  		defined clinical outcome and quality of care measures: </p>
<ul><li>reducing the rate of potentially avoidable hospital  		  readmissions;</li>
<li>decreasing potentially avoidable hospitalizations and increase the  		  ratio of ambulatory care to emergency room (ER) visits;</li>
<li>improving transitions of care between PCPs and inpatient  		  facilities;</li>
<li>improving care transitions for people with mental health conditions;  		  and</li>
<li>improving documentations, tracking, and reporting of health risks and  		  use of preventive services.  </li>
</ul><p>The state has also identified two service-based measures, both tied to  		comprehensive care management. <a href="#table3-OR">Table 3</a> below lists  		each goal with its corresponding measures. Data for these measures will be  		drawn mostly from administrative data, CAHPS survey data, claims data, and  		EMRs.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Measures and Methods</h3>
<p>The state will rely primarily on administrative data, Medicaid  		management information system (MMIS), provider-reported measures, and patient  		survey results in their evaluation of the Health Home program. A Learning  		Collaborative composed of providers and patients will also provide information  		on program implementation, processes, and lessons learned. For most Health Home  		measures, beneficiaries who have been enrolled for at least one year will be  		compared with beneficiaries not enrolled in a Health Home. It is not clear how  		comparison groups will be identified. <a href="#table4-OR">Table 4</a> below  		excerpts the information provided in the SPA.</p>

<h4>This paper also available at:  				<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/HHOption-RI.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/HHOption-RI.pdf</a></h4>
</div>
<p>Rhode Island has two approved State Plan Amendments (SPAs); one for  		persons with serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI), and one for persons  		with SPMI and/or other disabling or chronic physical or developmental  		conditions (this latter group is <i>de facto</i> limited to children and youth  		by virtue of the providers designated in the SPA). Both SPAs were approved on  		November 23, 2011, and have a retroactive effective date of October 1, 2011.  		Health Home services under the first SPA will be provided by seven community  		mental health organizations (CMHOs)--which provide behavioral health services  		to persons with SPMI, and predominantly serve Medicaid, Medicare, the dually  		eligible, and the uninsured--and two specialty providers of mental health  		services, Fellowship Health Resources, Inc., and Riverwood Mental Health  		Services.<sup><a href="#note1-RI">1</a></sup> The Department of Behavioral  		Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) oversees CMHOs and  		the specialty providers. Children and youth will receive services through  		specialized providers known as CEDARR Family Centers (CEDARR stands for  		Comprehensive Evaluation, Diagnosis, Assessment, Referral, Re-evaluation). To  		be eligible for care at CEDARR centers, an individual must be eligible for  		Medical Assistance, under age 21, a Rhode Island resident, live at home, and  		have a disabling or chronic condition that is cognitive, physical,  		developmental and/or psychiatric.<sup><a href="#note2-RI">2</a></sup> The  		Department of Human Services oversees the four CEDARR centers.</p>
<h3>Implementation Context</h3>
<p>Rhode Island's two SPAs were developed in the context of several ongoing  		initiatives aimed at reforming the health system so as to increase care  		management, develop the medical home model, and integrate care for those who  		are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, with particular focus on  		high-cost, high-need populations. The state has characterized the health homes  		model as an opportunity to improve an existing system of care, develop new  		payment methodologies to accommodate activities such as community-based care  		coordination, and provide a consistent system of care for children with special  		health care needs as they transition to adulthood.<sup><a href="#note3-RI">3</a></sup> An important aspect of Rhode Island's reform is  		the five-year Global Consumer Choice Compact Waiver approved by the Centers for  		Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in early 2009, under which Rhode Island  		operates its entire Medicaid program. Among other things, the waiver has  		allowed the state to mandate enrollment in either capitated or fee-for-service  		(FFS) managed care. The state also is participating in the Multipayer Advanced  		Primary Care Practice Demonstration, through which CMS provides a monthly care  		management fee for Medicare enrollees in advanced primary care  		practices.<sup><a href="#note4-RI">4</a></sup> In addition, the state recently  		has received a Money Follows the Person grant to support efforts to help  		institutional residents return to health and supportive care in community  		settings and is working with CMS to implement models for integrating Medicare  		and Medicaid services and financing for persons dually eligible for the two  		programs in capitated or FFS managed care.<sup><a href="#note5-RI">5</a></sup>  		As part of the integration plan, the state is considering creating a Community  		Health Care Team to focus on long-term services and supports for FFS  		participants and incorporating managed long-term services and supports into the  		service package for managed care participants.</p>
<p>CEDARR Family Centers were selected as Health Home providers based on  		their experience managing care for children and youth with special health care  		needs. The centers, established in 2000, currently coordinate care for roughly  		2,700 children and youth at any given time. These centers are responsible for  		assessment of need, referral to resources, and the integration of services  		provided through different systems (education, Medicaid FFS, Medicaid Managed  		Care, child welfare), oversight of Medicaid FFS specialized Home and  		Community-Based Services, and reassessment and adjustment of treatment plans on  		an annual basis. CEDARR centers also provide direct services, such as  		home-based therapeutic services, personal assistance services and supports,  		KidsConnect therapeutic day care, and respite services.About 95% of CEDARR  		clients meet health home diagnostic criteria.<sup><a href="#note3-RI">3</a></sup></p>
<p>CMHOs, which were established in 1964 and served about 20,000 persons in  		2010, also have experience with care integration. Two of the seven CMHOs  		designated as Health Home providers received Substance Abuse and Mental Health  		Services Administration (SAMHSA) primary care/behavioral health integration  		grants in September 2010.<sup><a href="#note6-RI">6</a></sup> Health Homes will  		build on this existing infrastructure, which includes community hospital  		contracts with CMHOs to conduct emergency psychiatric assessments in emergency  		rooms (ERs), and long-term relationships between some CMHOs and local Federally  		Qualified Health Centers and primary care practices (e.g., co-location and  		formal integrated care agreements). CMHO services also include 24-hour crisis  		intervention and stabilization, medication prescription and management,  		bio-psychosocial assessment, psychotherapy, counseling, psychiatric evaluation,  		community psychiatric support and treatment (CPST) specific to substance abuse  		and supported employment, rehabilitative residence, substance abuse treatment,  		supported housing/residential services, and two levels of intensive  		community-based treatment.<sup><a href="#note7-RI">7</a></sup> Basic mental  		health and substance abuse services are provided through managed care  		organizations (MCOs) for those enrolled; more extensive services for enrollees  		with SPMI are available on a FFS basis.<sup><a href="#note8-RI">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Rhode Island has multiple programs intended to better coordinate and  		manage care for high-risk populations, including those with disabilities. Under  		its Section 1115 Global Consumer Choice Compact Waiver, the state has not only  		continued its efforts to increase access to community-based supports and  		services and reduce institutional care--a process which was begun in 2006 under  		a Real Choice Systems Transformation Grant--but has also expanded the scope of  		its health system reform.<sup><a href="#note9-RI">9</a></sup> As of fall 2009,  		Rhode Island adults age 21 and older who qualify for Medical Assistance must  		enroll in either Connect Care Choice (CCC), a FFS-based primary care case  		management (PCCM) program, or a capitated Medicaid MCO through Rhody Health  		Partners (RHP), both of which were initiated in 2007.<sup><a href="#note10-RI">10</a></sup> Children with special health care needs living  		outside of institutional settings (which include the target population for the  		CEDARR-based health home program) must enroll in a RIte Care managed care plan  		(MCP).<sup><a href="#note11-RI">11</a></sup> UnitedHealthcare of New England  		and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island are the two participating plans  		for both RIte Care and RHP. In late 2008, the state launched a pilot program  		known as the Chronic Care Sustainability Initiative (CSI) which is a PCCM  		program focused on patients who suffer from diabetes, depression, and/or  		coronary heart disease. In 2011, the program was accepted for participation in  		the three-year CMS Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration.<sup><a href="#note12-RI">12</a></sup> These programs are described in greater detail  		in the table found in the <a href="#appendix-RI">Appendix</a>.</p>
<h3>Implications for Rhode Island Section 2703 Medicaid  		Health Homes Evaluation</h3>
<p>The initiatives described above demonstrate that the state has made  		significant efforts toward expanding care coordination and management in its  		health system and integrating health services with community support services  		and in planning additional expansions and models. The health homes initiative  		provides a vehicle for further system development for two particularly  		high-need subsets of the Medicaid population. Under the state's Section 1115  		Global Waiver both children with special health care needs and adults with  		disabilities have been required to enroll in managed care for their physical  		health care--RIte Care MCPs in the case of children and CCC or RHP in the case  		of adults. Although both CEDARR Family Centers and the SPMI providers have  		experience with various aspects of health home structures, there appear to be  		significant differences in the level of development between the CEDARR and SPMI  		providers and among the designated SPMI providers, and the two SPAs differ  		significantly in terms of service definition, level of training required,  		payment structure, and evaluation measures. The range of additional  		demonstrations and plans for care integration the state is undertaking may have  		implications for the availability of comparison groups for the evaluation,  		particularly for adults in the CMHO-HHs. On the one hand, state materials  		relating to these integration efforts suggest that there are adults with SPMI  		outside of CMHOs who may be appropriate as comparisons. On the other hand, the  		progress of these additional care integration efforts may affect the validity  		of comparisons over time and will need to be monitored over the evaluation  		period.</p>
<p>Health home-type services have been provided by CEDARR centers for a  		number of years. Therefore, it will be particularly important to clearly  		identify and describe the structures and processes that are in place at  		baseline, and to characterize the changes that providers make to these  		structures and processes as a consequence of becoming health homes. It will  		also be necessary to adjust the analysis for both the participants' and  		providers' time in program.</p>
<p>The picture is more complex for CMHOs and the two specialty providers  		because some sites appear to have more experience with care integration and  		coordination than others. All, however, will require more substantial  		reorganization and training than the CEDARR centers to meet health home  		requirements. As in the CEDARR center evaluation, it will be necessary to  		clearly delineate the existing structure and processes, but it will also be  		important to document variations between mental health provider sites and how  		the state is addressing the variations. The baseline site visits will be a  		critical tool for filling in gaps in our understanding of both provider  		groups.</p>
<h3>Population Criteria and Provider Infrastructure</h3>
<p><a href="#table1-RI">Table 1</a> summarizes the population criteria, the  		designated providers, and requirements regarding the minimum composition of the  		Health Home team for both health home initiatives. In the rest of the  		discussion, we denote the initiative targeting persons with SPMI as the  		CMHO-HH, and the second targeting special needs children and youth as the  		CEDARR-HH. The CMHO-HH SPA lists additional eligibility criteria aside from  		diagnostic category that limit those eligible to enroll to a highly impaired  		subset who have mental or emotional disorders that seriously impair daily  		functioning, but for whom long-term 24-hour care may be averted.<sup><a href="#note13-RI">13</a></sup> The CEDARR-HH population is also fairly narrowly  		focused by virtue of the eligibility criteria for receiving CEDARR services.  		Children and youth are eligible for Health Home services if they have a mental  		health condition, two chronic conditions, or one chronic condition and the risk  		of developing another. The conditions are a mental health condition, asthma,  		diabetes, Down syndrome, a developmental disability, mental retardation, or a  		seizure disorder.</p>
<p>CMHOs and CEDARR Family Centers have varying experience with Health  		Home-type services and have care teams that reflect both the extent to which  		they are already providing health home-like services and the different needs of  		their respective beneficiary populations. The required Health Home team for  		CEDARR-HH includes only two members, a licensed clinician and a family service  		coordinator who will share responsibility for the core health home services.  		The required team for CMHO-HH includes at least seven members with behavioral,  		clinical, or social support expertise. However, the CEDARR-HH SPA states that  		the Centers employ both licensed health professionals and staff trained to  		provide Health Home-type services, and that the two-person team is expected to  		collaborate regularly with the child's primary care provider (PCP).</p>
<p><i><b>Service Definitions and Provider Standards</b></i></p>
<p>Rhode Island has established both overarching and provider-specific  		definitions for the six Health Home services. (A full list of these services is  		provided in <a href="#table5-RI">Table 5</a>.) Overall, the differences between  		the provider-specific definitions between the CMHO-HH and the CEDARR-HH reflect  		the different characteristics and needs of their respective patient  		populations. Thus, for example, care coordination, transitional care, and  		referral to support services at CEDARR-HHs would potentially involve  		school-based services, whereas CMHO-HH services generally would not. Similarly,  		CMHO-HHs will focus more than CEDARR-HHs on ensuring adequate housing, social  		integration and functioning, substance abuse treatment, and vocational  		training. The assignment of service provision within the teams is flexible;  		although each service is assigned to a provider who will have primary  		responsibility, many services for both CEDARR-HH enrollees and CMHO-HH  		enrollees may be performed by various members or combination of members of the  		Health Home team.</p>
<p>The information provided in the SPAs suggests that practice  		transformation requirements for the two provider groups will be somewhat  		different. CEDARR Family Centers already meet established state certification  		standards, which will serve as the basis for Health Home qualification and will  		be changed as necessary to meet any additional health home requirements.<sup><a href="#note14-RI">14</a></sup> Additional requirements for Health Home status  		have been added as an Appendix to the CEDARR Family Center Recognition  		Standards and include the requirement that Health Homes agree to perform the 11  		Health Home functions identified by CMS in the November 16, 2010, State  		Medicaid Director (SMD) Letter on Section 2703.<sup><a href="#note15-RI">15</a></sup> CEDARR-HHs must also agree to establish a  		protocol to gather, store, and transmit to the state all required reporting  		data as part of their quality improvement plan. Additional reporting  		requirements are listed in <a href="#table2-RI">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p>The requirements for CMHO-HHs are more extensive. (See  		<a href="#table2-RI">Table 2</a> for a detailed list.) In addition to meeting  		state licensure requirements for being behavioral health centers, CMHOs must  		submit a proposal demonstrating how they will structure team composition and  		member roles to meet Health Home goals, a requirement that is not included for  		CEDARR teams. CMHOs must also sign a certificate of agreement that outlines  		their roles and responsibilities as Health Homes and that includes requirements  		related to care organization, transitional care arrangements with hospitals,  		progress reports, and state evaluations. CMHOs must also agree to participate  		in statewide learning activities, which will focus on training providers to  		perform the 11 Health Home functions identified by CMS in the November 2010 SMD  		letter. Community support specialists are specifically required to undergo a  		17-week training designed to improve their clinical and case management skills.  		</p>
<h3>Use of Health Information Technology</h3>
<p>Rhode Island plans to phase-in HIT support to its Health Home providers  		and, in the interim, will rely on the existing infrastructure used by CEDARR  		Family Centers and the state Medicaid MCOs, which cover 60% of CEDARR-HH  		participants and 35% of eligible CMHO-HH participants. The state is working  		with the MCOs to develop utilization profiles covering the last 12 months,  		including the number of ER and urgent care visits, date and diagnosis of most  		recent ER visit, PCP and number of visits, prescription drug information, and  		behavioral health utilization. To the extent possible, the state will develop  		similar profiles from the Medicaid data warehouse and other applicable sources  		for the remaining FFS individuals. For CMHO-HH participants who are dually  		eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, the state will work closely with the CMS  		Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to obtain Medicare  		utilization and cost data. The state will query CMHO providers about the use of  		HIT in the delivery of care coordination services and may establish pilot tests  		of a subset of providers (e.g., those with EHRs and patient registries) to  		measure changes in health outcomes, experience of care, and quality of care  		among clients. The Rhode Island Behavioral Health Online Dataset (RI-BHOLD)  		also is cited as the source for some clinical outcome data, but is not  		otherwise described in the SPA.</p>
<p>CEDARR-HHs will use an existing electronic case management system, which  		can support linkages of information from medical and human service providers  		and school programs, and the Rhode Island KIDSNET Child Health Information  		System, which provides access to information such as blood lead levels,  		immunizations, newborn developmental assessment, hearing assessment, WIC  		participation, and early intervention participation. CEDARR-HHs also will offer  		to enroll all clients into "CurrentCare," Rhode Island's electronic health  		information exchange.</p>
<h3>Payment Structure</h3>
<p>The two types of Health Homes will have very different payment  		structures. CMHO-HHs will be paid on a monthly case rate basis, with the rate  		reflecting personnel costs and staffing ratios based on estimates of client  		need. The estimated staff needs, for a team serving 200 clients, is 11.25  		full-time equivalent, or approximately nine staff hours per client per month.  		CMHO-HHs will be required to submit detailed encounter data to the state. After  		six months, and annually thereafter, the state will consider whether to adjust  		the case rate or consider alternate payment methodologies, based on analysis of  		program costs versus services received by recipients.</p>
<p>CEDARR-HHs will be paid on a FFS basis. Three existing CEDARR  		activities, with established rates, are defined to be the "comprehensive care  		management" component of a health home. These are initial family intake and  		needs assessment, family care plan development following initial needs  		assessment, and annual family care plan review. Fixed rates for each of these  		three services are in the $350-$400 range. All the other health home services  		are mapped to two established CEDARR services: health needs coordination and  		therapeutic consultation. The skill mix associated with each health home  		service is specified in the SPA. Care coordination, comprehensive transitional  		care, individual and family support services, and referral to community and  		social support services are considered to be health needs coordination. Health  		promotion is considered to be therapeutic consultation. Payment rates per  		quarter hour for each type of professional are established hourly rates, and  		billing will be by quarter hour units of time actually spent on each service.  		There is no stated plan for revision of the payment system for CEDARR-HHs.</p>
<h3>Quality Improvement Goals and Measures</h3>
<p>There are five quality improvement goals for CEDARR-HHs and six for  		CMHO-HHs, summarized in <a href="#table3-RI">Table 3</a> below, along with the  		quality measures that will be used. There is little overlap in either the goals  		or the measures used, in part because of the very different participant  		populations for the two types of providers. Both SPAs list "Improved care  		coordination" as the first goal, but the measures diverge, with CEDARR-HH  		measures focusing on physician consultations, use of Rhode Island KIDSNET, and  		communication with MCO PCPs, while those for CMHO-HHs focus on chart  		documentation of physical and behavioral health needs and post-hospitalization  		follow-up visits. Other goals are similar in concept, but have very different  		measures. For example, goals for CEDARR centers include "decrease occurrence of  		secondary conditions," "decrease emergency department use and preventable  		admissions," and "improve quality of transitions from inpatient/residential  		care to community," while CMHO goals include "increase use of preventive  		services," "reduce preventable emergency department use," and "improve  		transitions to CMHO care." There are only a few overlaps in measures (e.g.,  		documentation of BMI and depression screening). Both patient groups will be  		surveyed on their satisfaction with service access and quality.</p>
<p>Data sources also vary, though both evaluations will use claims and  		encounter data, as well as chart/record review and client surveys. The CEDARR  		data sources also will include KIDSNET, and CMHO data sources will include the  		Rhode Island Outcomes Evaluation Instrument, and RI-BHOLD.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Measures and Methods</h3>
<p>The evaluation measures and methodology described in the CMHO-HH and  		CEDARR-HH SPAs are reproduced in <a href="#table4-RI">Table 4</a> and are  		different in both content and evaluation methodology for the two provider  		groups.</p>
<p>The CEDARR-HH evaluation strategy is limited to an entirely pre/post  		design for all data collected from practices and for cost savings estimates.  		Based on the detailed information provided for the cost savings estimation, the  		intent is to consider the "pre" period to be the single quarter preceding the  		effective date of October 1, 2011 (the 1st quarter of the state's fiscal year  		2012), and the "post" period to be the eight subsequent quarters over which the  		enhanced federal match for health home services is in effect. No comparison  		group of beneficiaries or practices is specified. Hospital admission rates and  		length of stay, and the number of emergency department visits and skilled  		nursing facility admissions will be computed bi-annually.</p>
<p>The CMHO-HH strategy for evaluating chronic disease management,  		coordination of care, assessment of program implementation, and processes and  		lessons learned, and assessment of quality improvements and clinical outcomes,  		does not specify either a pre/post design or a comparison group, apparently  		relying on change over time after implementation. For hospital admission rates  		(to be measured per 1,000 member months), both a pre/post analysis of rates for  		CMHO-HH participants and a comparison with rates for clinically similar  		individuals not receiving CMHO-HH services are envisioned. It is not made clear  		whether the intent is to examine rates pre and post for both participants and  		comparison group, which is the preferred approach. For savings estimations, the  		state proposes to estimate baseline total costs for Medicare and Medicaid  		beneficiaries who would have been eligible for CMHO health home services at any  		time during the 4th quarter of state fiscal 2011 (April-June 2011), presuming  		they can obtain appropriate Medicare claims data for dual eligible clients.  		Cost savings will be estimated annually by comparing those baseline estimates  		with costs for the same beneficiaries one year and two years later. Assessments  		also will include performance measures, which we interpret as the clinical  		outcome measures shown in <a href="#table3-RI">Table 3</a>, and targeted areas  		of cost in addition to total costs.</p>
