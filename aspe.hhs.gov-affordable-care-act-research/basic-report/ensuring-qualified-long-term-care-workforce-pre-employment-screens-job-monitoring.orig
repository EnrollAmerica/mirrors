<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>A. Study Overview</h3>
<p>In an effort to improve the quality of care provided in long-term care  		settings, as well as ensure a committed and qualified long-term care workforce,  		the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, within the  		U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, contracted with The Lewin Group  		(Lewin) to study the efficacy of various approaches to pre-employment screening  		and on-the-job monitoring of nurse assistants to prevent resident abuse in  		nursing homes. This study is intended to inform policymakers, providers,  		consumers and other interested parties about the relative contributions and  		perceived effectiveness of existing federal mandates and state and provider  		based strategies for preventing or reducing the abuse of vulnerable adults.  		</p>
<p>Federal and state governments, education and training centers, and  		employers have created a variety of formal mechanisms aimed at preventing  		incidences of abuse, neglect and exploitation in nursing homes and other  		long-term care settings. These mechanisms span a wide spectrum and include  		certification and licensure of paraprofessional long-term care workers, various  		pre-employment screening, (e.g., nurse aide registries, criminal background  		checks and drug tests), and on-the-job training and monitoring.</p>
<p>The two primary methods used for pre-employment screening include  		checking nurse aide registries and conducting criminal background checks.  		Federal guidelines require each state to establish and maintain a registry of  		nurse aides that includes certification information and substantiated findings  		of abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation in nursing homes. At minimum,  		these registries must include: (1) the full name of the individual; (2)  		identifying information, (3) the date of certification; and (4) information  		regarding substantiated findings of abuse, neglect or  		misappropriation.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup>  		Federal guidelines require nursing facilities to check their State nurse aide  		registry to ensure that hired nurse aides are certified to work and meet all  		state requirements, and that they do not have any substantiated findings of  		abuse, neglect or misappropriation associated with their license. In addition,  		long-term care facilities must check other relevant databases they believe will  		include any information on the potential employee (e.g., criminal background  		database).<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Some states, either through state law or by choice, collect data beyond  		the scope mandated through federal requirements for maintaining nurse aide  		registries. For example, states registries may include data on certified and  		non-certified health care workers in addition to nurse aides along with  		additional demographic information such as race/ethnicity, education level or  		current employer. </p>
<p>Examining the efficacy of screening mechanisms such as state nurse aide  		registries and criminal background checks comes at a particularly relevant  		time. Two recent federal studies highlight the urgency for the study from both  		a long-term care staffing perspective and from a quality perspective. The first  		study, conducted by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration,  		detailed a widespread shortage of nurse aides and home health aides with a high  		likelihood of increasingly severe shortages in the future.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> The second study conducted by the  		Office of the Inspector General (OIG) revealed that nurse aide registries often  		fail to provide accurate information because of failure to update data or purge  		outdated data.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have examined rates of abuse in nursing facilities,  		direct service worker capacity issues, and compliance of states to maintain  		nurse aide registries. This study looks across all of these issues, by  		examining the process states go through to collect and maintain information in  		their registries, state and employer mandated background check procedures,  		reporting and investigating policies/practices when abuse allegations are made,  		and the impact of such processes on the direct service workforce, employers and  		state agencies.</p>
<h3>B. Research Goal and Objectives</h3>
<p>The goal of this study was to examine current practices at the state and  		facility levels regarding pre-employment screening and on-the-job monitoring,  		and how these influence the quality of the long term care workforce. In  		addition, this study sought to: </p>
<ul><li> Examine the utility and efficacy of nurse aide registries and  		  criminal background checks as strategies for reducing the incidence of nursing  		  facility resident abuse. </li>
<li> Determine the relationship (if any) between past criminal background  		  or previous incidences of abuse and the proclivity toward subsequent abuse,  		  neglect or exploitation.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></li>
<li> Identify, from the perspective of states and nursing facilities,  		  limitations, innovative strategies, and recommendations for improving the  		  current screening and monitoring process for ensuring a qualified long-term  		  care workforce. </li>
</ul><h3>C. Key Findings</h3>
<p>The efficacy of nurse aide registries and criminal background checks in  		preventing resident abuse in nursing facilities is difficult to ascertain.  		Making an accurate assessment regarding the effectiveness of these practices is  		difficult because every state has a different process for screening and  		disqualifying potential workers, documenting information in their registries,  		tracking subsequent employment or complaint data, investigating abuse  		allegations, reporting relevant findings, and coordinating efforts across state  		entities. Extensive variation across states affects the ability to make a  		definitive statement about the efficacy of these strategies to ensure a  		qualified workforce. The in-depth examination of four states revealed that some  		aspects of these systems work well, but limitations exist in each state that  		affects the overall utility of these practices. There is, however, consensus  		across stakeholders in all four states that criminal background checks are a  		necessary element of the hiring process. The technology, coordination  		capabilities and infrastructure exist through on-line registries, fingerprint  		databases and abuse registries to help employers make the best hiring decisions  		possible to protect the elderly in their care. States are building on their  		knowledge, experience, and capabilities to streamline these processes, but  		there is still room for improvement while balancing the resource intensiveness  		of making these changes. It is clear that relying on criminal background checks  		and nurse aide registries are not enough to prevent or reduce abuse in nursing  		facilities. Ongoing training, education and supervision for workers providing  		direct care are also key components to maintaining a quality workforce. A  		summary of our overall project conclusions are provided below.</p>
<p><b><i>Criminal background checks are a valuable tool for employers  		during the hiring process and their use does not limit the pool of potential  		job applicants</i></b>. Stakeholders agree that conducting criminal background  		checks on potential employees is an important aspect of the hiring process to  		reduce the likelihood of hiring someone who has potential to harm residents in  		long-term care. There is widespread acceptance throughout the long-term care  		industry (similar to that of the child care industry), that this practice  		serves to protect vulnerable adults and ultimately prevent abuse. None of the  		nursing facilities experienced any negative impact on their applicant pool as a  		result of this requirement. From the perspective of employers, reducing the  		amount of time it takes to receive background check results would improve the  		current system. </p>
<p><b><i>A correlation exists between criminal history and incidences of  		abuse</i></b>. Based on data we received from Arizona and Kansas, it does  		appear that nurse aides who had a previous criminal conviction  		(non-disqualifying offense) had higher rates of substantiated abuse than nurse  		aides without a criminal history. While this only represents the experience of  		two states, this analysis does provide evidence to support the rationale for  		checking the criminal history of potential direct care workers as a screening  		mechanism for quality.</p>
<p><b><i>Criminal background checks are only one component of preventing  		abuse</i></b>. Despite a connection between past criminal history and  		subsequent allegations of abuse, stakeholders consistently reported the  		following as effective strategies for preventing abuse (many of which are not  		formal state or industry policy): adequate supervision/monitoring, presence of  		managers on the floor, decreasing staff burnout, adequate staffing levels,  		rotating nurse aides on the floor to alleviate pressure of difficult residents,  		increased education and training, obtaining meaningful employment references  		(beyond verification of employment dates), valuing and respecting staff,  		creative recruitment incentives to retain committed staff, instituting a  		drug-free workplace policy, minimizing temporary hires, and pointing out  		negative behaviors in the moment and using them as a staff development  		opportunity. </p>
<p><b><i>There are fewer policies in place that support or reinforce  		post-employment strategies to ensure a qualified workforce</i></b>. Through  		this study we have discovered that there is significantly more effort and  		resources allocated to the pre-employment phase of ensuring a qualified  		long-term care workforce than the post-employment phase. The policy focus at  		the state and facility level is on pre-screening applicants before employment  		and there are structures and regulations in place that support this effort.  		However, once a worker is hired and working in the field, there is less  		guidance regarding how best to train, continuously educate and monitor existing  		employees. As stated before, most states have no process in place to notify  		employers if an active employee commits a crime that would have prohibited them  		from working during their background check prior to employment. In the event of  		employee complaints or allegations of abuse, the effectiveness of state systems  		often breaks down due to a lack of coordination between multiple state entities  		involved in the investigation and reporting process. Duplicative efforts waste  		state resources, prolong investigations and often keep employees out of the  		workforce unnecessarily. </p>
<h3>D. Policy Considerations</h3>
<p><b>National Level Considerations</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>The challenge of individual state registries</i></b>.  			 Individual state registries and the barriers associated with data sharing  			 across states, limit employer access to useful information about substantiated  			 abuse findings against workers found in other states. Since workers may have  			 been employed in more than one state, a national nurse aide registry has been  			 frequently mentioned as one way to address the issue of long-term care workers  			 with substantiated findings of abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation  			 crossing state lines to work in another state. Several issues may pose barriers  			 for the creation of a national nurse aide registry. First, transfer of  			 information across various state and national agencies may be difficult due to  			 state laws and agency ownership of data. Second, the cost of  			 creating and maintaining a national database would require commitment of both  			 staff time and funds from both states and national agencies. Third,  			 certification procedures and requirements vary across states, which further  			 challenge any effort to standardize the process nationwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Use of disqualifying offenses and waivers</i></b>. It is  			 important to strike a balance between the need to protect vulnerable citizens  			 from harm and creating unnecessary barriers to employment for qualified  			 individuals, further reducing the potential pool of long-term care workers.  			 There is a paucity of literature examining nurse aides and criminal recidivism  			 and propensity to commit abuse. Criminal recidivism research shows that a  			 history of past criminal convictions may be a possible predictor of future  			 behavior.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> Other  			 research by Cohen (1996) reports that the probability of future dangerous  			 behavior of criminal offenders increases when circumstances are similar to past  			 situations in which criminal behaviors occurred, which has implications for  			 workers who have substantiated findings of resident abuse.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A review of the Illinois Department of Public Health waiver process  			 for individuals certified to work in hospitals and nursing facilities indicates  			 that many individuals with criminal records can work in the health care field  			 with minimal impact on patient safety. In Illinois, individuals with specific  			 criminal convictions are banned from working in certain health care professions  			 but can apply for waivers. In an examination of waiver applications from 1996  			 to 2003, 5,706 individuals with convictions applied for waivers. 4,130 (72%) of  			 these individuals were granted waivers. Ninety-seven individuals (or 2.3% of  			 the 4,130 individuals) had their waivers revoked; 38 of these individuals had  			 revoked waivers because of substantiated finding of abuse, neglect, or theft  			 and 59 individuals due to a second disqualifying conviction.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Additional research in the area of criminal recidivism, specifically  			 in relation to elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation is necessary to  			 develop evidence based lists of disqualifying offenses. Justification for the  			 inclusion or exclusion of various crimes that constitute states lists of  			 disqualifying offenses is unclear, and the lack of consensus across states on  			 this issue illustrates the complexity of making a solid connection between past  			 criminal activity and the proclivity to commit abuse in long-term care  			 settings. In the absence of such evidence, policymakers and employers must  			 still balance the need to protect vulnerable populations with the need to  			 maintain an adequate direct care workforce to accommodate a growing older adult  			 population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b><i>The screening process requires a significant amount of  			 resources</i></b>. As states make efforts to improve their screening processes  			 (e.g., expanding the criminal background check to other states or incorporating  			 federal level checks, expediting the turnaround time for results, expanding the  			 screening process to other types of workers), the costs will inevitably  			 increase. States will need additional capacity (staff and financial resources)  			 to meet the demand for quality screens on increased numbers of workers in a  			 timely manner. It is important to balance the financial burden across state  			 agencies, employers and direct service workers in an equitable manner so that  			 screening processes can continue to improve. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>State Level Considerations</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p> <b><i>Keeping registry data current to maximize their  			 utility</i></b>. A recent OIG study revealed that nurse aide registries may not  			 always contain the most up-to-date, or accurate information. In a survey of 200  			 randomly selected long-term care facility administrators, 44% (87 individuals)  			 surveyed stated that they periodically rechecked nurse aide registries to  			 ensure that substantiated findings had been posted to the registry. Fifteen  			 administrators found that a nurse aide previously listed as registered and free  			 of a substantiated finding of abuse was later listed to be unqualified for work  			 due to a substantiated finding, failure to attain active registration status,  			 or failure to be certified as a nurse aide. The nurse aide registry is only  			 helpful to employers if the information is current. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b><i>Increasing the utility of the nurse aide registry with public  			 awareness and education</i></b>. In most states, employers are the only ones  			 who benefit from the information contained in the nurse aide registry. By  			 increasing consumer knowledge and use of the registry, the state can further  			 protect the public by offering additional resources and information on  			 individual long-term care workers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b><i>Incorporating alternative screening mechanisms</i></b>.  			 Nursing home administrators use several practices (not required by federal  			 regulations) to screen potential employees and to monitor current nurse aides.  			 Eighty-five percent of administrators surveyed for a recent OIG report used  			 additional screening procedures such as criminal background checks, and/or  			 personal and employment reference checks.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> Implementing <i>random</i> drug tests and  			 criminal background checks on existing employees may be another way to monitor  			 employees after they have cleared original pre-employment screens. Conducting  			 drug testing may be a more effective method for screening out individuals with  			 a criminal history in drug abuse rather than a comprehensive ban.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> Findings demonstrate the need  			 to use creative and multi-pronged strategies for screening and monitoring  			 direct care paraprofessionals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b><i>Examining states practices related to investigating and  			 reporting abuse</i></b>. Current state practices for investigating and  			 reporting abuse cases appear duplicative and lack adequate coordination across  			 entities. This creates overlap for agencies conducting the investigation,  			 burden for the employers, and a protracted suspension period for the direct  			 service worker involved.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3>A. Overview and Study Purpose</h3>
<p>In 2000, there were 35 million people 65 years of age and over in the  		U.S., an increase of 12% from 1990. When baby boomers (born from 1946 through  		1964) reach the age of 65, starting in 2011, the number of individuals 65 years  		of age and over is expected to rise.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> The rapidly aging long-term care workforce  		and high turnover rate pose barriers for meeting the long-term care needs of  		the growing older adult population.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve the quality of care provided in long-term care  		settings, as well as ensure a committed and qualified long-term care workforce,  		the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE),  		within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, contracted with The  		Lewin Group (Lewin) to study the efficacy of various approaches to  		pre-employment screening and on-the-job monitoring of nurse assistants to  		prevent resident abuse in nursing homes. This study is intended to inform  		policymakers, providers, consumers and other interested parties about the  		relative contributions and perceived effectiveness of existing federal mandates  		and state and provider based strategies for preventing or reducing the abuse of  		vulnerable adults. </p>
<h3>B. Background</h3>
<p><b><i>Vulnerability of older adults in long-term care settings</i></b>.  		Examining the value of federal, state and provider strategies for preventing or  		reducing the incidence of abuse is vital for the protection of residents in  		long-term care service settings. Long-term care consumers often have physical,  		cognitive and functional impairments that make defense from and reporting of  		abuse, neglect, or exploitation difficult. Consumers with long-term care needs  		may lack strong advocates provided through a spouse or family support network.  		</p>
<p>While abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation occur in a variety of  		formal and informal long-term care settings by both paid and unpaid caregivers,  		the quality of long-term care in nursing facilities is of particular concern  		because past reports have demonstrated higher incidences of abuse in comparison  		with other settings. The House Committee on Government Reform, for example,  		issued a report in 2001 that demonstrated a high rate of abuse in nursing  		homes. Over a two-year period, nearly one-third of all certified nursing  		facilities had been cited for some type of abuse violation that had the  		potential to cause harm or had actually caused harm to a nursing home resident.  		Ten percent of nursing homes were cited for abuse violations that caused actual  		harm to residents.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> A  		2002 General Accounting Office (GAO) study estimated that almost 30% of the  		nations 17,000 nursing homes were cited for deficiencies involving actual harm  		to residents or placing them at risk of death or serious injury.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Definitions of abuse, neglect and exploitation</i></b>. According  		to the National Center on Elder Abuse, abuse, neglect, and exploitation in the  		context of long-term care are defined as any knowing, intentional, or negligent  		act by a caregiver or any other person that causes harm or a serious risk of  		harm to a vulnerable adult. <i>Abuse</i> in nursing homes is defined as the  		willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or  		punishment with resulting physical harm, pain, or mental anguish for all  		residents, even those in a coma (42 CFR § 488.301). This includes physical  		abuse (inflicting, or threatening to inflict, physical pain or injury on a  		vulnerable elder, or depriving them of a basic need), emotional abuse  		(inflicting mental pain, anguish, or distress on an elder person through verbal  		or nonverbal acts), and sexual abuse (non-consensual sexual contact of any  		kind). <i>Neglect</i> is generally defined as the intentional or unintentional  		withholding of food, medication, or other necessities that result in the older  		persons failure to thrive.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> Federal statute (42 CFR § 488.301)  		states that neglect in nursing homes is the failure to provide goods and  		services necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental  		illness. <i>Exploitation</i> in the context of long-term care is defined  		as the illegal taking, misuse, or concealment of funds, property, or assets of  		a vulnerable elder.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup>  		Individual states vary in their definitions of abuse, neglect, and  		exploitation. </p>
<p><b><i>Strategies to improve workforce quality and reduce risk of  		abuse</i></b>. Federal and state governments, education and training centers,  		and employers have created a variety of formal mechanisms aimed at preventing  		incidences of abuse in nursing homes and other long-term care settings. These  		mechanisms span a wide spectrum and include certification and licensure of  		direct paraprofessional long-term care workers, various pre-employment  		screening, (e.g., nurse aide registries, criminal background checks and drug  		tests), and on-the-job training and monitoring.</p>
<p><b><i>Federal Guidelines for Certified Nurse Aide (CNA)  		Registries</i></b>. The two primary methods used for pre-employment screening  		include checking nurse aide registries and conducting criminal background  		checks. Federal guidelines require each state to establish and maintain a  		registry of nurse aides that includes certification information and  		substantiated findings of abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation in nursing  		homes. At minimum, these registries must include: (1) the full name of the  		individual; (2) identifying information; (3) the date of certification; and (4)  		information regarding substantiated findings of abuse, neglect or  		misappropriation.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup>  		Federal guidelines require nursing facilities to check their state nurse aide  		registry to ensure that hired nurse aides are certified to work and meet all  		state requirements, and that they do not have any substantiated findings of  		abuse, neglect or misappropriation associated with their license. In addition,  		long-term care facilities must check other relevant databases they believe will  		include any information on the potential employee (e.g., criminal background  		database).<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Requirements beyond Federal Guidelines</i></b>. Some states,  		either through state law or by choice, collect data beyond the scope mandated  		through federal requirements for maintaining nurse aide registries. For  		example, states registries may include data on certified and non-certified  		health care workers in addition to nurse aides along with additional  		demographic information such as race/ethnicity, education level or current  		employer. See <b><a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a></b> for a comprehensive list  		of state requirements for certification and employment.</p>
<p><b><i>Statutes Authorizing Criminal Background Checks</i></b>. Criminal  		background checks provide another avenue for screening potential long-term care  		employees. Two federal statutes enable health care providers to perform  		criminal background checks on prospective employees. Public law 105-277,  		Section 124 enables nursing facilities and home health care agencies to request  		fingerprint based national criminal history checks by the FBI for employees or  		job applicants seeking positions involving direct patient care. In addition,  		Public law 103-322 § 320928 enables federal criminal background checks to  		be performed on individuals employed in long-term care settings other than  		nursing facilities and home health agencies. This law allows for checks to be  		conducted on individuals who work for, own, or operate a business that provides  		care to the elderly or individuals with disabilities. </p>
<p>Despite these two laws, an earlier law passed by Congress in 1972,  		Public law 92-544, created a barrier for states attempting to conduct  		background checks. This law stipulated that in order for background checks to  		occur, states had to first pass a law authorizing health care employers to  		request such background checks from state and local government officials, and  		then seek approval of the law from the U.S. Attorney General. However, Public  		law 105-251 § 222, passed in 1998, remedied some of these barriers by  		enabling state designated businesses or organizations involved in the licensure  		or certification of individuals providing care to children, the elderly, or  		individuals with disabilities to request federal criminal background checks of  		potential employees even in the absence of a state statute authorizing criminal  		background checks.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>On-the-Job Monitoring</i></b>. Long-term care facilities also play  		a role in maintaining the quality of the long-term care workforce through their  		employment and monitoring practices. These monitoring practices might include  		supervision of direct care paraprofessional workers by other personnel,  		training, and education. Gaining a better understanding of the effectiveness  		and use by employers of screening mechanisms as well as on-the-job monitoring  		enables policymakers and relevant stakeholders to understand the balance  		between the need to protect vulnerable individuals with long-term care needs  		with the need to ensure that potentially qualified long -term caretakers are  		not being inappropriately screened out by highly sensitive screening tools.  		</p>
<h3>C. Context and Contribution of this Study</h3>
<p>Examining the efficacy of screening mechanisms such as state nurse aide  		registries and criminal background checks comes at a particularly relevant  		time. Two recent federal studies highlight the urgency for the study from both  		a long-term care staffing perspective and from a quality perspective. The first  		study, conducted by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration,  		detailed a widespread shortage of nurse aides and home health aides with a high  		likelihood of increasingly severe shortages in the future.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> The second study conducted by  		the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) revealed that nurse aide registries  		often fail to provide accurate information because of failure to update data or  		purge outdated data.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have examined rates of abuse in nursing facilities,  		direct service worker capacity issues, and compliance of states to maintain  		nurse aide registries. This study looks across all of these issues, by  		examining state processes for collecting and maintaining information in their  		registries, state and employer mandated background check procedures, reporting  		and investigating policies/practices when abuse allegations are made, and the  		impact of such processes on the direct service workforce, employers and state  		agencies.</p>

<h3>A. Research Goal and Objectives</h3>
<p>The goal of the study was to examine current practices at the state and  		facility levels regarding pre-employment screening and on-the-job monitoring,  		and how these influence the quality of the long term care workforce. In  		addition, this study sought to: </p>
<ul><li>Examine the utility and efficacy of nurse aide registries and  		  criminal background checks as strategies for reducing the incidence of nursing  		  facility resident abuse. </li>
<li>Determine the relationship (if any) between past criminal background  		  or previous incidences of abuse and the proclivity toward subsequent abuse,  		  neglect or exploitation.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Identify, from the perspective of states and nursing facilities,  		  limitations, innovative strategies, and recommendations for improving the  		  current screening and monitoring process for ensuring a qualified long-term  		  care workforce. </li>
</ul><h3>B. Data Sources</h3>
<p>For this study, Lewin relied on both primary and secondary data sources.  		The sources used include key informants at the federal, state, and facility  		levels, CNA registry data, abuse registry data and relevant literature and  		reports. </p>
<p><b><i>Federal and National Key Informant Interviews</i></b>. Guided by  		ASPE and a technical advisory group (TAG), Lewin gathered data from a numerous  		primary sources to capture a variety of stakeholder perspectives. In the  		initial stages of the project, Lewin conducted fourteen key informant  		interviews targeting experts in several key areas related to the project,  		including: experts in long-term care, elder abuse, law enforcement, federal  		representatives working on related projects (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS)), and nursing home industry and direct care workforce  		representatives. Preliminary interviews focused on soliciting input related to  		project topics, strategies, and contacts for experts in the field. After  		speaking with key informants, Lewin formed a TAG representing a broad spectrum  		of stakeholders. TAG members assisted the research team with: (1) developing a  		work plan focused on eliciting a better understanding of how screening  		mechanisms are used and interpreted and the practice variation that exists  		across and within states, (2) clarifying relevant policies and identifying  		relevant research, and (3) ensuring that the project added to the existing body  		of research. </p>
<p><b><i>State Key Informant Interviews</i></b>. Arizona, Illinois,  		Florida, and Washington were selected as case study states based on several  		relevant characteristics developed in collaboration with ASPE and the TAG.  		Criteria included:</p>
<ul><li>Geographic location;</li>
<li>Mix of urban versus rural populations;</li>
<li>Diversity of resident population;</li>
<li>Diversity of direct care worker population;</li>
<li>Comprehensive nurse aide registry;</li>
<li>Criminal background check requirement;</li>
<li>Use of waivers or other sanctions for direct care workers; and</li>
<li>Size of older adult population.</li>
</ul><p>For each state, Lewin conducted stakeholder discussions via telephone  		with selected state representatives. Lewin conducted interviews from September  		2005 to January 2006 with the following stakeholders:</p>
<ul><li>Nurse Aide Registry personnel;</li>
<li>State survey and certification representatives;</li>
<li>Long Term Care Associations;</li>
<li>Adult protective service (APS) representatives;</li>
<li>Law enforcement;</li>
<li>Ombudsmen;</li>
<li>Medicaid fraud unit; and</li>
<li>Workforce development board agency.</li>
</ul><p>Interviews with state stakeholders focused on policies and practices  		related to the prevention of resident abuse in nursing homes--specifically, the  		approach to criminal background checks and use of nurse aide and abuse  		registries. Discussions with state staff provided a better understanding of the  		different practices imposed by the states and rationale pertaining to the  		employment of individuals with criminal histories or previous offenses of  		abuse, neglect or financial exploitation. In addition, stakeholders provided  		information about current state processes, capacity issues, system structures,  		and suggested improvements. Information gathered was used to contextualize  		discussions with employers at the facility level about their practices and  		perspectives on the value of different strategies for reducing the incidence of  		resident abuse. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Facility Site Visits, Interviews, and Surveys</i></b>. In  		addition to telephone interviews with state level stakeholders, Lewin conducted  		in-person site visits or phone interviews with informants in three or four  		nursing facilities in each state.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> Nursing facilities were selected for the  		following reasons:</p>
<ul><li><i>Diversity</i>: When selecting facilities, Lewin considered the  		  facilities geographic characteristics (e.g., size, resident population,  		  ownership type (chain versus freestanding nursing facility), business model  		  (for profit, non-profit, religious affiliation)).</li>
<li><i>History and reputation</i>: Lewin selected facilities (based on  		  state recommendations) that had a history of overcoming staffing/resident  		  challenges, experienced positive/negative management changes that affected  		  performance, or had a reputation of consistency, and positive survey  		  results.</li>
<li><i>Labor market</i>: Lewin selected some facilities dealing with a  		  constrained labor market to elicit whether the high demand for employees  		  resulted in different hiring practices. </li>
</ul><p>At each facility, Lewin conducted interviews from November 2005 to March  		2006 with the following stakeholders:</p>
<ul><li>Representatives from management (Administrators and Regional  		  Directors);</li>
<li>Director of Nursing and Staff Development Nurse;</li>
<li>Human resources/risk management personnel; and</li>
<li>CNAs.</li>
</ul><p>Interviews with facility level stakeholders focused on the policies and  		practices employed by the facility regarding the screening, hiring, training  		and monitoring of nurse aides. Discussions with facility level stakeholders  		solicited, from a variety of perspectives, an understanding of the utility and  		relative contribution of registries and background checks in reducing the  		incidence of resident abuse and ensuring a qualified long-term care workforce.  		Discussions also revealed aspects of the process that are most and least  		useful, strategies employers use to enhance the screening process as part of  		corporate requirements, suggestions to improve the current system, and insight  		into effective training and monitoring practices. </p>
<p>Detailed discussion guides for all interviews with TAG members, key  		informants, and state and facility level stakeholders are included in <b><a href="#appendE">Appendix E</a></b>. </p>
<p><b>Analysis of Registry Data</b></p>
<p>Originally, ASPE intended to gain access to states registry data  		and criminal background databases and use this data to ascertain:</p>
<ul><li>The relationship between direct care workers with criminal background  		  and rates of abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation; and </li>
<li>The relationship between direct care workers with prior history of  		  abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation and subsequent findings of abuse,  		  neglect or exploitation. </li>
</ul><p>Lewin worked closely with the Arizona Board of Nursing (AZBN) and the  		Kansas Department of Health Occupations Credentialing to conduct a secondary  		data analysis of state nurse aide registries and criminal history databases to  		explore the relationship, if any, between past criminal convictions or previous  		incidences of abuse and proclivity towards abuse, neglect and financial  		exploitation. These two states were selected because they use <i>both</i> nurse  		aide registries and criminal background checks as screening mechanisms. </p>
<p>Lewin originally requested raw data files of the nurse aide and abuse  		registries, as well as information on criminal background status, from both  		Arizona and Kansas. Due to regulations that prohibit the release or sharing of  		information on individuals criminal history, Lewin then requested Arizona  		and Kansas to conduct the analyses of state databases and then share aggregated  		results with the research team. Lewin provided an analysis plan (see <b><a href="#appendE">Appendix  		E</a></b>) for both states to follow that would examine the differences in  		abuse rates between nurse aides who had a criminal conviction or previous  		substantiated abuse finding, and nurse aides without such history. The data  		analysis plan also included demographic characteristics of nurse aides with  		substantiated findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. </p>
<p>Each state submitted information on the following:</p>
<ul><li>The percentage of nurse aides in the abuse registry with past  		  criminal histories (non-disqualifying offenses).</li>
<li>The percentage of nurse aides in the statewide nurse aide registry  		  with past criminal histories (non-disqualifying offenses).</li>
<li>Basic demographics and type of abuse allegation.</li>
</ul><p><b>Document Review</b></p>
<p>To augment interview and site visit data, relevant documents were  		reviewed, including federal reports, state statutes, research literature, and  		literature provided by nursing facilities. <b><a href="#appendA">Appendix  		A</a></b> contains the bibliography of literature reviewed. </p>
<h3><a name="chapIIC" id="chapIIC">C. Study Limitations</a></h3>
<p>Numerous barriers, outlined below, prevented Lewin from analyzing the  		relationship between criminal background and proclivity for abuse using  		registry data from multiple states. </p>
<p><b><i>Barriers to Accessing Data on Criminal History</i></b>. Accessing  		the repository of criminal record data collected by state agencies is  		prohibited by federal laws and state statutes established to protect individual  		privacy. Sharing this information is prohibited, even in aggregated form.  		Similarly, in a limited number of states that follow an open record  		policy for releasing criminal background information, access to information  		remains highly restricted. For example, open record states may  		restrict information sharing on criminal background records to other state  		offices. Further, if open record states allow a non-state entity to  		access information, many allow these entities to conduct criminal background  		checks on a <i>single</i> individual only--using name, date of birth, or social  		security number.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Barriers to Accessing Data on Substantiated Abuse</i></b>. Similar  		barriers arise when attempting to access nurse aide registry information on  		substantiated findings of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation. Due to  		privacy laws, states contacted could not release the full extent of their  		databases to entities outside the state agency. For example, despite having a  		rich database that contains abuse, neglect, misappropriation, and criminal  		background data, Wyoming could only provide information on whether a person has  		been disqualified and could only release information for individuals who  		consented to the release of their information. Approximately 56% of Wyoming  		nurse aide applicants consent to releasing information to third parties. </p>
<p><b><i>Relevant Data Housed in Multiple Registries, Maintained by  		Multiple Agencies</i></b>. Access to criminal background data and state nurse  		aide registry data are not the only obstacles encountered in conducting the  		quantitative component of this study. For example, few states maintain  		information on licensure, abuse, neglect, financial exploitation, and criminal  		history in <i>one registry</i>.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> The majority of states maintain two or more  		registries containing information on licensure of various health professionals,  		findings of abuse, neglect, and misappropriation of property, and criminal  		background.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> Access to  		needed data would require the approval by multiple entities and these entities  		would need to release identifying information for each individual in order to  		match records from each state database. As noted previously, access to  		comprehensive identifying information is difficult. In addition to the  		difficulties of correlating data across multiple registries in one state, nurse  		aide registry data may be of poor quality. </p>
<p> <b><i>Inconsistent Data Quality</i></b>. The quality of nurse aide  		registry and criminal history data impacted our ability to conduct a meaningful  		analysis. A study by the OIG revealed that nurse aide registries often fail to  		provide accurate information. Federal law requires that substantiated findings  		of abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation be recorded within ten days of the  		substantiated finding. In the national survey, OIG conservatively estimated  		that one in four records of nurse aides with substantiated findings was not  		updated within the required ten day period. Of even greater concern was the  		finding that one in eight nurse aide records were not updated three months  		later, long after the federally mandated ten day period. Further, many states  		failed to meet the federal requirement of removing records of inactive nurse  		aides (defined as failure to practice in 24 consecutive months) therefore  		enabling uncertified individuals to continue working.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> Several states that were approached to  		participate in this study expressed resistance because databases were not  		consistently purged. Interestingly, some states indicated that they  		have never purged their database. Some states reported that they have several  		hundred-thousand records in their database, including many inactive workers  		which would compromise the quality of the data. For these states, conducting  		the secondary analysis would have required significant resources and data  		cleaning to produce meaningful results. Due to access barriers, Lewin needed to  		rely on the willingness of state workers to conduct this analysis. State  		contacts generally indicated a high level of interest in the study but simply  		did not have the staffing capacity to conduct the analyses.</p>
<h2><a name="findings" id="findings">III. FINDINGS</a></h2>
<p>To answer the questions posed by this study, it is essential to examine  		the various components that constitute the systems for pre-employment screening  		(i.e., use of nurse aide registries and criminal background checks) and  		post-employment processes (i.e., training, on-the-job monitoring, and complaint  		investigation and reporting practices). While there are federal requirements to  		maintain a nurse aide registry and conduct pre-employment background checks,  		there are no requirements standardizing the implementation practices employed  		by states and nursing facilities. As such, implementation of these requirements  		varies considerably across states. The following section presents findings from  		four states regarding pre- and post-employment practices and innovations.  		Illustrating the variation in practices across the four states are process flow  		charts contained in <b><a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a></b> depicting: (1) the  		process for CNAs seeking certification; (2) process for CNAs seeking  		employment; and (3) process for handling complaints or allegations against CNAs  		of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. </p>
<h3>A. Current Practices in Pre-Employment Screening,  		Background Checks, and On-the-Job Monitoring</h3>
<p><b>1. Maintenance of the Nurse Aide Registry</b></p>
<p>To understand the utility and overall effectiveness of the nurse aide  		registry, it is important to have a clear sense of the structure, content,  		maintenance and capabilities within the state for sharing relevant information.  		The department or association responsible for the nurse aide registry varies  		greatly in each state. There is also significant variety in the content  		recorded in states registries, as well as the means and timing of updates  		to the registry. Many states encounter difficulty in keeping the state nurse  		aide registry up-to-date since there are different entities within each state  		that keep track of the different aspects of information recorded. Through state  		level informant interviews in the four study states (Arizona, Florida,  		Illinois, Washington), the level of variation among responsible entities who  		maintain the nurse aide registry, the contents, and the ease with which updated  		information is accessed became evident. </p>
<p>The nurse aide registry is maintained by the AZBN, the Department of  		Health in Florida, the Department of Public Health in Illinois, and the  		Department of Social and Health Services in Washington. Though each state  		entity fulfills the same role, they are different sectors within each state  		governments structure. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Washington contain  		information on CNAs, registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses in  		their nurse aide registries. Illinois also includes home health aides, personal  		care aides, and developmental disability aides in its registry. All four states  		record most demographic information including social security number, name,  		address, etc. However, each state varies in keeping record of other relevant  		information, such as date of competency completion, employment status, criminal  		background check status and date, substantiated findings, disqualifying  		offenses, waiver status, and current employer. </p>
<p>The complexity of maintaining the nurse aide registry stems from the  		need to receive updated information from other state departments handling  		different types of information that must be recorded in the registry. Criminal  		background check status, for example, must be gathered from the background  		check unit in the state, which in many cases is different from the entity that  		maintains the nurse aide registry. Information about employment (i.e., employer  		and status) requires updated information from employers or by certified workers  		themselves. If this is not done regularly, it impedes the ability of the entity  		maintaining the nurse aide registry to keep current and accurate records. Also,  		limited staffing capacity to maintain the registry and high nurse aide turnover  		are additional challenges that states face in updating the nurse aide  		registries consistently and accurately. </p>
<p><b>2. Criminal Background Check Processes</b></p>
<p><i>a. Disqualifying criminal offenses</i></p>
<p>Federal guidelines require criminal background checks to be conducted  		prior to the employment of CNAs. The goal of conducting criminal background  		checks is to ascertain whether or not applicants have a  		disqualifying criminal conviction that would prohibit them from  		working in a long-term care setting. Most states have developed a list of  		criminal offenses that prohibit an individual from obtaining either state  		certification/licensure or employment (blanket disqualification).  		However, there is no consensus across states regarding which crimes should be  		considered disqualifying offenses. Some states disqualifying offense  		lists include felonies only, while other states include felonies and select  		misdemeanor offenses such as driving under the influence and domestic violence  		convictions. The length of time (number of years) since conviction that would  		prohibit a person from working in a long-term care setting also varies by  		state. In some states, any felony conviction, regardless of when it occurred,  		automatically disqualifies someone from being employed. In other states, only  		specific felonies committed in the last five years result in blanket  		disqualification. In some cases, states consider convictions on juvenile  		records when making a determination of suitability. </p>
<p>To examine the level of variation that exists across states in terms of  		the types of crimes resulting in blanket disqualification, Lewin  		compiled a cross-state summary including data from 50 states and the District  		of Columbia regarding the use of criminal background checks in screening CNAs  		(see <b><a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a></b>). These matrices provide a  		concise summary regarding the state entities that conduct criminal background  		checks on nurse aides, laws or regulations that authorize criminal background  		checks and types of crimes<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> that result in disqualification from  		employment as a CNA. </p>
<p>Matrix 1 (in <b><a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a></b>) provides an  		overview of the criminal background check process by state and shows  		variability across states at the certification and employment levels. In  		addition to states cross-checking against lists of different disqualifying  		offenses, states also vary in their requirements for conducting either a state  		or federal (Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI)) level background check. The  		timing of the background check also varies, with nearly 40% of states (n=20)  		requiring the criminal background check prior to certification of nurse aides,  		and 80% (n=41<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup>)  		requiring the check before employment. One implication of states requiring the  		background check prior to employment but not prior to certification is that  		individuals with criminal backgrounds can become certified and listed in the  		registries, possibly leading to an overstatement of the CNA supply in these  		states. In addition, this policy can be an issue for nurse aides who can  		complete their training and education, receive state certification to work, yet  		are not able to secure a job if they cannot clear the background check. </p>
<p>Matrix 2 (in <b><a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a></b>) provides details  		regarding regulations by state, again illustrating enormous variation in  		policies and regulations, in terms of types of crime (felonies and  		misdemeanors) and allowable time period since conviction (five years, ten  		years, no limit, and inclusion of juvenile record), that constitute the basis  		for disqualifying a potential worker from employment in the long-term care  		industry. For example, the allowable time since conviction in Colorado is ten  		years for certain disqualifying offenses, while for other offenses there is no  		limit (i.e., any history of violent crime, regardless of when the crime was  		committed prohibits an individual from employment). The allowable time since  		conviction in Delaware ranges from 5-10 years depending on the type of offense,  		and Virginia grants exemptions for offenses committed more than five years  		prior to application if the individual has only one conviction. </p>
<p><i>b. Similarities in the criminal background check process across  		states</i></p>
<p>Stakeholder discussions and facility site visits and interviews revealed  		some common criminal background check practices among Arizona, Florida,  		Illinois, and Washington. These commonalities include the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>State statutes mandate that nursing facilities perform checks on  			 CNA certification/licensure status and criminal history</b>. In each of the  			 four states we examined, nursing facilities are required by law to verify that  			 nurse aides seeking employment have active certification and that criminal  			 background checks are completed before hiring. In addition, state certification  			 entities perform criminal background checks and verify that the nurse aide has  			 no disqualifying offenses on their record. </p>

<p><b>Waivers or exemptions are permitted in all four states</b>. While  			 a waiver or exemption process exists in these states, the procedure for  			 granting waivers or exemptions varies widely. For example, Arizona does not  			 permit exemptions to any individual with a history of a felony in the past five  			 years. Illinois permits waivers for a select number of crimes and with the  			 permission of the Director of Public Health. In Illinois, a waiver application  			 of an individual who has been convicted of an offense and who is typically  			 ineligible for a waiver is still accepted, though far fewer exceptions are  			 granted. Florida permits waivers and Washington permits exemptions if  			 applicants follow certain appeal procedures. In Florida, potential CNAs bear  			 the burden of showing sufficient evidence that they should not be disqualified  			 and can be granted waivers under certain conditions set forth by law. (See  			 <b><a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a></b> for Disqualifying Offenses.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Registries contain detailed information that exceeds requirements  			 detailed in federal guidelines</b>. Federal guidelines dictate that registries  			 contain the following information: full name of the individual, identifying  			 information (social security number, address, etc.), the date of certification,  			 and information regarding any substantiated findings of abuse. However, all  			 four states maintain additional information in their registry databases. For  			 example, databases in all four states include some demographic information  			 (e.g., gender, race, education). Databases in Arizona, Florida, and Washington  			 can capture employment status. Illinois collects training information and  			 waiver information. Two states, Illinois and Florida provide information about  			 inactive CNAs. While states reported what their databases have the  			 <i>capacity</i> to collect on all individuals, this level of data is not  			 necessarily collected for each individual in the registry. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>c. Background checks variation across states</i></p>
<p>Despite some commonalities in the process for checking criminal  		background and disqualifying offenses, there is significant variation in how  		states approach screening the long-term care workforce. Differences include the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>In contrast to Florida and Washington, Illinois and Arizona  			 perform criminal background checks on a diverse range of workers</b>. Illinois  			 maintains information on home health aides, personal care aides, and  			 developmental disability aides. Arizona performs criminal background checks on  			 all direct care, human services, and supportive services employees working in  			 residential and long-term care facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>States use a variety of identifying information to perform checks  			 on criminal history and disqualifying offenses</b>. States use a variety of  			 identifying information to perform background checks ranging from more reliable  			 data such as fingerprints to less reliable data such as name and date of birth.  			 For example, Arizona and Florida use fingerprint data for all checks. Illinois  			 uses a combination of name and date of birth to perform an initial check and if  			 this information results in a positive result for criminal history, Illinois  			 runs an additional check using fingerprint data to confirm results. With  			 additional funding received as part of the CMS demonstration, Illinois will  			 move to a fingerprint system in January 2006. Similar to Illinois, Washington  			 uses a combination of name, date of birth, and fingerprint data. In this case,  			 name and date of birth are used to run an initial check and fingerprint data  			 are only used when name and date of birth do not appropriately identify the  			 individual or if a positive result occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>States use a variety of databases to run background checks</b>.  			 In Arizona, fingerprints are run through both state and national (FBI)  			 databases. At the state level, Arizona relies on the Automated Fingerprint  			 Identification System (AFIS) that houses all criminal prints collected in the  			 state. At the national level, Arizona uses the FBI database. Florida uses  			 fingerprints to check for criminal records in the Florida Department of Law  			 Enforcement database. If this state level check results in a positive  			 identification, fingerprint checks are run a second time against the FBI  			 database. Illinois uses name and date of birth to check the state police  			 database. If state level checks result in a positive identification, Illinois  			 utilizes fingerprint data to check the FBI database. Washington uses  			 identifying information such as name and date of birth to run a criminal  			 background check through the Washington State Patrol database. If name and date  			 of birth do not appropriately identify a person (such is the case when two  			 people have the same name and date of birth), Washington utilizes fingerprint  			 data. In addition, Washington will perform fingerprint checks using the FBI  			 database in particular situations (e.g., when a person has recently moved to  			 the state).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In contrast to Florida and Illinois, Arizona and Washington  			 provide information on pending cases of abuse, neglect, or exploitation</b>. In  			 Arizona, entities or individuals submitting background check requests must  			 provide the name, license number, and social security number in order to access  			 whether or not applicants are currently under investigation for abuse, neglect,  			 or exploitation. Washington also includes pending abuse cases filed against  			 workers in their registry. Employers have the discretion to hire, ask the  			 applicant for information regarding the circumstances, or deny employment based  			 on pending charges noted in the registry. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>d. System gaps--limitations of existing screening practices</i></p>
<p>An analysis of background check processes in these four states  		highlighted gaps in the criminal background check system that may lead to  		limitations in the effectiveness of these screening mechanisms. Identifying  		potential limitations to current background check processes may provide ideas  		for states trying to improve their systems and inform stakeholders about the  		complexities of this process. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Criminal background checks only capture activity prior to  			 employment</b>. One of the biggest gaps in the current system is the single  			 point in time nature of the criminal background check. The underlying  			 assumption for checking an individuals criminal history is that  			 individuals who commit certain types of crimes are not appropriate for working  			 in close proximity with vulnerable populations in long-term care settings.  			 There are additional assumptions about the character of individuals with a  			 criminal history that make them less desirable employees. The current system  			 has no method for tracking criminal activity that occurs after the worker is  			 employed. Unless states require periodic review of criminal history on a  			 regular basis, employers have no knowledge of any criminal behavior their  			 employees may engage in once they are working. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Current systems do not effectively capture crimes committed in  			 other states</b>. One of the most common discussions we had with stakeholders  			 centered on states inability to access information about criminal history  			 outside their own state. Privacy protections often prohibit information sharing  			 between states, and information collected in the FBI database relies on  			 states submission--which is often incomplete. Costs of FBI fingerprint  			 checks also prevent some states from checking the national database for every  			 applicant seeking certification or employment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Disqualifying criminal offenses that preclude an individual from  			 obtaining either state certification or employment differ widely across all  			 states</b>. <b><a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a></b> details how all 50 states  			 and the District of Columbia approach the criminal background check process and  			 define disqualifying criminal offenses through their state  			 statutes. States are not consistent in their criteria for blanket  			 disqualifications that prohibit potential nurse aides from working in long-term  			 care settings. Drug charges are a particular issue, as many interview  			 respondents indicated that individuals with a history of drug related crimes  			 are less reliable in terms of work attendance and job commitment, yet few  			 states include drug convictions in their list of disqualifying offenses. In  			 reference to their statutes regarding drug offenses, a representative from one  			 state reported You can <i>use</i> drugs and still work with the elderly;  			 you just cant sell them and work. The rationale for which criminal  			 offenses make the list in each state is inconsistent, and the time delimitation  			 of certain offenses varies across states and lacks evidence to support any  			 preference. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Information delay of criminal background check can put facilities  			 and residents at risk</b>. Facilities can hire employees while their criminal  			 background check is pending. In some states, the criminal background check  			 process can take several months. This may put both the residents and facility  			 at risk as well as waste labor resources if in fact the background check shows  			 criminal activity. Facilities rely on information they receive from the  			 criminal background check and would like this process expedited so they can  			 avoid hiring, training and investing in employees they may need to terminate  			 based on results of the screen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inadequate communication and coordination between relevant  			 stakeholders can impede the process</b>. In all four states, multiple entities  			 participate in the background check process. Consequently, communication and  			 coordination of information across state agencies is critical to the criminal  			 background check process. State and federal legislation can pose barriers to  			 communication across agencies. States have tried to address communication  			 issues. For example, Arizona offers a free quarterly newsletter to the public  			 that contains information on verified cases of abuse, neglect, and  			 misappropriation. This regular communication is one way to increase  			 communication across relevant stakeholders. </p>
<p>Once allegations have been made and an investigation takes place,  			 additional communication is necessary to close the loop and ensure  			 substantiated findings make it to the appropriate registry. Multiple entities  			 can investigate abuse allegations in skilled nursing facilities (state  			 surveyor, APS, ombudsman, etc.), with no systematic coordination or  			 communication of findings across investigative entities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inadequate resources result in gaps in the background check  			 process</b>. Additional financial resources and/or staff would improve the  			 criminal background check process in several ways. Budget limitations and  			 attendant staff allocation issues affect quality, completeness, and timeliness  			 of registry data. For example, understaffing in Washington poses barriers to a  			 comprehensive background check system because state patrol statutes mandate  			 that pending cases must be dropped after 12 months. Inadequate staffing levels  			 lead to unprocessed cases, which result in missed opportunities to review  			 individuals. In addition, states frequently cited the high cost of procuring  			 and processing fingerprint background checks as a barrier within the current  			 system. Many states would rather use fingerprint checks at the state and  			 national level, but simply cannot afford to implement this practice. Due to  			 cost issues, some states are considering shifting the costs of background  			 checks to applicants. However, this may prevent qualified applicants from  			 applying for jobs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Entities performing background checks use data that cannot be  			 easily verified</b>. Applicants can potentially falsify information if entities  			 do not rely on fingerprint data. For example, some states rely on name and date  			 of birth to perform state level background checks, defaulting to more reliable  			 fingerprint data only when name and date of birth result in more than one match  			 or when applicants have recently moved to the state (within three years).  			 Individuals who do not want to submit fingerprint data can easily claim that  			 they have lived in the state for more than three years and thus bypass the more  			 rigorous fingerprint based background check. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inaccurate hits or errors on the criminal background  			 check may falsely exclude qualified workers</b>. Individuals with common names  			 may experience positive hits on their criminal background check  			 when they in fact have not committed a crime. In this situation, some states  			 are able to conduct a fingerprint background check to ensure they are checking  			 the background of the correct individual, but this is not always the case.  			 Individuals often bear the burden for clarifying errors associated with their  			 background check results which is takes time and unnecessarily delays their  			 entry into the workforce. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The background check process often fails to account for  			 unlicensed workers in licensed facilities or individuals working outside  			 licensed facilities</b>. Current processes do not account for the criminal  			 history of workers without licenses (e.g., housekeeping and kitchen staff) in  			 licensed care facilities, yet these individuals often have frequent contact  			 with residents. In addition, states do not have statutes requiring background  			 checks on individuals working outside licensed facilities such as individuals  			 providing home health care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Interpretation of pending cases in the abuse registry  			 is difficult for employers during the hiring process</b>. Solid arguments exist  			 on both sides of the issue of whether or not to include pending cases in abuse  			 registries. One the one hand, including abuse cases that are pending in the  			 registry allows employers to learn if there are issues of misconduct associated  			 with someone they may be trying to hire into their organization. From a  			 conservative standpoint, some employers welcome the information to be  			 safe rather than sorry, and they appreciate the option to pursue  			 details of the pending case with potential applicants they have particular  			 interest in hiring. However, pending cases can be detrimental to a worker  			 seeking a new job position before the case has reached resolution. States are  			 required to investigate all allegations that are brought against an  			 employee--whether frivolous in nature or not. While a case is pending, which  			 can be up to several months, workers under investigation due to a false  			 accusation have difficulty finding employment and are placed into a  			 guilty until proven innocent framework until the case is dismissed.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Some states have adopted a waiver system for direct service  			 workers to appeal a decision to prohibit employment while other states have no  			 appeal system in place</b>. Some state systems are ironclad and  			 there are few opportunities for workers to appeal the decision made by the  			 state. Issues highlighted previously factor into this scenario. Criminal  			 background checks conducted with name and date of birth can often generate  			 false positives for individuals with common names, for which there  			 is little recourse in some states. Similarly, in states where there is no time  			 delimitation associated with offenses, a potentially qualified and capable  			 person may be prohibited to work because of an assault charge they had 20 years  			 ago--regardless of maturation, rehabilitation or contextual factors associated  			 with the crime. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>3. Post-Employment Processes</b></p>
<p>Compared to pre-employment requirements at the federal, state, and  		employer levels, monitoring during the post-employment phase is less formal.  		There are fewer regulations and policies in place to track the criminal  		activity of nurse aides once they are actively employed. State resources are  		allocated primarily to pre-screening activities, with fewer resources and  		requirements focused on training (e.g., in-services, management training),  		monitoring practices or subsequent follow-up criminal background checks.</p>
<p><i>a. Training</i></p>
<p>Discussions with stakeholders at the state and nursing facility levels  		in the four study states revealed that the requirement states place on nursing  		facilities for on-the-job training primarily concern health and safety issues  		under licensure. Many of the facilities interviewed do provide on-going  		training to nurse aides regarding what constitutes abuse, neglect, and  		financial exploitation (committed by peers or residents relatives and  		friends), resident rights, clinical topics, and other related issues. However,  		the frequency and regularity of trainings specifically focused on preventing  		abuse and neglect varies by facility. Several nursing supervisors mentioned  		using potentially problematic behaviors (e.g., raised voices, negative comments  		about residents, delayed responses to call lights, etc.) as teachable  		moments to work with staff to better understand the connection between  		these behaviors and incidents of abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>Directors of nursing and staff development nurses at the facilities  		interviewed rarely, if ever, receive specialized management training that would  		assist them in recognizing incidences of abuse and neglect. They rely primarily  		on their experience in managing potentially difficult scenarios between  		residents and staff. </p>
<p><i>b. On-the-job monitoring</i></p>
<p>On-the-job monitoring is not well-defined, nor are there any state  		requirements to standardize facility practices. In the absence of any state  		requirements, independent and chain facilities reported implementing policies  		such as random drug testing and random criminal background checks to routinely  		monitor existing employees. In addition, facilities interviewed reported a  		variety of strategies to facilitate on-the-job monitoring, including locating  		work spaces for nursing supervisors on the floor, pairing new hires with  		experienced nurse aides, assigning pairs or teams of staff to residents, and  		offering ways for staff to report concerns about the behavior of their peers  		anonymously. </p>
<p><i>c. Complaint investigation and reporting</i></p>
<p>All facilities interviewed follow a similar set of procedures for  		responding to complaints and allegations. Following a complaint, nurse aides  		are suspended without pay while the facility conducts an internal investigation  		and notifies the state about the pending complaint. If the complaint is  		substantiated, the nurse aide is terminated, a report is filed with the state,  		and the nurse aide registry is notified. If the complaint is not substantiated,  		the nurse aide is reinstated with back pay and the state and registry are  		notified. </p>
<p>What complicates this process for employers is the fact that multiple  		entities (e.g., state licensing agency, ombudsman, attorney general, APS, law  		enforcement, etc.) can receive and investigate complaints and allegations  		simultaneously. Process flow charts in <b><a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a></b>  		show the state-specific processes for handling complaints or allegations  		against CNAs. The quality and level of coordination and communication across  		agencies varies by state, which further complicates and compromises the  		timeliness of the investigation process. Nursing facilities reported that the  		process for complaint investigation and resolution can be time-consuming given  		the possibility of multiple entities investigating the same complaint. In  		addition, state entities involved in reporting and investigation indicated that  		they are under-resourced and lack the staff to respond to cases efficiently and  		effectively. During the course of a protracted investigative process, a nurse  		aide under suspension without pay typically seeks other employment. If the  		allegations are not substantiated, employers can lose qualified workers. </p>
<p>The involvement of multiple entities and lack of role clarity among them  		also can be confusing for residents and their advocates in terms of which  		entity or agency to notify regarding a complaint or allegation.</p>
<h3>B. Relationship between Past Criminal Background or  		Incidences of Abuse and Subsequent Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation</h3>
<p>Analyses of nurse aide and abuse registries in Arizona and Kansas  		suggest that there is a correlation between prior history of criminal  		conviction and subsequent incidences of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. We  		were not able to determine which crimes had the strongest association with  		subsequent findings of abuse, neglect or misconduct due to the privacy issues  		associated with sharing criminal background data on individuals. We did not  		have access to the type of crime or date of criminal conviction to further  		elucidate the relationship between prior criminal history and substantiated  		findings of abuse post-employment. States can perform this type of analysis on  		the data in their own administrative files, but the states we partnered with  		for this study did not have the resources to devote specifically to this  		effort. Findings from the two states are presented below.</p>
<p><b>Kansas</b></p>
<p>The Kansas Department of Health and Environment, Health Occupations  		Credentialing Unit analyzed their abuse registry from December 1990 to March  		2005. Over this period, 710 individuals were entered with a substantiated  		finding of abuse, neglect or exploitation. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows  		the distribution of individuals by type of substantiated allegation. Kansas  		calculated the percentage of nurse aides with a substantiated finding of abuse  		that also had a non-disqualifying criminal conviction prior to employment.  		Twenty-one percent of the 710 individuals in the abuse registry also had a  		hit when their criminal background check was conducted prior to  		employment, compared to 14% in the overall population of nurse aides in the  		state. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>Arizona</b></p>
<p>The Arizona Board of Nursing (AZBN) Abuse Registry contains information  		on RN aides under investigation by the AZBN. The AZBN investigates nurse aides  		for the following reasons: (1) a complaint is filed against an active nurse  		aide on-the-job, (2) the criminal background check results in a positive  		hit, or (3) the nurse aide answers yes to previous criminal  		conviction on the state application for certification. The registry contains  		information on pending cases and tracks potential violations, actual  		violations, substantiated findings and outcomes of all investigative actions  		(suspension, fines, additional hearing, case dismissal, etc.). As of April  		2006, the AZBN Abuse Registry contains data on 4,154 individuals. <b>Of the  		4,154 individuals in the Abuse Registry, 1071 (26%) have a prior criminal  		conviction and 829 (20%) have an incidence of previous misconduct</b>. </p>
<p>As of April 2006, there were a total of 20,764 active CNAs in the AZBN  		registry database. According to the AZBN, the number of CNA's that have  		submitted to fingerprints for certification are 13,799 (some nurse aides were  		certified by the state prior to implementation of the state requirement to  		conduct fingerprint background checks). From the population of active nurse  		aides who have submitted fingerprints, 9,426 have had <i>both</i> a state  		(Department of Public Safety (DPS)) and federal (FBI) fingerprint background  		check documented in the state database. <b>Of the 9,426 individuals with  		documented state and federal checks, 6.2% had a positive felon or  		offender hit on the state background check through the DPS and  		10.1% had a positive felon or offender hit on the  		federal background check conducted by the FBI</b>. </p>
<h3>C. Innovative Screening and Monitoring Strategies</h3>
<p>Several aspects of the screening and monitoring process were cited by  		state informants and facilities as innovative practices that contribute to  		ensuring the employment of a high quality long-term care workforce. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Arizona Fingerprint Clearance Card System</b>. The nursing  			 facilities interviewed in Arizona cited the Fingerprint Clearance Card System,  			 implemented in 1999, as an innovative practice for facilitating criminal  			 background checks of employees and monitoring subsequent criminal behavior  			 after they are employed. Arizonas comprehensive Fingerprint Clearance  			 Card System is administered by the DPS to perform background checks on and to  			 track arrest activity of individuals working in positions of direct care and  			 service of potentially vulnerable populations (e.g., nursing facilities, home  			 health agencies, child care agencies, schools etc.). Development of the  			 Fingerprint Clearance Card system occurred through collaborative efforts of  			 five state agencies (Department of Health Services (DHS), Department of  			 Education, Department of Economic Security, Department of Juvenile Corrections,  			 and Administrative Office of the Court) in an effort to improve the quality of  			 the workforce across professional fields. For example, to work in long-term  			 care settings, individuals must obtain a Fingerprint Clearance Card by going  			 through a background check.</p>
<p>It is important to note that technically CNAs are not required by  			 the state to obtain Clearance Cards to work in long-term care settings because  			 they already undergo a criminal background check during the certification  			 process required by law and governed by the AZBN. However, the practice of most  			 nursing facilities is currently to require potential hires to have a Clearance  			 Card and it is common for facilities to require students training to be CNAs to  			 have Clearance Cards before working directly with residents. Because the  			 Fingerprint Clearance Card process was developed collaboratively across five  			 state agencies, the resulting list of disqualifying offenses used is far more  			 expansive than the list specified in the state statute for certifying  			 nurses aides administered by the AZBN.</p>
<p>This Fingerprint Clearance Card system allows law enforcement to  			 identify individuals who are direct care workers serving vulnerable populations  			 when any arrest is made and fingerprints are taken. Upon arrest and booking,  			 fingerprints are entered into a database (AFIS), which sends a flag  			 to the (DPS) for individuals with Fingerprint Clearance Cards. DPS then  			 notifies the appropriate agency representing the field in which the individual  			 is currently employed (in the case of a long-term care employee, DHS would be  			 notified) that the employee has been recently arrested for a crime. Ideally, in  			 the case of a CNA arrest who has a Clearance Card, DHS would contact the AZBN  			 so that employers could be notified of the employees recent conduct. This  			 process gives employers updated information on employee conduct, and addresses  			 the limitation of criminal background checks being performed at a single point  			 in time prior to employment. However, the effectiveness of this notification  			 chain is dependent on the accuracy and currency of the nurse aide registry and  			 breaks down if the registry does not routinely receive updated information  			 regarding changes in employment/employer status.</p>
<p>The Fingerprint Clearance Card is valid for six years and costs  			 $52.00 ($24.00 for the FBI check, $3.00 for the Arizona Bureau, and $25.00 to  			 DPS to support personnel costs and fingerprint technicians). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>When individuals or entities request background check records,  			 offer detailed information</b>. In Arizona, individuals or entities requesting  			 background check records do not simply receive a yes or no regarding the  			 eligibility of an applicant. Instead, background check requests include  			 detailed information such as the types of crimes the applicant has committed.  			 This information may play a role in hiring decisions. If the applicant has a  			 criminal conviction that does not automatically disqualify them from working,  			 the employer can use their own discretion to assess the context of the crime  			 and make an appropriate hiring decision based on their needs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Illinois Nursing Home Sweep identifies workers with  			 existing and relevant arrest warrants after they have cleared the criminal  			 background check prior to employment</b>. In Illinois, state police within the  			 Medicaid Fraud Unit conduct monthly checks of all staff and residents within  			 long-term care facilities that receive Medicaid financing to ascertain if any  			 of these individuals have outstanding warrants for their arrest. The Medicaid  			 Fraud Unit uses discretion to determine which arrest warrants are relevant to  			 pursue based on contextual factors (e.g., warrants for unpaid parking tickets  			 are bypassed, warrants for assault or theft are pursued). Officers arrive at  			 facilities unannounced to make the appropriate arrest. According to  			 the fraud unit in Illinois, arrests are made each month during these sweeps.  			 When this process was first implemented, facilities were not fully supportive  			 and viewed the process as intrusive. However, over time facilities have become  			 accustomed to the process and recognize its benefit. Now many facilities  			 proactively contact the fraud unit requesting the sweep as a means  			 of quality checking current employees without paying for follow up criminal  			 background checks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform background checks a wide variety of individuals that serve  			 people with long-term care needs. Florida performs background checks on any  			 employee that has contact with residents in long-term care facilities. These  			 checks include housekeeping, maintenance and kitchen staff. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Facility Level</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Facilities with adequate resources contract with private  			 companies to conduct their own pre-employment background checks</b>. For the  			 purposes of expediting the hiring process and minimizing potential liability,  			 some facilities (many of which are part of national chains) contract directly  			 with private firms to conduct background checks of potential employees. They  			 report that the costs incurred are warranted because the background checks are  			 conducted more quickly and cover databases from all 50 states. In addition, the  			 list of disqualifying offenses required by corporate human resources policy  			 typically is more stringent than that specified by the state. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Facilities require drug tests on all job applicants</b>. Many  			 facilities cited drug testing as a critical component of the hiring process  			 because of the correlation between drug use and absenteeism, inferior caregiver  			 skills, diminished therapeutic relationships with residents and overall  			 unreliability on the job. Drug testing is considered an asset because of the  			 negative impact drug use can have on the safety of the workplace environment  			 for both staff and residents. The drug testing requirement is also seen as a  			 deterrent for potentially unreliable and problematic staff. Many facilities we  			 interviewed stated that far more applicants are denied employment due to  			 positive drug tests than having a positive hit on their criminal  			 background check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Facilities conduct random criminal background checks  			 and random drug tests annually on existing employees to maintain  			 quality</b>. Some larger chain facilities have corporate requirements to  			 continually check the criminal status and/or drug use of existing employees. In  			 addition to random drug tests for a sample of employees, one corporate chain  			 has implemented random criminal background checks on an employee sample to  			 determine whether existing employees have had relevant criminal convictions  			 after passing the initial screen before hire. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Facilities offer financial incentives to employees for referring  			 successful hires</b>. To address the challenge of recruiting, hiring, and  			 retaining qualified staff, several facilities interviewed offer financial  			 incentive programs, such as bonuses and salary increases, to encourage current  			 employees to refer qualified colleagues for open staff positions. These  			 facilities believe that that peer referrals enhance the likelihood of  			 identifying qualified candidates who will meet the hiring requirements, as well  			 as fit successfully into the organizational culture and community. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>D. Suggestions by Informants to Improve Processes for  		Background Checks and On-the-Job Monitoring</h3>
<p>Informants offered several suggestions for improving the background  		check process. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Create online registries</b>. Representatives from Washington  			 noted that online registries would enable interested parties to check the  			 registry in real time instead of waiting for registry staff to sort through  			 paper for relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Create a national registry</b>. While cost and administrative  			 issues present barriers to the creation of a national registry, representatives  			 across states noted that a national registry would result in a much improved  			 background check system since individuals would not be able to cross state  			 lines to gain employment if disqualified for employment in another state.  			 </p>

<h3>A. Conclusion</h3>
<p>The efficacy of nurse aide registries and criminal background checks in  		preventing resident abuse in nursing facilities is difficult to ascertain.  		Making an accurate assessment regarding the effectiveness of these practices is  		difficult because every state has a different process for screening and  		disqualifying potential workers, documenting information in their registries,  		tracking subsequent employment or complaint data, investigating abuse  		allegations, reporting relevant findings, and coordinating efforts across state  		entities. Extensive variation across states affects the ability to make a  		definitive statement about the efficacy of these strategies to ensure a  		qualified workforce. The in-depth examination of four states revealed that some  		aspects of these systems work well, but limitations exist in each state that  		affect the overall utility of these practices. There is, however, consensus  		across stakeholders in all four states that criminal background checks are a  		necessary element of the hiring process. The technology, coordination  		capabilities and infrastructure exist through on-line registries, fingerprint  		databases and abuse registries to help employers make the best hiring decisions  		possible to protect the elderly in their care. States are building on their  		knowledge, experience, and capabilities to streamline these processes, but  		there is still room for improvement while balancing the resource intensiveness  		of making these changes. </p>
<p>It is clear that relying on criminal background checks and nurse aide  		registries are not enough to prevent or reduce abuse in nursing facilities.  		Ongoing training, education and supervision for workers providing direct care  		are also key components to maintaining a quality workforce. A summary of our  		overall project conclusions are provided below.</p>
<p><b><i>Criminal background checks are a valuable tool for employers  		during the hiring process and their use does not limit the pool of potential  		job applicants</i></b>. Stakeholders agree that conducting criminal background  		checks on potential employees is an important aspect of the hiring process to  		reduce the likelihood of hiring someone who has potential to harm residents in  		long-term care. There is widespread acceptance throughout the long-term care  		industry (similar to that of the child care industry), that this practice  		serves to protect vulnerable adults and ultimately prevent abuse. By virtue of  		prohibiting potential workers from certification or employment who have a  		disqualifying criminal conviction, the pool of individuals entering  		the long-term care field would theoretically be smaller. However, none of the  		nursing facilities interviewed experienced any negative impact on their  		applicant pool as a result of this requirement. According to sources from two  		state nurse aide registries, the number of CNAs continues to rise each year,  		further indicating that the criminal background check requirement is not  		significantly restricting the pool of potential workers entering this field.  		From the perspective of employers, reducing the amount of time it takes to  		receive background check results would improve the current system. </p>
<p><b><i>A correlation exists between criminal history and incidences of  		abuse</i></b>. Based on data we received from Arizona and Kansas, it does  		appear that nurse aides who had a previous criminal conviction  		(non-disqualifying offense) had higher rates of substantiated abuse than nurse  		aides without a criminal history. Due to limitations with access to criminal  		history data, it is not clear which criminal offenses (if any) have the  		strongest correlation with subsequent findings of abuse, nor can we determine  		if the recency of a criminal conviction is a contributable factor in the  		correlation between criminal history and abuse. However, the analysis of these  		two states does provide evidence to support the rationale for checking the  		criminal history of potential direct care workers as a screening mechanism for  		quality.</p>
<p><b><i>Criminal background checks are only one element of preventing  		abuse</i></b>. Despite a connection between past criminal history and  		subsequent allegations of abuse, stakeholders consistently reported the  		following as effective strategies for preventing abuse, (many of which are not  		formal state or industry policy): adequate supervision/monitoring, presence of  		managers on the floor, decreasing staff burnout, adequate staffing levels,  		rotating nurse aides on the floor to alleviate pressure of difficult residents,  		increased education and training, obtaining meaningful employment references  		(beyond verification of employment dates), valuing and respecting staff,  		creative recruitment incentives to retain committed staff, instituting a  		drug-free workplace policy, minimizing temporary hires, and pointing out  		negative behaviors in the moment and using them as a staff development  		opportunity. </p>
<p><b><i>There are fewer policies in place that support or reinforce  		post-employment strategies than pre-employment to ensure a qualified  		workforce</i></b>. This study revealed that there are significantly more  		resources allocated to the pre-employment phase of ensuring a qualified  		long-term care workforce than the post-employment phase. The policy focus at  		the state and facility level is on pre-screening applicants before employment  		and there are structures and regulations in place that support this effort.  		However, once a worker is hired and working in the field, there is less  		guidance regarding how best to train, continuously educate and monitor existing  		employees. As stated before, most states have no process in place to notify  		employers if an active employee commits a crime that would have prohibited them  		from working during their background check prior to employment. In the event of  		employee complaints or allegations of abuse, the effectiveness of state systems  		often breaks down due to a lack of coordination between multiple state entities  		involved in the investigation and reporting process. Duplicative efforts waste  		state resources, prolong investigations and often keep employees out of the  		workforce unnecessarily. </p>
<h3>B. Policy Considerations</h3>
<p><b>National Level Considerations</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>The challenge of individual state registries</i></b>.  			 Individual state registries and the barriers associated with data sharing  			 across states, limit employer access to useful information about substantiated  			 abuse findings against workers found in other states. Since workers may have  			 been employed in more than one state, a national nurse aide registry has been  			 frequently mentioned as one way to address the issue of long-term care workers  			 with substantiated findings of abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation  			 crossing state lines to work in another state. Several issues may pose barriers  			 for the creation of a national nurse aide registry. First, transfer of  			 information across various state and national agencies may be difficult due to  			 state laws and agency ownership of data. Second, the cost of  			 creating and maintaining a national database would require commitment of both  			 staff time and funds from both states and national agencies. Third,  			 certification procedures and requirements vary across states, which further  			 challenge any effort to standardize the process nationwide. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Use of disqualifying offenses and waivers</i></b>. It is  			 important to strike a balance between the need to protect vulnerable citizens  			 from harm and creating unnecessary barriers to employment for qualified  			 individuals, further reducing the potential pool of long-term care workers.  			 There is a paucity of literature examining nurse aides and criminal recidivism  			 and propensity to commit abuse. Criminal recidivism research shows that a  			 history of past criminal convictions may be a possible predictor of future  			 behavior.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> Other  			 research by Cohen (1996) reports that the probability of future dangerous  			 behavior of criminal offenders increases when circumstances are similar to past  			 situations in which criminal behaviors occurred, which has implications for  			 workers who have substantiated findings of resident abuse.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A review of Illinoiss Department of Public Health waiver  			 process for individuals certified for work in hospitals and nursing facilities  			 shows that individuals with criminal records can work in the health care field  			 with minimal impact on patient safety. In Illinois, individuals with specific  			 criminal convictions are banned from working in certain health care professions  			 but can apply for waivers. In an examination of waiver applications from 1996  			 to 2003, 5,706 individuals with convictions applied for waivers. 4,130 (72%) of  			 these individuals were granted waivers. Ninety-seven individuals (or 2.3% of  			 the 4,130 individuals) had their waivers revoked; 38 individuals had revoked  			 waivers because of substantiated finding of abuse, neglect, or theft and 59  			 individuals due to a second disqualifying conviction.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Additional research in the area of criminal recidivism, specifically  			 in relation to elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation is necessary to  			 develop evidence based lists of disqualifying offenses. Justification for the  			 inclusion or exclusion of various crimes that constitute states lists of  			 disqualifying offenses is unclear, and the lack of consensus across states on  			 this issue illustrates the complexity of making a solid connection between past  			 criminal activity and the proclivity to commit abuse in long-term care  			 settings. In the absence of such evidence, policymakers and employers must  			 still balance the need to protect vulnerable populations with the need to  			 maintain an adequate direct care workforce to accommodate a growing older adult  			 population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>The screening process requires a significant amount of  			 resources</i></b>. As states make efforts to improve their screening processes  			 (e.g., expanding the criminal background check to other states or incorporating  			 federal level checks, expediting the turnaround time for results, expanding the  			 screening process to other types of workers), the costs will inevitably  			 increase. States will need additional capacity (staff and financial resources)  			 to meet the demand for quality screens on increased numbers of workers in a  			 timely manner. It is important to balance the financial burden across state  			 agencies, employers and direct service workers in an equitable manner so that  			 screening processes can continue to improve. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>State Level Considerations</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>Keeping registry data current to maximize their  			 utility</i></b>. A recent OIG study revealed that nurse aide registries may not  			 always contain the most up-to-date, or accurate information. In a survey of 200  			 randomly selected long-term care facility administrators, 44% (87 individuals)  			 surveyed stated that they periodically rechecked nurse aide registries to  			 ensure that substantiated findings had been posted to the registry. Fifteen  			 administrators found that a nurse aide previously listed as registered and free  			 of a substantiated finding of abuse was later listed to be unqualified for work  			 due to a substantiated finding, failure to attain active registration status,  			 or failure to be certified as a nurse aide. The nurse aide registry is only  			 helpful to employers if the information is current. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Increasing the utility of the nurse aide registry with public  			 awareness and education</i></b>. In most states, employers are the only ones  			 who benefit from the information contained in the nurse aide registry. By  			 increasing consumer knowledge and use of the registry, the state can further  			 protect the public by offering additional resources and information on  			 individual long-term care workers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Incorporating alternative screening mechanisms</i></b>.  			 Nursing home administrators use several practices (not required by federal  			 regulations) to screen potential employees and to monitor current nurse aides.  			 Eighty-five percent of administrators surveyed for a recent OIG report used  			 additional screening procedures such as criminal background checks, and/or  			 personal and employment reference checks.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> Implementing <i>random</i> drug tests and  			 criminal background checks on existing employees may be another way to monitor  			 employees after they have cleared original pre-employment screens. Conducting  			 drug testing may be a more effective method for screening out individuals with  			 a criminal history in drug abuse rather than a comprehensive ban.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> Findings demonstrate the need  			 to use creative and multi-pronged strategies for screening and monitoring  			 direct care paraprofessionals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Examining states practices related to investigating and  			 reporting abuse</i></b>. Current state practices for investigating and  			 reporting abuse cases appear duplicative and may lack adequate coordination  			 across entities. This creates overlap for agencies conducting the  			 investigation, burden for the employers, and a protracted suspension period for  			 the direct service worker involved.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="research" id="research">V. CONSIDERATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH</a></h2>
<p>There are several areas for future research that may further inform this  		issue but were beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<ul><li>Examining the use of screening mechanisms for additional direct care  		  paraprofessional workers such as home health aides, etc.</li>
<li>Exploring the possibility of conducting criminal background checks  		  for direct care paraprofessional workers through a national and international  		  system.</li>
<li>Gaining a better understanding of how state appeal processes work for  		  individuals flagged during criminal background checks.</li>
<li>Exploring the barriers individuals with criminal history (but not  		  disqualifying offenses) experience in gaining employment even when they have  		  appropriate certification or licensure.</li>
<li>Gaining a better understanding of the reporting and investigations  		  process when a resident brings a case of abuse, neglect, and financial  		  exploitation to the attention of facility staff.</li>
<li>Gaining a better understanding of post-employment risk factors for  		  abuse. </li>

<h2><a name="appendB" id="appendB">APPENDIX B: PROCESS FLOW CHARTS--SCREENING AND  		COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION</a></h2>
<p>Through our interviews with state agencies in the four case study states  		(Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Washington), we discovered that each state  		differs in its approach to screening nurse aides before certification and  		employment. The process for investigating abuse allegations and reporting  		subsequent findings to appropriate state agencies also differs by state. The  		following flow charts illustrate the screening and investigative processes for  		the four states we examined.</p>

<h3>Matrix 1: Overview Across States</h3>
<p>This matrix provides an overview of state requirements and practices for  		using criminal background checks in the certification and employment of  		CNAs.<sup><font><a href="#noteC1">1</a></font></sup> The process for  		criminal background checks varies across states at the certification and  		employment levels in terms of the use of state and/or federal level checks and  		disqualifying offenses. Twenty states require criminal background checks on  		CNAs prior to certification (all states reported state level checks with 11  		states requiring additional federal level checks). Forty-one states require  		criminal background checks on CNAs prior to employment (37 states reported  		state level checks with 22 states requiring additional federal level  		checks).</p>

<p>This matrix provides details on regulations for certification and  		employment of CNAs across states. There are two separate processes and  		requirements prior to certification and employment of CNAs in terms of criminal  		background checks, disqualifying offenses, and other consideration made in each  		process. The states differ in terms of which felonies or offenses are included  		in their list of disqualifying offenses as well as the look back periods for  		prohibitive disqualifying offenses. For example, the look back period in  		Colorado is ten years for certain disqualifying offenses, while for other  		offenses there is no look back period. The look back period in Delaware ranges  		from 5-10 years depending on the type of offense, and Virginia grants  		exemptions for offenses committed more than five years prior if the individual  		has only one misdemeanor.</p>

A full set of  			 fingerprints taken by AZ Department of Public Safety for licensure of persons  			 providing direct care, home health or supportive services.

<p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has contracted  		with The Lewin Group to assist them with a new study examining the use of  		screening mechanisms and on-the-job monitoring activities by long term care  		employers in ensuring a qualified long-term care workforce. ASPE is  		particularly interested in this issue because of the quickly aging long-term  		care workforce, high turnover rate, and limit on new pools of direct care  		workers. This project is also intended to inform current work at Centers for  		Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to conduct pilot projects to experiment  		with improved ways of conducting background checks and evaluating the  		effectiveness of various methods for preventing the employment of abusive  		long-term care workers. </p>

<h3>TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP INITIAL INTERVIEW DISCUSSION  		GUIDE</h3>
<p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></p>
<p>Thank you for agreeing to serve on the Office of the Assistant Secreatry  		for Planning and Evaluations (ASPEs) technical advisory group for  		ensuring a qualified long-term care workforce. ASPE has contracted with The  		Lewin Group to assist them with a new study examining the use of screening  		mechanisms and on-the-job monitoring activities by long-term care employers in  		ensuring a qualified long-term care workforce. ASPE is particularly interested  		in this issue because of the quickly aging long-term care workforce, high  		turnover rate, and limit on new pools of direct care workers. This project is  		also intended to inform current work at Center for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS) to conduct pilot projects to experiment with improved ways of  		conducting background checks and evaluating the effectiveness of various  		methods for preventing the employment of abusive long-term care workers. </p>
<p>As a member of the Technical Advisory Group, we are asking you to  		provide feedback and direction to ASPE and The Lewin Group on key project  		activities to ensure the project outcomes are field and policy relevant. Today,  		we hope that you can provide feedback on:</p>
<ol><li><i>The work plan; and</i></li>
<li><i>Site selection including:</i><br /><ol type="a"><li><i>states and facilities to visit,</i></li>
<li><i>key stakeholders we should speak to at those sites,  				and</i></li>
<li><i>important discussion questions for the interviews.</i></li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p><b><i>Background Questions (only ask these questions if we have not  		spoken to them previously):</i></b></p>
<p>Before we discuss these specific items, we want to learn a little more  		about your background and interest in the quality of the long-term care  		workforce. </p>
<ol><li><i>Please tell us a little more about your work and interest in the  		  quality of the long-term care workforce.</i></li>
<li><i>From your perspective, what are the most important issues for us  		  to consider in terms of quality of the long-term care workforce?</i></li>
</ol><p><b><i>Feedback on the Work Plan </i></b></p>
<p>You have had the opportunity to review our project work plan which has  		four major components:</p>
<ul><li>Secondary data analysis of three selected states CNA and resident  		  abuse registries;</li>
<li>Stakeholder discussions via four site visits;</li>
<li>Follow up discussions with several national experts and other  		  stakeholders; and</li>
<li>A final report.</li>
</ul><ol><li><i>Does the work plan adequately address the following study  		  objectives: </i><br /><ol type="a"><li>To establish an understanding of the current screening processes  				for the long-term care workforce;</li>
<li>To describe the association between direct care workers with  				certain previous criminal histories and previous incidences of neglect with  				proclivity towards abuse, neglect and financial exploitation; </li>
<li>To develop a better understanding of the extent to which  				employers are limiting an important group of potential direct care  				paraprofessionals by screening out potentially viable employees with certain  				criminal histories inappropriately; and</li>
<li>To describe innovative approaches to hiring and monitoring direct  				care workers, including the use and interpretation of background checks, and  				employee training and supervision practices?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>If No to any of the above, what changes to the work plan do you  		  suggest to ensure the study objectives are met? </i></li>
<li><i>Does the work plan reflect research that would add value to the  		  existing research and understanding of: </i><br /><ol type="a"><li>Improving the quality of care provided in long-term care  				settings; and</li>
<li>Ensuring a committed and qualified long-term care workforce?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p><b><i>Feedback on the Site Visits </i></b></p>
<p>The project team plans to conduct site visits to four states. We propose  		visiting the three states that are currently conducting the registry analysis  		(Kansas, Arizona, and Alaska) and an additional state. The visits are intended  		to help us understand:</p>
<ul><li>How long-term care employers interpret and use criminal background  		  checks in their hiring decision and practices;</li>
<li>The efficacy of state registries in documenting providers with  		  incidences of abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation of residents; and  		  </li>
<li>The training or supervision of long-term care workers with previous  		  histories of abuse, neglect, and or financial exploitation.</li>
</ul><p>We plan to interview in each state the following individuals:</p>
<ul><li>State ombudsmen;</li>
<li>State nursing board representatives;</li>
<li>Nursing home administrators;</li>
<li>Front-line supervisors; </li>
<li>CNAs at each long-term care facility site; and</li>
<li>Residents or resident representatives from each case study site.</li>
</ul><ol><li><i>Do you have any suggestions for how the fourth study state should  		  be selected? </i></li>
<li><i>Who are the key state level informants and local providers we  		  should interview during our site visit (suggestions of names or  		  positions)?</i></li>
<li><i>What questions should we ask during the state level interviews?  		  What questions should we ask during the facility level interviews? </i></li>
</ol><p><b><i>Wrap Up</i></b></p>
<p>Our plan is to conduct the site visits and discussions with experts  		during this spring and summer and then hold a teleconference with you and the  		rest of the advisory group late summer to discuss our major findings from both  		the quantitative and qualitative analysis as well as to discuss a proposed  		outline for the final report. </p>
<p><i>Those are all the questions we have for you--do you have any  		questions for us? </i></p>
<p>Thank you for your time and helpful feedback. If you have some more  		thoughts after our conversation today, please feel free to contact [provide  		contact name and information]. </p>

<h2><a name="appendF" id="appendF">APPENDIX F: SCREENING MECHANISMS USED IN THE CHILD  		CARE INDUSTRY</a></h2>
<p>Each state develops unique child care workforce regulations and  		requirements. To examine individual states rules regarding child care  		workforce regulations, five states were selected: Michigan, Alaska, California,  		Arizona, and Kansas. The following information outlines key findings regarding  		child care workforce regulations for these states.</p>
<h3>MICHIGAN</h3>
<p>In Michigan, the Department of Consumer and Industry Services lists  		guidelines for the licensing of child day care centers. The rule states that a  		licensee must:</p>
<ol><li>Demonstrate to the department that he or she is of good moral  		  character as defined in the good moral character act.</li>
<li>Submit to a Michigan department of state police criminal history  		  check and a family independence agency check for a history of abuse and  		  neglect</li>
<li>Notify and submit new hires credential to the department.</li>
<li>Develop a written screening policy for all staff and volunteers who  		  have contact with children.</li>
<li>Have all staff at the time of hire sign a written statement that they  		  are aware that abuse and neglect are against the law, they have been informed  		  of centers policies on child abuse and neglect, and that they are mandated by  		  law to report cases of abuse and neglect. </li>
</ol><p>The department prohibits the presence of staff in a child care center  		who have been convicted of child abuse or neglect, or have been convicted of a  		felony involving harm or threatened harm. Records of such acts are placed on  		the central registry for substantiated abuse or neglect in the state. Further,  		the state also required the minimum presence of two staff members at any one  		time in the centers. They have strict rules of discipline prohibited by staff,  		which includes any physical or emotional forms of punishment.<sup><font><a href="#noteF1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>ALASKA</h3>
<p>Alaskas Department of Health and Social Services has established laws  		for the licensure of child care facilities. They require evidence that the  		licensee has sufficient experience, training, or education in fulfilling the  		care giving duties, and they require each person to submit fingerprints to the  		Department of Public Safety to conduct state and national criminal background  		checks from criminal justice information.<sup><font><a href="#noteF2">2</a></font></sup> In addition, as a way of monitoring the  		licensee, the department requires an annual self-monitoring report. The  		department will not grant licenses or allow individuals to have contact with  		children in a child care facility if they have a history of:</p>
<ul><li>domestic violence;</li>
<li>alcohol or substance abuse;</li>
<li>within the last ten years, indicted on charges of stalking, assault,  		  arson, reckless endangerment, perjury;</li>
<li>endangering the welfare of a child in the second degree;</li>
<li>neglect or abuse of a child; or</li>
<li>physical, mental health, or behavioral problems that pose a risk to  		  well-being of children.</li>
</ul><p>For licensed child care facilities with one or more employees or regular  		volunteers, the department mandates that before employment to work with  		children, employees or volunteers must meet personnel qualifications, must be  		of reputable character, and have must submit a criminal justice information  		report with two fingerprints for hiring clearance. They also rule that any  		employee or volunteer, who has a record of child abuse or has given a child  		alcohol, tobacco, or a controlled substance, must be removed from the  		center.<sup><font><a href="#noteF3">3</a></font></sup> The child care  		facility is required to keep written records of all employees, and permit a  		licensing representative to review records. </p>
<h3>CALIFORNIA</h3>
<p>The California Department of Social Services has established child care  		center general licensing requirements. Prior to employment or initial presence  		in the child care facility, the department conducts criminal record review of  		any person in the child care facility who has contact with children, in  		addition to the licensee applicant for the child care facility. Under the  		California Department of Justice, there is the Child Abuse Central Index which  		maintains statewide, multi-jurisdictional, centralized index of child abuse  		investigation reports. Each child protection agency is required to forward  		reports of every child abuse incident it investigates to the California  		Department of Justice. Criminal record clearance is necessary for all persons  		in the child care facility who are also required to submit two fingerprints to  		the Department of Justice to search FBI criminal history records as well. </p>
<p>If after the criminal background check, a person is found to have  		convicted of a sex offense against a minor, inflicted any cruel or inhuman  		corporal punishment or injury upon a child, or have been convicted of a felony  		or criminal offense specified by the department, this persons employment  		will be immediately terminated and will be barred from entering the child care  		facility.<sup><font><a href="#noteF4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>ARIZONA</h3>
<p>In Arizona, the Department of Health Services has guidelines for child  		care facilities to follow. The department requires that an applicant for a  		license to run a child care facility must submit all credentials, along with a  		copy of a two fingerprints and criminal history release form. In addition, the  		licensee must ensure that each staff member at the facility submit two  		fingerprints to the Department of Public Safety within seven working days after  		becoming a staff member. </p>
<p>As part of the licensees responsibilities, they shall ensure that  		during hours of operation, a parent, or representative from the department,  		local health department, child protective services, or local fire department,  		be allowed immediate access to the facilities. Staff members are mandated to  		report all suspected or alleged child abuse or neglect to Child Protective  		Services, and within 24-hours must notify the department as well. Licensees  		must keep staff records and reports on file throughout the period of  		employment. </p>
<p>Each licensee must provide training to each staff member who provides  		child care services to children within ten days of the starting date of  		employment or volunteer service. The training includes: health and nutritional  		requirements, child guidance and methods of discipline, child abuse or neglect  		detection, prevention, reporting, and accident and emergency  		procedures.<sup><font><a href="#noteF5">5</a></font></sup> A licensee  		must ensure that staff members maintain consistent, reasonable rules and  		limitations for a childs behavior, and must explain to the child why a  		particular behavior is not allowed. No staff member is permitted to use a  		method of discipline that could cause harm to the health or welfare of the  		child, no corporal punishment, no restraints or medications used in  		disciplines, and no discipline administered to any child by another child. As a  		disciplinary measure, a provider may place a child in time out. </p>
<p>Complaints about a provider or child care facility may be registered  		with the department. The department will investigate allegations and shall  		maintain records of all complaints against a provider. This information will be  		available to parents and to the general public upon request permitted by  		law.<sup><font><a href="#noteF6">6</a></font></sup> This practice  		makes past complaints available to employers about prospective providers. </p>
<h3>KANSAS</h3>
<p>The Kansas Department of Health and Environment established child care  		licensing and registration laws. They have the power to grant licenses for  		child care facilities and have access to the premises for inspection. The law  		states that no person shall work in the child care facility who: </p>
<ul><li>Has a felony conviction for a crime against persons, or as a juvenile  		  committed an act that would constitute as a felony as an adult.</li>
<li>Has a felony conviction under the controlled substances act.</li>
<li>Has committed an act of physical, mental, or emotional abuse or  		  neglect or sexual abuse. </li>
<li>Has had a child declared, in any state, to have been deprived or in  		  need based on allegations of physical, mental, or emotional abuse or neglect or  		  sexual abuse.</li>
<li>Has had parental rights terminated.</li>
</ul><p>Under the department, each child care facility must register each  		employee or volunteer in the facility. Within one week of new hire, the name  		and birth date of the person must be filed with the department for the purpose  		of criminal history and child abuse registry information histories. Each person  		caring for children must also go through a health assessment no later than 30  		days after employment and must meet all health testing and safety requirements.  		There is also a written discipline policy for methods of guidance. It is  		prohibited to use: corporal punishment (spanking, slapping, etc.), verbal  		abuse, binding or restricting movement, withholding food, misusing  		treatments.<sup><font><a href="#noteF7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Although there are similarities in child care workforce laws among  		states, this five state examination highlights the significant flexibility  		states have in determining screening regulations for the child care  		workforce.</p>
