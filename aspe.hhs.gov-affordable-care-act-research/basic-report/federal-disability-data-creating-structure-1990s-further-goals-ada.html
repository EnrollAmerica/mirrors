<hr /><h2>PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Landmark legislation has the power to change people's lives for many  		years to come. The ADA, signed into law on July 26 1990, is landmark  		legislation for Americans with disabilities. The four goals of the  		ADA--equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and  		economic self-sufficiency--are broad in scope and bold in nature.</p>
<p>The ADA is not the first piece of landmark legislation. in this century,  		we have seen the enactment among others of the Social Security Act of 1935, the  		Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Social Security Amendments of 1965, under  		which Medicare and Medicaid were created. We have a strong statistical  		structure in, place to measure the progress and evaluate the effects of this  		earlier legislation. However, no similar statistical structure exists to  		describe the role of disability in American society or to monitor compliance  		with the ADA.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to examine how Federal disability data in  		the 1990's can structured to be useful in policy debates that will further the  		goals of the ADA.</p>
<h2>WHY DO WE NEED DISABILITY DATA?</h2>
<p>We need disability data, because quite simply disability 'is critically  		important. Depending on how disability is defined, there are over 40 million  		Americans with disabilities of one kind or another. This makes people with  		disabilities one of the largest constituencies in the country. We know little  		about them.</p>
<p>First, many Federal programs serve the needs of persons with  		disabilities. Secondly, disability is a major Federal effort and include: (1)  		programs that provide cash assistance, such as Social Security Disability  		Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Black Lung  		program; (2) programs that provide health insurance and direct medical care  		such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs health  		programs, and CHAMPUS for the Handicapped; (3) programs that provide a range of  		direct supportive services; such as those from the Administration on  		Developmental Disabilities; the Maternal and Child Health Block Grants;  		Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grants; State Grants for Children  		with Disabilities; State Operated Programs for Handicapped Children; Preschool  		Grants Program; and Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program; and, (4)  		programs that pertain to rehabilitation, such as the Basic Vocational  		Rehabilitation Service program.</p>
<p>The Federal government is also involved in funding basic research  		designed to enable persons with disabilities to lead independent lives. For  		example, there are programs in NASA, the DVA, and DoD's National Strategic  		Defense Initiative which adapt defense and space-age technology for  		rehabilitative purposes. Finally, Congress mandated the establishment in FY  		1991 of the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) within  		the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The budgetary importance of all these programs is tremendous. In fiscal  		year 1989, 8 percent of Federal outlays or $85 billion was spent on Federal  		programs targeted just on nonelderly persons with disabilities. obviously,  		persons with disabilities and the programs which serve them are critically  		important. And obviously, it is crucial to have accurate and timely information  		on persons with disabilities, particularly in light of the ADA.</p>
<h2>WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DISABILITY IN THE U.S.?</h2>
<p>In order to monitor ADA compliance and perform disability policy  		research, we need to be able to describe the population with disabilities, to  		determine the effects of current programs, and to assess the effects of program  		changes. A very important use for data is modeling the effects of proposed  		program or policy changes and coming up with estimates of the number of people  		who would be affected and the amount of money that such changes would cost. In  		these days of constrained resources, cost estimates are an absolute necessity  		for sound program planning.</p>
<p>Not just any information will do. A broad array of data are needed in  		addition to information just on disability. Specifically since Federal programs  		rely on other criteria for eligibility, we need information on other aspects of  		a person's life besides disability, such as income, assets, and work experience  		(to name a few). Secondly, definitions of disability typically vary by program  		and this can be problematic. Thirdly, persons with disabilities are not all  		alike. They include people with chronic mental illness, those with  		developmental disabilities, persons with mobility limitations, and those with  		chronic illnesses, to name a few. Finally, persons with disabilities cut across  		all ages from newborns to centenarians--with different needs for each age  		group. All this heterogeneity makes it difficult to design disability surveys  		and to translate survey results into policy analyses.</p>
<h2>WHAT DATA DO WE HAVE?</h2>
<p>National population-based surveys underlie much of what we know about  		many topics including disability. National population-based surveys are those  		which obtain information on individual people and their families by selecting a  		national sample of addresses and interviewing the people who live there. Nearly  		all such surveys are collected by the Federal government and many have been in  		place for decades. These surveys are complex, expensive, and take years to  		plan.</p>
<p>Numerous Federal surveys are in existence, none of which focus primarily  		on disability. That was not always the case. The Social Security Administration  		conducted the Surveys of Disability and Work every few years beginning in the  		early 1960's. The purpose of these surveys was to measure the extent of  		disability in the working-age population (18-64) and to specifically examine  		the experience of disabled workers and their families for use in the SSDI  		program.</p>
<p>The last Survey of Disability and Work was conducted in 1978. No other  		disability survey has occurred since that time. Furthermore, while the Surveys  		of Disability and Work dealt exclusively on the working-age population, we have  		never had a national population-based disability survey which focused on all  		ages or on all causes of disability.</p>
<p>As a result, we know almost nothing about some very important  		policy-relevant groups, such as children with disabilities and people with  		developmental disabilities. For example, estimates of the number of children  		with disabilities range from 1 to 10 million. We don't know which estimate is  		the most accurate and we know little about these children or their families.  		This became problematic when faced with deciding what the impact of the  		<b>Zebley</b> decision would be. As for developmental disabilities, we don't  		even know how many people in this country are developmentally disabled, let  		alone how many reside in the community or what services they need or use.</p>
<p>Besides national population-based surveys, we also have administrative  		records for specific Federal programs on disability. However, this information  		is limited to people who receive program benefits, not those who could  		potentially receive benefits. . Furthermore, confidentiality restrictions limit  		data access to only a few agency staff. We also have epidemiological studies or  		State data, which are useful for specific studies. Therefore, to have an impact  		on disability data in the 1990's, it is probably wisest to concentrate on  		national population-based surveys.</p>
<h2>WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE?</h2>
<p>A national comprehensive survey totally devoted to disability would  		probably not be ready at least until the year 2000, even if we decided today to  		create and support one. We need to collect data on ADA compliance before the  		end of this decade and we need to do it in a cost-effective manner. The most  		practical way to do this is to build off existing surveys by adding or  		modifying questions on disability. Although there are dozens of Federal  		surveys, there are several major or workhorse surveys which serve as the basis  		for almost everything we know about social policy. The surveys are:</p>
<ul><li>the Decennial Census</li>
<li>the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)</li>
<li>the Current Population Survey (CPS)</li>
<li>the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)</li>
</ul><p>These basic surveys have all collected disability data in some way and  		at some time, but with the exception of the NHIS, disability data have been  		collected on an ad hoc, not a routine basis. Even on the NHIS, routine  		collection of disability data has mainly consisted of questions on limitation  		of activity.</p>
<p>During the past few years, all of these surveys have had a disability  		component and all have been approached to add more information on disability.  		The most ambitious and promising source of disability data and the only one  		which addresses they four goals of the ADA is the 1993/94 Disability Survey,  		which is a supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), planned  		to begin in April 1993 and continue through the end of 1994. This is not solely  		a disability survey, but a disability survey spun off of a health survey.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS THE 1993/94 DISABILITY SURVEY?</h2>
<p>The NHIS, sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),  		contains a 40-minute core interview of a national household sample. The  		interview covers health status, health care utilization, conditions, and  		limitations of activity. The contents of the core questionnaire have  		essentially remained the same since 1957. In addition to the NHIS core, there  		is also a 30-minute supplementary interview, the topic of which changes every  		year. During 1993 and 1994, this supplement will be devoted to disability.  		Results could be available as early as the middle of 1994.</p>
<p>The 1993/94 Disability Survey grew out of a coordinated effort at the  		Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to obtain data on disability.  		The Departmental Coordinating Group on Disability Data was formed in 1989 to  		establish a framework for disability data. This was accomplished by reviewing  		existing data, identifying gaps, and interviewing both DHHS technical staff and  		policymakers about their disability data needs.</p>
<p>In the interview phase, DHHS policymakers indicated a range of data  		needs on disability. These included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i><b>What are the characteristics of people with disabilities who  			 rely on DHHS programs?</b></i> While program records contain characteristics of  			 people with disabilities, data are limited and rarely contain information on  			 family characteristics, such as health insurance coverage and income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Why is growth in SSI and SSDI enrollment and costs so  			 high?</b></i> Applications for SSI and SSDI grew 12 percent from 1990 to 1991  			 compared to only 4 percent between 1988 and 1989.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Why is employment among persons with disabilities so  			 low?</b></i> Reasons why some people with the same disabilities work while  			 others do not are unclear. Although people with disabilities have relatively  			 low employment rates, many do work. In 1984, 9½ percent of those  			 receiving SSI or SSDI were employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>What is the extent of disability among children?</b></i> As a  			 result of the <b>Zebley</b> Supreme Court decision and the new SSA childhood  			 regulations, the number of children on SSI is growing rapidly about 100  			 thousand children were added last year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>How do persons with mental retardation and other developmental  			 disabilities access community services?</b></i> In 1991, per capita Medicaid  			 costs for persons in intermediate-care facilities for, the mentally retarded  			 (ICF-MRs) were $52,700--an increase of 40 percent over 4 years. We know almost  			 nothing about the community side. We need to know more about these individuals:  			 their numbers, characteristics, the services they use and the costs of these  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>How does access to health care vary for people with  			 disabilities?</b></i> The cause and the stage of disabling conditions play a  			 major role in access to health care, but that role is unclear. People with the  			 most severe disabilities use 6 times more physician visits and 3½ times  			 more hospital stays than those with no disabilities. Sources of health  			 insurance coverage also vary--51 percent of those with the most severe  			 disabilities are on Medicare or Medicaid compared to 4 percent of those with no  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>What is the impact of racial/ethnic differences in  			 disability?</b></i> Disability varies by race and ethnicity, but we don't know  			 why. Among nonelderly adults, the most severe functional disabilities are found  			 in 1 in 50, Whites, 1 in 33 Blacks, 1 in 30 Hispanics, and 1 in 20 American  			 Indians. We need to know more about why disability rates vary so much and if  			 there are differences in the receipt of disability benefits from SSI and SSDI  			 and their medical companion programs--Medicaid and Medicare.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>After policy interviews were held and the Department's disability data  		were closely examined, the consensus was that while our need for information on  		disability was great, little information existed. There were no plans for data  		collection until 1990, when four separate disability surveys were proposed by  		different components in DHHS.</p>
<p>All proposing agencies agreed to coordinate their efforts into the  		1993/94 Disability Survey. Coordination was a sensible and cost-effective  		approach. The four surveys, which evolved into the 1993/94 Disability Survey  		were:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>National Survey of Persons with Developmental Disabilities</b>,  			 proposed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  			 (ASPE), was a survey of persons with mental retardation and/or developmental  			 disabilities. This survey was proposed because increasingly, programs and  			 policies treat individuals with mental retardation and/or developmental  			 disabilities as a single group where eligibility is determined functionally  			 rather than diagnostically. Estimates of the developmentally disabled  			 population are not known and range from 1.2 to 4.5 million. No such survey has  			 ever been done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>SSI Low Income Survey</b>, proposed by the Office of Supplemental  			 Security Income (SSA), was a survey of actual and potential SSI recipients  			 designed to obtain basic information for policy analysis, program expansions or  			 changes, and outreach efforts. The last such survey, the Survey of Low-Income  			 Aged and Disabled (SLIAD) was conducted in 1974.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>National Disability Survey</b>, proposed by the Office of  			 Disability (SSA), was a survey of working- age adults who either are or could  			 potentially receive SSDI so as to assess policy issues such as rehabilitation  			 and work incentive strategies. This survey builds off the experience of the  			 Surveys of Disability and Work conducted by SSA during the 1960's and  			 1970's.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>National Child Health Assessment and Planning Project</b>,  			 proposed by the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health and Resources Development,  			 Public Health Service, was a survey of children with disabilities. Estimates of  			 disabled children range from 1 to 10 million, de ending on how disability is  			 defined and which ages are included. A 2½ year planning grant to the  			 Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Bronx, New York  			 was instrumental in designing the survey.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>WHAT IS THE DESIGN OF THE 1993/94 DISABILITY SURVEY?</h2>
<p>The 1993/94 Disability Survey will have two parts. The first part or  		Phase I will be given immediately after the NHIS core interview is administered  		in all sample households. Phase I will collect basic descriptive information on  		the prevalence of disability and identify the four populations of particular  		policy interest. The Phase II interview will follow Phase I two months later  		and only be given to persons with disabilities who were identified in Phase I.  		The Phase II interview will collect detailed information on service use and  		expenditure patterns--key information for policy analysis.</p>
<p>Two years of data collection--1993 and 1994--are needed in order to get  		a large enough sample. Nationwide, about 200,000 people in 100,000 households  		will participate in Phase I, with approximately 40,000 people in Phase II.</p>
<p>The Disability Survey has been extensively reviewed throughout the  		Federal disability community during the last year. In addition, the  		questionnaire has been voluntarily tested by people with disabilities and their  		families through the NCHS Cognitive Questionnaire Lab. A 250 household pretest  		was also conducted in the Washington, DC area this fall.</p>
<p>The Disability Survey has some other attractive features. Information  		can be linked to the rich data on health care and utilization gathered in the  		core NHIS and we can learn about the characteristics of both individuals with  		disabilities and members of their families. The data can also be linked to  		administrative disability records at SSA and Medicare records at HCFA.  		Furthermore, while the Disability Survey is a one-time or snapshot survey,  		provisions can be made to follow respondents back and reinterview them for up  		to 10 years. Thus, the Disability Survey can be used as the basis for  		longitudinal studies.</p>
<h2>HOW IS DISABILITY DEFINED IN THE DISABILITY SURVEY?</h2>
<p>The hardest part of designing any disability survey is deciding how to  		define disability. Since there is not even a single framework for defining  		disability, it is not surprising that there is no single recognized definition  		of disability, either for research or for policy purposes.</p>
<p>Disability or an inability (or difficulty) to perform societal roles, is  		hard to define, because so many aspects of human behavior are involved in  		determining societal roles. Furthermore, these roles vary by age, gender, and  		culture.</p>
<p>DHHS has devoted considerable time and resources to designing the  		Disability Survey so that disability can be measured from many aspects. Phase  		I, which contains the measures of disability, was designed to include in-depth  		measures of almost every broad definition of disability--functional, sensory  		impairments, mental/cognitive impairments, receipt of disability benefits,  		childhood disabilities, developmental disabilities, and the use of assistive  		devices. The different types of measures also include severity, nature, onset,  		and duration. Compromises had to be made, but the resultant product contains  		strong state-of-the-art measures.</p>
<p>Many of these measures have appeared for years in other surveys, but  		specific components of the questionnaire--notably those sections dealing with  		children, mental illness, and developmental disabilities are new. Due to the  		lack of good measures of childhood disability, we derived new ones, including  		those which pertain to infants and toddlers. New measures were also constructed  		to identify people with developmental disabilities. Similarly, a group of  		esteemed psychologists from the National Committee on Vital and Health  		Statistics designed the questions on mental illness and cognitive  		impairments.</p>
<p>Finally, questions adapted from the ADA definition itself on the  		perception of disability are also included. These questions are:</p>
<ul><li>"Do you consider yourself or anyone in your family to have a  		  disability?</li>
<li>Who is this? Anyone else?</li>
<li>Would other people consider you or anyone in your family to have a  		  disability?</li>
<li>Who would others consider to have a disability?"</li>
</ul><h2>HOW CAN THE DISABILITY SURVEY BE USED TO MONITOR ADA COMPLIANCE?</h2>
<p>The 1993/94 Disability Survey is the only survey which can help us  		understand the impact of all four ADA goals. The Disability Survey is  		constructed so that while Phase I will measure the prevalence of disability,  		Phase II will collect data on the lives of people with disabilities, such as  		transportation, housing, caregiving, use and out-of-pocket costs for services,  		social interaction, employment, accommodations, and vocational  		rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Specific data items which will help us understand the four ADA goals are  		given below:</p>

<p>The other basic surveys--the Decennial Census, the SIPP, the CPS, and  		the NHIS--can also help monitor at least some parts of ADA compliance during  		this decade, although not to the same extent as the 1993/94 Disability Survey.  		Each survey has its strengths and each has a major purpose other than  		disability. We will not be able to change these surveys into disability  		surveys, but we can modify their design so that the ADA and other disability  		policy can be evaluated. Very often, this means simply adding or strengthening  		items which would identify people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Specifically, these surveys could be improved with regard to disability  		data in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Decennial Census</b>: <i>Insure that disability is collected in  			 the Year 2000 Decennial Census by participating now in the planning  			 process</i>. The purpose of the Decennial Census is to collect data every ten  			 years to be used for Congressional redistricting, as called for in the U.S.  			 Constitution. However, a variety of demographic and socioeconomic data have  			 also been gathered for almost 200 years. The strength of the Decennial Census  			 is that it is the only survey in this country which can provide estimates for  			 virtually every geographic entity from the nation as a whole to States,  			 counties, Indian reservations, and blocks. Limited information on disability in  			 one form or another have been collected in most years since 1830. The 1990  			 Decennial Census gathered information on disability from Americans aged 15 or  			 over through three questions: one on the ability to work, one on the ability to  			 get around outside the house, and one on the ability to take care of personal  			 needs. The Decennial Census can be used to provide estimates of the need for  			 disability services in small areas. It is also the, only major survey which  			 includes people who live id institutions, as well as the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>SIPP</b>: <i>Insure that disability data are collected in a  			 routine manner when the SIPP is redesigned starting in 1995</i>. SIPP or the  			 Survey of Income and Program Participation is sponsored by the Census Bureau  			 and began in 1.983. The purpose of SIPP is to measure the economic well-being  			 of the American people by looking at the income distribution and participation  			 in Federal programs. SIPP is a longitudinal survey consisting of 9 interviews  			 spread over almost three years. People in approximately 19,000 households are  			 interviewed annually for SIPP. SIPP is a rich source of information on income,  			 employment, health insurance, and assets, because these factors figure  			 prominently in Federal program participation. So too does disability. However,  			 disability data have been gathered only on an ad hoc, not a routine basis. In  			 1984, questions on disability were added to SIPP, which have been a valuable  			 source of information on disability. Disability questions were reintroduced in  			 1990/91 and are being planned for 1992/93. If SIPP were to routinely collect  			 disability data, we would be able to examine issues on employment, income, and  			 poverty in much greater detail. We would also be able to look at changes in  			 employment, program participation, and health insurance coverage over  			 time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>CPS</b>: <i>Insure that disability data are expanded and  			 collected in a routine manner when the CPS is redesigned starting in 1995</i>.  			 The CPS, or Current Population Survey began in 1942 to measure the monthly  			 unemployment rate. The CPS is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  			 Department of Labor. The sample size is 50,000 households per year. The March  			 Supplement of the CPS is also used for the Federal government's official  			 estimates of income and persons living in poverty. The CPS is the basis of  			 practically every economic model and is hence used for nearly every Federal  			 cost estimate involving social programs. However, disability data are limited  			 to a few questions, mostly on the ability to work. There are no questions on  			 children and none on any other type of functioning. Since the CPS is such a  			 valuable source of data for program planning and legislation, it is imperative  			 that the disability questions be strengthened. If that were to happen, the CPS  			 could be used as a strong monitor of ADA compliance, particularly for  			 employment issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>1993/94 NHIS Disability Survey</b>: <i>Insure that the 1993194  			 Disability Survey can begin as scheduled</i>. The 1993/94 NHIS Disability  			 Survey is the only survey which can realistically monitor ADA compliance before  			 the end of this century. However, funding is problematical. If sufficient funds  			 are not committed by the end of 1992, the survey will not occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>NHIS</b>: <i>Insure that disability be viewed as a major purpose  			 of the NHIS when it is redesigned starting in 1995</i>. The purpose of the  			 NHIS, as stated in the National Health Survey Act (which is due for  			 reauthorization in 1993) is to collect data on the incidence and prevalence of  			 chronic conditions, and to measure the nation's health status, utilization, and  			 disability. Approximately 50,000 households are included in the sample each  			 year. The NHIS has gathered information on limitation of activity and on  			 disability days, that is days missed form work or school because of illness.  			 However, until the advent of the 1993/94 Disability Survey, no comprehensive  			 in-depth information on disability was ever collected. However, there have been  			 a variety of special topics, such as home care, mental illness, and assistive  			 devices. The NHIS will be redesigned in 1995. Disability items can be  			 strengthened and included in the core NHIS interview, particularly those  			 measures pertaining to mental impairments. Thus, we would be able to see how  			 health care differs for people with and without disabilities. We will, not be  			 able to assess the impacts of health care reform proposals on people with  			 disabilities, unless they can be identified and we can distinguish between  			 physical and mental causes of disability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>LONG-RANGE PLANNING AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>Besides collecting disability data, we should be thinking seriously  		about future efforts. To be successful, we need to address a series of  		technical concerns, particularly those involving exactly how disability is  		defined. We also need to be sensitive to the adaptability of disability data  		for use in the Nagi and ICIDH frameworks.</p>
<p>Results from the 1993/94 Disability Survey will teach us much about  		disability in this country. We will learn more about how to measure disability  		and how to create new surveys. Until we get some results, academic arguments  		over very basic issues will continue without resolution.</p>
<p>If we take an active role in disability data, we can influence the  		soundness of the information used to make policy decisions about the ADA and  		other disability issues. If not, decisions will be made anyway with the benefit  		of what we know about disability.</p>
<p>The timing is right to make a difference in disability policy and to  		base that policy on sound information. Right now, support for the 1993/94  		Disability Survey is crucial to understanding disability in the 1990's. Other  		surveys can also be strengthened to provide more information on ADA  		compliance.</p>
<p>The ADA put disability in the forefront of domestic policy, but unless  		we can evaluate the impacts of policy, people with disabilities will have  		difficulty being heard in policy debates.</p>
