<p>National data collections have only recently begun to respond to the  		need for data on growth in residential care alternatives to both traditional  		nursing homes and care at home for older persons with disability. This  		information is critical to understanding the evolving long-term care delivery  		system and to the ability to monitor care arrangements and quality for public  		policy and for consumer information.</p>
<p>This report is the second of two prepared as part of a project to better  		understand the size and characteristics of the long-term care population in all  		settings. The first report reviewed existing estimates of the older population  		in residential care, generally divided into nursing homes and alternative  		residential care settings. Substantial variation was found across different  		types of data and even across studies using the same data, and differences in  		estimates generally were larger for residential alternatives than for nursing  		homes (Spillman and Black 2005). As part of that report, we identified a set of  		key methodological issues contributing to observed differences in existing  		estimates that could be investigated using available national surveys.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul><li>age of the population examined,</li>
<li>sample representation and weighting,</li>
<li>methods for assigning individuals to the facility or  		  institutional population (and conversely, the community  		  or noninstitutional population),</li>
<li>methods of identifying nursing homes,</li>
<li>methods of identifying alternative residential care settings.</li>
</ul><p>We also identified three recent federally supported surveys--the 2002  		Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), the 2002 Medicare Current Beneficiary  		Survey (MCBS) Cost and Use file, and the National Long Term Care Survey  		(NLTCS)--as being best suited for the purpose because of their focus on the  		older population and data elements that allow identification of residential  		care alternatives by name, services, or both. In this study, we report on our  		analysis of these surveys and discuss the implications of our findings for  		improving collection of data on residential settings.</p>
<h3>Methods and Data</h3>
<p>Our analytic strategy was first to identify relevant residential care  		samples as consistently as possible across the three surveys analyzed and then  		to compare the characteristics of the populations identified. We defined the  		following residential categories that could be measured across surveys,  		excluding persons living in facilities for the mentally ill or mentally  		retarded, rehabilitation facilities, and other facilities not identified as  		nursing homes or alternative residential long-term care:</p>
<ul><li>Traditional private residences.</li>
<li>Nontraditional residences, including retirement or senior housing or  		  other such community settings not meeting criteria for residential care.</li>
<li>Residential care settings:
<ul><li>Nursing homes;</li>
<li>Alternative community residential care;</li>
<li>Alternative facility residential care.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>We drew on existing sources of guidance, including definitions developed  		by the Assisted Living Workgroup (ALW) formed by the U.S. Senate Special  		Committee on Aging in 2001, and a survey of state licensing practices (Han,  		Sirrocco, and Remsburg 2003) to develop feasible criteria for defining  		residential care settings using data elements on the three surveys. Alternative  		residential care settings encompass a variety of places and care arrangements  		that provide both housing and services outside of a nursing facility for those  		who are unable or unwilling to live independently. They include such diverse  		settings as small foster care homes, board and care or personal care homes,  		congregate housing, or assisted living facilities. Hallmark services generally  		include assistance with instrumental activities of daily living, such as meals  		and housekeeping, and activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and  		dressing. </p>
<p>Our aim was to identify all residential care settings, rather than a  		subset qualifying as assisted living, <i>per se</i>. Therefore we followed a  		general strategy similar to one used by Hawes et al. (1998) in an earlier  		project to develop a survey of assisted living, which relied on either facility  		self-identification or services. To identify all settings, however, we used a  		broader array of place types and a less restrictive set of services,  		constrained by the type of data available on each survey. (Detailed  		specifications of our constructions for each survey are in <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>.)</p>
<h3>Key Findings on the Size and Characteristics of the  		Residential Care Population</h3>
<p>Estimates from the three major national surveys of the older population  		examined are in substantial agreement that about 6.5 percent of persons age 65  		or older--about 2.2 million persons--live in some type of residential care  		other than settings for special populations such as the mentally ill or  		mentally retarded. The estimates indicate that most--about 1.45 million--live  		in nursing homes, but more than 750,000 live in alternative residential care  		settings.</p>
<p>The three surveys also provide a consistent picture of the  		characteristics of the residential care population. Relative to older persons  		remaining in traditional private housing, the residential care population was  		far more likely to receive help with ADLs and to suffer from Alzheimers  		disease or other dementias. Estimates from the two surveys that include the  		facility or institutional population, indicate that the prevalence of  		disability and dementias is dramatically higher in facility residential care  		than in community care settings, and higher yet in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Persons living in residential care facilities are more likely to be over  		age 85, more likely to be female, and more likely to be widowed, than are  		persons residing in traditional housing. Residential care facilities serve a  		broad income range. Persons living in those facilities are more likely to have  		incomes below $10,000, roughly approximating the federal poverty level for  		older couples. In both the MCBS and the NLTCS the proportion who are nonWhite  		was lower than in either traditional private housing or nursing homes.</p>
<h3>Discussion and Conclusions</h3>
<p>The consistency of estimates across three major national surveys, after  		reducing methodological differences to the extent possible, provides confidence  		in the existing data on the size and characteristics of the residential care  		population. Two different methods are used to obtain data on the  		characteristics of the persons residence. Individuals are asked to  		describe their type of residence. The responses yield a set of place types  		(e.g., retirement community, assisted living, etc.). The other method is to ask  		individuals whether or not the place they live offers specific services,  		usually by asking about each service on the interviewers list of  		potential services. However, accurately identifying a residential care facility  		as the place of residence through the use of survey questions is difficult.  		Neither named place type, as in the NLTCS, nor services alone, as in the HRS,  		appears to be sufficient to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the  		setting.</p>
<p>For example, the NLTCS, allows identification only by named setting  		type, and makes special effort to identify assisted living. The  		NLTCS reports a larger proportion of community residents in generic types of  		senior or retirement housing than do the other two  		surveys. However, no information is gathered on services available, regardless  		of whether the respondent uses them. Consequently, it is difficult to determine  		whether these generic settings meet the criteria for alternative residential  		care, such as those proposed by the ALW or used in state licensing.</p>
<p>Among the MCBS community residential care population, which we  		identified using a combination of named place type and services offered, only  		about 30 percent identified their residence by name as assisted living or any  		other place type clearly associated with residential care. About 8 percent of  		the group reporting that their residence was assisted living reported that  		<i>none</i> of the services included in the survey were available, and only  		about three-quarters reported the availability of medication supervision,  		considered to be a hallmark service for higher quality residential care  		settings. </p>
<p>Finally, although the estimates of the characteristics of the  		residential care population from the three surveys show reasonable consistency,  		comparisons were complicated both by differences in measurement and  		availability of data across community and facility settings and by small sample  		sizes. </p>
<p>If, as widely believed, the older population in alternative residential  		care is growing rapidly, either as a substitute for or a precursor to  		traditional nursing homes, it is important to have reliable national data to  		document both the growth and the implications for the welfare of older persons  		with disability. The three major surveys of the older population we examined  		have made a first step in that direction. In fact, such data offer the only  		opportunity for an integrated understanding of the entire long-term care  		delivery system and those who use it, rather than piecemeal examination of  		sometimes artificially defined segments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, improvements are needed if national surveys are to support  		studies that improve understanding of the residential care missing  		link. This analysis indicated several key areas for improvement: </p>
<ul><li>A hybrid approach to identifying settings would seem to be ideal, in  		  which a broad screen for nontraditional settings is applied, as in the HRS, and  		  then information on both services available and named place type is gathered.  		  Ideally information similar to that in the HRS and MCBS on whether services are  		  included in housing costs or cost extra and whether services are actually used  		  also would be collected.</li>
<li>More consistency is needed across all community and facility settings  		  in the information collected on characteristics of settings and services  		  offered, as well as the characteristics of residents, so that analyses can  		  identify factors associated with choice of setting, transitions between  		  settings, and outcomes.</li>
<li>Existing sources of guidance, such as those cited here, can provide a  		  foundation for survey organizations to identify the minimal array of key  		  setting characteristics and services needed to identify and discriminate  		  between residential care settings.</li>
<li>Although growth over time eventually will increase sample sizes, a  		  sound methodology for oversampling the population in alternative residential  		  care is needed if national population-based surveys are to provide the data to  		  support reliable estimates.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>National data collections have only recently begun to respond to the  		need for data on growth in residential care alternatives to both traditional  		nursing homes and care at home for older persons with disability. There are a  		number of reasons. There is as yet no agreement on the full range of names that  		designate such settings or the characteristics by which they may be identified.  		And, although a federally funded project is underway, there is at present no  		national sampling frame of long-term care places other than nursing homes to  		guide survey efforts. The Decennial Census considers many of these settings  		housing units that are to date indistinguishable in Census data  		from traditional private residences, and similar places may appear in either  		the institutional or noninstitutional population under current Census  		definitions. As a result, considerable uncertainty exists about the types of  		accommodative settings providing care to older persons and the number and  		characteristics of persons living in them. This information is critical to  		understanding the evolving long-term care delivery system and to the ability to  		monitor care arrangements and quality for public policy and for consumer  		information. </p>
<p>Several trends continue to fuel growth in alternative residential care  		settings. Nursing homes have been the most common institutional setting for  		persons with disability since the advent of Medicaid funding in 1965, but  		states increasingly are looking for alternatives to contain costs and in  		response to beneficiary preferences for noninstitutional care. The 1999  		Olmstead Decision, which mandates that reasonable alternative accommodations be  		available for persons preferring noninstitutional settings, added impetus to  		state efforts (Fox-Grage, Folkemer, and Lewis 2003; Rosenbaum 2000). More  		recent federal Medicaid initiatives such as Money Follows the  		Person and Systems Change Grants for Community Living seek to  		increase noninstitutional infrastructure and incentives for persons with  		disability to remain in or return to the community (Crisp et al. 2003). In  		addition, there has been independent growth of residential care  		alternatives--often labeled assistive living--to serve primarily an older  		private pay clientele no longer able or willing to perform activities needed  		for independent living at home.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the rate of nursing home use among the older population  		has leveled off or even declined slightly in some surveys even in the face of  		an aging population. This has led one researcher to ask, Where are the  		missing elders? (Bishop 1999). At least part of the answer lies in  		measurement issues in national data collections. For example, Rhoades (2000)  		argued that as states have added licensing categories for alternative  		residential care, facilities--and particularly small facilities--formerly  		licensed as nursing homes have not disappeared, but simply moved to new  		licensing categories so that they no longer appear in nursing home estimates  		(Rhoades 2000). Between 1977 and 1999, a stable proportion of the population in  		facilities identified as nursing homes by the National Nursing Home Survey  		(NNHS) were long stayers, but the size of nursing homes increased, along with  		both the age and disability level of residents and the number of short,  		post-acute stays (Decker 2005). These trends may suggest that a so far poorly  		understood array of alternative settings may be functioning as a way station  		that, for some persons, delays or obviates long-term placement in nursing  		homes. Thus, it is imperative that national surveys develop the capacity to  		provide information about the new generation of care settings and their  		residents. </p>
<p>This report is the second of two prepared as part of a project to better  		understand the size and characteristics of the long-term care population in all  		settings. The first report reviewed existing estimates of the older population  		in residential care, generally divided into nursing homes and alternative  		residential care settings. Substantial variation was found across different  		types of data and even across studies using the same data, and differences in  		estimates generally were larger for residential alternatives than for nursing  		homes (Spillman and Black 2005). As part of that report, we identified a set of  		key methodological issues contributing to observed differences in existing  		estimates that could be investigated using available national surveys. They  		are:</p>
<ul><li>Age of the population examined,</li>
<li>Sample representation and weighting,</li>
<li>Methods for assigning individuals to the facility or  		  institutional population (and conversely, the community  		  or noninstitutional population),</li>
<li>Methods of identifying nursing homes,</li>
<li>Methods of identifying alternative residential care settings.</li>
</ul><p>We also identified three recent federally supported surveys--the 2002  		Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), the 2002 Medicare Current Beneficiary  		Survey (MCBS) Cost and Use file, and the National Long Term Care Survey  		(NLTCS)--as being best suited for the purpose because of their focus on the  		older population and data elements that allow identification of residential  		care alternatives by name, services available, or both. In this study, we  		report on our analysis of these surveys and discuss the implications of our  		findings for improving collection of data on residential settings.</p>
<h2><a name="methods" id="methods">METHODS AND DATA</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we describe the methodology used to construct our  		estimates of the older population in alternative residential care and nursing  		homes. Our strategy was to identify the relevant samples as consistently as  		possible across the three surveys analyzed and then to compare the  		characteristics of the populations identified. We defined the following basic  		residential categories that could be measured across surveys, excluding persons  		living in facilities for the mentally ill or mentally retarded, rehabilitation  		facilities, and other facilities not identified as nursing homes or alternative  		residential long-term care:</p>
<ul><li>Traditional private residences.</li>
<li>Nontraditional residences, including retirement or senior housing or  		  other such community settings not meeting criteria for residential care.</li>
<li>Residential care settings:
<ul><li>Nursing homes;</li>
<li>Alternative community residential care;</li>
<li>Alternative facility residential care.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>We first describe the three surveys analyzed and then describe our  		methodology for identifying residential setting and for measuring population  		characteristics as consistently as possible across the three surveys. Survey  		characteristics relevant to identifying residential setting are summarized in  		<a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table1">Table 1</a>. </p>
<h3>Health and Retirement Survey (HRS)</h3>
<p>The 2002 HRS is a household survey representing only the community, or  		noninstitutional, population ages 51 or older, based on Census definitions of  		the noninstitutional population. The HRS originated as a survey of community  		residents age 51-61 in 1992, and the companion Assets and Health of the Oldest  		Old (AHEAD) survey began in 1993 with a sample of community residing persons  		age 70 or older. In 1998, the two surveys merged and expanded to represent the  		noninstitutional population ages 51 or older. The survey is repeated every two  		years and employs a dual frame sample consisting of an area probability sample  		and a supplementary probability sample of persons age 80 or older drawn from  		Medicare enrollment files. Weights adjust for complex sample design and are  		post-stratified using population control totals for the noninstitutional  		population from the Current Population Survey March Supplement.</p>
<p>Individuals originally sampled in the community are followed if they are  		institutionalized, but have a zero cross-sectional weight for any wave in which  		they are in an institution as defined by the survey. We construct estimates  		only for the noninstitutional cross-section in 2002. The excluded institutional  		population includes persons in nursing homes or other facilities, which the HRS  		defines as places that dispense medication and provide 24-hour nursing  		assistance and supervision, personal assistance, and room and meals.</p>
<p>The HRS methodology for identifying persons in noninstitutional  		residential care is distinct from methods used in the other two surveys in that  		the HRS does not use a list of place names or types associated with alternative  		residential care. Rather, it screens respondents broadly for residence in a  		retirement community, senior housing, or other housing providing services. All  		respondents reporting that they live in any of these generic residence types  		are asked whether specified services are available, whether they are included  		in housing costs, whether the respondent actually uses the services, and  		whether the respondent could remain in the residence if they needed  		substantial care. Included services are group meals; housekeeping;  		transportation; help with bathing, dressing, or eating; emergency call button  		or checks on residents; and nursing or a special resident facility for those  		who need nursing care. </p>
<h3>Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)</h3>
<p>The MCBS is a probability sample drawn from all Medicare beneficiaries,  		regardless of their place of residence and thus includes both the  		noninstitutional and institutional populations. The survey began in 1992 and is  		conducted annually. Participants are interviewed over a four-year period. The  		annual sample includes an over-sample of persons age 85 or older (Adler 1994;  		Laschober and Olin 1996; Liu and Sharma 2002). A supplemental sample is drawn  		and interviewed in each fall round (September through December) to replace  		respondents being retired from the sample, replenish cells depleted by refusals  		and death, and correct for coverage errors in the initial frame (Liu and Sharma  		2002). Since 1994, the supplemental sample has been representative of persons  		alive and eligible on January 1 of the survey year. </p>
<p>Two files are released each year. The first released is the Access to  		Care file, which represents only persons continuously enrolled in Medicare  		during the year, and the second is the Cost and Use file, which represents all  		persons ever enrolled in Medicare during the year, including persons who die or  		enroll during the year. The Cost and Use file also includes a residential  		timeline identifying where sample members were living at each point during the  		calendar year. In this study we use the 2002 Cost and Use file, which contains  		information on about 13,000 enrollees.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Sample weights are based on Medicare  		enrollment data.</p>
<p>Respondents are interviewed wherever they are on the interview date,  		using either a community or a facility questionnaire, depending on whether the  		respondent is in a facility as identified by MCBS criteria. They are followed  		as they make residential changes. Through 2000, the MCBS collected information  		on residential care only in long-term care facilities, which the  		MCBS defines more broadly than either of the other two surveys, as places  		offering long-term care services or supervision, as well as places offering  		nursing care and other licensed facilities. Specifically, the MCBS defines a  		facility as a place with three or more beds and</p>
<ul><li>Medicare or Medicaid certified or state licensed as a nursing home or  		  other long term care facility, <i>or</i></li>
<li>providing supervision of medications or help with activities of daily  		  living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),  		  <i>or</i></li>
<li>providing 24-hour caregiver supervision. </li>
</ul><p>Facility type, including nursing home, assisted living, and various  		other types of residential care, is determined from the facilitys  		self-designation in a facility screening questionnaire. The facility respondent  		also is asked whether the facility provides medication supervision or help with  		bathing, dressing, shopping, walking, eating, or communication. </p>
<p>Since 2001, the survey also has collected information about residential  		setting from all persons in the community. Respondents are asked whether their  		residence is in a retirement community, senior citizens housing, assisted  		living facility, continuing care retirement community (CCRC), staged living  		community, retirement apartments, or a personal or residential care home and  		can specify another type. Community residents reporting any such special  		setting are asked whether services are available, whether services cost extra,  		and whether they would have to move out or to another part of the community if  		they needed substantial care. Specific service questions for  		community respondents are more limited than in the HRS/AHEAD. An important  		distinction is that the MCBS services include no ADL items, presumably because  		places identified as providing these services would be classified as facilities  		on the MCBS. On its face, this would imply that the HRS residential care  		population would include an unknown proportion of persons who would be appear  		in the MCBS facility, rather than community, population. MCBS community service  		questions ask about the availability of assistance with meals, housekeeping,  		transportation, medication assistance, and recreational activities. </p>
<h3>National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS)</h3>
<p>The NLTCS is a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or  		older weighted to represent the complete elderly population using Census data  		on the noninstitutional and institutional populations. It is designed to  		identify persons who are chronically disabled in a screening interview, and  		then to collect detailed data on a wide range of characteristics. When the  		survey began in 1982, only community residents who had screened in  		as disabled were eligible to receive a detailed interview. The survey was  		repeated in 1984 and 1989, adding detailed interviews of residents of  		institutions as defined by NLTCS. In 1994 and 1999, samples of  		nondisabled community residents also received the detailed interview, so that  		complete information is available in those two years for the full Medicare  		population age 65 or older in all settings.</p>
<p>The samples are drawn from Medicare enrollment files and refreshed in  		each wave with a new sample of persons who turned 65 since the previous survey,  		so that both longitudinal and cross-sectional estimates can be made. In 1994  		and 1999, supplemental samples of persons aged 95 or older were added to  		increase precision of estimates for the very old. The 1999 sample, including  		all persons screened for the survey, is about 17,000, about 6,000 of whom were  		eligible for and responded to the detailed interview.</p>
<p>Information on residential setting is elicited on an instrument called  		the Control Card. This instrument is administered just prior to the detailed  		interview and determines whether an individual receives a community or  		institutional interview. In 1999 assisted living was added as a  		separate residential category on the Control Card. Historically, an institution  		in the NLTCS has been any institutional setting as defined by the Decennial  		Census or any other setting with three or more unrelated residents, provided  		that a health professional of some type is on duty every day. When the assisted  		living category was added in 1999, persons identified as being in assisted  		living were asked whether their residence provided a list of services <i>to the  		sampled person</i> rather than whether services are offered, as in the HRS and  		MCBS. The services are meals, housekeeping, eating assistance, mobility  		assistance, and substantial nursing of any kind. The screen for  		institutional residence among person identified as being in assisted living is  		that they report receiving substantial nursing. All others in assisted living  		receive the community interview. In the institutional interview, facilities  		identify themselves by named type only. No information on services provided is  		collected from facilities.</p>
<p>Respondents to the community interview are also asked whether their  		residence is in a building or community for older or disabled persons or is  		another type of residential care setting, including retirement home, boarding  		home, group home or community residential facility. No information about  		services is collected from additional community respondents who identify their  		residence as any of these types but were not identified as being in assisted  		living on the Control Card.</p>
<h3>Sample Representation and Weighting</h3>
<p>For all three surveys we started by selecting samples of persons age 65  		or older. We also made further adjustments to the sample and weights for the  		MCBS and to weights for the NLTCS to improve comparability.</p>
<p>The MCBS Cost and Use file is designed to represent all persons ever  		enrolled in Medicare during the year, whereas the HRS and the NLTCS are  		designed to represent cross-sections. To approximate a cross-section using the  		MCBS data, we selected persons alive and enrolled on September 1 and used the  		residential timeline to identify place of residence on that date, so that our  		approximated cross-section and associated residential information is for a date  		near the data of the fall interview in which health characteristics are  		collected. Because this sample somewhat under-represents a cross-section of  		enrollees that could be drawn on September 1, we obtained control totals for  		Medicare enrollees by age and adjusted sample weights to those  		totals.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> We did not  		attempt to adjust the weights to the full elderly population including the 3-5  		percent of the older population not enrolled in Medicare.</p>
<p>Although the NLTCS is drawn from Medicare enrollment files and  		represents the Medicare population age 65 or older, survey weights historically  		have been constructed to represent the full elderly population, using control  		totals for the noninstitutional and institutional populations from Census  		population projections. A different methodology was used in 1999, in which only  		the community sample was post-stratified to these external control totals.  		Estimates of the nursing home population using the survey provided weights are  		far below estimates from other sources, such as the NNHS produced by the  		National Center for Health Statistics (Spillman and Black 2005). To improve  		comparability with the HRS and MCBS, we post-stratified the survey weights so  		that both the community and institutional samples were consistent with  		appropriate Census population estimates (Spillman 2004). Because the  		residential setting information is provided only for persons selected for  		detailed interview--including the subset reporting no disability--we further  		adjusted the weights so that the sample receiving a detailed interview  		represents the total population age 65 or older. </p>
<p>We made no adjustment to the weights provided with the HRS, which are  		post-stratified to totals from the March Current Population Survey. However, we  		wanted to compare the implied size of the excluded institutional population for  		comparison with the facility and institutional populations defined on the MCBS  		and NLTCS, respectively. In order to estimate the excluded population, we  		constructed a denominator representing the resident population age 65 or older.  		The difference between this denominator and the noninstitutional population  		estimate from the HRS weights for persons age 65 or older is our estimate of  		the excluded institutional population.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Identification of Residential Care</h3>
<p>Our ability to identify settings is, of course, limited by the data  		available on each survey. We drew on existing sources of guidance to develop  		feasible criteria using data elements on the three surveys. Alternative  		residential care settings encompass a variety of places and care arrangements  		that provide both housing and services outside of a nursing facility for those  		who are unable or unwilling to live independently. They include such diverse  		settings as small foster care homes, board and care or personal care homes,  		congregate housing, or assisted living facilities. Hallmark services generally  		include assistance with IADLs, such as meals and housekeeping, and ADLs, such  		as bathing and dressing. </p>
<p>Although assisted living appears to have replaced older  		designations, such as board and care, as the generic name for alternative  		residential care, some argue that the name should be reserved for settings  		adhering to a specific model. In 2001, the U.S. Senate Special Committee on  		Aging formed the Assisted Living Workgroup (ALW), to consider specific criteria  		for facilities representing this model. The ALW definition was settings that  		provide 24-hour supervision, provision and oversight of personal and supportive  		services, health related services, social services, recreational activities,  		meals, housekeeping and laundry, and transportation services (Han, Sirrocco,  		and Remsburg 2003).</p>
<p>The only survey to date focusing solely on alternative residential care  		(Hawes, Rose, and Phillips 1999) used a combination of facility  		self-designation or services offered to identify eligible facilities.  		Specifically, the survey included facilities that <i>either</i> identified  		themselves by name as assisted living <i>or</i> offered 24-hour oversight,  		housekeeping, at least two meals per day, and help with at least two  		activities, such as medications, bathing, or dressing. Evidence from a survey  		of state licensing practices suggests, however, that neither name nor service  		package is necessarily a reliable way to identify either assisted living  		specifically or other alternative residential care settings. The Inventory of  		Long-Term Care Residential Places project, funded jointly by several federal  		agencies in an effort to build a comprehensive provider frame, used state  		regulations to develop a typology of names and characteristics of licensed  		residential settings that house older adults (Han, Sirrocco, and Remsburg  		2003). They found that in 22 states, small boarding homes would be included in  		the same licensing category as places offering the range of services, privacy,  		and autonomy associated with assisted living by the ALW. Further, although 42  		states licensed facilities meeting the assisted living criteria, only about  		half of the 42 states actually used the term assisted living.</p>
<p>Our aim is to identify all residential care settings, rather than a  		subset qualifying as assisted living, <i>per se</i>. Therefore we followed a  		general hybrid strategy similar to Hawes reliance on either facility  		self-identification or services, but used a broader set of place types and a  		less restrictive set of services, constrained by the type of data available on  		each survey. (Detailed specifications of our constructions for each survey are  		in the <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#appendA">Technical Appendix</a>.)</p>
<p><b><i>HRS Community Residential Care</i></b></p>
<p>For the HRS/AHEAD, we relied entirely on information about services  		offered because only generic place types are identified. We included in our  		residential care population all persons who reported that their residence  		offered assistance with ADLs (bathing, dressing, or eating), or who reported  		that their residence did not offer ADL assistance but offered either oversight  		(an emergency call button or checks on residents) or nursing, housekeeping, and  		group meals. Persons living in these generically identified places but not  		reporting this combination of services were considered to be in other  		nontraditional settings. The remainder of the sample was considered to be in  		traditional private residences.</p>
<p><b><i>MCBS Community and Facility Settings</i></b></p>
<p>For the MCBS, where information about both setting name and services is  		available, we first included all places with any place type associated with  		alternative residential care and then considered services in identifying  		additional, more ambiguously named community settings as residential care. In  		the 2002 MCBS, assisted living was the only explicit residential care type  		actually occurring in the community data. In addition, we included as being in  		community residential care persons who identified a more ambiguous residence  		type (i.e., retirement community, senior citizens housing, CCRC, staged living  		community, and retirement apartments) but reported that the place offered  		meals, housekeeping or laundry, and medication assistance. All settings  		identified as facilities on the MCBS met at least one of the criteria for  		residential care by definition.</p>
<p>We included as nursing homes all facilities self-identified as nursing  		homes, and a few additional facilities with names otherwise associated with  		alternative residential care (i.e., CCRC, retirement community, or assisted  		living facility) but reporting that all beds were certified for Medicaid or  		Medicare. Alternative facility residential care included residents in all other  		places identified as CCRCs, retirement communities, assisted living facilities,  		board and care homes, domiciliary homes, personal care homes, rest or  		retirement homes, or adult group homes and not reporting that all beds were  		certified.</p>
<p><b><i>NLTCS Community and Institutional Settings</i></b></p>
<p>For the NLTCS, because no information was collected on services  		<i>offered</i>, and services received were reported only by the subset  		identified on the Control Card as being in an assisted living community, we  		used only named type of setting to identify residential care, using a  		combination of information from the Control Card and the community and  		institutional interviews (see <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#appendA">Appendix A</a> for details).  		Bed totals and number of certified and uncertified beds could not be reconciled  		for facilities in the NLTCS institutional sample. We therefore did not use  		certification in identifying <i>whether</i> a setting was a nursing home, but  		rather only to identify the subset of nursing homes reporting any certified  		beds. </p>
<h3>Other Key Variables</h3>
<p>To compare characteristics of residents across settings we selected  		health and demographic characteristics that could be measured relatively  		comparably across surveys. Health characteristics are disability, measured by  		the number of IADLs and ADLs, self-reported health status, and self-reported or  		facility reported health conditions or events associated with disability.  		Demographic characteristics are age, gender, race, marital status, and  		income.</p>
<p>In this section, we focus on clarifying construction of measures where  		we had to make analytic decisions about measurement. Given different question  		wording and content even for these characteristics, we still would expect to  		observe differences in measures across the three surveys. We would also expect,  		however, that health and other characteristics would vary in similar ways  		across settings. For example, we generally would expect movement from the least  		to the most health care oriented setting to be associated with greater  		proportions of residents with disability or poor health on each survey. </p>
<p><b><i>Disability Measures</i></b></p>
<p>Differences in the way surveys measure disability sometimes results in  		large differences in estimates (Freedman et al. 2005; Wiener et al. 1990). To  		make measures as comparable as possible, we settled on receiving active help  		(excluding supervision or standby help) with ADLs or IADLs because  		of health or disability as the measure we could operationalize in all three  		surveys. We included only the disability items that were available on all three  		surveys. The included ADLs for the community population are bathing, dressing,  		transferring (to or from bed or chair), getting around inside or walking,  		toileting, and eating. Only the NLTCS ties help to a reference period, asking  		if help was received with each ADL in the last week. The common IADLs across  		the three surveys are preparing meals, shopping, telephoning, and managing  		money. Because neither the HRS/AHEAD nor the MCBS asks about the duration of  		the difficulty or help, we do not consider duration in our estimates, although  		it is typical to do so in the NLTCS because the NLTCS screening instrument  		considers duration. </p>
<p>The same six ADLs are collected for the facility population on the MCBS  		and the institutional population on the NLTCS and are included in our  		estimates. We also included three IADLs (telephoning, shopping for personal  		items, money management) collected on the MCBS facility questionnaire. No IADL  		information is collected for the institutional population on the NLTCS. </p>
<p>Remaining differences that may affect our estimates primarily relate to  		screening. The HRS/AHEAD asks about help with each ADL only if a respondent has  		reported both physical limitation (e.g., difficulty walking short distances or  		climbing stairs) and difficulty with the specific ADL item. The MCBS does not  		screen on physical limitations but does limit questions about active help with  		each ADL to persons who have reported difficulty performing the activity. Both  		surveys limit IADL questions to persons reporting difficulty.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> The 1999 NLTCS has no universal  		screen for difficulty. Rather the survey screened only the minority of  		respondents who were newly selected for the sample or were continuing sample  		members who had not previously been selected for the detailed interview. The  		screen asks if the respondent has problems performing ADLs or  		inability to perform IADLs and whether the problems or inabilities have lasted  		or are expected to last at least 3 months. NLTCS estimates of IADL help are  		limited to persons who report that help is received with included IADLs because  		of health or disability, with the exception of help taking medicine, which has  		no such qualifier. </p>
<p><b><i>Health Conditions </i></b></p>
<p>We selected as disability-related conditions cognitive difficulties,  		diabetes, hip fracture, chronic lung disease, and stroke. These conditions are  		measured for community residents on all three surveys, but for all settings  		only on the MCBS. We also included mental disorders for the HRS and MCBS.  		Mental illness is not included as a condition on the NLTCS. For community  		residents, both the HRS and the MCBS ask whether a doctor has said the person  		has the included conditions. The NLTCS asks only if the sampled person  		currently has diabetes or cognitive problems, and whether the sampled person  		had lung disease, a broken hip, or stroke in the previous 12 months. The MCBS  		facility questionnaire uses information from Minimum Data Set assessments. </p>
<p>The content of the measures we were able to construct for specific  		conditions also differs across surveys. For cognitive problems, the HRS and  		MCBS ask about Alzheimers disease or other dementia. For the NLTCS we  		combined individual questions about Alzheimers disease and senility.  		Mental disorders are measured on the HRS as emotional, nervous, or  		psychiatric problems and on the MCBS community interview as a  		mental or psychiatric disorder, including depression. Our mental  		disorders measure for the MCBS facility population includes anxiety disorder,  		depression, bipolar disease, and schizophrenia. Chronic lung disease is also  		measured differently on the three surveys. The HRS asks about chronic  		lung disease, such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema, specifically  		excluding asthma in interviewer instructions. The MCBS community interview asks  		a question combining emphysema, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary  		disease (COPD). For the MCBS facility interview we combined separate questions  		about asthma and emphysema or COPD. The NLTCS asks separately about emphysema,  		asthma, and bronchitis in the last 12 months. We included only emphysema and  		asthma in our NLTCS chronic lung disease measure because bronchitis may not be  		chronic. About one-third of persons reporting bronchitis also reported one or  		the other of the chronic lung problems we included.</p>
<p><b><i>Income</i></b></p>
<p>Income presented the greatest problems of comparability. Continuous  		income data is reported on the MCBS and HRS for individuals or individual and  		spouse, if married. The MCBS income variable is edited using information from  		other rounds if missing or imputed and had no missing values. For the HRS, we  		used the imputed total income variable from a file produced by the RAND  		Corporation (St. Clair et al. 2005).</p>
<p>The NLTCS income measures are categorical, measuring categorical income  		in the last <i>year</i> for the sampled person or sampled person and spouse for  		community respondents and categorical income in the last <i>month</i> for  		person or person and spouse for institutional respondents. We used a hot deck  		procedure to impute categorical income for 28.5 percent of community residents  		and 30.3 percent of institutional residents missing the information (Iannachone  		1982).<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>To construct relatively comparable estimates across surveys, we created  		annual income categories of less than $10,000, which loosely corresponds to the  		federal poverty level for persons and couples age 65 or older, $10,000 to less  		than $20,000, $20,000-$40,000, and $40,000 or more, which could be measured for  		the HRS, MCBS, and the NLTCS community population. We constructed roughly  		corresponding categories from the monthly categorical income data for the NLTCS  		institutional population (less than $10,788, $10,788 to less than $17,988,  		$17,988-$41,988, and $41,988 or more).</p>
<h2><a name="size" id="size">SIZE OF THE RESIDENTIAL CARE POPULATION</a></h2>
<p>The three surveys yield remarkably similar estimates of the distribution  		of the population age 65 or older by residential setting, considering  		differences in methodology (<a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table2">Table 2</a>). Remaining  		differences appear to trace primarily to the different ways the samples are  		sorted into noninstitutional and institutional or community and facility  		settings. </p>
<p>Looking across all three surveys, about 95 percent of the older  		population lives outside of explicitly institutional settings (top panel of  		<a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table2">Table 2</a>). The HRS and the NLTCS, both of which rely more  		closely than the MCBS on Census definitions of the institutional population,  		yield similar estimates of the total institutional population in all  		settings--about 1.6 million persons or just under 5 percent of the older  		population. The larger MCBS estimate of nearly 2 million persons, or 5.7  		percent of the population, in facilities is consistent with the broader  		definition of the facility population used in that survey.</p>
<p>The middle panel of <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table2">Table 2</a> focuses on traditional  		private housing and all other types of settings. Here again, the three surveys  		provide reasonably similar estimates of persons in traditional residences,  		excluding all types of retirement, group or facility settings, ranging from the  		NLTCS estimate of 85.6 percent of the older population to the MCBS estimate of  		88.8 percent. A larger proportion of NLTCS respondents (8 percent) report that  		they live in some type of community retirement setting that is not identified  		as residential care, with the majority reporting that their residence was in a  		building or community for older, retired, or disabled persons. With no  		information on either services or place type for this group, there is no way to  		refine this category. The MCBS estimate of persons in these nontraditional  		settings may be lower in part because the survey uses a list of place types to  		identify these settings, rather than more general language, such as that used  		on the HRS and the NLTCS.</p>
<p>In fact, excluding the tiny proportion of the population in settings for  		special populations such as the mentally retarded, our MCBS and NLTCS estimates  		of the total residential care population are nearly identical--2.2 million  		persons, or about 6.5 percent of the older population. (The HRS, of course,  		cannot measure the entire residential care population because of its  		noninstitutional sample.) The numerical similarity of the MCBS Medicare  		enrollee population estimates for 2002 to the 1999 estimates from the NLTCS may  		be explained by the roughly 3-5 percent of the older population not enrolled in  		Medicare. There is no <i>a priori</i> reason to believe that this  		missing population in the MCBS estimates is large enough or  		different enough in characteristics to affect the distribution of the  		population by setting.</p>
<h3>Population by Type of Residential Care</h3>
<p>Finally, considering how the residential care population is distributed  		across settings as defined by our criteria (last panel of <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table2">Table 2</a>), estimates from both the NLTCS and the MCBS  		indicate that 1.45 million persons, or about 4.2 percent of the older  		population, reside in nursing homes, about 1.3 million of them in facilities  		with beds certified by either Medicare or Medicaid. Both estimates are below,  		but reasonably similar to estimates of 1.47 million nursing home residents age  		65 or older and 1.44 million in certified facilities from the 1999 NNHS  		(Spillman and Black 2005). </p>
<p>The MCBS and NLTCS estimates of the total population in alternative  		residential long-term care also are very similar, at 2.2-2.3 percent of the  		older population. They differ, however, in the proportions in  		community and facility settings. The MCBS alternative  		residential care population is about evenly divided between community (1.1  		percent) and facility settings (1.2 percent), as defined by the survey. The  		NLTCS estimate of community residential care is higher, about 1.7  		percent, and its institutional residential care estimate of 0.5  		percent is correspondingly, perhaps owing to the more restrictive NLTCS  		requirement that institutional settings have a health professional  		on duty daily or provide substantial nursing to respondents in settings  		identified as assisted living. It seems reasonable to assume that some NLTCS  		community residents would be considered facility residents by MCBS  		definitions.</p>
<p>The HRS community residential care estimate is  		larger--nearly 2 percent of the older population--approaching the MCBS and  		NLTCS estimates for community and facility residential care combined. The  		larger HRS estimate also presumably includes some persons who would be  		considered facility residents under the broader MCBS facility definition,  		including all places that have at least three residents and offer ADL or IADL  		assistance or supervision. It also may be that some proportion of the larger  		NLTCS population in nontraditional settings would have been classified as  		residential care under our criteria if information on services similar to that  		in the HRS had been available on the NLTCS.</p>
<h3>Services in Residential Care and Other Nontraditional  		Settings</h3>
<p><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table3">Table 3</a> compares information on available services  		reported on the HRS and MCBS by persons we classified as being in residential  		care with available services reported by persons who reported living in a more  		ambiguous retirement setting but did not report a combination of services  		consistent with residential care. We also discuss in this section but do not  		report in <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table3">Table 3</a> services provided to the subset of  		NLTCS respondents in residential care who received service questions. </p>
<p>Considering the HRS first, because we defined community residential care  		settings in part by the availability of ADL help, no respondents in  		nontraditional housing but about 62 percent of persons living in community  		residential care reported the availability of help with bathing, dressing or  		eating. About 96 percent of persons in settings we identified as residential  		care reported availability of group meals and housekeeping. More than 90  		percent reported that their residence provided an emergency call button or  		checked on residents, and a majority (56.1 percent) reported availability of  		nursing care or an onsite nurse. About half reported their residence would  		allow them to remain if they needed more care.</p>
<p>In contrast, of HRS respondents living in other nontraditional settings,  		about 60 percent reported none of the services (not shown), 27.3 percent had an  		emergency call button or oversight, 16.3 percent had access to group meals,  		only 4.1 percent had access to housekeeping, and 7.2 percent reported nursing  		or a nurse on site. Nearly three-quarters reported that they would be allowed  		to stay in their residence if they needed more care. </p>
<p>For the MCBS, only a little over 30 percent of our residential care  		population identified their residence as assisted living, which was the only  		explicit residential care category appearing in the data. The remaining almost  		70 percent identified their residence ambiguously (e.g. retirement community,  		senior citizen housing), but met our criteria that prepared meals, housekeeping  		or laundry, and supervision of medications were available. Thus, it is not  		surprising that most of our MCBS residential care population reported the  		availability of meals (96.9 percent), housekeeping (96.1 percent), and  		medication supervision (92.6 percent). It is worth emphasizing, however, that  		even though we used service criteria to identify residential care that were  		less restrictive than the criteria proposed by the ALW to identify assisted  		living, <i>all</i> persons in our residential care population who did not  		report availability of the identifying services had characterized their  		residence as assisted living. Of these, about 8 percent reported no services,  		and nearly one-quarter reported no supervision of medications (not shown). As  		on the HRS, about half (47.1 percent) of our MCBS residential care population  		reported that they could remain if they needed a much greater level  		of care.</p>
<p>Only about 42 percent of MCBS respondents in nontraditional housing  		reported the availability of <i>any</i> services (not shown), the most common  		being prepared meals (19.5 percent). Only 2.6 percent reported medication  		supervision. Less than half of this group were asked whether they would be  		allowed to remain if needs increased, primarily persons who had reported the  		availability of at least one service. Of persons receiving the question, 51.6  		percent reported that they could remain, similar to the proportion than for our  		MCBS residential care population.</p>
<p>Service responses are not reported in <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table3">Table 3</a> for  		the NLTCS because the questions are asked only of the 58 percent of our NLTCS  		residential care sample who were identified on the control card as being in  		assisted living and refer to whether services actually are provided <i>to the  		sampled person</i> rather than whether they are available or offered. Despite  		the identification of their residence specifically as <i>assisted living</i>  		12.6 percent of community respondents who received the questions reported  		receiving none of the listed services, and most of the remainder reported  		receiving only meals, housekeeping, or both. Only 6.3 percent reported  		receiving help with eating, and 12.1 percent reported help with mobility, the  		two ADLs included in the NLTCS service list. In contrast, all persons in the  		NLTCS facility residential care population who were identified as being in  		<i>assisted living</i> and received the service questions, reported that their  		facility provided receiving meals and housekeeping to them. Two-thirds reported  		that they received mobility help from their facility, and 58.1 percent reported  		receiving help with eating.</p>
<h2><a name="char" id="char">CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESIDENTIAL CARE  		POPULATION</a></h2>
<p>Using available data to construct estimates of the residential care  		population that are as comparable as possible supports similar conclusions  		about the size of this population across the three surveys, despite important  		differences in survey methodology. In this section, we compare health and other  		characteristics of the population across settings to examine the  		characteristics associated with each setting, but also to examine whether the  		criteria used to identify residential care appear to be capturing similar  		populations. Because of remaining differences in measures of characteristics,  		we are less concerned with differences in the characteristics across the  		surveys than with whether characteristics change in similar and expected ways  		when moving from one residential situation to another.</p>
<p>An issue we highlight is that, like the population estimates,  		comparisons of the characteristics of subpopulations across the surveys are  		complicated not only by differences in the way characteristics are measured,  		but also by differences in the way the surveys define the community and  		facility populations. To make distinctions as clear as possible, we use the  		population in traditional private residences as the base and compare their  		characteristics with those of persons in community residential  		care, facility residential care, combined community and facility  		alternative residential care, and nursing homes.</p>
<p>Because of the differences in how surveys define facility  		residential care, the combined population may provide a more reliable picture  		of alternative residential care in cases where similar measures are available  		for both community and facility populations. Combining the samples also  		provides greater sample size and more precision. As will be seen, although most  		estimates meet a reasonable standard for precision, in some cases small  		alternative residential care sample sizes result in imprecise  		estimates.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> Unweighted  		residential care sample sizes range from 111 (NLTCS facility residential care)  		to 228 (NLTCS community residential care). (See <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#appendA">Appendix</a>  		for details.) </p>
<h3>Health Characteristics</h3>
<p>All three surveys indicate the expected increase in the prevalence of  		disability and poorer health moving from traditional private housing to  		residential care to nursing homes (<a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#table4">Table 4</a>). The pattern  		is clearest for disability in IADLs and ADLs, general health, Alzheimers  		disease and other dementias, mental disorders, and recent stroke. Patterns are  		mixed for other conditions. The lack of information about IADLs and about  		conditions other than Alzheimers or other dementia for NLTCS  		institutional residents is a limitation.</p>
<p><b><i>Disability Composition</i></b></p>
<p>The MCBS and the HRS estimates suggest that about two-thirds to 70  		percent of persons living in community residential care receive no help with  		ADL or IADL disability compared with more than 80 percent of persons living in  		traditional private homes.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> The NLTCS provides a fairly similar profile of  		disability in traditional housing, but finds a lower rate of IADL disability in  		both traditional housing and community residential care, and a higher rate of  		ADL disability in community residential care. Only 55 percent of the NLTCS  		community residential care population receive no help with any of the included  		ADLs or IADLs. The HRS and the MCBS indicate that only 14-15 percent of the  		community residential care population are receiving ADL help, compared with the  		NLTCS estimate of about one-third. </p>
<p>The disability distributions within the MCBS and NLTCS community and  		facility residential care populations appear to support the importance of  		community and facility definitions in observed population composition. As  		expected, both surveys indicate higher disability levels moving from community  		to facility residential care settings and from alternative residential care to  		nursing homes, with the NLTCS finding far higher prevalence of three or more  		ADLs in all settings. When the community and facility residential care  		populations are combined, however, estimates from the two surveys are far more  		similar, with about 40-45 percent reporting at least one ADL disability,  		compared with 84-97 percent of nursing home residents. It should be recalled  		that no IADL information is collected for institutional residents on the NLTCS.  		As a result, we do not report NLTCS estimates of either the proportion with no  		disabilities or the proportion with IADL only disabilities.</p>
<p><b><i>Self-Reported Health</i></b></p>
<p>The general pattern of poorer self-reported health for persons living in  		community residential care settings relative to persons in traditional housing  		is evident in both the HRS and the NLTCS. The MCBS does not show significantly  		poorer self-reported health among persons in community residential care. Again,  		this finding is consistent with our speculation that the broader MCBS facility  		definition captures some persons who would be in community residential care,  		according to HRS and NLTCS definitions. Because the NLTCS does not collect  		self-reported health for its institutional population, the progression from  		community to facility care can be observed only in the MCBS, but estimates  		support the expectation of poorer health in facility settings and in nursing  		homes relative to alternative residential care. Most strikingly, only 30.7  		percent of residents in combined community and facility residential care  		settings report fair or poor health, compared with more that twice that  		proportion in nursing homes. </p>
<p><b><i>Medical Conditions</i></b></p>
<p>Among the medical conditions examined, the clearest result is for  		Alzheimers and other dementias, which are measured in all settings on  		both the MCBS and the NLTCS. Alzheimers and other dementias are more  		common in all residential care settings, and, not surprisingly most common  		among nursing home residents. All three surveys indicate a very low prevalence  		of cognitive problems among persons in traditional private homes--roughly 2-3  		percent. The HRS and MCBS both show a prevalence of cognitive problems in  		community residential care twice that in traditional residences (about 5  		percent and 8 percent respectively), but neither estimate is precise. The  		corresponding NLTCS estimate is 13.3 percent. Question wording may contribute  		to the higher NLTCS estimate. Both the HRS and the MCBS ask whether a doctor  		has identified the cognitive problems, but the NLTCS does not, and the NLTCS  		measure includes the arguably broader senility. The NLTCS facility  		residential care estimate (42.4 percent) is similar to the MCBS estimate for  		facility residential care (40.7 percent). When the community and facility  		residential care populations are combined, estimates from the two surveys are  		also similar. About 20 percent of the NLTCS population in all alternative  		residential care settings suffer from cognitive problems, compared with about  		25 percent of the similar MCBS population. </p>
<p>All three surveys indicate higher rates of recent stroke in community  		residential care, although the apparently higher rates for the MCBS alternative  		residential care samples are not significantly different from the rate in  		traditional housing. Both the HRS and the MCBS show higher rates of mental  		disorders other than dementia in the residential care population, although the  		MCBS estimates are significantly higher only for facility and combined  		residential care. Estimates from all three surveys indicate that neither  		diabetes nor chronic lung disease is more common in community residential care  		than in traditional housing. In fact, the MCBS finds diabetes to be only  		modestly more common among nursing home residents. Hip fracture appears to be  		more common in community residential care according to the MCBS and NLTCS  		estimates--in fact more common in these settings than in any other on the  		MCBS--but the HRS finds it no more common than among person living in  		traditional residences.</p>
<h3>Demographic Characteristics</h3>
<p>The three surveys provide a consistent broad demographic profile of the  		residential care population, with a few notable exceptions. Relative to older  		persons remaining in traditional housing, the population in all residential  		alternatives to nursing homes is substantially older, and more likely to be  		female and unmarried. All three surveys indicate that a larger proportion of  		persons in alternative residential care are White, although the difference for  		the HRS community residential care population is not significant. All three  		surveys also appear to show a higher proportion of the alternative residential  		care population with very low income, but, again, the HRS estimate for  		community residential care is not significantly different from the estimate for  		persons in traditional housing. Only the MCBS also finds that a significantly  		higher proportion of the community residential care population has income above  		$40,000. </p>
<p>There is considerable agreement across the surveys about the composition  		of the population in traditional housing, with more than half between age 65  		and 75, about one in ten age 85 or older, 87-89 percent White, about 57 percent  		women, and a similar proportion married. There is less agreement with respect  		to very low incomes among the population in traditional housing, with the HRS  		finding the smallest proportion (11.3 percent) and the NLTCS the highest (19  		percent).</p>
<p>Less consistency is seen in comparisons of the HRS community residential  		care population with either the community or combined community and facility  		alternative residential care populations on the MCBS and NLTCS. The most  		striking differences are for age, race, and gender composition. Only about  		one-third of the HRS community residential care population is age 85 or older,  		compared with estimates of about half of the community and facility alternative  		residential care populations from the MCBS, and about 40 percent of the  		combined alternative residential care population from the NLTCS. About 9  		percent of the HRS residential care population are nonWhite, compared with half  		that proportion of community and combined alternative residential care  		populations from the MCBS and NLTCS. HRS respondents in residential care are  		also somewhat less likely to be female--about two-thirds, compared with about  		three-quarters of persons in alternative residential care settings on the other  		two surveys.</p>
<p>Comparison of the residential care populations from the MCBS and the  		NLTCS reveal more regularity, although, again, with some notable differences.  		Comparing the combined alternative residential care population and the nursing  		home population in the two surveys, both surveys find that nursing home  		residents are more likely to be nonWhite but no significant difference in the  		distribution by gender. The NLTCS nursing home population is more likely than  		the alternative residential care population to be very old, whereas the MCBS  		populations in the two settings are similar in age distribution. Both surveys  		indicate that a majority of residents in alternative residential care and  		nursing homes are widows, although the NLTCS finds a somewhat larger  		proportion--about two-thirds compared with about 60 percent for the MCBS. Both  		surveys also indicate that about one-quarter of persons in alternative  		residential care and about 40 percent of nursing home residents have annual  		incomes below $10,000. The two surveys differ, however, with respect to the  		rest of the income distribution for persons in alternative residential care and  		nursing homes, with the MCBS generally indicating lower incomes in both  		settings, but particularly in nursing homes, where only 6 percent of the  		nursing home population has income of $40,000 or more, compared with 27 percent  		of NLTCS nursing home residents. We investigated different income categories on  		the MCBS and also examined the NLTCS income distribution excluding imputed  		cases but could find no ready explanation for why the two surveys yield such  		different results regarding higher incomes in nursing homes.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Estimates from three major national surveys of the older population  		indicate that about 6.5 percent of persons age 65 or older--about 2.2 million  		persons--live in some type of residential care other than settings for special  		populations such as the mentally ill or mentally retarded. The estimates  		indicate that most--about 1.45 million--live in nursing homes, but more than  		750,000 live in alternative residential care settings.</p>
<p>We also found consistency in the characteristics of the residential care  		population across the three surveys. As expected, estimates from all three  		surveys indicate that, relative to elders remaining in traditional private  		housing, this residential care population was far more likely to receive help  		with ADLs and to suffer from Alzheimers disease or other dementias.  		Estimates from the two surveys including the facility or institutional  		populations, indicate that the prevalence of disability and dementias is  		dramatically higher in facility residential care than in community care  		settings, and higher yet in nursing homes. Persons living in residential care  		facilities are more likely to be over age 85, more likely to be female, and  		more likely to be widowed, than are persons residing in traditional housing.  		Residential care facilities serve a broad income range. Persons living in those  		facilities are more likely to have incomes below $10,000, roughly approximating  		the federal poverty level for older couples. Only the MCBS estimates indicated  		that the community residential care population was also more likely to have  		high income above $40,000 than persons in all other types of residence. In both  		the MCBS and the NLTCS the proportion who are nonWhite was lower than in either  		traditional private housing or nursing homes.</p>
<p>The consistency of estimates across three major national surveys, after  		reducing methodological differences to the extent possible, provides confidence  		in the existing data on the size and characteristics of the residential care  		population. Two different methods are used to obtain data on the  		characteristics of the persons residence. Individuals are asked to  		describe their type of residence. The responses yield a set of place types  		(e.g., retirement community, assisted living, etc.). The other method is to ask  		individuals whether or not the place they live offers specific services,  		usually by asking about each service on the interviewers list of  		potential services. However, accurately identifying a residential care facility  		as the place of residence through the use of survey questions is difficult.  		Neither named place type, as in the NLTCS, nor services alone, as in the HRS,  		appears to be sufficient to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the  		setting. </p>
<p>For example, the NLTCS allows identification only by named setting type,  		and makes special effort to identify assisted living. The NLTCS  		reports a larger proportion of community residents in generic types of  		senior or retirement housing than do the other two  		surveys. However, no information is gathered on services available, regardless  		of whether the respondent uses them. Consequently, it is difficult to determine  		whether these generic settings meet the criteria for alternative residential  		care, such as those proposed by the ALW or used in state licensing.</p>
<p>Among the MCBS community residential care population, which we  		identified using a combination of named place type and services offered, only  		about 30 percent identified their residence by name as assisted living or any  		other place type clearly associated with residential care. About 8 percent of  		the group reporting that their residence was assisted living reported that none  		of the services included in the survey were available, and only about  		three-quarters reported the availability of medication supervision, considered  		to be a hallmark service for higher quality residential care settings. </p>
<p>Finally, although the estimates of the characteristics of the  		residential care population provided here show reasonable consistency,  		comparisons were complicated both by differences in measurement and  		availability of data across community and facility settings and by small sample  		sizes. </p>
<p>If, as widely believed, the older population in alternative residential  		care is growing rapidly, either as a substitute for or a precursor to  		traditional nursing homes, it is important to have reliable national data to  		document both the growth and the implications for the welfare of older persons  		with disability. The three major surveys of the older population we examined  		have made a first step in that direction. In fact, such data offer the only  		opportunity for an integrated understanding of the entire long-term care  		delivery system and those who use it, rather than piecemeal examination of  		sometimes artificially defined segments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we conclude that improvements are needed if national  		surveys are to support studies that improve understanding of the residential  		care missing link. Our analysis suggests indicated several key  		areas for improvement: </p>
<ul><li>A hybrid approach to identifying settings would seem to be ideal, in  		  which a broad screen for nontraditional settings is applied, as in the HRS, and  		  then information on both services available and named place type is gathered.  		  Ideally information similar to that in the HRS and MCBS on whether services are  		  included in housing costs or cost extra and whether services are actually used  		  also would be collected.</li>
<li>More consistency is needed across all community and facility settings  		  in the information collected on characteristics of settings and services  		  offered, as well as the characteristics of residents, so that analyses can  		  identify factors associated with choice of setting, transitions between  		  settings, and outcomes.</li>
<li>Existing sources of guidance, such as those cited here, can provide a  		  foundation for survey organizations to identify the minimal array of key  		  setting characteristics and services needed to identify and discriminate  		  between residential care settings.</li>
<li>Although growth over time eventually will increase sample sizes, a  		  sound methodology for oversampling the population in alternative residential  		  care is needed if national population-based surveys are to provide the data to  		  support reliable estimates.</li>

<p>This appendix provides detail on the specific variables used and  		decisions made to identify residential settings as consistently as possible in  		the 2002 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), the 2002 Medicare Current  		Beneficiary Survey Cost and Use File (MCBS), and the 1999 National Long Term  		Care Survey (NLTCS). We defined broad groups:</p>
<ul><li>Traditional private residences in the community.</li>
<li>Nontraditional residences (other retirement or special  		  places that cannot be determined to be residential care).</li>
<li>Residential care, further subdivided into nursing homes, alternative  		  community residential care settings, and alternative residential care  		  facilities.</li>
<li>Other facilities, generally such places as rehabilitation  		  hospitals and facilities for the mentally ill or developmentally disabled,  		  which are excluded from our residential care estimates.</li>
</ul><p>The general strategy for defining alternative residential care settings  		was to include any place identified <i>either</i> as being a named residential  		care type <i>or</i>, in the case of the MCBS and the HRS, providing services  		consistent with residential long-term care. We accepted as potential  		residential long-term care settings all places whose residents received an  		institutional interview in the case of the NLTCS or a  		facility interview in the case of the MCBS. In the MCBS, both  		facilities and community settings are identified by named type, but persons  		living in more generic community settings (e.g., retirement community) also are  		asked about services available. The HRS includes only community residents, and  		settings other than traditional private residences are identified <i>only</i>  		generically, but information about services offered is collected for all  		residents in these generic settings. Conversely, we relied entirely on named  		type of setting for the NLTCS because in that survey, information is collected  		on services received, rather than offered, and is asked only of the subset of  		the population identified as being specifically in assisted  		living.</p>
<h3>Health and Retirement Survey (HRS)</h3>
<p><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#tableA1a">Table A.1.a</a> shows our characterization of  		residential setting for HRS respondents. The HRS differs from the NLTCS and the  		MCBS in two major ways. First, the HRS is nominally a household survey  		representing only the population age 51 or older in noninstitutional settings  		as defined by the Decennial Census. Sample members are followed into all  		settings, however, and are eligible for interview if they return to an eligible  		setting. Cross-section weights exclude all persons residing in nursing homes or  		other health facilities, defined as providing all of the following services for  		residents: dispensing of medication, 24-hour nursing assistance and  		supervision, personal assistance, and room and meals. Second, the HRS provides  		no information about named types of residential care, but rather collects  		information about services available to persons reporting in the current or a  		former round that their residence is part of a retirement community,  		senior citizens' housing or some other type of housing that provides  		services. Thus, our categorization of residential setting for HRS  		respondents relies entirely on information about services provided.</p>
<p>For our analysis, we selected respondents age 65 or older. In order to  		compare proportions of the total elderly population in each type of setting  		identified, we needed an appropriate denominator. Cross-sectional weights on  		the 2002 HRS apparently were post-stratified to a control total from the March  		2003 CPS, corresponding to Census civilian noninstitutional population  		estimates for April 1, 2003. Census resident population estimates were  		available only for July 1 of each year. We therefore computed a monthly change  		between the July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, resident population estimates for  		persons age 65 or older and increased the 2002 resident population by 9 months  		to generate the appropriate denominator.</p>
<p>To identify the population in traditional private residences and other  		nontraditional residences, we used two survey variables:</p>
<ul><li>HH101, through which new entrants and those with a residence change  		  since their last interview are screened for residence in retirement or senior  		  citizen housing or other housing with services; and </li>
<li>HH115, which asks whether the setting offers group meals and is asked  		  of all persons identified in the current or a previous round of the survey as  		  living in one of the generic housing types in HH101. Respondents also may  		  dispute the type of setting on this variable and are then excluded from  		  remaining questions about services.</li>
</ul><p>We classified all persons who did not identify their setting as being  		one of the housing types in HH101 or who disputed the classification in HH115  		as being in traditional private residences. Among those reporting one of the  		housing types in HH101, we examined the remaining questions about services  		offered. We defined persons in residential care by two criteria: </p>
<ul><li>all persons in settings offering help with bathing, dressing or  		  eating (HH124), which is a criterion used in the MCBS to identify  		  facility settings; and </li>
<li>all persons who reported availability of some type of oversight or  		  nursing--either an emergency call button or checks on residents (HH127) or  		  nursing care or a nurse on-site (HH130)--<i>and</i> help with housekeeping  		  (HH121) and group meals (HH115).</li>
</ul><h3>Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)</h3>
<p>The MCBS Cost and Use file includes Medicare enrollees of all ages who  		were enrolled at any time during the survey year. To approximate a  		cross-section of enrollees age 65 or older, we therefore selected a sample of  		respondents who were age 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare on September 1,  		prior to the fall interview in which community residential information and  		other data relevant to our analysis is collected. We identified the residential  		setting on September 1 by using the residential timeline provided on the Cost  		and Use file. The timeline provides the sampled persons residence at each  		point in the year. As described below, in a few cases, where a September 1  		setting was not available from the timeline or was identified as a hospital, we  		examined situations before and after September 1 and other data to place the  		individual in their likely residential setting at fall interview. Following  		advice from survey staff at CMS, we then adjusted the survey weights for our  		sample by age to represent a cross-section of enrollees age 65 or older.</p>
<p><b><i>Community Residents</i></b></p>
<p><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#tableA2a">Table A.2.a</a> shows our categorization of the MCBS  		community population according to residential setting. For persons identified  		as being community residents on September 1, we used the variable HCOMUNTY, in  		which community respondents report their type of setting, to determine  		residence type. Interviewers and survey staff determine whether a setting is in  		the community or a long-term care facility based on rules described below. A  		key factor, however, is that facilities must have supervision of some type (not  		necessarily medical) 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. Thus, under MCBS survey  		definitions, settings in the community should not have such explicit  		supervision. Values for the community residential setting variable HCOMUNTY in  		2002 are as follows:</p>
<table><tr><td scope="row">  .  </td>
<td>  Inapplicable (facility  			 residents)  </td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">  -9  </td>

</tr><tr><td scope="row">  91  </td>
<td>  Other  </td>
</tr></table><p>All community residents reporting any of these settings were considered  		to be in something other than a traditional private residence. Persons  		reporting a value of 3: Assisted living facility were included in our  		residential care population (no one in our sample of Medicare enrollees age 65  		or older reported a value of 8: personal or residential care home) without  		further inspection. Persons in the remaining categories, which may or may not  		be residential care, were included in or excluded from our residential care  		population based on responses to a series of questions about whether their  		residence offers meals, housekeeping, laundry, medication assistance, or  		transportation. We included respondents in these ambiguous settings in our  		community residential care population only if they reported that their  		residence offered assistance with meals, housekeeping or laundry, and  		medication. No question is asked about 24-hour supervision for community  		residents, presumably because 24-hour supervision is a criterion for facilities  		as defined on the MCBS.</p>
<p><b><i>Facility Residents</i></b></p>
<p>Our categorization of facility residents is provided in  		<a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#tableA2b">Table A.2.b</a>. As noted earlier, facility residence is  		determined by survey staff based on interviewer observations and data collected  		in a facility screening interview. Facilities are defined as places that: (1)  		have three or more beds, <i>and</i> (2) are certified by Medicaid or Medicare  		(nursing facilities) <i>or</i> licensed as a nursing home or other long-term  		care facility, <i>or</i> provide at least one personal care service, <i>or</i>  		provide 24-hour, 7 days a week supervision by a caretaker. We included all  		persons interviewed in a place determined to be a facility by this definition  		in our residential care population. The distinction between this MCBS  		definition and the definition used to define an institutional questionnaire  		setting on the NLTCS is that the supervision required on the NLTCS is health or  		nursing-related. We therefore would expect that the facility  		population on the MCBS would be broader than the institutional  		population on the NLTCS. In fact, however, we found that all MCBS facilities  		reported some level of medical or nursing supervision.</p>
<p>We used the facility description variable PLACTYPE associated with the  		September 1 facility setting identified on the timeline to determine the type  		of residential care setting within the universe of MCBS defined facilities. The  		values of PLACTYPE in 2002 are as follows:</p>
<table><tr><td scope="row">  3  </td>
<td>  Continuing Care Retirement  			 Community (CCRC)  </td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">  4  </td>
<td>  Nursing home  </td>

<td>  Rehabilitation  			 facility  </td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">  18  </td>
<td>  Adult/group  			 home  </td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row">  91  </td>
<td>  Other  </td>
</tr></table><p>We first included as nursing homes all places identified as nursing  		homes by the PLACTYPE variable. Other residential care facilities were  		identified by PLACTYPE values of: 3: CCRC, 5: retirement community, 8: assisted  		living, 9: board and care home, 10: domiciliary care facility, 11: personal  		care facility, 12: rest home/retirement home, and 18: adult/group home, except  		for a small number of persons (28 unweighted cases) in facilities identified as  		CCRC, retirement community, or assisted living facility but reporting that all  		beds were certified for Medicare or Medicaid. We included these cases in our  		nursing home estimate. All remaining persons in other types of facilities  		(mental health, MR/DD, rehabilitation facilities, and other) were included in  		the other facilities category.</p>
<p>For persons whose fall interview was in a facility but who were either  		missing facility type or were in a hospital during the period spanning  		September 1, we assigned residence to the type of facility of the next  		situation identified on the timeline.</p>
<h3>National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS)</h3>
<p>All NLTCS respondents are age 65 or older. Respondents are assigned at  		the outset to either a community or institutional  		interview. The NLTCS criterion for receiving the institutional interview is  		either residence in a group setting <i>and</i> receiving daily medical  		supervision of some type or residence in assisted living  		specifically and receiving substantial nursing care. As noted, we included all  		sample members assigned to the institutional interview and living in relevant  		settings in our NLTCS residential care population. We used four variables,  		QUARTER1 from the Control Card portion of the interview, HNC_2B and INC_4_1  		from the community interview, and BED_1_1 from the institutional interview to  		identify persons in community residential care and to further delineate type of  		residential setting in both institutions and the community. </p>
<p>The variable QUARTER1 is the interviewers assessment of the  		respondents residential situation. The possible values are as  		follows:</p>
<blockquote><ol><li>Housing Unit (HU).</li>
<li>Staff quarters in institution.</li>
<li>Assisted Living Community.</li>
<li>Quarters, not a HU, in a rooming or boarding house, convent,  			 commune, foster or family care home, group home, community residential  			 facility, etc.</li>
<li>Residents unit in nursing, convalescent or rest home, or home  			 for the aged.</li>
<li>Patients unit in mental/long-stay hospital.</li>
<li>Nonstaff unit in other institution. </li>
<li>Inmates unit in correctional/detention facility (out of scope  			 for the survey and excluded from the sample).</li>
<li>A recode to 9 indicates that a community questionnaire was  			 administered although the original QUARTER1 was coded 8 or blank, or an  			 institutional interview was administered although the original QUARTER1 was  			 coded 2, 8, or blank.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>All values of QUARTER1 occur in both the community and institutional  		interview samples, except 2, which identifies persons living in staff quarters  		of an institution. This small group appears only in the community sample and is  		included in our classification as living in a traditional housing unit.</p>
<p><b><i>Community Residents</i></b></p>
<p><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#tableA3a">Table A.3.a</a> shows our residential classification  		of the NLTCS community population. We included in the residential care  		population all persons receiving the community interview whom the interviewer  		identified as living in an assisted living community (QUARTER1=3). Only persons  		with this QUARTER1 value were asked about services provided to them by the  		assisted living community. They were then assigned to the community  		questionnaire if they reported that the community did not provide them with  		Substantial nursing care of any kind. (Assisted living residents  		reporting substantial nursing were assigned to the institutional interview.) In  		one additional case, a community questionnaire respondent the interviewer  		identified as being in a housing unit (QUARTER1=1) was asked the services  		questions and reported services. We treated this case as community residential  		care along with the remaining persons with a QUARTER1 value of 3 and not  		reporting nursing care.</p>
<p>We also included in residential care all community residents with a  		QUARTER1 value of 5, 6, or 7, all of which are included in Census definitions  		of institutional or noninstitutional group quarters.<sup><font><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Whereas QUARTER1 values of 3, 5, 6, and 7 clearly describe residential  		care settings, values of 1 (housing unit), 4 (Quarters, not a housing  		unit) and 9 (recode) may or may not be residential care. For these  		values, we first examined values of the variable INC_4_1 from the community  		questionnaire, in which the respondent characterizes the residential setting as  		follows:</p>
<blockquote><ol><li>Alone or with others in a house/apartment (independent  			 living).</li>
<li>In a retirement home.</li>
<li>In a boarding home, rooming house, or rented room.</li>
<li>In a foster or family care home.</li>
<li>In a group home or community residential facility.</li>
<li>In assisted living setting with board and/or personal care services  			 available.</li>
<li>In another place.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>We selected INC_4_1 values of 4, 5, or 6 as clearly being named  		residential care settings. All persons with QUARTER1 values of 1, 4, or 9 and  		one of these INC_4_1 values were included in our residential care population.  		Standing alone, a QUARTER1 value of 4 indicates a group setting but is less  		clearly residential care because it includes settings such as boarding houses  		and convents, along with residential care settings such as foster or family  		care, group homes, and residential care facilities. For the remainder of this  		group who did not have INC_4_1 values of 4, 5, or 6, we examined an additional  		variable HNC_2B in which respondents identified whether their residence was  		part of a building or community intended for older or retired, or  		disabled persons. Persons with a QUARTER1 value of 4 and a yes response  		to HNC_2B were also included in our residential care population.</p>
<p>Finally, we assigned remaining persons who had QUARTER1 values of 1 or 9  		and reported residence in a community or building for retired or disabled  		persons in HNC_2B to the marginal category of persons in nontraditional or  		special settings that are neither traditional housing nor clearly residential  		care.</p>
<p><b><i>Institutional Residents</i></b></p>
<p><a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#tableA3b">Table A.3.b</a> shows our classification of the  		NLTCS institutional population. For the institutional population we used a  		combination of the QUARTER1 value and the facility type reported in the  		variable BED_1_1 to determine the type of facility. The classification is shown  		in <a href="size-and-characteristics-residential-care-population-evidence-three-national-surveys.html#tableA3b">Table A.3.b</a>. Values of BED_1_1 are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><ol><li>Hospital, other than SNF or ICF unit.</li>
<li>Skilled nursing facility (SNF).</li>
<li>Intermediate care facility (ICF).</li>
<li>Other (noncertified) nursing home.</li>
<li>Domiciliary or personal care facility.</li>
<li>Institution/facility for the mentally retarded/developmentally  			 disabled (MR/DD).</li>
<li>Mental health center/facility.</li>
<li>Another place.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>We first included as nursing home residents all facility respondents  		with a BED_1_1 value of 2, 3, or 4, all of which explicitly identify nursing  		homes, and all persons with a QUARTER1 value of 5 (residents unit in  		nursing, convalescent or rest home, or home for the aged), and a BED_1_1 value  		indicating something other than a MR/DD, mental health, or other place. We used  		the residential setting indicated by QUARTER1 to categorize 20 persons with a  		facility type of hospital. Two cases of these 20 cases had a QUARTER1 value of  		assisted living and were classified as being in assisted living; 14 had a  		QUARTER1 value of nursing home or home for the aged (ten of these cases were in  		facilities also reporting some certified beds) and were classified as being in  		a nursing home; and the remaining four cases had a QUARTER1 value of mental or  		long-stay hospital and were classified as being in other  		facilities. All other persons with a BED_1_1 value indicating MR/DD, mental  		health, or another place, or with a QUARTER1 value indicating a mental or  		long-stay hospital also were identified as being in other  		facilities. Remaining unassigned facility residents with QUARTER1 and BED_1_1  		values indicating something other than a nursing home or mental retardation or  		mental health facility, were identified as living in an alternative facility  		residential care.</p>
<p>We also examined, but did not use in determining the type of facility,  		variables indicating whether the facility reported being certified as a  		Medicare or Medicaid SNF or as a Medicaid ICF, relying instead on the  		interviewer and respondent reports of type of facility. In a large number of  		cases the sum of beds reported as certified by Medicare or Medicaid and not  		certified exceeded the total number of beds reported for the facility, so that  		we could not determine the number of beds that were certified or whether the  		respondent was in such a bed. We therefore used certification information on  		the NLTCS only to identify certified facilities among those we had otherwise  		classified as nursing homes.</p>

<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">We</a> originally intended to provide estimates from  			 both the Access to Care and Cost and Use files, but found that estimates were  			 very similar, and the Cost and Use file provides the ability to approximate a  			 cross-section of enrollees more comparable to samples in the other surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Frank</a> Eppig, of the Center for Medicare and  			 Medicaid Services' Office of Research, Development, and Information suggested  			 this approach for approximating a cross-section of enrollees and provided the  			 enrollment control totals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">To</a> construct this denominator, we examined  			 Census estimates of the noninstitutional population and found that the sum of  			 the HRS weights for persons age 65 or older most closely matched the  			 noninstitutional population estimate for April 1, 2003 (found at  			 <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/national/asrh/2003_nat_ni.html">http://www.census.gov/popest/national/asrh/2003_nat_ni.html</a>).  			 Because Census resident population estimates were available only for July 1, we  			 calculated the average monthly change between estimates for July 1, 2002, and  			 July 1, 2003 (found at  			 <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/national/asrh/NC-EST2003-as.html">http://www.census.gov/popest/national/asrh/NC-EST2003-as.html</a>),  			 and increased the July 1, 2002 resident population to reflect the 9 months  			 between July 1, 2002, and April 1, 2003.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">An</a> additional IADL, help with housework, also  			 appears on all three surveys, but was not included in our disability measure  			 because the HRS item refers to help with housework or yard work and, unlike the  			 remaining IADL items, is not conditioned on difficulty or otherwise linked with  			 need for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">For</a> the community sample we used marital status,  			 age, gender, education, and race as classification variables, collapsing when  			 necessary because of small cells. For about 12 percent of the community sample,  			 we were also able to use information on broad income categories collected  			 through unfolding questions designed to bracket missing values. For  			 the institutional sample, where sample sizes were smaller, we used whether  			 Medicaid was reported as a payment source, marital status, and age as  			 classification variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">Estimates</a> with a relative standard error (the  			 ratio of the standard error to its associated estimate) of 30 percent or  			 greater are indicated in the tables by the # sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">As</a> a reminder, the disability measure is help  			 with the subset of ADLs and IADLs that can be measured on all surveys. The ADLs  			 are bathing, dressing, transferring (to or from bed or chair), getting around  			 inside or walking, toileting, and eating. The IADLs are shopping, meal  			 preparation, telephoning, and managing money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">Only</a> one community respondent had a QUARTER1  			 value of 6: Patient's unit in mental/long-stay hospital. We included this  			 respondent in our community residential care population rather than retaining a  			 separate category.</p>
