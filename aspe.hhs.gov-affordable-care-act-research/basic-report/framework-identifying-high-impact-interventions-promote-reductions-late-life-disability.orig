<p>Considerable evidence now suggests that the prevalence of disability  		among older Americans is declining; however, how best to implement intervention  		strategies to promote continued or accelerated declines in disability  		prevalence remains unstudied. The purpose of this report is to develop and  		begin to demonstrate a new framework for comparing the population-level effects  		of different types of interventions. Drawing upon elements of the proposed  		framework, we reviewed the literature for seven illustrative interventions and  		also conducted several simple modeling exercises. Of the seven approaches we  		reviewed, evidence of modest reductions in the risks of disability is strongest  		for exercise programs that increase strength, balance, and physical activity of  		older adults; depression screening, combined with referral and feedback and a  		treatment program combining therapy with pharmacologic treatment; and  		multi-factor fall prevention programs. Because they can be targeted at  		potentially large populations, widespread implementation of such interventions  		could potentially reduce the prevalence of disability in the short run if  		adherence issues could be successfully addressed. Little evidence exists,  		however, about the long-term effects of such interventions. This exercise has  		also provided several additional insights into how to reduce population-level  		disability prevalence among the elderly population. Our most striking finding  		is that efforts with the largest potential for success are those targeted at  		individuals whose life experience is exemplified by a prolonged period of  		disability and frailty before death. Multi-factor interventions that are  		targeted at frail individuals and that address individualized needs appear to  		be the most promising. Both short and long-term effects are critical to  		consider when evaluating the population-level impact of such interventions.  		</p>
<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p><b><i>Motivation and purpose.</i></b> Considerable evidence now suggests  		that the prevalence of disability among older Americans is declining. This  		finding suggests that not only are older people living longer, but they may be  		enjoying more years of active life. </p>
<p>How best to implement intervention strategies to promote continued or  		accelerated declines in disability prevalence remains unstudied. Studies of  		disability trends among the population ages 65 and older have focused almost  		exclusively on establishing trends in disability prevalence and, to a lesser  		extent, potential explanations for those trends. Studies of individual  		interventions occasionally include projected effects at the population level,  		but in general such studies do not facilitate explicit comparisons among  		various types of interventions. </p>
<p>Identifying high-impact interventions to reduce disability prevalence  		requires reconceptualizing disability at the individual level and translating  		those ideas into population-level implications. The purpose of this report is  		to develop and begin to demonstrate a new framework for comparing the  		population-level effects of different types of interventions.</p>
<p>With the framework in mind, we reviewed the literature for seven  		illustrative interventions, seeking to learn how existing strategies compare.  		To focus the scope of this exercise, we purposefully limited our attention to  		interventions that were existing but not already widespread, had some published  		evidence demonstrating efficacy, and if implemented, could provide benefit  		within a few years. We selected the following interventions from a list of 12  		by tabulating rankings provided by external reviewers with input from the  		Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and project team  		members:</p>
<ol><li><b>Implement smoking cessation</b> programs for the older  		  population.</li>
<li><b>Improve exercise</b>. The literature review focuses on exercise  		  interventions in frail but otherwise healthy elderly people.</li>
<li><b>Implement good chronic disease care</b>. To narrow this set of  		  interventions, we focus on chronic disease care for a commonly disabling  		  condition: congestive heart failure (CHF).</li>
<li><b>Implement depression screening, treatment, and follow-up</b>.</li>
<li><b>Implement fall prevention systems for frail elderly  		  persons</b>.</li>
<li><b>Modify homes and provide assistive devices</b>.</li>
<li><b>Implement widespread care planning for seriously ill  		  people</b>.</li>
</ol><p>We also reviewed the relatively limited literature evaluating  		multi-component interventions aimed at preventing or alleviating disability in  		late-life. </p>
<p><b><i>Conceptual underpinnings of framework</i></b>. The proposed  		conceptual framework extends existing frameworks and models in several ways.  		First, building on the Institute of Medicines disablement process  		framework,<sup><font><a href="#ref1">1</a></font></sup> the approach  		distinguishes among interventions designed to affect an individuals risk  		along different junctures of the disablement process from onset of disease to  		death. Second, building on Lunney and colleagues,<sup><font><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup> the proposed approach  		explicitly recognizes that interventions are often designed for and targeted at  		individuals with specific diseases and injuries, many of which conform to one  		of three prototypical trajectories: (1) a short period of evident decline  		(e.g., in patients with cancers); (2) moderate and slowly declining functioning  		with intermittent exacerbations and sudden dying (e.g., organ system failures);  		and (3) a prolonged period of disability before death (e.g., dementia,  		disabling strokes and frailty). Third, we extend well-established notions in  		the epidemiological literature about risk factors and health outcomes to  		explicitly address the effect of interventions aimed at altering distributions  		of risk factors for late-life disability. </p>
<p><b><i>Key factors to consider. </i></b>The change in cross-sectional  		disability prevalence that would emerge in the presence and absence of an  		intervention(s), depends on three key factors:</p>
<ol><li><b><i>At which trajectory</i></b>(ies) and <b><i>at what point in the  		  disablement process</i></b> is the intervention targeted? What are the  		  competing risks for other trajectories, causes of disability, and death?</li>
<li>What is the <b><i>size of the target population</i></b> among the  		  current older population and among future cross-sections? That is, how large a  		  target population has the risk factor(s) targeted by the given intervention?  		  </li>
<li>What is the effect of the intervention on <b><i>disability</i></b>  		  (either directly on disability or indirectly through shifts in functioning or  		  illness trajectories) and <b><i>mortality</i></b>? The effect in the population  		  will be influenced by:
<ul><li>the risk factors influence on disability and  				mortality;</li>
<li>the interventions efficacy in reducing the risk factor (how  				well it works in ideal circumstances) over time;</li>
<li>the likely extent of adherence to the intervention in the target  				population (what percent maintain the protocol) in the short-run and  				longer-run; and</li>
<li>the generalizability of study results (i.e., the difference  				between the composition of the at-risk population and those in clinical trials  				in factors related to the efficacy of the intervention).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>In the proposed framework we consider disability to be the inability to  		carry out tasks independently, that is, without help from another person. Thus,  		in this framework, an environmental modification (e.g., addition of grab bars  		or ramp) that allows an individual to maintain independence would be considered  		an intervention that reduces the prevalence of disability. The approach we  		develop allows for a discussion of tradeoffs in both the short-term and  		long-term. </p>
<p><b><i>What is high-impact</i></b>? Our interest is in identifying and  		comparing potentially high-impact interventions. We estimate that  		in a one-year period, it would take approximately 175,000 fewer people ages 65  		and older with disability to generate a 1% decline in disability (e.g., from  		20% to 19.8%). To gain a sense of what a high-impact intervention might achieve  		in the longer term, we created a very simple simulation to suggest what  		combinations of: (1) trajectory dynamics, (2) target population size, and (3)  		effects on disability and mortality, would be needed to sustain a 1% per year  		decline in disability. Our calculations suggest that a number of scenarios  		could move the age-adjusted disability rate, for instance, from 20% to 16% in  		20 years. For example, one scenario would require interventions that would  		drastically reduce the expected years with a disability with no improvements in  		longevity for people in two trajectories--from 2.0 to 0.5 for people who die  		from cancer and from 3.0 to 1.0 for people who experience organ failure. A less  		drastic, but still sizeable, compression would be required for interventions  		aimed at the third trajectory (frailty/dementia). That is, the disability rate  		would be reduced by 1% per year from an intervention that reduced the expected  		years with a disability from 5.0 to 3.6 but did not alter life expectancy among  		people in this trajectory. Similar reductions could be achieved by postponing  		the onset of all three trajectories and adding four years of active life on  		average over the next 20 years. </p>
<p><b><i>Short-term comparisons</i></b>. To compare short-run effects of  		the illustrative interventions, we compared interventions along three  		dimensions: size of the population with the targeted risk factor; short-term  		risk of disability associated with the targeted risk factor; and short-term  		effectiveness of the intervention in alleviating targeted risk factor. We found  		that comparisons across studies were particularly challenging because measures  		of disability, composition of study populations, and follow-up periods varied  		widely. Moreover, we were unable to identify a comprehensive study documenting  		either the relative importance of or co-occurrence of the environmental,  		physical, and psychological causes of disability. Nevertheless, we found:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Variation in the size of population with targeted risk  			 factor</b>. Interventions vary widely in the size of the population with the  			 targeted risk factor. Three of the seven interventions we reviewed may be aimed  			 at a large (10-18 million) target population: exercise, fall prevention, and  			 depression screening and treatment; three other interventions--smoking  			 cessation, management of CHF, and advanced care planning--target a  			 substantially smaller population. Depending on how the target population is  			 defined, assistive technology/home modifications fall somewhere in  			 between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Variation in short-term risk of disability associated with  			 targeted risk factor</b>. Interventions vary in effectiveness in part because  			 they target fundamentally different kinds of risk factors for disability. One  			 can, however, group risk factors (and intervention efforts) by the stage of the  			 disablement process at which they are targeted. All else equal, secondary (CHF  			 management, depression management, fall management) and tertiary prevention  			 efforts (assistive technologies and environmental modifications) aimed at  			 groups already experiencing disease or disability will have the greatest effect  			 in the short run. Primary prevention strategies aimed at disease onset  			 (exercise, smoking cessation) will have a weaker impact in the  			 short-run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Effects of intervention on risk factors and on disability</b>. Of  			 the seven interventions reviewed, there was evidence of a potentially modest  			 effect on risk factors of interest for four of them: smoking cessation programs  			 that combine counseling with pharmacologic treatment; exercise programs that  			 increase strength, balance, and physical activity of older adults; depression  			 screening, combined with referral and feedback, and combination  			 therapy/pharmacologic treatment; and multi-factor fall prevention programs. Of  			 those four, only three have been linked to reductions in risks of disability:  			 exercise, depression screening and treatment, and fall prevention programs. The  			 short-term effects of a population-based exercise intervention and of  			 depression screening and treatment on disability risks are likely to be modest  			 whereas multi-factor programs that successfully reduce the risk of falling  			 could potentially have a large effect on the risks of disability.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b><i>Long-term comparisons</i></b>. To compare long-term effects of the  		illustrative interventions, we considered three additional dimensions: How will  		the size and composition of the target population change in the future? At  		which trajectory is the intervention targeted and what are the competing risks?  		What are the effects of the intervention over the remaining lifetime? In  		particular, how will the intervention affect mortality as well as disability?  		We found:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Some targeted risk factors are already on the decline</b>.  			 Several well-known demographic trends have been identified which will influence  			 the effectiveness of interventions--the aging of the population, its increasing  			 racial and ethnic diversity, increases in obesity and related chronic  			 conditions, and increases in educational attainment. In addition, for several  			 of the interventions investigated here, we found evidence of ongoing trends.  			 For instance, four of the seven risk factors of interest--inactivity, smoking,  			 depression treatment, and assistive technology/home modification--appear to be  			 moving already in a direction consistent with disability decline. There is also  			 some evidence that injuries due to non-fatal falls have decreased and that  			 advance care planning is increasing slowly. In contrast, CHF appears to be  			 increasing. Limited information is available on trends in the joint  			 distribution of these risk factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Variation in trajectories targeted and competing risks</b>. Each  			 of the illustrative interventions we reviewed may be targeted at one or more  			 illness trajectories. Exercise and fall prevention, for example, are primarily  			 targeted to older adults whose life experience is exemplified by a prolonged  			 period of disability and frailty before death. CHF management is clearly  			 targeted to a specific type of organ failure. Smoking cessation is likely to be  			 geared toward people who go on to develop cancer or organ failure. Depression  			 screening and treatment, assistive technology and environmental modifications,  			 and advanced care planning are not unique to any one trajectory but may be  			 targeted at all three. The issue of competing risks arises mainly for  			 interventions targeted at the prevention of diseases with earlier ages of  			 onset. That is, interventions designed to prevent cancer or organ failure, if  			 successful, could allow people to experience the longer-lived frailty  			 trajectory. Of the seven illustrative interventions reviewed here,  			 consideration of competing risks is most important for smoking cessation.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Important relationships between lifetime disability and  			 prevalence of disability</b>. In longer-run comparisons it is important to  			 understand the interventions effect not only on disability but also upon  			 the length of life and whether (or what proportion of) additional years are  			 free from disability. Intervention studies rarely examine effects beyond a year  			 or two after the intervention, so we turned to life table analyses for insights  			 into this issue. Using life table principles, we demonstrated the comparative  			 effects on cross-sectional disability of hypothetical interventions affecting  			 disease prevention (through shifts in trajectories), disease management (with  			 and without mortality effects), and disability. We found that:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Disease prevention/trajectory shift</i>: Interventions aimed at  				preventing disease or shifting people from cancer or organ failure trajectories  				to the longer-lived frailty trajectory resulted in no perceptible change in the  				population-level prevalence of disability, due to countervailing effects of  				reduced mortality and increased number of years lived with disability. For  				example, cutting the chances of eventually dying from cancer or organ failures  				by half has a negligible effect on the cross-sectional rate of disability.</p>
<p><i>Disease management</i>: Interventions aimed at managing the  				course of disease will result in declines in disability prevalence only if: (a)  				the intervention does not alter the risk of mortality, or (b) resulting changes  				in disability-free life expectancy exceed changes in disabled life expectancy.  				For example, the exercise interventions discussed in the literature appear to  				be targeted at the frailty trajectory and have no apparent effect on mortality.  				If they delay disability onset by one year in this population (increasing  				disability-free life expectancy by one year), the estimated effect on  				disability prevalence is a reduction from 20.3% to 17.6%. Alternatively,  				suppose that smoking cessation interventions aimed at older people with a  				diagnosis of cancer or organ failure coincided with such diagnoses and resulted  				in an extension of life for both trajectories. In this case the disability rate  				would <i>increase</i> to 21.8%. </p>
<p><i>Shift in the disability threshold</i>: Whether a limitation in  				functioning results in disability depends in part on the environment in which  				tasks take place. If home modifications or assistive technologies could reduce  				the amount of time spent living with a disability by 25%, disability prevalence  				would decline from 20.3% to 16.3%. Much smaller reductions (say of 5%) would  				still yield declines in disability (for example from 20.3% to 19.5%). The role  				of the environment as a component of late-life disability is not well  				understood, but merits further consideration.</p>
<p><i>Mortality-only interventions</i>: An intervention to increase  				advance care planning may have the effect of reducing the period of disability  				at the end of life for frail individuals; but, as currently practiced, efforts  				to increase advance care planning would have practically no effect on the  				cross-sectional prevalence of disability. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol><p><b><i>Summary of key findings</i></b>. Of the seven illustrative  		approaches we reviewed, evidence of reducing the risks of disability is  		strongest for exercise interventions, depression screening and treatment, and  		multi-factor fall prevention efforts. Because they can be targeted at  		potentially large populations, and may have modest or even potentially large  		effects on the risks of disability, widespread implementation of such  		interventions could potentially reduce the prevalence of disability in the  		short run if adherence issues could be addressed. Little evidence exists,  		however, about the long-term effects of such interventions on disability and  		its interplay with length of life. </p>
<p>This exercise has also provided several additional insights into how to  		reduce population-level disability prevalence among the elderly population. Our  		most striking finding is that efforts with the largest potential for success  		are those targeted at individuals whose life experience is exemplified by a  		prolonged period of disability and frailty before death. Multi-factor  		interventions that are targeted at frail individuals and that address  		individualized needs appear to be the most promising. However, both short and  		long-term effects are critical to consider when evaluating the population-level  		impact of such interventions. </p>

<p>Considerable evidence now suggests that older Americans are not only  		living longer, but rates of disability in late-life are declining.<sup><font><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></font></sup> Whether the declines reported over the last  		decade or two will continue is the subject of much debate.<sup><font><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>,  		<a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>,  		<a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>,  		<a href="#ref16">16</a></font></sup> These trends, and their potential  		continuation, are of great interest for several reasons. In view of the large  		growth in both the absolute and relative numbers of older people in the  		population, the care needs and costs, both public and private, of meeting those  		needs, are widely thought to present major fiscal and public-health challenges  		in coming decades. Furthermore, disability is closely related to the quality of  		life not only of those with disabilities, but their family members as well.  		</p>
<p>Projections of the older population suggest that continued declines in  		rates of disability will be important to achieve. One set of projections, which  		assumes continued declines in mortality and disability of 0.6% per year,  		suggests the number of older Americans with disability will increase from about  		six million today to over ten million in 2050.<sup><font><a href="#ref17">17</a></font></sup> Others have noted that impending shifts in  		risk factors related to disability--(such as education)<sup><font><a href="#ref18">18</a></font></sup> or obesity<sup><font><a href="#ref13">13</a></font></sup>--might make it difficult to achieve continued  		declines on the order observed over the past decade or two. Based on a series  		of alternative projections,<sup><font><a href="#ref19">19</a></font></sup> one study concludes that whether the  		decline in population-level disability continues has enormous implications for  		the size of the disabled population in the future and for the ability of the  		society to care for its disabled elderly members.</p>
<p>To date, the discussion has not focused per se on how best to implement  		intervention strategies to promote continued declines in the prevalence of  		disability. Identifying high-impact interventions to reduce population-level  		disability requires a new and broad-based approach to thinking about disability  		at the individual-level, from onset through the end of life and translating  		those ideas into population-level implications. The purpose of this report is  		to develop and begin to demonstrate a new framework for comparing the effects  		of different types of interventions on a consistent set of population outcomes.  		</p>
<p>The report is divided into five major sections. The rest of this chapter  		summarizes the literature that we drew upon in creating the framework that we  		then use to compare the population-level effectiveness of interventions to  		promote disability decline. <a href="#concept">Chapter II</a> presents the  		framework for comparing population-level effects of interventions to reduce the  		prevalence of late-life disability. <a href="#litreview">Chapter III</a>  		presents the methodology used to select and carry out comparisons among seven  		illustrative interventions and provides a summary of relevant evidence from  		randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding each of the seven interventions.  		<a href="#compare">Chapter IV</a> provides insight into the extent of available  		information for quantitative comparisons of short-term and long-term  		differentials in the effectiveness of the illustrative interventions.  		<a href="#summary">Chapter V</a> summarizes major findings.</p>
<h3>B. Background</h3>
<p>Three distinct literatures bear on the development of a conceptual  		framework for evaluating the relative merits of late-life disability  		interventions. Two emphasize conceptual models of disability--both conceived of  		at the individual level. A third set of quantitative studies from the  		epidemiologic and public-health literature has emphasized the etiology of  		disability, quantifying the extent of disability attributable to various  		chronic conditions, and linking risk factors and disease distributions to  		disability prevalence.</p>
<p><b>The Disablement Process and Conceptual Models of Disability</b></p>
<p>A conceptual framework for understanding the disablement process at the  		individual level and identifying strategic points for preventive  		intervention was developed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM).<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> In this model, the concepts of pathology, impairment,  		and functional limitation represent deficits or damage at the cellular, organ,  		and person level, respectively.  Disability is socially  		defined, as it depends upon an interaction of an individuals functional  		limitations with the demands imposed by the environment and his or her own  		expectations about daily life. </p>
<p>As discussed in the IOM report, the standard public-health model  		distinguishes three types of prevention efforts: <i>primary</i>, defined as  		efforts to avoid the onset of pathological processes; <i>secondary,</i> defined  		as efforts aimed at slowing the progression of disease; and <i>tertiary,</i>  		which includes strategies that restore function and increase autonomy among  		people with reduced functional capacity.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>  		Examples of primary prevention efforts include educating about health habits  		(e.g., smoking, alcohol, obesity) and fall prevention. Secondary prevention  		measures include chronic disease management efforts and screening for  		potentially complicating co-morbidities. Tertiary prevention includes  		rehabilitation of physical, cognitive, and functional deficits and the  		introduction of environmental modifications and assistive technology. </p>
<p>The disabling effects of impairments can be reduced or potentially  		eliminated by changes in either the abilities of the individual or the demands  		of the environment.<sup><font><a href="#ref20">20</a></font></sup>  		These adaptations include: ability modification (where the individuals  		capabilities are enhanced through medical intervention and rehabilitation or  		through the use of assistive devices) and environmental modification (where the  		demands of the physical environment are reduced through change of residence or  		installing architectural enhancements).<sup><font><a href="#ref21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The disablement process model is completely general and describes, at  		the individual level, a dynamic process comprising onset of and recovery from  		disease and injury, use and effectiveness of treatments, adaptive responses,  		and feedback mechanisms. A more recent development emphasizes trajectories at  		the end of life.</p>
<p><b>Illness Trajectories at the End of Life</b></p>
<p>Lynn and colleagues have advanced the notion of the trajectory of fatal  		chronic illness which denotes the usual course of illness severity and care  		needs over time.<sup><font><a href="#ref22">22</a></font></sup> Three  		prototypical pathways distinguished by the course of functioning in  		the years before death have been suggested: (1) a short period of evident  		decline (e.g., in patients with cancers); (2) moderate and slowly declining  		functioning with intermittent exacerbations and sudden dying (e.g., organ  		system failures); and (3) a prolonged period of disability before death (e.g.,  		as seen in dementia, disabling strokes and frailty). Recent attempts to verify  		and quantify these trajectories<sup><font><a href="#ref2">2</a>,  		<a href="#ref22">22</a></font></sup> have upheld these conceptual distinctions,  		suggesting that cancer and organ system failure account for about 1/5 of deaths  		each and frailty for up to 40% of deaths. A fourth, smaller group is  		characterized by having no disability and a sudden death (7%-16%). </p>
<p>The terminal illness (e.g., advanced or metastatic cancer)  		trajectory (top panel of <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>) is characterized by a  		short period of decline. The typical cancer patient comes to diagnosis with few  		symptoms and the physical distress associated with the illness is due, at least  		initially, to cancer treatments. These patients may function reasonably well  		with their illness for quite some time before the disease becomes overwhelming  		and non-responsive to treatment. At that point, they usually die within a 6-8  		week terminal phase.<sup><font><a href="#ref23">23</a>,  		<a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a>,  		<a href="#ref27">27</a></font></sup> Among the major causes of death, only  		cancer routinely manifests a clearly defined phase of worsening functional,  		emotional, and social impairment with a high prevalence of symptoms.<sup><font><a href="#ref28">28</a></font></sup> Some cancers do not behave this  		way, most notably breast and prostate cancer; and sometimes AIDS and other  		conditions can follow this pattern.</p>
<p>The advanced, chronic organ system failure trajectory (middle panel of  		<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>) has emerged only recently, as the result of  		sophisticated medications, antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation, which have  		improved the likelihood of surviving acute disease exacerbations that would  		have proved fatal in earlier times for individuals. This trajectory includes  		conditions that tend to have erratic and unpredictable courses, set against a  		backdrop of progressive decline and physical disability. Hospitalization rates  		and survival are predictable for populations, though not for  		individuals.<sup><font><a href="#ref29">29</a></font></sup> These  		patients have long periods of relative stability punctuated by episodes of  		acute illness for which the outcome is always uncertain. This trajectory  		includes individuals who die within a few years, but the persistent uncertainty  		of prognosis keeps them from being acknowledged as terminally ill. The illness  		course is characterized by moderate and slowly declining functional limitations  		between exacerbations. Each exacerbation could result in death, but usually  		these patients have many such episodes over the course of several  		years.<sup><font><a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></font></sup> If they survive an acute exacerbation,  		typically they return to stability but often with diminished functional  		capacity. Examples of such diseases are congestive heart failure (CHF) and  		chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<sup><font><a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the dementia/frailty disease trajectory (bottom panel,  		<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>) is characterized by a long period with a low  		level of function with a slower decline, and with steadily progressive  		disability, loss of independence, and increasing need for supervision and  		assistance. This course can arise from stroke, Parkinsons disease,  		Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia, or just the declining  		function of various organs that is associated with advanced old age.  		Individuals with these conditions are likely to lose much of their function in  		the course of their disease and yet live on, experiencing intermittent, often  		small, changes in their functional status as they near death. The most severely  		deteriorated patients are dependent in all or most of their activities of daily  		living (ADLs), are unable to engage in purposeful activities, have speech  		limitations, and typically are no longer able to recognize their loved ones.  		People with severe frailty without dementia often die of complications  		following falls or sepsis, and many have delirium or depression as part of the  		experience of their last months.</p>
<p><b>Population Epidemiology and Public-Health</b></p>
<p>A distinct set of studies in the epidemiology and public-health  		literature has raised issues at the population level, focusing on the etiology  		of disability, the extent of disability attributable to specific diseases, and  		how changes in distributions of risk factors or disease might affect  		population-level prevalence of functional limitations and/or disability. </p>
<p><b><i>Etiology of disability</i></b>. Embedded in both the disablement  		process and the illness trajectories is the notion that disability can be  		attributed to a physical or mental illness or injury, or to physiological  		changes associated with aging. Several investigators have found that, among  		people ages 65 and over reporting disability, arthritis and other  		musculoskeletal conditions are the most common conditions reported as  		causes.<sup><font><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>,  		<a href="#ref35">35</a></font></sup> In their review of the literature, Fried  		and Guralnik<sup><font><a href="#ref36">36</a></font></sup> cite 13  		chronic diseases associated consistently with the development of physical  		disability in older adults: arthritis, hip fracture, diabetes, stroke, heart  		disease (myocardial infarction, angina, and CHF), claudication, COPD, visual  		impairment, depression, and cognitive impairment. </p>
<p>For the purposes of identifying high-impact interventions, such  		simplistic classifications pose several problems. First, a substantial number  		of older people attribute their disability to old age.<sup><font><a href="#ref37">37</a></font></sup> Second, as people age, the  		likelihood of a single medical cause for disability decreases. More than half  		of older people with a disability have multiple chronic diseases or  		impairments.<sup><font><a href="#ref38">38</a>, <a href="#ref39">39</a></font></sup> In some instances a disease may not be  		sufficient to cause substantial disability in itself, but may increase risk of  		subsequent functional decline if another condition develops.<sup><font><a href="#ref36">36</a></font></sup> By extension, in some  		circumstances attention to one disease might be sufficient to alleviate  		disability; in other cases multiple underlying problems must be identified and  		addressed. Third, classification according to medical cause ignores the  		critical role of the environment in defining disability. Environmental  		modifications in the home, for example, might enable an older person to remain  		independent despite the onset of chronic disease or injury. </p>
<p><b><i>Studies of population attributable proportion</i></b>. A few  		investigators have attempted to quantify what proportion of disability in the  		population is attributable to different chronic conditions.<sup><font><a href="#ref40">40</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></font></sup> The  		population attributable proportion can be estimated from information about the  		relative risk of disability given a specific chronic condition and the  		prevalence of that condition in the population. For example, one study of  		adults ages 16 and older in the Netherlands from 1989 to 1992 found 25% of  		disability could be attributed to musculoskeletal conditions, and 4% to  		neurological conditions such as stroke.<sup><font><a href="#ref40">40</a></font></sup> Similarly, analysis of data from seniors in  		the Framingham Heart Study interviewed during the 1980s found 15% of disability  		was attributable to osteoarthritis (OA), 10% to depression, 9% to heart  		disease, and 9% to neurological diseases such as stroke.<sup><font><a href="#ref41">41</a></font></sup> Both studies controlled for the presence of  		co-morbidities but did not investigate the joint distributions of multiple  		causes. Moreover, in practice, relative risks are generally drawn from  		cross-sectional prevalence data; hence, whereas they provide some insight into  		the relative contributions of various diseases in a cross-section, they do not  		provide insights into the relationship between the risks of disease and  		disability over the remaining lifetime. Nor have environmental components of  		disability been incorporated into such frameworks.</p>
<p><b><i>Disease elimination studies</i></b>. A related set of studies has  		addressed the tradeoffs from eliminating different chronic diseases. Boult and  		colleagues, for example, demonstrated the future effects on person-years of  		functioning of controlling for six fatal and nonfatal conditions.<sup><font><a href="#ref42">42</a></font></sup> Assuming the prevalence of other  		chronic conditions remained constant, they found that decreasing the prevalence  		of arthritis by 1% every two years would lead to a much greater reduction in  		functional limitation between 2001 and 2049 than would decreasing any of the  		other conditions by the same amount. Decreases in two fatal conditions (cancer  		and coronary artery disease (CAD)) would lead to increases in functional  		limitation. Similarly, Nusselder and colleagues evaluated the effect of  		eliminating a specific disease on the mortality, long-term disability, and  		health status in the Dutch population.<sup><font><a href="#ref43">43</a></font></sup> Assuming independence among competing causes  		of death, they found that eliminating disabling nonfatal diseases such as  		arthritis/back complaints results in a decline in life expectancy with  		disability--that is, an absolute compression of morbidity. Eliminating highly  		fatal diseases such as cancer leads to an increase in the number of years and  		the proportion of life with disability--that is, a relative expansion of  		morbidity. As with the studies of population attributable proportion, cause  		elimination studies do not take into account the multi-factorial nature of  		disability, nor do they provide insight into the extent to which the  		environment could be altered to alleviate disability.</p>
<p><b><i>Studies of population avoidable risk</i></b>. A set of papers from  		on the Global Burden of Disease project, a collaborative project between  		Harvard University School of Public Health, the World Health Organization, and  		the World Bank, for example, explicitly focuses on the burden of risk factors  		for death and disability.<sup><font><a href="#ref44">44</a></font></sup> The analyses draw upon an epidemiologic  		framework that attributes the burden of disease or injury in a population  		(expressed as prevalence) to the distribution of exposure to risk factors in  		the past. The approach they have developed allows one to calculate the extent  		of disability/injury that could have been averted in the population if that  		risk factor had been eliminated, or changed to another distribution, presumably  		through interventions. They use the term avoidable disability to  		denote the extent of <i>future</i> disability that could be avoided due to  		future changes in the distribution of risk factors. Although the authors do not  		explicitly address the link between interventions and risk factors, the general  		approach is useful in that it sets the stage for thinking about the potential  		future effect of interventions at the population level. </p>
<h3>C. Extensions of Existing Framework</h3>
<p>The proposed conceptual framework for comparing population-level  		effectiveness of interventions to promote disability decline integrates and  		extends existing frameworks and models in several ways:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>First, building on the IOM framework, the approach distinguishes  			 among interventions designed to affect an individuals risk along  			 different junctures of the disablement process, from onset of disease to  			 death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, building on Lynn and colleagues, the proposed approach  			 explicitly recognizes that interventions are often designed for and targeted at  			 <i>individuals</i> with specific diseases and injuries, many of which conform  			 to one of three prototypical functional pathways discussed earlier. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, we extend the epidemiological risk factor approach to  			 explicitly include interventions designed to alter the distribution in a  			 population of risk factors for late-life disability. The framework recognizes  			 the multi-factorial nature of interventions and risk factors--that is, they do  			 not have a simple one-to-one correspondence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth, the approach allows for a discussion of tradeoffs in both  			 the short-term and long-term. That is, the approach recognizes that there may  			 be short-term effects (e.g., benefits from interventions in a one-year period),  			 and/or long-term effects (e.g., over the remaining lifetime of successive  			 cohorts of the older population), and that ultimate effects depend on the point  			 in the disablement process in which the intervention is introduced and the  			 risks involved in experiencing alternative (competing) trajectories.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="concept" id="concept">II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</a></h2>
<h3>A. Definitions and Scope</h3>
<p>Our focus here is on interventions late in life (specifically for  		populations ages 65 and older) designed to alter the distribution in the  		population of one or more modifiable risk factors and, therefore, reduce the  		population-level prevalence of disability. </p>
<p>We define <b><i>interventions</i></b> to include strategies that might  		be effective in delaying indefinitely or postponing disability onset, slowing  		the course of decline, or promoting recovery and/or independence. Strategies  		might also modify the risks at any point along the disablement process, by  		altering the risk of disease or injury, functional limitations, or death. Our  		interest is in understanding both the short-term and long-term effectiveness of  		such interventions. </p>
<p><b><i>Effectiveness</i></b> in this context is defined as the benefit of  		an intervention for a given group in the population, and takes into account  		both the efficacy (under ideal conditions of investigation) and the acceptance  		and implementation of the intervention by those in the general population of  		older adults. Thus the effectiveness takes into account issues not included in  		clinical trials, such as compliance and differential efficacy for varying  		groups. </p>
<p><b><i>Risk factors</i></b> in this context refer to any factor that may  		increase an individuals chances of living with a disability--either by  		influencing his or her chances of developing a disease, having functional  		limitations, experiencing disability, or dying. Modifiable risk factors include  		behavioral, medical, social, and environmental factors. Non-modifiable risk  		factors--such as demographic characteristics and genetic makeup--may be  		important in predicting disability onset, recovery, and death but are less  		relevant for our purposes here because one cannot (currently) alter the  		distributions of such factors through interventions in late-life. We refer to  		an individuals unique set of non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors  		related to their risk of disability as their disability <b><i>risk  		profile</i></b>. </p>
<p>One of the major challenges in summarizing the literature is the wide  		variety of disability-related outcome measures used in late-life intervention  		studies. Two widely used approaches differ by whether they measure the extent  		of underlying difficulty--without help or assistive devices--or, the extent of  		residual difficulty--with help or assistive technology if used. A third  		commonly used approach is to determine if help or assistive devices are used to  		carry out basic activities. In the proposed framework in this report, we define  		<b><i>disability</i></b> as the inability to carry out tasks independently,  		that is, without help from another person. Thus, in this framework, an  		environmental modification (e.g., addition of grab bars or ramp) that allows an  		individual to maintain independence would be considered an intervention that  		reduces the prevalence of disability.</p>
<p>To focus the scope of this project, we have purposefully limited  		consideration to interventions that are: (a) existing; (b) not already  		widespread; (c) have some published evidence demonstrating efficacy; and (d) if  		implemented, might provide benefit within a few years in terms of reducing  		disability prevalence in the older population (rather than waiting for decades  		or having most effect upon early or mid-life populations). </p>
<p>Finally, we explicitly recognize the <b><i>multi-factorial</i></b>  		nature of interventions, risk factors, and disability. A given intervention,  		for example, exercise, might affect the distribution of more than one risk  		factor for disability (e.g., recovery from surgery and the risk of injury from  		a fall). In addition, the distribution of a single risk factor (e.g., injury  		from fall) may be influenced by multiple interventions. For example, exercise  		and home modifications both reduce the prevalence of injuries from falls and  		may have larger effects together than either has alone. Thus, we recognize that  		the effects of implementing multiple interventions may not be strictly  		additive, but may have synergistic effects (interacting in either a positive or  		negative direction). </p>
<h3>B. The Proposed Framework</h3>
<p>The proposed framework consists of three perspectives: individual,  		cohort, and cross-sectional. To fully understand the population-level  		phenomena, one must first begin by understanding the complexities at the  		individual level among interventions, risk factors, and illness trajectories.  		We then describe potential intervention effects in terms of a single cohort.  		Finally, we develop an account of how interventions effects on successive  		cohorts of individuals will alter cross-sectional snapshots of disability  		prevalence.</p>
<p><b>Individual-Level Dynamics</b></p>
<p>The four trajectories in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> show  		prototypical patterns of functioning over an individuals lifetime. Each  		can be taken to represent distinctive manifestations of risk profiles taking  		effect as the person ages. </p>
<p>The approach considers not just a single point in ones life, but  		what might happen over the course of an individuals potential lifetime,  		from ages 65 and beyond. In this context, potential lifetime  		extends to some possibly arbitrarily assumed upper limit. For simplicity, here  		the hypothetical lifetime is set to 100 years.<sup><a href="#notea">a</a></sup></p>
<p>The solid line represents a minimum level of physical or cognitive  		functioning necessary to care for oneself. In other words, it may be considered  		a threshold below which a functional limitation results in disability. </p>
<p>The figures demonstrate four prototypical experiences. At one extreme,  		individuals who reach age 65 and develop cancer, for example, ordinarily  		experience the onset of disease early on and eventually evidence a rapid  		decline. In contrast, individuals who develop dementia experience a slow and  		steady decline in functioning for a much longer time period. </p>
<p><a href="#figure2b">Figure 2b</a> illustrates several different ways  		that an intervention may alter the risks of disability. The top panel  		illustrates approaches that may be used to target individuals who experience  		organ failure. Disease management programs, such as those developed to manage  		CHF, shift both functioning and years lived. The bottom panel illustrates  		approaches that may be targeted at individuals whose experience exemplifies the  		frailty trajectory. For example, exercise programs targeted at the frail  		elderly population, may target maintenance of functioning (at a level above the  		threshold for disability), without shifting risks of mortality. In both the  		upper and lower panels, the effect of home modification programs is  		illustrated. Changes to the environment affect disability by shifting the  		disability threshold, rather changing functional status per se. </p>
<p>In addition, although not explicitly illustrated in the figure,  		interventions designed to delay or postpone indefinitely the onset of a  		trajectory, for example, by delaying or preventing cancer or organ failure, may  		increase the risk of another trajectory, for example, the risk of experiencing  		the frailty/dementia trajectory may increase. </p>
<p>The bars in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> summarize for each of the  		illustrative individuals in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>--each following a  		different prototypical trajectory--how much time that person will spend in each  		of five states of the disablement process: healthy, with disease or injury but  		no limitation, functionally limited but without a disability, with a disability  		(defined as dependence), and dead. Thus, <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>  		summarizes, from the perspective of an initial point (e.g., age 65), the  		disease, functional limitation, and disability (and death) trajectory that lies  		ahead. </p>
<p>Starting with the first bar, the hypothetical individual who dies from a  		solid tumor cancer spends five of the 35 potential years between age 65 and 100  		(14%) in a healthy state, two years (6%) with disease but no limitation, one  		year (1%) with functional limitation but no disability, and about two years  		(6%) with a disability before dying at age 75. In this scenario, 26 potential  		years of life (73%) are foregone. The second bar illustrates the proportion and  		years lived in each state for a typical older person with organ failure. In  		this illustration, five years are spent healthy, six years with disease but  		with no functional limitations, one year with functional limitations and about  		three years with disability before dying at age 80. The final bar illustrates  		the proportion and years spent for a typical older person who is frail and  		develops dementia, with 15 years spent without the disease, one year spent with  		the disease but no limitations, one year with limitations but no disability,  		and five years with disability before dying at age 87.</p>
<p>We focus here on illustrative trajectories that are most prevalent.  		About 22% of the population dies from solid tumors, 16% from organ failure, 46%  		with dementia or frailty.<sup><font><a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup> However, we recognize that there are additional  		trajectories that may involve fewer states. For example, an individual who has  		a spinal cord injury early in life might live to age 80, and spend 15 of the  		years between age 65 and death with a disability; alternatively, an individual  		may live to age 80 in a healthy state (with no signs of disease) and die  		suddenly from cardiac arrest. Or, an individual who has experienced repeat  		episodes of depression over his or her lifetime may never develop functional  		limitations but may have periods where he or she is unable to perform basic  		ADLs without help. Nevertheless, emphasizing the three most common trajectories  		will provide the basis for exploring the experience of nearly 85% of the  		population.</p>
<p><b>Population-Level Implications: Cohort Perspective</b></p>
<p>The future experience of a group of people who are all age 65 today--a  		cohorts future experience--is the average of all the individuals  		experiences in the population. <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> shows for a  		hypothetical cohort of individuals who are all age 65 today the average amount  		of time spent in each state, for a baseline case (with no interventions) and  		for the illustrative cases of two different types of hypothetical and  		purposefully exaggerated interventions. That is, suppose at the end of 35 years  		of an intervention for a cohort, the cohorts experience is apportioned  		into the five states as shown in the Figure. Starting with the first bar, the  		baseline case, the hypothetical cohort age 65 today will die on  		average at the age of 82. Of the 35 years between age 65 and 100, the cohort  		will spend on average 11 years in a healthy state (31% of the 35 potential  		years), two years (6%) on average with disease but no limitations, one year  		(3%) with a functional limitation, three years (9%) with a disability, and 18  		years (51%) foregone. </p>
<p>Just as individuals in the cohort have unique disability risk profiles,  		the cohort has a unique distribution of these profiles, and distributions of  		factors that make up the profile. Some of these distributions--such as age,  		sex, race, and cumulative experiences to date--will change in the future but  		are not modifiable per se whereas others--distributions of current and future  		diseases, behaviors, and the environment--may be altered. Thus, over the  		remaining course of the cohorts lifetime, the cumulative amount of time  		the group experiences disability--and the severity of that disability--might be  		affected by interventions that alter the distributions of individuals  		disability risk profiles. </p>
<p>The second bar in <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> illustrates a  		hypothetical intervention that works primarily by altering the environment so  		that the risk of either onset of disability is very low, or the risk of  		recovery from an episode so high, that the average number of years spent with a  		disability is less than one. In the extreme, picture the smart  		house or other supportive environment in which technology makes it possible to  		be independent in instrumental daily activities despite substantial underlying  		functional limitations. Because the risks of developing disease, functional  		limitations, and dying are not affected, the average number of years lived with  		disability is close to one; at the same time the average number of years lived  		with functional limitations increases from one to three on average, (or from 3%  		to 9% of the cohorts potential remaining lifetime).</p>
<p>The third bar in <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> illustrates a more  		complex hypothetical intervention--one that works by both reducing the  		likelihood of developing a disability, and by lowering the risk of death. Given  		this more complex (and more realistic) set of possibilities, it now becomes  		possible that a population may spend on average more years of life with a  		disability, or without, or the additional years of life may be divided somehow  		between the two. This bar illustrates a potential shift in the average amount  		of lifetime spent with a disability due to interventions targeted at both  		disability and death. Suppose, for example, that some intervention--the  		addition of grab bars and a stool to the shower--allows an individual to shower  		independently and reduces the risk of dying from an injury, thereby altering  		both the risk of disability and death. At the end of 100 years this  		intervention might result in more years lived on average (so the average age at  		death is 84 instead of 82). It might also result in a higher average number of  		years spent with a disability (four years instead of three) and with a  		limitation (two years instead of one).</p>
<p>Not shown in the figure are more complex examples of interventions that  		target risk factors earlier in the disablement process--for example  		exercise--which operate on the risks of developing a disease (e.g., CHF) and  		injury (e.g., from a fall). These illnesses and injuries then in turn alter an  		individuals risk of developing later in life functional limitations,  		disability, and ultimately death. Over the lifetime of a cohort such  		interventions might change the cohorts experience with disability in  		complex ways. The cohort-level predictions are even more complicated by the  		issue of competing risks--for example, if CHF and falls are eliminated, how  		many more cases of Alzheimers disease will develop? In other words,  		because an individual will usually go on to develop other illnesses, with  		different prototypical trajectories (potentially ones with a greater risk of  		disability for a longer time period), preventing a disease with an intervention  		does not necessarily result in a lower proportion of a cohorts potential  		lifetime spent with a disability. </p>
<p><b>Population-Level Implications: Cross-Sectional Perspective</b></p>
<p>Now imagine successive cohorts of individuals ages 65 and older. If we  		classified all individuals born over the last 100 years into one of the five  		states in <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> (healthy, has disease but no  		limitation, has limitation but no disability, has a disability, dead), the  		distribution across those states would depend on the age distribution of the  		population and the experience of the cohort over the past 100 years--both  		modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The short-run impact of an  		intervention at the population level will depend upon not only the relative  		short-term effectiveness of that intervention for persons at each age, but on  		the relative size of each age group and the baseline distribution of each age  		group across disease and disability groups. One such possibility is pictured in  		<a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>. <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a> represents a  		point-in-time picture of the population arrayed by age (along the horizontal  		axis) and across states (vertical axis). The solid lines show the baseline  		distribution, while the dashed lines depict an alternative distribution in the  		presence of a hypothetical intervention (alternatively, the reader can view the  		dashed lines as a picture of the same population one year later, after the  		previous years 64-year-olds have aged into it). Again, we include those  		who have died, but could potentially have lived past age 65.</p>
<p>Finally, imagine moving forward in time, and having each cohort that  		reaches age 65 exposed to an intervention beginning the day they turn 65. The  		longer-run impact of a sustained intervention effort will play out over time.  		The change in cross-sectional distributions of the five states that would  		emerge in the presence and absence of such intervention(s) depends on three key  		factors:</p>
<ol><li><b><i>At which trajectory</i></b>(ies) and <b><i>at what point in the  		  disablement process</i></b> is the intervention targeted? What are the  		  competing risk for other trajectories, causes of disability, death?</li>
<li>What is the <b><i>size of the target population</i></b> among the  		  current older population and among future cross-sections.</li>
<li>What is the effect of the intervention on <b><i>disability</i></b>  		  (either directly on disability or indirectly through shifts in functioning or  		  illness trajectories) and <b><i>mortality</i></b>? The effect in the population  		  will be a the influenced by:
<ul><li>the risk factors influence on disability and  				mortality;</li>
<li>the interventions efficacy in reducing the risk factor (how  				well works in ideal circumstances) over time;</li>
<li>the likely extent of adherence in the target population (what  				percent maintain the protocol) in the short-run and longer-run; and </li>
<li>the generalizability of study results (i.e., the difference  				between the composition of the at-risk population and those in clinical trials  				in factors related to the efficacy of the intervention).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><h3>C. What Constitutes High-Impact?</h3>
<p>The proposed framework allows for comparisons across the five key  		factors but does not in and of itself delineate the exact meaning of  		<b><i>high-impact</i></b>. Here we discuss briefly the policy-relevant context  		for establishing a definition of high-impact in both the short-term and  		long-term. </p>
<p>Because policy makers are often concerned with year-to-year variation  		over time, we assume <i>a priori</i> that the goal is to reduce the  		cross-sectional disability prevalence rate. A one-year unit of time is often  		used to track changes in policy-relevant measures. However, when considering  		the long-term outcomes, other appropriate measures of disability that take into  		account individuals remaining lifetimes could also be considered--for  		example, years of active life, proportion of life spent active. </p>
<p>Over the last two decades, the prevalence of disability with ADL or  		instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) tasks, has decreased  		approximately 1% per year.<sup><font><a href="#ref5">5</a></font></sup> According to the National Long Term Care  		Survey, for example, the cumulative effects over the 20 year period have been  		to decrease the rate of chronic disability in the older population from  		approximately 19.8% in 1984 to 15.9% in 1999,<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a></font></sup> and this trend has been considered by policy  		makers and scientists alike to be quite substantial. Others surveys that do not  		focus on chronic disability (lasting three months or more) have found  		comparable declines in terms of percentages, although they report somewhat  		higher levels of disability prevalence (around 20% at the beginning of the 21st  		century, which we adopt here).</p>
<p>Although some have argued that the future holds promise for continued  		declines, others have pointed out countervailing factors that might offset  		future gains.<sup><font><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></font></sup> The debate about future trends (in the  		absence of widespread interventions) is relevant to a discussion of identifying  		high-impact interventions in that these impending changes make it challenging  		to sort out the appropriate comparison group. Disability interventions take  		time to implement and the full effect will only emerge as all birth cohorts are  		exposed to the intervention. Future cohorts of older people will look very  		different from those today, and while some of these impending changes are  		predictable (for example, education levels), others are quite uncertain (for  		example, activity levels). Moreover, interventions may be more or less  		effective for different population groups, so demographic trends will  		undoubtedly mingle with intervention effects.</p>
<p>Still, given the enormous attention paid to declines over the past  		decade of on average 1% per year, we contend that an intervention that results  		in an average annual decline of this size would be considered high-impact. Over  		the next 20 years, such an intervention or group of interventions, all else  		equal, could push the disability rate down from approximately 20%  		today to 16% in the year 2030. Here we provide some insights into the size of  		the target population and effect size that would be required to achieve such  		declines in both the short-term (one-year) and long-term (sustained for  		20-year) time frame.</p>
<p><b><i>Short-run perspective</i></b>. First, we calculate the relative  		risk and population size needed to generate a 1% decline in disability in a  		one-year period. Based on Census figures, mortality data from the National  		Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and published estimates of late-life  		disability incidence, recovery, and mortality,<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a></font></sup> we assume the following:</p>
<ul><li>7.4 out of 35 million people ages 65+ have a disability at the  		  beginning of year;</li>
<li>3.3 million new cases occur during the year among those without a  		  disability;</li>
<li>0.3 out of 2 million new 65 year olds enter with a disability;</li>
<li>1.9 million people with disability at the beginning of the year  		  recover by the end; </li>
<li>Among people with disability at the beginning of the year 1.6 million  		  die during the year, an additional 600,000 people without disability at the  		  beginning of the year die during the year.</li>
</ul><p>Under these circumstances, it would take approximately 175,000 fewer  		people ages 65 and older with disability to generate a 1% decline in disability  		(from 21% to 20.8%) in one year. </p>
<p>This target could be achieved a number of ways, including by decreasing  		incidence rates or increasing recovery rates. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>  		illustrates for several scenarios the impact an intervention must have and how  		widespread the effect must be for a specific age group in order to reduce  		disability prevalence by this amount. For example, if the population ages 65-74  		without disability (14.9 million people) had 0.90 the risk of developing  		disability (a 10% reduction in risk), 175,000 fewer people would develop  		disability during the year. Or, if half the population ages 65-74 without a  		disability (7.4 million) had 0.80 the risk of developing disability (a 20%  		reduction in risk), a similarly sized decline would occur. Alternatively,  		doubling the risks of recovering among 25% of those ages 75-84 with a  		disability (1.2 million people) would also achieve the reduction of 175,000  		cases.</p>
<p><b><i>Long-term perspective</i></b>. The short-run perspective does not  		take into account the fact that interventions may have effects well beyond a  		one-year period. To gain a sense of what a high-impact intervention might  		achieve in the long-term, we created a very simple simulation. The approach  		suggests what combinations of: (1) trajectory dynamics, (2) target population  		size, and (3) effects on disability and mortality, would be needed to sustain a  		1% per year decline in disability. Using calculations based on the National  		Mortality Followback Survey, reweighted to represent a cohort of people ages 65  		and older in 2000, we assign each trajectory, j, the expected values of both  		life expectancy (LEj) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLEj). </p>
<p>The simulation makes the following assumptions: </p>
<ul><li>When an individual reaches age 65, they will take one of four  		  trajectories to the end of life. </li>
<li>22% of individuals will experience the Cancer trajectory with LE of  		  9.5 years and DFLE of 7.5 years (see <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). </li>
<li>16% will be in the Organ Failure trajectory (LE=15, DFLE=12). </li>
<li>46% of the cohort will experience the Frailty/Dementia trajectory  		  (LE=22, DFLE=17). </li>
<li>The remaining individuals will have a life expectancy of 11.5 years  		  with 11 of them lived disability-free. </li>
</ul><p>In a stable population, we can estimate the population prevalence of  		disability by dividing the expected years lived with a disability by the total  		expected years lived. </p>
<table><tr><td><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68671/prodecl-fig6.jpg" /></td>
</tr></table><p>In the baseline scenario, average life expectancy at age 65 is 16.5  		years, and the disability prevalence rate is 20.1%. </p>
<p>Our calculations suggest that a number of scenarios could move the  		disability rate from 20% to 16% in 20 years. We provide assumptions for three  		such illustrations in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, and present results of the  		simulation in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>. One scenario would require  		interventions that would drastically reduce the expected years with a  		disability with no improvements in longevity for people with cancer and organ  		failure: from 2.0 to 0.5 for people with cancer and from 3.0 to 1.0 for people  		with organ failure. A less drastic, but still sizeable, compression would be  		required for interventions aimed at the frailty trajectory. That is, the  		disability rate would be reduced by 1% per year from an intervention that  		reduced the expected years with a disability from 5.0 to 3.6 but did not alter  		life expectancy among people in this trajectory. Similar reductions could be  		achieved by accelerating increases in years of active life--gaining four years  		over the next 20 years--thereby postponing the onset of all three  		trajectories.</p>
<p>Translating these figures into the type of information more readily  		(although not consistently) found in the literature, such as target population  		and effect sizes, is not straightforward. Each year of active life expectancy  		gained could represent infinite number of combinations of target population  		size and disability effect. For example, if 16.1 million older people are  		estimated to be following a course consistent with frailty/ dementia, a one  		year decrease in expected years with disability could involve an intervention  		that reduces disability by one year for all 16 million people, or by two years  		for 8 million (50%) people, or completely for 3.2 million (20%). Moreover,  		effect sizes are rarely if ever reported in terms of effect on remaining  		lifetime or years of disability over the remaining lifetime; and if they are,  		they are generally based on life table calculations drawn from age-specific  		incidence and recovery rates over a much shorter (generally one or two year)  		period. Such estimates of lifetime effects based on age-specific one-year  		incidence rates will be biased if the timing of the intervention in the  		trajectory course matters.</p>

<h3>A. Methodology</h3>
<p><b>Selection of Illustrative Interventions</b></p>
<p>The project team called upon six external reviewers to rank 12  		interventions (see <a href="#append">Appendix</a> for details). To focus the  		scope of this exercise, we purposefully limited our attention to interventions  		that were existing but not already widespread, had some published evidence  		demonstrating efficacy, and if implemented, could provide benefit within a few  		years (rather than waiting for decades or having most effect upon early or  		mid-life populations). We selected the following interventions from a list of  		12 by tabulating rankings provided by external reviewers with input from the  		Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and project team  		members:</p>
<ol><li><b>Implement smoking cessation</b> programs for the older  		  population.</li>
<li><b>Improve exercise</b>. The literature review focuses on exercise  		  interventions in frail but otherwise healthy older people.</li>
<li><b>Implement good chronic disease care</b>. To narrow this set of  		  interventions, we focus on chronic disease care for a commonly disabling  		  chronic condition: CHF.</li>
<li><b>Implement depression screening, treatment, and follow-up</b>.</li>
<li><b>Implement fall prevention systems for frail elderly  		  people</b>.</li>
<li><b>Modify homes and provide assistive devices</b>. Because we expect  		  interventions in the literature to combine home modifications and portable  		  assistive technologies, we combine them here into one review.</li>
<li><b>Implement widespread care planning for seriously ill</b>. </li>
</ol><p><b>Search Strategy</b></p>
<p>We focused our search on randomized trials so that to the extent  		possible, we could identify successful components for interventions. We also  		examined several important descriptive studies although, with regard to  		particular target populations, these studies cannot control for variables that  		may explain the underlying risk factors. We purposefully did not replicate  		previous systematic reviews of the literature, and relied on existing reviews  		from Cochrane and other sources where possible.</p>
<p>Relevant studies were located through a Search of MEDLINE, Ageline,  		Cochrane Library, EBM Reviews, CINAHL, and Psych Abstract using the Reed and  		Baxter approach.<sup><font><a href="#ref46">46</a></font></sup> The  		search was limited to articles published in English since 1980. Search terms  		were limited to elderly samples and randomized controlled  		trials. The searches were conducted with a combination of keywords using  		the following terms: outcome assessment (health care),  		intervention studies, treatment outcome, AND one of the  		following terms: Smoking cessation; Exercise;  		Exercise therapy; Heart failure, congestive;  		Depression; Accidental falls/prevention and control;  		Self help devices; Assistive devices; Home  		modification; Advanced care planning; and Terminal  		care.</p>
<p>The abstracts for each of these publications were subsequently examined  		by two analysts to determine their applicability for review. Relevant studies  		were defined to be those that included any discussion of disability, although  		studies did not have to include disability as their main focus. Abstracts were  		included if they met the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Sample included only older adults 60 years and older.</li>
<li>Methods included of some type of intervention.</li>
<li>Sampling included use of a comparison/control group.</li>
<li>The number of participants in the study groups was specified. </li>
<li>Sufficient information was provided to determine a rate of difference  		  in the outcome measure.</li>
</ul><p>For each study meeting the inclusion criteria, the design, subjects,  		disability-related outcomes, and results were summarized in tabular form.  		Interventions were classified in terms of their dosage or the  		strength of the interventions. To facilitate comparisons, the  		effect sizes for continuous outcomes were calculated as the mean difference in  		the outcome of interest between treatment and control group and for dichotomous  		outcomes was calculated in terms of odds ratios.<sup><a href="#noteb">b</a></sup> Special attention was given to understanding the  		extent of adherence associated with each type of intervention, and to issues  		surrounding moving from efficacy associated with controlled clinical trial  		circumstances generally carried out with a homogeneous sample, to a widespread  		intervention with a more heterogeneous population.</p>
<h3>B. Reviews</h3>
<p><b>Implement Smoking Cessation </b></p>
<p>The U.S. Surgeon General, in a report on the health consequences of  		smoking, recently concluded that smoking harms nearly every organ of the body,  		causing many diseases and reducing the health of smokers in general and that  		quitting smoking has immediate as well as long-term benefits.<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> The risk of disability onset is  		highest among current smokers, followed by former smokers, and then  		non-smokers;<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a></font></sup>  		cumulative years of smoking appears to influence the risk of developing  		smoking-related disease and associated mortality. One study suggests current  		smokers have one and one half times the risk of non-smokers of reporting an  		activity limitation.<sup><font><a href="#ref49">49</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Size of the target population</i></b>. In 2002, 45.2 million  		adults (22.5%) in the United States were current smokers (25.2% of men and 20%  		of women), down from 24.1% in 1998. Compared to other age groups, the elderly  		population has a much lower rate of smoking--9.3% or 3.3 million smokers,  		compared to 28.5% among those aged 18-24.<sup><font><a href="#ref50">50</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions.</i></b> A total of 35 citations were  		reviewed, including four intervention studies that focused on older  		adults.<sup><font><a href="#ref51">51</a>, <a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> Interventions  		included counseling, clinician advice, buddy support programs, age-tailored  		self-help materials, telephone counseling, and nicotine replacement therapies.  		The interventions aimed at people ages 65 and older all involved combined  		intervention strategies. Follow-up ranged from one year to six years. </p>
<p><b><i>Efficacy.</i></b> A comprehensive review for Centers for Medicare  		and Medicaid Services (CMS) indicates that in the general population  		individual, telephone, and group counseling, and pharmacotherapy are all  		effective in promoting smoking cessation, raising the odds of quitting by  		approximately 1.7.<sup><font><a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> The  		Surgeon Generals 2000 report<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> also evaluated a number of smoking prevention  		and cessation interventions aimed at the general population, including  		increasing the cost of cigarettes, increasing clean indoor air regulations,  		reducing treatment cost by providing insurance coverage, implementing telephone  		smoking quit-lines, offering treatment to smokers every time they are seen in  		health care systems, and implementing media campaigns to encourage smokers to  		quit. Pharmacologic treatment of nicotine addiction, combined with behavioral  		support, is estimated to enable 20%-25% of users to remain abstinent at one  		year post treatment. Less intense measures, such as physicians advising their  		patients to quit smoking, are estimated to produce cessation of 5%-10%. </p>
<p>Age does not appear to diminish the benefits of quitting  		smoking.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> Interventions  		that used a combined and comprehensive approach in late-life were able to  		achieve moderate increases in smoking cessation. For example, a preventive  		health care and group support intervention with older adults found quit rates  		were only slightly higher in the intervention group than in the control group  		(24.2% vs. 17.9%, P=0.09) over two years.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> Moreover, not all groups experience equal  		benefits. In a study of elderly patients ages 60-82 receiving nicotine  		dependence counseling and education over four years abstinence was more likely  		if patients were, for example, hospitalized at the time of the intervention and  		married to a non-smoker.<sup><font><a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> Preliminary results from a CMS Medicare  		demonstration project<sup><font><a href="#ref56">56</a></font></sup>  		suggest that a smoking cessation benefit (e.g., a quitline and reimbursement  		for nicotine replacement therapy) may increase quit rates by as much as  		three-fold at six months post treatment.</p>
<p>Existing studies have not explored whether individuals who receive the  		intervention experience reduced rates of disability.</p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence.</i></b> Adherence in this literature was  		discussed primarily in terms of smoking cessation rates, rather than adherence  		to particular aspects of the intervention (e.g., support group attendance,  		adherence to pharmacologic protocols).</p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability</i></b>. Most of the research has been done on  		populations under age 65. However, samples in at least two of the four RCT  		studies of the 65 and older population were drawn from Medicare beneficiary  		populations. </p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory.</i></b> Interventions  		have primarily been directed toward prevention of younger persons starting  		smoking and supporting adults who wish to stop smoking. The primary goal is to  		prevent disease from occurring. Disease consequences of smoking occur  		disproportionately among the elderly population, due to the long duration of  		cumulative injury. Excess mortality is most commonly due to cardiovascular  		disease and lung cancer.<sup><font><a href="#ref57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Improve Exercise </b></p>
<p>The scientific literature has established a positive link between  		physical activity (strength/resistance and aerobic exercise) and the prevention  		of sarcopenia (losses of muscular strength, muscle mass, quality, bone mineral  		density), declines in physical performance (strength, balance, flexibility, and  		mobility), decreases in maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max),  		prevention of diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease, hypertension, colon  		cancer, and diabetes), overall risk of falling, and decreased  		mortality.<sup><font><a href="#ref58">58</a>, <a href="#ref59">59</a>, <a href="#ref60">60</a>, <a href="#ref61">61</a>,  		<a href="#ref62">62</a>, <a href="#ref63">63</a>, <a href="#ref64">64</a>,  		<a href="#ref65">65</a>, <a href="#ref66">66</a>, <a href="#ref67">67</a>,  		<a href="#ref68">68</a>, <a href="#ref69">69</a>, <a href="#ref70">70</a></font></sup> However, the proper quantity and quality of  		exercise necessary to increase physical fitness in the elderly population  		remains unclear.<sup><font><a href="#ref71">71</a>, <a href="#ref72">72</a></font></sup> Findings from the limited research on the  		impact of exercise on disability are, however, inconsistent.<sup><font><a href="#ref73">73</a>, <a href="#ref74">74</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Size of target population.</i></b> Despite the well-known benefits  		of physical activity for older adults in improved well-being and the prevention  		or delay of disease, as many as 70% of people ages 50 years old or older remain  		under-active.<sup><font><a href="#ref75">75</a>, <a href="#ref76">76</a></font></sup> Thirty-three percent of men and 50% of women  		age 75 or older engage in no leisure time physical activity. Rates also vary by  		race, with African Americans less active on average than Whites.<sup><font><a href="#ref77">77</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions. </i></b>Over 140 articles were reviewed.  		Approximately 62 RCTs were reviewed with the rest of the literature comprised  		of observational studies or reviews of the literature. The majority of  		interventions involved aerobic exercise alone or compared against resistance  		training, strength or endurance training, and quadriceps training, though the  		operationalization of these terms varied greatly. Other interventions included:  		walking, cardiac rehabilitation, electrical stimulation of muscles,  		electro-acupuncture, drug interventions, etc. </p>
<p>The description of randomization also varied from explicit to implied,  		making comparisons across studies difficult. Comparison/control groups varied  		widely across the literature; with some groups receiving a portion of the  		intervention, an alternative intervention (e.g., strength vs. endurance  		training), or no intervention, but there was no systematic pattern.  		Almost all of the studies compared baseline performance among groups to post  		outcome measures. Most studies were small and had small samples or short  		follow-up periods (ranging from six weeks to two years). One study on  		prevention and health promotion in the elderly population (that included  		exercise as part of the intervention), followed subjects for eight years, but  		this study was a notable exception. </p>
<p>Outcomes included measures of physical performance (e.g., exercise  		capacity/ tolerance, mobility, muscle strength, endurance, functional capacity,  		ADL/IADL disability, pain, sensory limitations, cardiovascular endurance (e.g.,  		VO<sub>2</sub>max, heart rate, etc.), walking velocity, gait, ambulation,  		weight-bearing ability, range of motion, and days of restricted activity.  		Psycho-social outcomes focused on measures of psychological well-being, quality  		of life, and depression. Many exercise interventions were aimed at individuals  		with specific diseases (e.g., OA or rheumatoid arthritis; Parkinsons  		disease, CHF, COPD, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, post femoral fracture)  		or with specific symptoms (e.g., pain; back pain, limited of movement) and thus  		did not include representative sample populations. </p>
<p><b><i>Efficacy.</i></b> The preponderance of the literature suggests  		that both aerobic and strength/resistance training offer a wide range of  		benefits to older adults.<sup><font><a href="#ref78">78</a>,  		<a href="#ref79">79</a>, <a href="#ref80">80</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a>,  		<a href="#ref82">82</a>, <a href="#ref83">83</a>, <a href="#ref84">84</a>,  		<a href="#ref85">85</a>, <a href="#ref86">86</a>, <a href="#ref87">87</a>,  		<a href="#ref88">88</a>, <a href="#ref89">89</a></font></sup> Hurley and  		Rother<sup><font><a href="#ref58">58</a></font></sup> found strength  		gains of greater than 30% and muscle mass increases of 12% after two months of  		heavy resistance training in 65-75 year olds. Lemura and colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref71">71</a></font></sup> examined studies (n=27) of  		physical training on functional capacity in older adults (ages 46-90) years and  		found a significant difference in functional capacity between studies of  		exercise intensity <u>&gt;</u> to 80% of VO<sub>2</sub>max compared to those  		with training intensities of 60-75% of VO<sub>2</sub>max (p&lt;0.001) and  		exercise duration. (Exercise of <u>&gt;</u>30 minutes duration produced  		significantly greater improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max vs. less than 30  		minutes, p&lt;0.002). Lazowski and Ecclestone<sup><font><a href="#ref90">90</a></font></sup> in a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs of physical  		training on performance in institutionalized adults 70 years of age or older  		found physical training improved muscle strength, mobility, gait speed,  		balance, wheelchair propulsion, ADL function, endurance, and range of motion.  		The meta-review found no RCT showing any negative results from physical  		training; however, ADL improvement in one study reviewed was only for the most  		dysfunctional subjects. Range of motion training did not prevent functional  		decline in institutionalized elderly people.<sup><font><a href="#ref91">91</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The effects of exercise interventions on disability were inconsistent.  		In a review of 41 RCTs, Latham and colleagues found that progressive  		resistance training moderately increased walking speed but had no effect on  		physical disability.<sup><font><a href="#ref73">73</a></font></sup>  		Chin and colleagues in an exercise intervention in 157 independently living  		frail elderly people (mean age: 78.7 years), found performance and fitness were  		significantly enhanced (+8% in exercise vs. -8% in controls; difference in  		change: 1.9 points, p&lt;0.001; +3% vs. -2%; difference in change: 0.9 points,  		p=0.05) but no effects on disability were observed.<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> In contrast, Binder and  		colleagues found moderate short-term improvements on physical function and  		pre-clinical disability in 115 elderly frail men and women (1.0-5.0 points;  		0.9-3.6 mL/kg/min for VO<sub>2</sub> peak; 1.6-4.9 points for FSQ; 95%  		CI).<sup><font><a href="#ref79">79</a></font></sup> Kahana and  		colleagues found that exercise was predictive of fewer IADL limitations and  		greater longevity, positive affect, and meaning over an eight year  		follow-up.<sup><font><a href="#ref92">92</a></font></sup> Keysor and  		Jette,<sup><font><a href="#ref93">93</a></font></sup> in a review of  		the literature on the degree to which exercise enhances physical function  		and/or improves disability in late-life, found small to moderate positive  		effects on physical disability in 35% (five of 14 studies) of the studies  		reviewed (range of effect size: 0.26-0.58) though three of the studies were  		with people with OA and three included samples of elderly people living in  		residential nursing care who had functional limitations or disabilities. One  		study showed a large positive effect of exercise on physical disability only  		for those members of the sample stratified into a high disability group. </p>
<p>Penninx and colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> found that exercise prevented incident ADL  		disability in 250 subjects with knee OA (relative risks=0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.97;  		P=0.04 for resistance and 0.53; 95% CI 0.33-0.85; P=0.009 for aerobic  		exercise). Cumulative ADL incidence was 37% in exercise group versus 53% in  		controls (P=0.02). After adjustment for demographics and baseline physical  		function, the relative risk of incident ADL disability for assignment to  		exercise was 0.57 (95% CI 0.38-0.85; P=0.006). Both exercise programs prevented  		ADL disability; the relative risks were 0.06 (95% CI 0.38-0.97; P=0.04) for  		resistance exercise and 0.53 (95% CI 0.33-0.85; P=0.009) for aerobic exercise.  		The lowest ADL risks were found for participants with the highest adherence to  		the exercise regimen. Though it is unclear whether exercise prevents or  		minimizes physical disability, a number of prospective studies show a  		protective effect from exercise; that is, people who were physically active (at  		least two X/week) were less likely to develop ADL disability.<sup><font><a href="#ref94">94</a>, <a href="#ref95">95</a>, <a href="#ref96">96</a>, <a href="#ref97">97</a>, <a href="#ref98">98</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, a preventive home-based physical therapy program (including  		progressive balance and conditioning exercises) produced modest but consistent  		effects on functional decline among physically frail older persons.<sup><font><a href="#ref99">99</a>, <a href="#ref100">100</a></font></sup>  		However, the authors discuss the difficulty that older frail subjects had in  		advancing to more intense training levels.<sup><font><a href="#ref101">101</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence.</i></b> Adherence in this literature was  		discussed primarily in terms of completion of the trial and, when reported,  		ranged from 60%-90% completion of exercise interventions. However, in one  		long-term study, adherence to exercise regimens after two years was  		substantially lower.<sup><font><a href="#ref102">102</a></font></sup>  		Other research has indicated that an enhancement of motivation and a reduction  		in the burden on subjects are necessary for improving individual adherence to  		an exercise program.<sup><font><a href="#ref103">103</a>,  		<a href="#ref104">104</a>, <a href="#ref105">105</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability.</i></b> Exercise interventions focused mostly on  		healthy patients as well as patients with neck or low back pain, OA and  		rheumatoid arthritis. Some research reviewed focused on patients with  		myocardial infarction, hip fracture/post falls, stroke, Alzheimers  		disease, CHF, COPD, and has included sedentary and functionally impaired  		individuals. Many studies used convenience samples of asymptomatic older  		adults, limiting the generalizability of the results. </p>
<p>Samples ranged from individuals in their 20s to their 90s, with many  		interventions focusing on the elderly population (65+) and the very old (70-90  		years of age). There is little evidence on the impact among ethnic,  		socioeconomic, and chronic disease subgroups. </p>
<p>The RCTs and observational studies were well designed and used  		analytical techniques to account for many biases, such as loss to follow-up and  		adherence with exercise protocol and completion rates. However, many studies,  		including the RCTs, were unable to assess (and therefore control for)  		differences between treatment and control groups in the level of physical  		inactivity at baseline.</p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory. </i></b>Exercise  		interventions focused on primary and secondary prevention and were thus aimed  		at the full range of elderly individuals: the healthy elderly,  		individuals in the early stages of the chronic illness trajectories (e.g., knee  		OA with limited range of movement), older people with a condition and some  		disability (e.g., CAD with two disabilities), and a few interventions were  		targeted to those of very old age (70+) as well as on later stage  		trajectory populations (e.g., late stage cardiac patients, COPD  		patients, Alzheimers patients, or nursing home patients).</p>
<p><b>Implement Good Chronic Disease Care for Congestive Heart  		Failure</b></p>
<p>CHF is a fundamentally progressive and highly lethal, disabling  		condition and is the only major cardiovascular disease with increasing  		incidence and prevalence, especially in the over 65 population. CHF is the  		leading cause of hospitalization and death in adults older than 65.<sup><font><a href="#ref106">106</a>, <a href="#ref107">107</a>,  		<a href="#ref108">108</a></font></sup> More than half of inpatients older than  		65 with CHF are readmitted within 3-6 months of hospital discharge.<sup><font><a href="#ref109">109</a>, <a href="#ref110">110</a></font></sup>  		Despite treatment advances, heart failure has a significant mortality rate,  		causing more than 52,000 deaths annually.<sup><font><a href="#ref106">106</a></font></sup> Data suggest that approximately 20%-25% of  		heart failure patients die within one year after diagnosis, one-third of  		patients die within two years, more than half of patients die within five  		years.<sup><font><a href="#ref111">111</a>, <a href="#ref112">112</a>, <a href="#ref113">113</a>, <a href="#ref114">114</a>,  		<a href="#ref115">115</a></font></sup> Women survive longer than men, but fewer  		than 15% of women survive more than 8-12 years after diagnosis.<sup><font><a href="#ref112">112</a></font></sup> Heart failure has been found  		to have the greatest impact on patient quality of life. Wolinsky and  		colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref114">114</a></font></sup> found  		that having been hospitalized for CHF was consistently associated with greater  		increases in the number of functional limitations (basic ADLs, household ADLs,  		advanced ADLs, lower body limits, and upper body limits). </p>
<p><b><i>Size of target population.</i></b> Improvements in survival after  		myocardial infarction, better management of diabetes and hypertension, and an  		increase in the aging population have contributed to the rise in CHF. More than  		five million Americans currently have a diagnosis of CHF and 550,000 new cases  		are diagnosed each year.<sup><font><a href="#ref106">106</a></font></sup> Approximately 1% of persons aged 50-59 have  		CHF compared with 2%-7% of those aged 70-74 and 10% of persons 75 years or  		older.<sup><font><a href="#ref116">116</a></font></sup> One  		postmortem examination study found prevalence rates as high as 18%-25% in the  		elderly population.<sup><font><a href="#ref117">117</a></font></sup>  		As more patients survive myocardial infarctions, as treatments continue to  		improve for CHF, and as the Baby Boom generation ages, the number of patients  		who have CHF is expected to grow. </p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions.</i></b> Approximately 75 studies,  		discussion papers, and meta-analyses of RCTs and cohort studies were evaluated  		(1985-2004). Most studies were published between 1990 and 2001. Sample sizes  		ranged from less than 20 to 11,942 (this range included a number of large  		meta-analyses), with the usual number of participants around 100-200. Baseline  		clinical characteristics of patients in treatment and control groups were  		usually well matched. Outcomes focused on readmission rates and length of stay  		(hospitalizations or emergency room visits); angiotensin converting enzyme  		inhibitor (ACEI) use at follow-up, all cause mortality, heart failure related  		mortality, costs, provider adherence to evidence-based medical management  		guidelines, patient adherence with treatment and medication regimens, quality  		of life, mortality/survival. Disability was evaluated primarily as a component  		of quality of life and not explicitly assessed in most of the trials  		reviewed.</p>
<p>Three general types of interventions for CHF patients were reported in  		the literature reviewed: drug interventions, exercise interventions, and  		disease management interventions; roughly equivalent to the primary, secondary,  		and tertiary prevention approach of public-health and medicine. Disease  		management programs (secondary prevention) were the largest  		category of intervention studied, but the actual programs varied  		most widely and fall on a continuum from secondary to tertiary prevention  		rather than into discrete categories. It was hard to distinguish many programs  		labeled disease management from those labeled  		multidisciplinary care management. Outcome measures included  		reduction of exacerbations and utilization (ER, hospital), improved quality of  		life, mortality, readmission rates, and symptoms. Follow-up ranged from three  		months to 2-3 years.</p>
<p><b><i>Efficacy.</i></b> Numerous studies have examined the efficacy of  		specific drug therapies in CHF patients<sup><font><a href="#ref118">118</a>, <a href="#ref119">119</a>, <a href="#ref120">120</a></font></sup> while other studies examined the efficacy  		of home inotropic therapy in advanced heart failure.<sup><font><a href="#ref121">121</a></font></sup> Overall, most heart failure medications  		have been shown to alleviate symptoms, improve clinical status, and reduce  		mortality among CHF patients, with a clear dose-response effect. Only very  		elderly or very advanced patients were found to benefit less or experience  		serious complications and side effects from different CHF  		medications.<sup><font><a href="#ref122">122</a>, <a href="#ref123">123</a></font></sup> However, physician adherence to recommended  		medication prescribing guidelines remains poor.</p>
<p>Exercise interventions for rehabilitation of patients with heart disease  		generally found positive results in exercise tolerance, performance, and  		balance without adverse effects and with less fatigue.<sup><font><a href="#ref124">124</a>, <a href="#ref125">125</a>, <a href="#ref126">126</a>,  		<a href="#ref127">127</a></font></sup> However, most of these studies were  		based on samples of young and middle-aged males (45-65 years of age). Exercise  		trials in the very old CHF population are limited and adherence to exercise in  		the elderly population is low. </p>
<p>Disease management interventions differed widely on intensity (e.g.,  		number of program components) and length of intervention (short-term vs.  		long-term). Interventions ranged from single component (e.g., the provision of  		written educational materials or telephone monitoring) to multi-component  		programs (e.g., a registered nurse led cardiac rehabilitation clinics and more  		comprehensive case management interventions marshalling multi-disciplinary  		health and social service management with allied health professionals included  		in the team). A number of reviews<sup><font><a href="#ref109">109</a>, <a href="#ref128">128</a>, <a href="#ref129">129</a>,  		<a href="#ref130">130</a>, <a href="#ref131">131</a></font></sup> as well as  		reports of individual programs have been conducted on differing disease  		management interventions.<sup><font><a href="#ref132">132</a>,  		<a href="#ref133">133</a>, <a href="#ref134">134</a>, <a href="#ref135">135</a>, <a href="#ref136">136</a>, <a href="#ref137">137</a>,  		<a href="#ref138">138</a>, <a href="#ref139">139</a>, <a href="#ref140">140</a>, <a href="#ref141">141</a></font></sup> Overall,  		multi-component interventions achieved greater reductions in utilization and  		improvements in quality of life than single component interventions. </p>
<p>For example, an analysis of the literature by Rich found that an average  		61% reduction in hospitalizations (range: 14%-87% and an average 85% reduction  		in hospital days, range: 22%-92%) and improved quality of life, functional  		capacity, patient satisfaction, enhanced exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity,  		capacity to perform routine daily activities, improved patient adherence with  		diet and medications, patient satisfaction, and lower overall costs of care for  		patients in multi-component interventions.<sup><font><a href="#ref142">142</a></font></sup> Similarly, Ahmed found a 13% lower risk of  		hospitalization (summary RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.96; heterogeneity among  		studies, P=0.003) in multi-component specialized heart failure disease  		management and multi-disciplinary home management (summary RR 0.77; 95% CI  		0.68-0.86; heterogeneity, P&gt;0.50). Single interventions (telephone follow-up  		by a primary care physician) showed no effect. There was no association between  		the interventions and mortality.<sup><font><a href="#ref128">128</a></font></sup> Phillips et al. found a 25% relative  		reduction in the risk of readmission (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.32-1.28;  		X<sup>2/3</sup>=18.43; heterogeneity&lt;0.001, n=4 studies), a trend toward a  		13% relative reduction in all cause mortality (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.73-1.03;  		X<sup>2/13</sup>=17.79, heterogeneity=0.06, n=14 studies), and improved quality  		of life (P=0.01) but no difference in ACEI use at follow-up or length of stay  		for comprehensive post-discharge interventions.<sup><font><a href="#ref109">109</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Overall, comprehensive, multi-component interventions achieved  		significant reductions in utilization, ranging from 50% to 85%, with somewhat  		uniform positive impact on improved quality of care, patient management, and  		improved quality of life, depending upon the comprehensiveness of the  		interventions employed. Reductions in disability and impact on mortality have  		yet to be demonstrated. The impact of these interventions in the most advanced  		stage illness populations also remains to be demonstrated. </p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence.</i></b> CHF readmissions are suggested to  		reflect poor clinical management (a lack of familiarity or adherence to  		established protocols/guidelines), sub-optimal assessment of readiness for  		discharge, a breakdown in communication and information transfer between  		hospital-based and community physicians, inadequate post-discharge care and  		follow-up, or some combination of these processes.<sup><font><a href="#ref143">143</a>, <a href="#ref144">144</a></font></sup> RCTs of  		physician prescribing practices for CHF have shown that younger physicians are  		more likely than older physicians to select agents consistent with guideline  		recommendations and that physicians in general did not follow guidelines when  		initiating treatment in black patients, older patients, and those with mild  		renal failure. A number of interventions to increase physician adherence have  		shown mixed results.<sup><a href="#ref145">145</a></sup></p>
<p>Although adherence to a drug, exercise, and symptom recognition regimens  		have repeatedly shown a positive impact on patient quality of life and  		utilization, patient adherence is poor. Poor patient adherence has been  		attributed to factors such as lack of understanding of the treatment plan; poor  		understanding of the disease, its prognosis and course, and how to manage their  		symptoms at home; lack of motivation or lack of conviction about treatment;  		inability to follow the treatment plan due to memory problems; depression; or  		financial or other constraints.<sup><font><a href="#ref146">146</a>,  		<a href="#ref147">147</a>, <a href="#ref148">148</a>, <a href="#ref149">149</a>, <a href="#ref150">150</a></font></sup> It is unclear  		how much of this non-adherence is due fragmentation in the medical system and  		poor management by physicians and how much is due to individual factors. </p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability</i></b>. The extensive RCT literature on drug,  		exercise, and disease management interventions for CHF patients are  		consistently positive for comprehensive, multi-component interventions. While  		the early research (1990s) focused primarily on heterogeneous samples of 55-65  		year old men with CHF with no co-morbidities (especially the drug intervention  		literature), recent studies have become more representative, incorporating a  		wide range of CHF stage patients (e.g., NYHA Class III and IV), age (50-80  		years old), and diverse ethnic groups. The major current limitation in the  		literature is in relation to the very old (80+) and women, both groups not yet  		systematically included in the trials. </p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory.</i></b> Most  		interventions targeted the mid-stage of the CHF trajectory with secondary and  		tertiary prevention programs aimed at minimizing the impact of the disease and  		managing symptoms (mid to late stage on the trajectory).</p>
<p><b>Implement Depression Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up</b></p>
<p>Depressive disorders in the older population are common, chronic, and  		costly. The World Health Organization identified major depression as the fourth  		leading cause of worldwide disease, causing more disability than either heart  		disease or cerebrovascular disease. The diagnosis of depression is  		significantly associated with an older adults transition into disability  		status as well as the presence of stable functional disability.</p>
<p>Depressive symptoms have been shown to predict both onset of impairments  		in mobility and functioning, and declines in physical health in the older  		population.<sup><font><a href="#ref151">151</a></font></sup>  		Depressive symptoms also have an interactive effect with physical functioning  		in old age, compounding associated disability.<sup><font><a href="#ref152">152</a></font></sup> Despite its high prevalence in primary care  		and its substantial economic impact, depression often goes unrecognized in  		older adults seen in primary care settings and under-treated in older adults  		referred to the mental health system.<sup><font><a href="#ref153">153</a></font></sup> One cause is primary health care providers'  		failure to recognize symptoms,<sup><font><a href="#ref154">154</a></font></sup> which can present or be described  		differently in older patients,<sup><font><a href="#ref155">155</a></font></sup> or be seen as side effects of medical  		illness or part of the aging process.<sup><font><a href="#ref156">156</a></font></sup> However, even when major depression is  		diagnosed, it often remains under-treated or wrongly treated (e.g., with  		benzodiazepines, or not long enough).<sup><font><a href="#ref157">157</a>, <a href="#ref158">158</a>, <a href="#ref159">159</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Several risk factors common in the older population seem particularly  		amenable to community-level screening prevention programs: a prior history of  		depression, complicated bereavement (multiple losses), and the presence of  		vascular disease. There are currently no population-based screening programs to  		identify late-life depression.</p>
<p><b><i>Size of target population.</i></b> Epidemiological studies suggest  		that the prevalence of major depression in the community-based older population  		is between 1% and 3%.<sup><font><a href="#ref160">160</a></font></sup> This has led to speculation that depression  		declines in old age,<sup><font><a href="#ref161">161</a>,  		<a href="#ref162">162</a></font></sup> but this point is arguable.<sup><font><a href="#ref162">162</a></font></sup> Most studies find much greater  		non-response rates among people with health or cognitive problems,<sup><font><a href="#ref157">157</a>, <a href="#ref163">163</a></font></sup>  		which are important risk factors in this population. Major depression occurs in  		up to 25% of older people with co-morbid conditions such as ischemic heart  		disease, stroke, cancer, chronic lung disease, arthritis, and Parkinson's  		disease.<sup><font><a href="#ref164">164</a></font></sup> Major  		depression is also very common in other important subpopulations commonly  		excluded from epidemiological studies, such as nursing home  		residents.<sup><font><a href="#ref165">165</a></font></sup> One study  		(using self-report, not diagnostic interview) found an 8.7% community  		prevalence of DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression.<sup><font><a href="#ref160">160</a></font></sup> Additional disabling  		depressive illnesses include dysthymia and minor depression.  		Studies using age-specific instruments or not using strict DSM or ICD cut-off  		scores find a high rate of disabling depressive symptoms in older people. For  		example, a large community-based study, using the Centre for Epidemiological  		Studies Depression Scale,<sup><font><a href="#ref157">157</a></font></sup> found the prevalence of major depression to  		be 2.02%, but 12.9% had "minor depression," and a further 14.9% had significant  		depressive symptoms indicative of dysthymia. </p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that of the 33  		million Americans currently over the age of 65, approximately six million (18%)  		experience depressive symptoms, which can include persistent sadness,  		sleeplessness and changes in body weight. The NIMH also estimates that only 10%  		of the elderly people with depression ever receive appropriate treatment for  		this illness. In older adults, depression is associated with high levels of  		chronicity and high relapse rates.<sup><font><a href="#ref164">164</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In the older population with vascular disease, the neurovegetative  		symptoms of depression were often attributed to the side effects of their  		illness rather than investigated as evidence of depression.<sup><font><a href="#ref156">156</a></font></sup> For example, post-stroke  		depression is common, with prevalence estimates of 10%-64%.<sup><font><a href="#ref166">166</a></font></sup> One study reported a 23%  		one-year prevalence of post-stroke major depression, and 18% for minor  		depression.<sup><font><a href="#ref167">167</a></font></sup> Vascular  		disease, or even risk of vascular disease in the absence of stroke, is also a  		major risk factor for late-onset depression. Patients with late-onset  		depression were significantly more likely than younger subjects to have two or  		more risk factors for vascular disease.<sup><font><a href="#ref168">168</a></font></sup> The term "vascular depression" was  		proposed, emphasizing the fact that depression is not necessarily a unitary  		syndrome.</p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions.</i></b> We identified 19 RCTs examining  		the effectiveness of screening for depression in older an adults. In eight  		studies, the only intervention was screening for depression in primary care  		settings. Integrated programs included feedback to providers and/or patient  		education, access to case management and/or mental health care, and telephone  		follow-up. The trials reported various outcomes including recognition of  		depression, rates of treatment and clinical improvements among patients with  		depression.</p>
<p>Treatments for major depression include antidepressent medications for  		major depression, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective  		serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), psycho-social and psycho-therapeutic  		interventions, and combinations.</p>
<p><i><b>Efficacy.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Screening</b>. In seven trials, routine depression screening with  		feedback of screening results to providers generally increased recognition of  		depression especially major depression, by a factor of 2-3 compared with usual  		care. Eleven trials measured the effect of screening and feedback on the  		receipt of treatment from one month to two years after the interventions. The  		results of these studies showed mixed results: in four fair to good quality  		trials that used feedback only, there was no significant effect on treatment  		rates, but five of the seven trials that combined feedback with treatment  		advice or other system supports reported large increases in treatment rates  		(e.g., 15% for usual care vs. 70% among those combining feedback and advice) in  		the intervention groups compared with usual care. Outcomes improved  		significantly in several of the studies when the screening and management  		programs were integrated into usual (primary) care. The combined  		screening/treatment groups resulted in a small but significant reduction  		(effect size=-0.041) in depression symptoms. These trials suggest that the  		benefits from screening are unlikely to be realized unless support systems in  		the primary care and mental health settings are functioning well.</p>
<p>Many tools that screen for depression in older adults are available, but  		there was little evidence to recommend one over another. Most have relative  		good sensitivity (80%-90%) but only fair specificity (70%-80%). Most screening  		instruments are easy to use and can be administered in less than five minutes.  		Shorter screening tests, including simply asking questions about depressed mood  		and anhedonia, appear to detect the majority of incident cases of depression in  		older adults and sometimes performed better than the original, more complex  		instrument. </p>
<p><b>Treatment</b>. Antidepressent medications for major depression,  		including TCAs and SSRIs were clearly more effective than placebos in the  		Cochrane studies reviewed. Depressed older adults report a 60-80% response rate  		to pharmacotherapy. Psycho-social and psycho-therapeutic interventions were  		also shown to be as effective as antidepressant medications for major  		depression, but they are also more time intensive and costly. The benefit of  		psycho-therapy on other depressive illnesses was less well-studied. </p>
<p>Two randomized control studies of combined psycho-therapy and medication  		(nortriptylene) involving older people demonstrated a beneficial effect  		compared to placebo and medication clinic visits.<sup><font><a href="#ref164">164</a>, <font><a href="#ref169">169</a></font></font></sup> One study demonstrated a significant  		reduction in recurrence of a major depressive episode from 90% among placebo  		group to 20% among treatment group (relative risk of 0.22). The other study  		demonstrated significantly different remission rates from a major episode  		following bereavement due to the death of a spouse (69% with treatment, 45%  		with placebo, relative risk 1.5). Similarly sized results were found in a  		review of 16 clinical trials, with 932 adult patients randomized to  		pharmacotherapy alone and 910 to combined treatment (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.38,  		2.52) for combined therapy versus medication alone).<sup><font><a href="#ref170">170</a></font></sup> Others have suggested that with adequate  		screening and treatment, the rate of recovery and relapse for many older people  		with depression is estimated to be the same as in younger cohorts.<sup><font><a href="#ref158">158</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Studies focusing on functional outcomes typically had small samples with  		small improvements after treatment or remission, usually in IADLs or in  		cognitive functioning.<sup><font><a href="#ref171">171</a>,  		<a href="#ref172">172</a>, <a href="#ref173">173</a>, <a href="#ref174">174</a></font></sup> Recently, Callahan and colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref172">172</a></font></sup> found moderate improvements in  		physical functioning (change of 1.71 on the 12-item physical component summary  		and -0.15 on an IADL scale) among patients randomized to receive treatment from  		a depression clinical specialist coordinating with the primary care  		physician.</p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence</i></b>. Having depression is a risk for  		non-adherence with medical treatment recommendations.<sup><font><a href="#ref170">170</a>, <a href="#ref175">175</a></font></sup> In trials with  		older patients 18%-22% refused treatment, were non-compliant, or left the study  		for medical reasons.<sup><font><a href="#ref164">164</a>,  		<a href="#ref169">169</a></font></sup> A comprehensive review of studies with  		adult patients in 16 studies suggested combined non-response and dropout rates  		for medication only were on average 46% (ranging from 0%-71%) and for  		medication and therapy were on average 36% (range: 11%-55%).<sup><a href="#ref170">170</a></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability.</i></b> Sample selectivity and non-random sample  		attrition is one common but rarely addressed threat to the generalizability of  		the findings from the RCT literature. The existing literature suggests that  		screening tests perform well in cognitively intact elders but the issue of  		cognitive impairment was not addressed. Rates of depression are also higher  		among older adults that do not participate in screening such as those with  		common co-morbid conditions (e.g., diabetes and arthritis). Moreover, subjects  		in the reviewed RCTs were often homogenous with regards to race and  		ethnicity.</p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory.</i></b> Depression  		screening interventions are targeted early in the disablement process during  		the early pathology stage. Depression in the older adult population has been  		characterized as following a chronic relapsing course, with slow recovery and  		increasingly brief periods between episodes.<sup><font><a href="#ref176">176</a></font></sup> Untreated depression in later life is a  		risk factor for other negative events such as excess physical and social  		disability, exacerbation of co-existing illness, and earlier death. Therefore,  		primary prevention through screening and treatment early in the illness  		trajectory has been identified as a potentially effective intervention  		strategy.</p>
<p><b>Implement Fall Prevention Systems for Frail Elderly People</b></p>
<p>As a leading cause of functional impairment and disability, the subject  		of falls has received growing attention among clinicians and researchers who  		have identified many diverse risk factors for falls. The nature of falling is  		multi-factor that is, there is not a single cause for falls but rather a  		combination of multiple risk factors that put an older adult at risk for  		falling.<sup><font><a href="#ref177">177</a>, <a href="#ref178">178</a>, <a href="#ref179">179</a>, <a href="#ref180">180</a>,  		<a href="#ref181">181</a>, <a href="#ref182">182</a></font></sup> The risk for  		fall related disability is due to the high rate of sustained physical injury  		and fear resulting from a serious fall.</p>
<p><b><i>Size of target population.</i></b> The target population for a  		fall prevention intervention focuses on those individuals that without  		intervention would go on to fall and receive an injury in a given year. It is  		estimated that one-third of adults ages 65 years and older fall each  		year.<sup><font><a href="#ref183">183</a>, <a href="#ref184">184</a>,  		<a href="#ref185">185</a></font></sup> For older adults residing in long-term  		care settings the risk of falling approaches 50%.<sup><font><a href="#ref186">186</a>, <a href="#ref187">187</a></font></sup> Of those who  		fall, 20%-30% suffer severe injuries such as hip fractures or head traumas that  		increase disability and the risk of premature death.<sup><font><a href="#ref188">188</a>, <a href="#ref189">189</a></font></sup> Another 3%-5% of  		older adult falls cause fractures of the vertebrae, forearm, leg, ankle,  		pelvis, upper arm, and hand.<sup><font><a href="#ref190">190</a>,  		<a href="#ref191">191</a>, <a href="#ref192">192</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Of all adverse fall-related outcomes, hip fractures cause the greatest  		number of deaths and leads to the most resulting disability.<sup><font><a href="#ref193">193</a>, <a href="#ref194">194</a></font></sup>  		Most patients with hip fractures are hospitalized for about one week<sup><font><a href="#ref195">195</a></font></sup> and 25% of community-dwelling  		older adults who sustain hip fractures remain institutionalized for at least a  		year.<sup><font><a href="#ref196">196</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions.</i></b> Approximately 82 studies (76 RCTs  		and six quasi or non-RCT) were reviewed. Seven papers were excluded because  		they were descriptions of earlier studies published by the same research group  		and added no new information. Most studies were published between 2000 and  		2003. About 70% were carried out in the United States. Most studies contained  		between 100 and 200 participants and were conducted over 3-12 months. The  		primary outcome measures were: (1) fall rate, (2) injury rate from fall, and  		(3) performance on balance tests. The qualifying literature fell into two  		themes: (1) single interventions versus no intervention, and (2)  		multi-component interventions versus no intervention.</p>
<p><b>Single intervention versus no intervention</b>. Each of the 56 single  		comparison studies used a comparison group for which no intervention took  		place. The most common single intervention tested was exercise (23 studies).  		Studies focusing on single interventions provided conflicting evidence on the  		reduction of fall rates or improvement in function.<sup><font><a href="#ref91">91</a>, <a href="#ref190">190</a>, <a href="#ref191">191</a>, <a href="#ref192">192</a>, <a href="#ref197">197</a></font></sup> Indeed, the American Geriatrics Society  		Fall Prevention Panel observed that while a single intervention focused on one  		risk factor could be the most cost effective way to reduce falls, there is  		little evidence in the literature to support this practice.</p>
<p><b>Multi-component intervention versus no interventions</b>. The  		strongest results were found in the 26 studies that included a broad range of  		multi-component interventions. Multi-factor interventions that  		involve a comprehensive fall assessment and an individualized management  		program seem to be the most promising approach. Absolute changes after these  		interventions in the reduction of fall risk varied between 0.29 and  		0.36.<sup><font><a href="#ref198">198</a></font></sup> Unfortunately,  		the literature to date provides no definitive guidance on the specific  		components of multi-factor interventions or on whether the benefits of such  		interventions justify costs of an intervention. Effective interventions in the  		reviewed studies often combined different measures of health and environment  		and diverse intervention strategies, and most were not designed in a way to  		determine which components of a multi-factor intervention would be most  		effective.<sup><font><a href="#ref199">199</a>, <a href="#ref200">200</a>, <a href="#ref201">201</a>, <a href="#ref202">202</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Efficacy</i></b>. The effect of a multi-factor interventions on  		fall rates was based on the relative risk reductions or odds ratios reported in  		the reviewed studies for evidence of effectiveness. We only used those effect  		size findings reported in systematic reviews<sup><font><a href="#ref193">193</a>, <a href="#ref203">203</a>, <a href="#ref204">204</a>,  		<a href="#ref205">205</a>, <a href="#ref206">206</a>, <a href="#ref207">207</a></font></sup> and did not perform additional analysis  		(e.g., meta-analysis). The effectiveness of the interventions in these reviews  		varied widely, with the average efficacy of the intervention on preventing  		falls in the range of 20%-30% (Peto OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.64-0.91). Few studies  		reported systematic long-term follow-up. The longest duration of follow-up was  		conducted by Tinetti and colleagues.<sup><font><a href="#ref199">199</a></font></sup> The investigators reported that  		interventions to reduce five specific risk factors resulted in a 30% reduction  		in fall risk over one year in a prospective community cohort. The targeted risk  		factors were postural hypotension, use of any benzodiazepine or  		sedative-hypnotic medication, use four or more medications, presence of  		environmental hazards, muscular strength or range of motion impairments. </p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence</i></b>. No estimates of adherence with  		protocol were reported.</p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability</i></b> Because many of the reviewed studies used  		small sample sizes and inadequately described the precise number and  		standardization of interventions, their generalizability and reproducibility is  		limited. </p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory.</i></b> Fall  		prevention interventions are targeted early in the impairment pathway, when an  		older adult is identified as a fall risk. Fall prevention interventions are not  		typically aimed at particular diseases but rather are targeted to individuals  		with a predisposition to frailty or in the early stages of frailty. </p>
<p><b>Modify Homes and Provide Assistive Devices </b></p>
<p>Home modifications and the use of assistive technologies such as ramps,  		shower seats, wheelchairs, walkers, and the like, offer one way for older  		adults to cope with age-related limitations in activity. Recent increases in  		the use of assistive devices in the older population with disabilities have  		been noted.<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref208">208</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Size of target population.</i></b> According to NCHS, 38% of  		community residing adults over age 65 have some limitation in functioning  		caused by chronic conditions. The functional problem most commonly reported is  		difficulty climbing up and down stairs (35%). The other most frequently  		reported problems include difficulty walking, getting outside, and bathing.</p>
<p>National estimates from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest  		Old study suggest that 40% of the older population have modified their homes by  		installing items such as grab bars and shower seats, railings, ramps,  		modification for wheelchairs, and call devices. The proportion of households  		that reported some home modification was 34% among those age 70-79,  		47% among those 80-89, and 60% among those over age 90.<sup><font><a href="#ref209">209</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions.</i></b> We identified 17 studies that met  		the inclusion criteria for this review and included seven RCTs, ten descriptive  		studies. Most studies were published between 1999 and 2002 and were carried out  		in the United States. The sample size averaged 40 subjects (range 9-249). The  		primary outcome measures were assistive technology adherence and functional  		performance over time. </p>
<p>The most commonly tested assistive device in the RCTs was wheelchair  		seat cushions. Seat cushions can significantly affect sitting balance during  		reaching tasks as well as prevent sitting acquired pressure ulcers.<sup><font><a href="#ref210">210</a>, <a href="#ref211">211</a>,  		<a href="#ref212">212</a></font></sup> The most common types of home  		modifications were related to bathing, for example, grab bars and seats in the  		tub or shower area. These home modifications account for 27% of homes among  		those age 70 and over. The second most common home modification was wheelchair  		access. Approximately 12% of older adults have homes modified for indoor  		wheelchair use. Call buttons and railings are the third most common  		modification, accounting for 10% of home modifications among the older  		population.</p>
<p><b><i>Intervention efficacy.</i></b> Data from the RCTs were not  		sufficiently similar to allow for the combination of data by statistical  		analyses.<sup><font><a href="#ref213">213</a></font></sup> However  		analysis of national survey data using household production function model  		estimated that the use of home modification in bathing, such as the  		installation of grab bars and shower seats significantly increased bathing  		functioning. The size of the effect was estimated to be equal the functionality  		that is lost when an 80 year old loses when they age into their 90s.<sup><font><a href="#ref214">214</a></font></sup> Assistive device was estimated  		to add twice as much bathing functionality when compared to home modification,  		such that an 80 year old could gain more functionality through assistive  		devices than is lost through sever stroke.<sup><font><a href="#ref214">214</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Only one RTC of high methodological quality noted significant  		differences in disability rates resulting from assistive device use and home  		modification. In this study, the control group demonstrated a 2.7%-13% greater  		decline in functioning than the treatment group receiving assistive devices and  		home modifications. These results translated into the control group requiring  		2-4 minutes of additional assistance with ADLs than the treatment  		group.<sup><font><a href="#ref215">215</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence.</i></b> One important issue addressed in the  		literature was how and whether or not assistive technology was used when it was  		prescribed. Functional improvements (at follow-up) corresponded with device  		nonuse. Because of the high rate of non-adherence with assistive technology use  		(29.3%-45%),<sup><font><a href="#ref216">216</a></font></sup> the  		primary emphasis among the descriptive studies was on factors associated with  		use and substitution for personal care. Although third party payers cover  		relatively few assistive devices and home modification interventions, there was  		little evidence to suggest the financial resources increased the rate of  		adherence. The most frequent reason given for nonuse was that the device was no  		longer needed. Moreover, older adults in these studies often reported not  		liking to use devices or not knowing how to use them properly. Attitudes  		towards social acceptability typically affected the rate of adherence.</p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability.</i></b> Small samples sizes (&lt;50) in a  		majority of these studies limits the generalizability of the findings. Samples  		were also not representative of the general older population.</p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory.</i></b> The chronic  		health conditions commonly associated with the frailty trajectory such as  		stroke, arthritis, and dementia all reduce functional abilities such as  		ambulating and bathing, with severe stroke having the strongest  		impact.<sup><font><a href="#ref214">214</a></font></sup> Thus,  		interventions that include assistive device use and home modifications are  		typically aimed at the later stages of the frailty trajectory, after the onset  		of functional limitation. Individuals with advanced cancer and lung disease  		also have high rates of functional disability. Therefore, these interventions  		may be viewed as appropriate for individuals at the later stages of the cancer  		and organ failure trajectories</p>
<p><b>Implement Widespread Care Planning for Seriously Ill </b></p>
<p>Advance care planning (ACP) is a holistic, palliative approach to  		decision-making, involving a process of thinking ahead to treatment  		choices.<sup><font><a href="#ref217">217</a></font></sup> In  		addition, ACP encompasses implementing specific steps to make it easier to  		comply with the preferences of the patient and family. Sometimes legal  		documents called advanced directives (ADs), are included that state specific  		instructions for care (e.g., circumstances in which life sustaining treatment  		is to be provided or forgone) or that name a proxy/surrogate decision-maker  		(e.g., durable power of attorney). </p>
<p><b><i>Size of the target population. </i></b>Approximately two million  		individuals die in the United States each year, 80%-85% of which are 65 years  		or older and covered by Medicare (representing 4.7% of Medicare  		beneficiaries).<sup><font><a href="#ref218">218</a></font></sup> NCHS  		vital statistics data show that heart disease and cancer are the leading causes  		of death in the elderly population, accounting for more than half of deaths in  		1997. A random sample of all deaths in the United States revealed that about 9%  		of decedents had issued an AD at the time of their death.<sup><font><a href="#ref219">219</a></font></sup> Estimates on current AD  		completion rates nationally hover around 15%-20%.<sup><font><a href="#ref220">220</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Nature of interventions.</i></b> Fifty articles from the  		literature (1992-2004) on ADs and advanced care planning were reviewed. Eleven  		articles were discarded as not applicable or with insufficient information. The  		39 remaining studies included 22 RCTs, 13 observational studies, and four  		literature reviews. </p>
<p>Most interventions involved education activities (either single or  		combined) designed to increase awareness of specific components of ADs (e.g.,  		durable power of attorney/health care proxy, DNR, CPR, acceptance or rejection  		of ventilation), completion rates, and documentation in the patients  		medical record. Single interventions included educational materials, AD  		discussion guides for providers, and providing a uniform place for the AD in  		the medical record.<sup><font><a href="#ref221">221</a></font></sup>  		Multi-component interventions combined a variety of single approaches together.  		Follow-up was usually short, from weeks to months, with few studies conducting  		follow-up beyond a year. Specific information on comparison groups and details  		on complex interventions were often missing from the abstracts. Samples, other  		than in the SUPPORT study, were small and non-representative (e.g., ambulatory  		care clinic patients, nursing home patients, CHF/COPD patients).</p>
<p><b><i>Efficacy.</i></b> Results from the intervention studies were  		mixed. Most studies that used a single educational intervention  		component had little or no impact on AD completion rates or subsequent medical  		care.<sup><font><a href="#ref222">222</a></font></sup> Interventions  		that used a combined method were able to achieve a moderate increases in AD  		completion rates, ranging between an increase of 10%-20%. One study identified  		a completion rate of 33% in an HMO, but only 15% of patients who had an AD had  		discussed it with their physician.<sup><font><a href="#ref223">223</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A review of the literature by the Agency for Healthcare Research and  		Quality found that ADs were not effective in influencing end of life care not  		only because of low rates of completion but because the language in ADs was  		usually too non-specific and general to provide clear instruction.<sup><font><a href="#ref224">224</a></font></sup> An exception in the literature  		was a retrospective analysis of 540 decedents, which found that a  		comprehensive, community-wide AD intervention had positively affected the  		prevalence of documented ADs, showing an increased completion rate from 15% in  		1991 to 85% in 1998.<sup><font><a href="#ref217">217</a>,  		<a href="#ref221">221</a>, <a href="#ref225">225</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Extent of adherence.</i></b> Adherence in this literature was  		discussed primarily in terms of completion rates of an AD. Overall,  		interventions produced small to moderate effects on completion rates (10%-20%).  		</p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability</i></b>. Most of the studies conducted on  		improving completion of an AD are not RCTs but rather observational or  		descriptive studies, using small, non-representative samples (e.g., ambulatory  		care clinic patients) and comparing outcomes only on completion rates and  		documentation. Generalizability is thus limited due to sample selectivity and  		homogeneity with samples, small sample size, and low rates of adherence.</p>
<p><b><i>Stage in the disablement process/trajectory.</i></b> Interventions  		to implement advanced care planning have primarily focused on the ill elderly  		population (65 or older) and those in the very late stages of serious, life  		threatening illness.</p>
<h2><a name="compare" id="compare">IV. COMPARISONS BASED ON CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND  		LITERATURE REVIEW</a></h2>
<p>With the framework we have outlined and the literature we have reviewed,  		we can begin to compare alternative interventions. We first focus on the  		short-run (one-year time frame), quantifying comparisons where possible. We  		then discuss longer-run comparative effects. Recognizing that longer-run  		effects could not be easily quantified based on the literature, we instead  		demonstrate some basic principles about the likely effects of types of  		interventions using a simple simulation model. Comparisons are summarized in  		<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>.</p>
<h3>A. Comparison of Short-Term Effects</h3>
<p>Three key pieces of information are needed to compare short-term effects  		of interventions: (1) the size of the population with the targeted risk factor;  		(2) the short-term risk of disability associated with the presence of the  		targeted risk factor; and (3) the effectiveness of the specific intervention in  		remedying/reducing the risk factor. The latter is a combination of the  		interventions efficacy, adherence rates, and important differences  		between study populations and a population-based target population.</p>
<p><b>Size of Target Population with Risk Factor</b></p>
<p>The seven interventions we reviewed vary widely in terms of the size of  		the target population. Those interventions aimed at the largest populations,  		all else equal, will have the greatest effect on disability rates. Three  		interventions may be aimed at a large target population: exercise, fall  		prevention, and depression screening and treatment; three other  		interventions--smoking cessation, management of CHF, and advanced care  		planning--target a substantially smaller population. Depending on how the  		target population is defined, assistive technology/home modifications fall  		somewhere in between.</p>
<p>The three interventions that stand out as potentially reaching a large  		target population--exercise, fall prevention, and depression screening and  		treatment--could reach between 10 and 18 million people. Of the 35 million  		people ages 65 and older, 51%, or about 18 million people, report having no  		physical activity according to Healthy People 2010.<sup><font><a href="#ref226">226</a></font></sup> About a third of people age 65  		or older, or nearly 12 million people, fall annually. It has been estimated  		that nearly 30% of Americans age 65 or older, more than 10 million persons,  		have some depressive symptoms, with 2% (707,000) having major depression, about  		13% (4.5 million) having minor depression, and the remaining 15% (5.2 million)  		with significant depressive symptoms. </p>
<p>It is less straightforward to identify the target population for  		assistive technology and home modifications. Perhaps the population with  		functional limitations is the most relevant target population for an  		intervention increasing knowledge of and extent of assistive technology and  		home modifications because they have the ability to reduce or delay onset of  		dependence. National estimates indicate that 13-17 million<sup><a href="#notec">c</a></sup> community residing adults age 65 or older have some  		limitation in functioning, most commonly walking, followed by bathing and  		outdoor mobility. About 14% (roughly five million) of community-dwelling  		elderly population age 65 or older in the National Long-Term Care Survey  		identified additional home modifications that would make things easier or more  		comfortable.<sup><a href="#noted">d</a></sup> Similarly, Newman found in 1995  		that 14% of elderly individuals (roughly five million) had a  		housing-related disability, defined as difficulty, use of  		assistance, or need of assistance in functioning in the home, that might be  		amenable to home modifications.<sup><font><a href="#ref227">227</a></font></sup> Another study<sup><font><a href="#ref228">228</a></font></sup> suggests that among older people reporting  		difficulty with mobility (roughly 25% of the older population or nine million  		people), one-third use only equipment, one-third use no equipment or help, and  		the remaining third receive some sort of help with mobility tasks.</p>
<p>Three interventions--smoking cessation, management of CHF, and advanced  		care planning among the severely ill--were clearly designed to reach narrower  		populations. About 9.3% of those age 65 or older, or 3.3 million persons, were  		current smokers in 2002. CHF, the leading diagnosis in hospitalizations of  		older persons, affects a total of about 3 million older Americans (550,000 new  		cases per year), about 5% of the population age 65-69 and 10% of the population  		age 70 or older.<sup><font><a href="#ref229">229</a></font></sup>  		Advanced care planning could potentially affect about 1.6 million older persons  		who die each year and a larger percentage for which we have no good estimate  		who are in advanced stages of disease; less than half of severely or terminally  		ill patients currently have an AD and many are not specific enough to influence  		treatment decisions at the end of life.<sup><font><a href="#ref230">230</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Short-Term Risk of Disability Associated with Risk Factor</b></p>
<p>A second important factor in sorting out short-term effects of  		interventions is the relationship between the risk factor and the risk of  		disability. To quantify these comparisons properly requires us to be able to  		identify from the literature the prevalence, incidence rate, and recovery rate  		the population stratified by each risk factor and combination of risk factors.  		Although some of this information is available from epidemiologic and  		observational studies (for a review see,<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a></font></sup> the measures of disability, composition of  		study populations, and follow-up periods vary markedly across studies, making  		comparisons difficult. </p>
<p>Instead, we group interventions by the stage of the disablement process  		to which they are most relevant (i.e., those related to disease onset (primary  		prevention efforts), to disease management and functioning (secondary  		prevention), to the environmental components of disability (tertiary  		prevention), and to the very end of life). The risks of developing disability  		increase with each stage of the disablement process; moreover, the risks of  		disability recovery apply only to the group who has already experienced  		disability. Secondary and tertiary prevention measures, all else equal, are  		likely to have a greater impact on disability rates in the short-run than  		primary prevention efforts.<sup><a href="#notee">e</a></sup></p>
<p>Consider, for example, the relative risks for disability associated with  		risk factors related to primary disease prevention--inactivity and smoking.  		Disability incidence rates among seniors with no limitations at baseline, for  		example, have been estimated after a two-year follow-up period to be  		approximately 10% among non-walkers and 5% among walkers (who walk at least one  		mile one day/week)--a relative risk of 2.0 associated with  		inactivity.<sup><font><a href="#ref94">94</a></font></sup> Similar  		relative risks are evident for those with moderate and severe functioning  		limitations at baseline. The short-term risks of disability incidence  		associated with smoking are also relatively moderate (although the cumulative  		lifetime risks are higher). Among the elderly population, the functioning  		scores are consistently lowest among recent quitters and current smokers than  		among never smokers.<sup><font><a href="#ref231">231</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Much higher rates of disability incidence are associated with CHF,  		depression, and falling. For example, people with CHF have eight times the risk  		of severe mobility difficulty as other older people. Estimates from one study  		of older persons hospitalized with CHF found that a third were receiving formal  		assistance a year after hospital discharge. Population-based observational  		studies suggest that depressive symptoms increase the relative risk for  		incident ADL disability by 4-5 times among high functioning older  		adults<sup><font><a href="#ref232">232</a></font></sup> and  		1½-2 times in the general older population.<sup><font><a href="#ref233">233</a>, <a href="#ref234">234</a></font></sup> About 20%-30% of  		those who fall each year--roughly three times the average rate of disability  		incidence--suffer severe injuries such as hip fracture or head trauma that may  		lead to death, disability, and/or institutionalization. </p>
<p>Assistive technology and home modification may play a preventive role or  		may be used to facilitate recovery among those with disability. There are very  		few estimates as to the number of older people who could alleviate their  		disability through home modifications or the use of assistive technology, or  		the relative risk of disability in the absence of such devices. </p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of individuals who die in a given year  		experience disability at the very end of life. Based on estimates provided by  		Leveille and colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a></font></sup> we calculate that of the 2.2 million deaths  		to older America each year, 1.6 million have a disability at the beginning of  		the year and 600,000 do not. Based on work by Lunney and colleagues,<sup><font><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup> 84%-93% of  		deaths involve some amount of disability during the last year of life. </p>
<p><b>Effectiveness of Interventions </b></p>
<p>A number of challenges complicate the comparisons of effectiveness of  		interventions. Because most of the interventions studied here require  		behavioral changes, <i>adherence</i> is a major challenge. Rates of adherence  		with protocols and drop-out rates were not systematically reported and are  		difficult to compare across interventions. Studies commonly target <i>select  		populations</i>, making it difficult to determine (and compare) likely  		population-based effects. In addition, the <i>outcomes</i> examined in the  		studies we reviewed--particularly those targeted at disease prevention or  		functioning--rarely included include direct effects on disability. Instead,  		they provide evidence regarding the effectiveness in altering the risk factor  		(e.g., smoking, inactivity) or related physiologic (strength, aerobic capacity,  		functioning) or service use (hospitalizations, depression treatment) measures.  		Where disability measures are included, they vary widely across studies.  		Notwithstanding these complications, here we attempt to compare the strength of  		the evidence regarding the effect of each intervention(s) first on the risk  		factors of interest and then on the risks of disability. </p>
<p><b><i>Effects on risk factors of interest.</i></b> Of the seven  		interventions reviewed, four stand out as likely to have modest effects on risk  		factors of interest: smoking cessation programs that combine counseling with  		pharmacologic treatment; exercise programs that increase strength, balance, and  		physical activity of older adults; depression screening, combined with referral  		and feedback, and combination therapy/pharmacologic treatment; and multi-factor  		fall prevention programs. Of the remaining three interventions we reviewed, the  		beneficial effects of assistive technology/home modifications have not been  		adequately tested with the older population; interventions for CHF management  		have shown a wide range of effects on hospitalizations and hospital days; and  		as currently practiced completion of ADs appear to have little or no effect on  		treatment decisions at the end of life.</p>
<p><b><i>Effects on risks of disability</i></b>. Of the four interventions  		that might have a modest effect on risk factors, only three have been linked to  		reductions in risks of disability: exercise, depression screening and  		treatment, and fall prevention programs. The effects of a population-based  		exercise intervention on disability risks are likely to be modest, in part  		because of low adherence rates,<sup><font><a href="#ref102">102</a></font></sup> and the difficulty older frail individuals  		have in progressing to more intense levels of activity.<sup><font><a href="#ref101">101</a></font></sup> With respect to depression screening and  		treatment, although screening programs with feedback and referral increase  		treatment rates by over four-fold, and combined medication and therapy result  		in relative risks of remission of 1.5-1.8, studies focusing on functioning as  		an outcome typically found only small improvements in functioning after  		treatment, usually IADL and/or cognitive functioning. Hence, we conclude that  		depression and screening programs would have a small to modest effect on  		disability risks. Only one of the seven interventions reviewed has the  		potential to produce large effects on the risks of disability: multi-factor  		fall prevention strategies. Comprehensive interventions combining factors such  		as education about risks, exercise, home safety and health assessments,  		appeared to show a modest benefit in preventing falls for older populations,  		reducing the risk of falling in some cases by 30%-50% (RR 0.5-0.7), but the  		relationship between falling and disability is strong (RR 4.0-6.0).  		Consequently, programs that successfully reduce the risk of falling could  		potentially have a large effect on the risks of disability.</p>
<h3>B. Comparison of Long-Term Effects</h3>
<p>For longer-run comparisons, several additional issues emerge. How will  		the size and composition of the target population change in the future? At  		which trajectory is the intervention targeted and what are the competing risks?  		What are the effects of the intervention over the remaining lifetime? How will  		intervention affect mortality as well as disability? We discuss each of these  		issues in more detail below. </p>
<p><b>Shifting Target Populations</b></p>
<p>Several demographic trends are underway that will continue into the next  		20 years. Most obviously, the United States population is aging; by 2020, 14.1%  		will be age 65 and older (compared to 10.9% in 2000); and 2.2% will be 85 and  		older (compared to 1.5% in 2000).<sup><font><a href="#ref235">235</a></font></sup> The composition of the older population is  		also shifting--over the next two decades the older population will continue to  		experience increases in educational attainment<sup><font><a href="#ref18">18</a></font></sup> and become more racially and ethnically  		diverse.<sup><font><a href="#ref235">235</a></font></sup> Several  		health-related trends have also been apparent that show no signs of abating:  		obesity<sup><font><a href="#ref13">13</a></font></sup> and reports of  		related cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes<sup><font><a href="#ref236">236</a></font></sup> have been steadily increasing. Together,  		these changes are likely to influence the effectiveness of interventions in the  		future--although the net effects are unclear. On the one hand, individuals with  		more years of education are more likely to comply with protocols and invest in  		their future health and well-being. On the other hand the increasing diversity  		and co-morbidities of the older population will continue to challenge  		population-wide implementations of interventions.</p>
<p>For several of the interventions investigated here, we found evidence of  		ongoing trends. For instance, four of the seven risk factors of  		interest--inactivity, smoking, depression treatment, and assistive  		technology/home modification--appear to be moving already in a direction  		consistent with disability decline. There is also some evidence that injuries  		due to non-fatal falls have decreased and that ACP is increasing slowly. In  		contrast, CHF appears to be increasing. Limited information is available on  		trends in the joint distribution of these risk factors. More details on trends  		follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Inactivity</b> among adults, particularly seniors, is reportedly  			 declining.<sup><font><a href="#ref237">237</a></font></sup> Based on  			 data from the Center for Disease Controls Healthy People 2010, the  			 percentage of adults ages 65-74 who were inactive (no leisure time physical  			 activity in the past month) declined from 51% in 1997 to 47% in 2002; among  			 those ages 75 and older, the percentage of inactive adults declined from 64% in  			 1997 to 61% in 2002. (The target for 2010 is 20%.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Smoking</b> in the non-institutionalized population age 65 or  			 older has declined by about 2.5% per year for women and about 4.3% per year for  			 men between 1985 and 2000.<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Depression</b>. In the general population, the rate of outpatient  			 treatment for depression increased from 0.73 per 100 persons in 1987 to 2.33 in  			 1997 (P&lt;0.001).<sup><font><a href="#ref238">238</a></font></sup>  			 Among the older population, between 1985 and 1993-1994, a significant increase  			 in the rate of depression diagnosis was seen, but no change was observed  			 between 1993-1994 and 1998-1999. Rates of prescribing of antidepressants more  			 than doubled between 1985 and 1998-1999.<sup><font><a href="#ref239">239</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of <b>assistive technology</b> only (without personal care) to  			 carry out personal care activities doubled among older Americans (from 1.6% in  			 1984 to 3.0% in 1999 among all older Americans and from 7% to 15% among those  			 with chronic disability.<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a></font></sup>  			 The presence of <b>home modifications</b> among older people reporting a  			 housing-related disability nearly doubled from 26% in 1978 to 49% in  			 1995.<sup><font><a href="#ref240">240</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the CDCs injury surveillance system, age-adjusted  			 non-fatal injuries among the 65 and older population due to <b>falls</b> have  			 declined over the last three years from 4.67 to 4.53 per 100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  			 indicate that the prevalence of <b>CHF</b> more than doubled for persons age 65  			 and age 75 between 1976-1980 and 1988-1991.<sup><font><a href="#ref229">229</a></font></sup> More recent studies have found a continuing  			 increase in CHF prevalence in the general population between 1989 and  			 1999,<sup><font><a href="#ref241">241</a></font></sup> with no  			 increase in incidence but a decline in mortality.<sup><font><a href="#ref242">242</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since no study documents the prevalence of <b>ACP</b> or ADs,  			 documenting trends is somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, more reports are  			 surfacing about care systems with high rates,<sup><font><a href="#ref225">225</a>, <a href="#ref243">243</a>, <a href="#ref244">244</a>,  			 <a href="#ref245">245</a>, <a href="#ref246">246</a></font></sup> whereas  			 essentially no one had advance care plans 25 years ago. In many reports, the  			 baseline rates among seriously ill persons tend to run 15%-30%. In special  			 programs with a focus upon planning ahead, the rates can be around 90%. A  			 recent report from Oregon showed that nursing home residents there are now  			 running about 70%.<sup><font><a href="#ref247">247</a></font></sup>  			 In short, there is evidence that ACP is increasing slowly, but definitive  			 population-based rates are not available.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Competing Risks</b></p>
<p>Each of the illustrative interventions we reviewed may be considered to  		be targeted at one or more illness trajectories. Exercise and fall prevention,  		for example, are primarily targeted to older adults in the frailty/dementia  		trajectory. CHF management is clearly targeted a specific type of organ  		failure. Smoking cessation is likely to be geared toward people who go on to  		develop cancer or organ failure (e.g., COPD, CHF or other cardiovascular  		disease). Depression screening and treatment, assistive technology and  		environmental modifications, and advanced care planning are not unique to any  		one trajectory but may be targeted at all three.</p>
<p>The issue of competing risks arises mainly for interventions targeted at  		the prevention of diseases with earlier ages of onset. That is, interventions  		designed to prevent cancer or organ failure, if successful, could allow people  		to survive longer and be at risk for the frailty/dementia trajectory. Of the  		seven illustrative interventions reviewer here, smoking cessation is the only  		intervention for which competing risks is an issue to be taken into  		consideration. The question is, if a very effective smoking cessation  		intervention reduces deaths from cancer or organ failure, will a larger  		proportion of the older population survive to follow a longer course of  		disability associated with frailty and/or dementia? (We explore this point  		further in the simulation in <a href="#IV.C">Section C</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Mortality</b></p>
<p>In the longer-run comparisons it is important to understand the  		interventions effect not only on disability but also upon the length of  		life, and whether (or what proportion of) additional years are free from  		disability. In order for an intervention to result in a decline in disability,  		any increase in life expectancy must contribute proportionally more to active  		life expectancy than to years with disability. For example, a 1% increase in  		life expectancy will be accompanied by a decline in disability only if it  		results in a greater percentage increase in active life expectancy (and  		symmetrically, a smaller percentage increase in disability). </p>
<p>Intervention studies rarely quantify effects beyond a year or two after  		the intervention. Still, we speculate based on findings from the literature  		that, except for smoking cessation, the interventions reviewed here are  		unlikely to have large effects on mortality. Still, exercise, screening and  		treatment for depression, fall prevention, and the use of home modifications  		and assistive devices may possibly confer increases in longevity. To  		investigate this issue further, we turned to cohort studies and/or life table  		analyses. </p>
<h3><a name="IV.C" id="IV.C">C. Illustration of Long-Term Effects of  		Interventions</a></h3>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> illustrates the effects of several  		stylized interventions using the simplified model described in  		<a href="#concept">Chapter II</a>. Recall that the baseline prevalence of  		disability in a population with assumptions in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> is  		20.1%. We demonstrate the comparative impacts on cross-sectional disability of  		interventions affecting disease prevention (through shifts in trajectories),  		disease management (with and without mortality effects), and disability.<sup><a href="#notef">f</a></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Disease prevention/trajectory shift</i></b>. In order to  		illustrate the impact of shifts between trajectories that might occur with  		disease prevention programs, we assume that the three main trajectories  		(Cancer, Organ Failure, and Dementia/Frailty) are sequentially dependent. This  		implies that persons in whom cancer is prevented by an intervention will  		experience the same relative risks of the organ failure (20.5%) as others who  		do not get cancer. However, because it is typically experienced later in life,  		reducing organ failure has no effect on the probability of the cancer  		trajectory. 74.2% of persons who survive both the cancer and organ failure  		trajectories will experience the frailty trajectory.<sup><a href="#noteg">g</a></sup> By definition, the other trajectory  		captures any remaining members of the cohort after accounting for the other  		risks. </p>
<p>If an intervention were able to reduce cancers by half to 11% of the  		cohort, this model would predict an increase in organ failure to 18.3%, an  		increase in frailty/dementia to 52.5% and an increase in others to  		18.3%. For even this extremely large impact on cancer deaths, the resulting  		change in disability prevalence would be an almost imperceptible decrease to  		20.0% because the percentage change in years with disability would be only  		slightly smaller than the percentage gain in total life expectancy.</p>
<p>An intervention that reduced organ failures by half would have no effect  		on cancers, but would increase frailty/dementia to 51.9% and others  		to 18.1%. The disability rate would be unchanged, with countervailing effects  		of reduced mortality and increased number of years lived with disability. </p>
<p>If we simulate reductions in both the cancer and organ failure  		trajectories, for example due to a smoking intervention that shifts the risks  		of disease onset, we estimate no additional decrease in disability prevalence.  		It can be argued that smoking prevention and cessation interventions could have  		the effect of shifting individuals between trajectories. As discussed above, an  		intervention targeted at the elderly population for the purpose of preventing  		chronic disease would likely have a much smaller effect on disease prevalence  		than those simulated, but the simulations here demonstrate that  		population-level disability prevalence is essentially <i>unaffected</i> (20.0%)  		by any such intervention.</p>
<p><b><i>Disease management</i></b>. Interventions may also have the effect  		of reducing disability alone or in combination with changes in longevity. If  		the intervention does not alter the risk of morality, or if changes in DFLE  		exceed changes in disabled life expectancy, then we can expect the  		cross-sectional prevalence rate to decline.</p>
<p>For example, the exercise interventions discussed in the literature  		appear to be targeted at the frailty trajectory and have no apparent effect on  		mortality. If they delay disability onset by one year in this population  		(increasing DFLE by one year), the estimated effect on disability prevalence is  		a reduction from 20.1% to 17.3%. </p>
<p>Similarly, the CHF management programs might minimize the number of  		flare-ups that are often accompanied by disability, without shifting the  		mortality course. If such an intervention lessens the number of months of  		disability in the organ failure trajectory by six months (increasing DFLE by  		six months), the estimated effect on disability prevalence is a reduction from  		20.1% to 19.4%.</p>
<p>Alternatively, suppose that smoking cessation interventions aimed at  		older people with a diagnosis of cancer or organ failure coincided with such  		diagnoses and resulted in an extension of life for both trajectories of 2.8  		years total (by adding 1.5 years of DFLE and 1.3 years of disabled life  		expectancy to each so the percentage change in the latter was greater than the  		percentage change in DFLE). In this case the disability rate would  		<i>increase</i> to 21.8. </p>
<p><b><i>Shift in the disability threshold through environmental  		changes</i></b>. The next two columns simulate a home modification or assistive  		technology intervention that reduces environmental demands for persons in the  		organ failure and frailty trajectories by 25% and 5% respectively. We assume  		the rate of decline in function from the disability threshold to death is  		approximately constant and that there is no effect of the intervention on  		mortality so that the intervention results in reductions of 25% and 5% in the  		amount of time spent living with a disability. These assumptions imply a  		reduction of the numerator in the disability prevalence formula but no change  		in the denominator, and thus unambiguously reduce prevalence to 15.8% and 19.2%  		respectively.</p>
<p><b><i>Mortality only interventions</i></b>. An intervention to increase  		ACP may have the effect of reducing the period of disability at the end of life  		for frail individuals. If the average effect of ACP were a reduction of one  		month in life expectancy with no decrease in DFLE, under the assumptions of our  		model, the population disability rate would decline from 20.1% to 19.9%.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">V. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</a></h2>
<p>While the scope of this study and available research did not allow us to  		definitively quantify the impact of illustrative interventions on  		cross-sectional disability rates, we are able to suggest approaches that seem  		more likely to have a high-impact in the short-run than others. Of the seven  		approaches we reviewed, evidence of modest reductions in the risks of  		disability is strongest for exercise programs that increase strength, balance,  		and physical activity of older adults; depression screening, combined with  		referral and feedback and a treatment program combining therapy with  		pharmacologic treatment; and multi-factor fall prevention programs. Because  		they can be targeted at potentially large populations, widespread  		implementation of such interventions could potentially reduce the prevalence of  		disability in the short-run if adherence issues could be successfully  		addressed. Little evidence exists, however, about the long-term effects of such  		interventions. </p>
<p>This exercise has also provided several additional insights into how to  		reduce population-level disability prevalence among the elderly population. Our  		most striking finding is that efforts with the largest potential for success  		are those targeted at individuals whose life experience is exemplified by a  		prolonged period of disability and frailty before death. Multi-factor  		interventions that are targeted at frail individuals and that address  		individualized needs appear to be the most promising. Both short and long-term  		effects are critical to consider when evaluating the population-level impact of  		such interventions. More detail on each of these points follows.</p>
<p><b>Target Older Frail, Functionally Limited Populations</b></p>
<p>Both because of the numbers affected and because of the expected length  		of time spent with a disability, interventions aimed at reducing disability  		risk in the frail, functionally limited subpopulation have a relatively large  		payoff as measured by prevalence rates. In contrast, because of the advanced  		age at which disability tends to occur for this population, efforts that  		succeed in preventing diseases that typically cause shorter spells of  		disability earlier in life--while they will likely add to life expectancy--are  		unlikely to result in substantial reductions in disability prevalence.</p>
<p>Historically frail, functionally limited individuals are often left out  		of clinical studies examining disability interventions. While credibly  		controlling for baseline functioning and health in a population with multiple  		co-morbidities is difficult, the importance of including this group in clinical  		trails is clear if we wish to identify potentially high-impact interventions.  		To that end, Ferucci and colleagues have recently recommended strategies for  		including frail elderly population in clinical trials.<sup><font><a href="#ref248">248</a></font></sup> Studies of the benefits of managing  		physical and mental health conditions, injury avoidance, and adaptation of the  		environmental should all be considered with this population, particularly those  		who have already reached very old age.</p>
<p><b>Tailor Multi-Factor Disability Intervention to Individual Needs  		</b></p>
<p>Based on our literature review, there appears to be evidence that  		multi-factor interventions and interventions tailored to individual needs work  		best. This seems especially relevant to persons in the frailty trajectory who  		do not have single, well-defined conditions linked to their disability. </p>
<p>Indeed, randomized trials of multi-factor home-based interventions aimed  		averting or delaying functional decline have been undertaken with mixed  		results. According to a recent review,<sup><font><a href="#ref249">249</a></font></sup> modest reductions in disability incidence  		and functional decline may be achieved by home-based interventions that include  		multi-dimensional assessments with follow-up (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.64-0.91);  		however, benefits are generally limited to subjects with relatively low  		mortality (generally less than age 80). These trials have also reduced  		mortality by similar amounts, hence the ultimate effect on prevalence in the  		longer-run remain unclear. The proposed framework highlights several key issues  		that may be useful in fine tuning these multi-factor strategies to identify  		components likely to have substantial impact at the population level both in  		the short-run and over a longer time horizon. Government efforts to identify  		multi-component strategies for disability reduction should include research  		support for additional work in this area.</p>
<p><b>Consider Both Short and Long-Term Effects of Interventions </b></p>
<p>In evaluating population-level impacts of interventions involving the  		elderly population, it is important to consider both short and long-term  		effects. As we have demonstrated in this report, an interventions effects  		are not uniform in the short and long-term, and what appears to be high-impact  		over a one or two year period may be ineffective--or lead to increases in  		disability prevalence--over a longer term horizon.</p>
<p>At the individual level, the effect of an intervention may change over  		the course of an older individuals life. Older individuals who experience  		disability may face multiple underlying causes that may shift over time.  		Removing or reducing one potential cause may have little or no impact on  		disability in the presence of other causes. One can imagine an intervention,  		such as installation of grab bars or other environmental modification, which  		allows the individual to maintain his or her independence for only a brief time  		until their physical and cognitive functioning declines. Other protocols--such  		as exercise or muscle strengthening--may become more effective in postponing  		disability as time goes on. Thus, at the individual level, interventions may  		have fundamentally different effects in the short and longer term. </p>
<p>In addition, interventions that alter the risk of disability may also  		affect survival and hence the length of life lived with disability. In doing  		so, interventions that delay disability in the short-run but put individuals on  		a path to the longer-lived frailty trajectory may ultimately lead to additional  		years lived with disability. Our simplistic simulations highlight possible  		conflicting short and long-term effects at the population level. For instance,  		a successful smoking cessation intervention aimed at older people with a  		diagnosis of cancer or organ failure resulting in reduced risk of disability  		and an extension of life for both trajectories could lead ultimately to an  		increase in the prevalence of disability. Notably, programs aimed at increasing  		the independence of older frail adults without increasing longevity--either  		through disease management or environmental modifications--do not pose such  		contradictions, but unequivocally decrease the prevalence of disability both in  		the short and longer term. </p>
<p>To fully understand the interplay of interventions with disability and  		mortality requires consideration of interventions effects over a  		prolonged follow-up period. Such a strategy, if incorporated into disability  		intervention research, would allow better estimation of the overall merits,  		rather than only the short-term merits, of a proposed intervention.</p>
<h2><a name="append" id="append">VI. APPENDIX: METHODOLOGY TO IDENTIFY ILLUSTRATIVE  		HIGH-IMPACT INTERVENTIONS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Approach</h3>
<p>To help focus the literature review around a limited set of key  		interventions, we employed the Delphi method<sup><font><a href="#ref250">250</a></font></sup> to distill the opinions of an expert group  		to identify interventions that are likely to have a significant impact on  		population-level disability prevalence. As is common in the application of this  		technique, we asked nine experts on late-life disability and disability trends  		to rank 12 interventions from 1 to 12 (with 1 most important and 12 least  		important) according to <b>four criteria</b>:</p>
<ul><li>short-term effectiveness in enhancing independence;</li>
<li>long-term effectiveness;</li>
<li>effect on length of life; and</li>
<li>numbers of older people who could benefit from the intervention.</li>
</ul><p>Experts also had the opportunity to add to their own interventions to  		the list. Six external experts and six members of the project team provided  		rankings. </p>
<p>To focus the scope of this exercise, we purposefully limited the  		proposed list of interventions to those that were: (a) existing; (b) not  		already widespread; (c) had some published evidence demonstrating efficacy; and  		(d) if implemented, could provide benefit within a few years in terms of  		reducing disability in the older population (rather than waiting for decades or  		having most effect upon early or mid-life populations). Interventions included:  		</p>
<ul><li>Improve exercise for those in fairly good health.</li>
<li>Improve diet for those in fairly good health.</li>
<li>Modify homes to enhance ease of use and safety.</li>
<li>Provide assistive devices.</li>
<li>Encourage smoking cessation.</li>
<li>Encourage stroke prevention.</li>
<li>Implement good chronic disease care for mild to moderate  		  illness.</li>
<li>Implement widespread care planning for serious illness and  		  death.</li>
<li>Provide more organ and joint replacements.</li>
<li>Implement fall prevention systems for frail elderly.</li>
<li>Implement depression screening, treatment, and follow-up.</li>
<li>Provide cognitive training.</li>
<li>Other.</li>
</ul><h3>B. Findings</h3>
<p>Combing both internal and external responses, <a href="#tableA1">Table  		A-1</a> shows the rankings for each of the four outcomes.</p>
<p>Based on these results, the team classified the interventions into  		illustrative groupings that will help demonstrate different aspects of the  		conceptual framework under development (see <a href="#tableA2">Table A-2</a>).  		The classification revealed the following: </p>
<ul><li>Encouraging smoking cessation among the older population.</li>
<li>Implementing good chronic disease care for mild to moderate illness  		  ranked high on all four outcomes.</li>
<li>Improving exercise and encouraging stroke prevention ranked high on  		  the same three outcomes.</li>
<li>Implementing depression screening ranked high on two outcomes.</li>
<li>Modifying homes and implementing fall prevention systems ranked high  		  on short-term disability; encouraging smoking cessation ranked high on length  		  of life and improving diet on number of people.</li>
<li>Cognitive training, widespread care planning, providing more organ  		  and joint replacements, and providing assistive devices were not viewed as high  		  ranking in any of the four outcomes.</li>
</ul><p>Although there was considerable overlap between top rankings of external  		experts and project team members, one salient area of inconsistency emerged  		worth noting. Rankings were widely dispersed for widespread care planning for  		serious illness and death. </p>

<p><a name="notea" id="notea">To</a> fully take into account the effects of  			 interventions that alter not only illness trajectories but also the timing of  			 death, we must pick a reasonable number of years to represent a  			 complete lifetime. We are not suggesting as some have (e.g., Fries  			 and others) that a limit exists, only use this figure (100 years) to facilitate  			 comparisons over time in the illustration. The logic of the framework is not  			 altered if we pick 100, 120 or some other limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="noteb" id="noteb">An</a> effect size of 0.2 or less was considered  			 weak, between 0.2 and 0.8 moderate, and above 0.8 strong. An odds ratio of 1.2  			 or less was considered weak, up to 1.8 moderate, and over 1.8 strong.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="notee" id="notee">We</a> recognize that many of the interventions can  			 be targeted at multiple junctures in the disablement process--for example,  			 smoking cessation may be pursued to avoid disease onset (although lifetime  			 smokers generally enter late-life with multiple chronic illnesses) or to manage  			 disease; home modifications may be installed in an effort to avoid disability  			 or to promote recovery from dependence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="notef" id="notef">In</a> all cases, we make the simplifying assumption  			 of a stable population in which entering cohorts are of the same size. Under  			 that condition, the experience of a cohort followed until death will also  			 reflect the experience of cross-section of the population age 65 or older. In  			 fact, the cross-sectional outcome in a real population would be highly  			 sensitive to changes in the size of entering cohorts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="noteg" id="noteg">We</a> acknowledge that those who do not develop  			 organ failure will be exposed to the risk of later life cancers, such as late  			 onset prostate cancer, but such cancers typically do not behave like early  			 onset cancers and are unlikely to alter the ultimate trajectory.</p>
