</dl><h2><a name="abs" id="abs">ABSTRACT</a></h2>
<p>Analysis of new data on the relationship between health risk and  		premiums and coverage in the individual insurance market shows that actual  		premiums paid for individual insurance are much less than proportional to risk,  		and risk levels have a small effect on obtaining coverage. States limiting risk  		rating in individual insurance display lower premiums for high risks than other  		states, but such rate regulation leads to an increase in the total number of  		uninsured persons. The effect on risk pooling is small because of the large  		amount of risk pooling in unregulated individual insurance.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Americans should all have health insurance. But Americans differ in  		risk, and that difference potentially affects both the value they attach to  		health insurance and the premiums they are charged for it. How insurance should  		deal with risk variation is a key policy issue. </p>
<p>The variation in how private insurance treats customers at different  		levels of risk are often thought to be most pronounced in the smallest segment  		of the health insurance market, the market for individual (sometimes called  		non-group) insurance coverage. The purchasers in the individual  		market are more heterogeneous than those for other kinds of health  		insurance--in their characteristics and in their risk levels. Not surprisingly,  		they then face explicit variation in premiums that depends on some of these  		characteristics--generally the ones thought to be predictive of expected  		benefits--of which health risk is probably the most important. </p>
<p>The overall variation in premiums paid, prior research tells us, depends  		on the amount and type of insurance chosen, the effort or luck which attends  		the buyers search process, and buyer characteristics thought by insurers  		to be correlated with risk.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> However, premiums are also affected by policy  		provisions guaranteeing renewability of coverage at rating-class average  		premiums, independent of any changes in the insureds risk. Individual  		insurance contracts generally do not permit renewal underwriting.  		How much linking of premiums to risk actually exists cannot be settled by  		conjecture or anecdote, but requires empirical evidence. </p>
<p>The individual market is extraordinarily untidy, variegated, and  		malleable. It is this way precisely because it is the wide-open residual  		market that has the task of picking up those who do not obtain employment  		group insurance. Some have questioned whether its use should be encouraged for  		such purposes. Some policymakers and regulators would agree with a frustrated  		buyer quoted in a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i> story: If you have a  		job with health coverage, then you get health coverage. If you dont,  		youre simply out of luck.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> There would even be more agreement with this  		articles conclusion--that the individual market has a big problem:  		sick people often cannot get insurance or if they can, its prohibitively  		expensive. Often is not a useful number, but knowing what  		proportion of high risks actually pay high premiums or fail to have coverage in  		this market, and how that compares with the proportion of people at other risk  		levels, and in other insurance markets, would be useful. How serious are the  		problems, are they worse than in group markets, and are there some arrangements  		in the individual market that work better than others?</p>
<p>The individual market covers a small fraction of those who are privately  		insured and it only attracts about a quarter of those without group  		coverage.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> Those left  		uninsured are the segment of the American population that falls through the  		cracks even in this market of last resort. The individual market has assumed a  		more prominent place than its current 6 percent share of the privately insured  		population would suggest. It is sometime proposed as a target for tax credits.  		Both greater use of and reform in the individual market are at the center of  		the recently passed Massachusetts plan to cover the uninsured in that state.  		Just as there is substantial variation among the people who could use the  		individual market and their actual use of it in reality, so there is  		substantial variation in perceptions of policy analysts and policymakers about  		whether this market should be encouraged and improved or disparaged and  		discouraged. In this paper we provide evidence based on analysis of recent data  		on how this market currently functions. The data will describe insurance  		pricing and purchasing by risk level.</p>
<h2><a name="risk" id="risk">RISK VARIATION AND THE PURCHASE OF INSURANCE: WHAT MIGHT  		WE EXPECT?</a></h2>
<p>Before turning to the data, we discuss what one might expect to see in  		such a market. We begin with the benchmark economic model of rational insurance  		purchasing. Consider a set of persons who are not poor and suppose that  		individual insurance were to be offered to them in a large variety of forms and  		premiums. The conventional wisdom, based on anecdotes and elementary economic  		thinking, is that: (1) profit-seeking insurers will charge high risks premiums  		proportional to that high risk; and (2) many such persons will respond to this  		high price by being less likely to buy.</p>
<p>More sophisticated economic theory does not offer unequivocal support  		for either proposition. While the higher risks will pay higher premiums, they  		will expect on average to collect more benefits. For middle income people there  		need be no substantial negative impact of risk rating on the overall proportion  		of a population obtaining coverage; as long as the administrative cost is not  		too large, high risks need not be priced out of coverage that pays  		for expenses they would incur in any case. </p>
<p>But what about those lower income people who are unusually high risk?  		Isnt it likely that even moderately well off higher risk households would  		be unable to afford higher premiums? There is no precise or useful  		definition of affordability currently available.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> The availability of charity care  		to the uninsured may provide a viable, though certainly less attractive,  		alternative.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> It is  		therefore an empirical matter whether high premiums for high risks discourage  		insurance coverage and whether any such effects increase as income falls.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">WHAT THE DATA ON PREMIUMS SHOW</a></h2>
<p>Since we cannot settle things with a priori reasoning, we need to see  		how individual insurance markets really work. We take realism to require that  		we study actual insurance transactions. Typically people on both sides of the  		political divide have tried to study this market by looking at hypotheticals:  		hypothetical prices for hypothetical insurance purchases by hypothetical  		customers. For example, they look at the premiums that insurers  		quote, without regard to whether or not the insurer will actually  		sell coverage at that premium upon receipt of an underwriting report or whether  		buyers will pay that premium.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> Or they look at what buyers with various  		health histories were told when they first called an insurer, without regard to  		the benefits of shopping around or negotiating (sometimes by the consumer but  		more frequently by an insurance broker).<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> And they almost always look at brand new  		customers unknown to the insurer, and the potential premium at first issue;  		they do not look specifically at customers who have renewed with the same  		insurer. If we look at actual transactions, we can avoid these kinds of noisy  		and hypothetical measures. We therefore examined data from several large  		samples of people who might be buyers of individual insurance, and we look at  		two aspects of their actual behavior--whether or not they obtain coverage and,  		if they do, what premium they pay. </p>
<h2><a name="things" id="things">HOW THINGS USED TO BE AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE  		CHANGED</a></h2>
<p>The work to be reported here is to be contrasted to our prior work  		studying individual insurance markets in the late 1980s.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> That work found that premiums actually paid  		were very far away from the model of proportional risk rating. We found that,  		although premiums increased with expected expenses, they did so much less than  		proportionately. Moreover, the only risk variables that predicted higher  		premiums consistently were age, gender, and location; given these variables,  		those who had higher expected expenses (associated usually with chronic  		conditions) could not be shown to pay more than those who did not. </p>
<p>We also looked at whether risk affected having coverage. We found that  		the likelihood of having coverage was no smaller for the higher risks than for  		the lower risks, controlling for income, age, and gender. Indeed, controlling  		for income, younger people (despite risks and premiums much below average) were  		less likely than people in their fifties (who paid much higher premiums) to buy  		coverage.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There was a great amount of de facto risk pooling--in the  		sense that people with different expected loss experiences pay rather similar  		premiums in the individual insurance market. The amount of averaging appears at  		first glance to be so great as to be hard to square with rational profit  		maximizing behavior by informed insurers. Either the high risk consumers were  		hoodwinking insurers, or something else was going on. </p>
<p>We did identify one of the things that affected the relationship of risk  		to premiums--guaranteed renewability.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> Even though not then generally required by  		regulation, guaranteed renewability was a very common policy provision. If most  		people with insurance with this provision had initially bought individual  		coverage when they were relatively low risks, but then stuck with it as risk  		levels increased due to chronic conditions, their later-period premiums would  		not vary with person-specific risk. </p>
<p>Since average risk (and premiums) rises with age, making such a promise  		implies that premiums for younger people will be front loaded,  		containing an extra charge to cover the future loss of those who become high  		risks, which insurers then hold as reserves; this phenomenon would be highly  		consistent with the finding, already reported, that premiums rise much less  		than proportionately with expected expenses due to age. Finally, it also means  		that the overall or average extent to which premiums vary with risk reflects a  		mix of potentially strong risk rating at first issue and no risk rating upon  		renewal. </p>
<p>This time we looked at three different and newer data sets, each larger  		than the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey we examined earlier. The  		sources of these more recent data are the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey  		(MEPS) from years 1996-2002, the Community Tracking Studys Household  		Survey (CTS-HS) from years 1999 and 2001, and the National Health Interview  		Survey (NHIS) from years 1999-2004. One might expect there to be some  		differences from the earlier results. Insurance premiums are much higher now,  		so insurers might be less willing than earlier to tolerate higher risks.  		However, high risks should be more eager to get coverage. </p>
<p>Another change is that more states now regulate the extent to which  		premiums for first time individual insurance buyers can vary with risk (i.e.,  		through required rating bands or strict community rating). It may also be that  		insurers have new technology to identify risks and new incentives to avoid high  		risks when regulation permits them to do so. Finally, the federal Health  		Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) law required all states to  		enforce some type of guaranteed renewability provisions, but actual state  		regulation seems to vary.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> We therefore wanted to see what is happening  		with more recent data.</p>
<h2><a name="tech" id="tech">SOME TECHNICALITIES: WHAT IS RISK? WHAT ARE ITS  		COMPONENTS?</a></h2>
<p>In this new work we follow our earlier procedure in measuring risk by  		expected medical expenses. We developed a multiple regression model, applied to  		the expenses of the insured population, to predict an individuals risk  		based on age, gender, and the presence of a lengthy list of chronic conditions.  		The factors that contribute on average to high levels of medical care spending  		are factors which (we assume) both consumers and insurers would take as  		indicators of high risk. Moreover, the quantitative importance of any such risk  		factor is to be measured by its contribution to expected expenses.</p>
<p>The first two columns of <a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a> show both the  		distribution of actual medical spending and the estimated risk distribution as  		predicted by our model for the sample of candidates for individual insurance  		purchase. (Note that the distribution of risk is different than the  		distribution of actual expenses; there is less variation in the former than in  		the latter. To use the distribution of actual expenses to provide evidence for  		the problem of risk variation, as many analysts do, is thus  		potentially misleading.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note12">12</a></font></sup>) The last two columns show the variation in  		risk due to age and gender alone, and then the variation in relative risk,  		controlling for age and gender, due to health conditions. This so-called  		index of condition-related expense is the ratio of expected expense  		using all risk characteristics over expected expense using only age and gender.  		We wish to examine these distinct components of risk separately in our analysis  		due to the easier observability of some of the risk characteristics relative to  		others. Age and gender are easily observable characteristics, while the onset  		of a chronic disease (and the above average medical costs for subsequent years)  		is uncertain and may be hard for insurers to detect.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="recent" id="recent">WHAT THE MORE RECENT DATA ON PREMIUMS SHOW</a></h2>
<p><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#exhibit2">Exhibit 2</a> illustrates our main findings. It  		compares the actual medical costs, the expected medical costs, and individual  		insurance premiums for single-person policies, splitting the sample by those  		either in the lower or upper half of risk (i.e., expected expense). As the MEPS  		data shows, the predicted high risks (above the median) have both high expected  		expenses (before the fact) and high actual expenses (after the fact; they are  		roughly four times higher compared to the bottom half. But the premiums higher  		risk people actually pay are only, on average, about 1.6 times those of the  		lower risks. While there may be some variation with risk in extent of coverage  		for those who have coverage, even the direction of such variation is uncertain  		and need not be related to whether or not some insurance is purchased. At least  		half of their higher expected expense appears to be pooled, even in the  		individual market. The average premium reflects the experience both of new  		purchasers and those who renew. </p>
<p>Could it be that we do not observe proportionately higher premiums  		charged to higher risks because insurers are using underwriting to deny the  		seriously ill among them coverage or (what is really the same thing) quote them  		so high a premium they decide not to buy? Then they would not be included in  		our sample of transactions. <a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#exhibit3">Exhibit 3</a> shows the  		condition-related component of our measure of expected expense, broken down  		both by income level and current insurance status: employment-based insurance,  		individual insurance, uninsured, and Medicaid. Comparing the measure of  		condition-related expected expense between high-income people with individual  		insurance (0.959) and those who are uninsured (0.997) does provide some support  		for a modest number of high risks being pushed from the individual market to  		the ranks of the uninsured, but the comparisons for the low-income people do  		not imply that similar displacement occurs for them. The overall results do  		suggest the average health status for those with private insurance (whether  		group or individual) does not markedly differ from those who are uninsured  		(though there may well be more variation among the uninsured). Those covered by  		Medicaid, by contrast, have much higher risk and much higher condition-related  		expenses, as one would expect. </p>
<p>In our more rigorous analyses of these new data, we nevertheless make a  		statistical adjustment to account for the possibility that some of the higher  		risks in the potential individual market were denied  		coverage.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> Using a  		selection correction regression model approach for both the CTS-HS  		and NHIS samples, we do find that higher health risk is statistically  		significantly related to higher premiums overall. </p>
<p>While premiums do rise with risk, as indicated, each of these measures  		of the relationship between premiums and risk are well below unity--premiums  		are definitely far from proportional to risk, so there is a substantial amount  		of risk pooling present. The average increase in premium due to increases in  		the demographic component is between 32.8 and 48.0 percent, similar to what it  		was in our earlier work. The health conditions component, though statistically  		significant, has in contrast a much lower relationship, between 11.5 and 15.5  		percent in these two data sets. Although in this data people of a given age and  		gender with chronic health conditions pay higher premiums than people without,  		individual insurance, though guaranteed renewability or some other device,  		pools between 84.5 and 88.5 percent of the risk due to the random effect of  		chronic conditions. We also examined the relationship between conditions and  		premiums for new insurance purchasers only; the relationship in this smaller  		sub-sample was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>To sum up, both recent data sets show that, even after HIPAA and some  		increase in state regulation, the average relationship of premiums paid to risk  		for the full sample is quite similar to the relationship measured earlier.  		Premiums paid still do increase with risk, but they still increase much less  		than proportionately. The risk factors that are most important in predicting  		higher premiums are the persons age and gender--the demographic  		variables; chronic conditions per se matter, but their effect is quite small  		relative to their effect on risk.</p>
<h2><a name="effect" id="effect">THE EFFECT OF REGULATION ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN  		PREMIUMS AND RISK AND ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COVERAGE AND RISK</a></h2>
<p>A minority of states regulate, to various extents, the way in which  		insurers are allowed to vary premiums with risk and/or reject applicants based  		on risk. The strongest case (in New York) is full community rating, in which an  		insurer must charge the same premium for the same policy to everyone in a  		community. A few other states use modified community rating, which  		allows premiums to vary with age but not with health status. Some states put  		bands on the way premiums may vary with risk and put some but less stringent  		limits on underwriting practices. </p>
<p>There is no bright line that perfectly distinguishes states that  		regulate rating of premiums from those who do not, because virtually every  		state can forbid premiums that are arbitrary, while the definition  		of arbitrariness is itself arbitrary. We therefore selected two groups: six  		states as those with the reputation of being the most aggressive regulators  		using either full or modified community rating along with guaranteed issue  		versus 34 states with no rating regulations or guaranteed issue laws.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> We compare how premiums (and  		insurance coverage further below) vary with health condition-related risk,  		given age and gender, in these two groups of states.</p>
<p>The results in <a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#exhibit4">Exhibit 4</a> suggest that the small  		but positive effect of health conditions on premiums observed in the regression  		analysis described earlier exists (to a statistically significant extent) only  		in the unregulated states. We also found (in results not shown) that the higher  		premiums for sicker people in these unregulated states are largely confined to  		low-income people. Apparently higher income high risks in less regulated states  		either find lower premiums that they are willing to pay or are more likely to  		have previously obtained insurance with a guaranteed renewability feature. </p>
<p>The next part of the study looked at the relationship between risk and  		the probability of obtaining coverage. What, if anything, does the risk-premium  		relationship, and variation in it caused by regulation, do to the risk-coverage  		relationship? </p>
<p>We assume that the intent of regulation is to increase overall coverage;  		does it do so?<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> We  		must specify who the potential buyers in the individual market are. Here we  		assume that individuals who have no family member currently working at a firm,  		or who are not currently covered by employment-based insurance, are the  		candidates for individual insurance. Because of the high loading in individual  		insurance, however, the fraction of people in this set, at any risk level in  		any state, who actually buys coverage is relatively small. </p>
<p>Does regulation then matter for the relationship between risk and  		coverage? <a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a> shows the relative rates of  		obtaining individual insurance coverage for various percentiles of risk  		(measured by expected expense), split between those states with neither rating  		nor issue regulations versus those with both community rating and guaranteed  		issue; these relative rates of are normalized to the average proportion insured  		in the sample. </p>
<p>The effect of health risk on insurance coverage is negative and  		statistically significant in unregulated states, relative to an insignificant  		effect in heavily regulated states. However, the difference in the estimated  		relationship between risk and coverage between regulated and unregulated states  		is small in magnitude. </p>
<p>To be specific: high risk people (at the 90th percentile of the risk  		distribution, conditional on age and gender) are 91.5-92.9 percent as likely to  		obtain coverage as an average risk person in unregulated states, compared to no  		difference in likelihood of coverage by risk level in regulated states. Thus  		regulation increases the relative likelihood of coverage for high risks by  		7.1-8.5 percent. (Had we defined high risk people as those with high expected  		expenses based both on age/gender and the presence of chronic conditions, the  		impact of regulation would have been much smaller, with the proportion varying  		by extent of regulation by less than 2 percent.)</p>
<p>However, this modest difference does not necessarily translate into the  		conclusion that regulation helps the uninsured overall. There are two edges to  		the community rating or premium averaging sword; to help higher risks buy  		coverage, it discourages lower risks from doing so. Thus regulation may help  		only some of the uninsured by harming others.</p>
<p>The last relationship to be investigated is therefore the following  		question: how is premium regulation related to the total proportion (at all  		risk levels) who remain uninsured? That is, compared to unregulated states,  		does regulation bring in more high risks than it discourages low risks? We  		obviously cannot simply compare the proportions uninsured in regulated and  		unregulated states, because there are many other factors, some unknown, that  		influence insurance purchasing across states; it would be hard to tease out the  		effect of regulation alone. So we use the results from our analysis of the  		effect of regulation on purchasing by different risks in a simulation  		analysis.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As already noted, regulation increases the relative likelihood that  		higher risks will obtain coverage compared to lower risks. Since this change in  		mix in the insurance purchasing pool raises the average level of risk,  		competitive insurance markets will require average premiums to increase,  		relative to unregulated states (other things equal). This increase in premiums  		will then cause high risks and low risks both to drop coverage--the magnitude  		of which we can simulate using established estimates for the responsiveness of  		insurance purchasing to price. </p>
<p>In a first round that does not yet incorporate the effect of  		increased premiums on coverage, we use the previous model to estimate how  		regulation would affect the mix of risks. For example, we estimate that  		regulation would increase the relative rates of insurance from between 0.915  		and 0.929 to between 1.003 and 1.032 at the 90th percentile of risk, and would  		reduce the relative rate of insurance from between 1.029 and 1.045 to between  		0.999 and 0.980 at the 10th percentile of risk. </p>
<p>The second round incorporates the effect of this shift in  		composition of insurance coverage by risk on the average premium. Using the  		results for the distribution of expected expense for those in the CTS-HS and  		NHIS, we estimate that the shift in composition of insureds from lower to  		higher risks due to regulation will increase the average premium by  		approximately 12.0-14.8 percent. This, in turn, will result in a decrease in  		the percentage insured by 6.0-7.4 percent--using a consensus estimate of the  		price elasticity of insurance.<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> This calculation yields the results shown in  		the right side of <a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a>, where the  		baseline average relative rate of insurance coverage is now between  		0.926 and 0.940 for states with community rating and guaranteed issue  		regulations. That is, these regulations reduce the overall proportion of  		eligibles in the individual market with insurance by between 6.0 and 7.4  		percent.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>What is striking about these estimates is not their precise magnitude,  		but rather the fact that their magnitude is small. The effects of rate  		regulation on relative probability of insurance purchasing in the individual  		insurance market are exceedingly modest, especially when compared to the  		overall shortfall of 74 percent of the eligible population in this market who  		did not buy insurance at all. The reason for so small an effect of regulation  		is, we believe, precisely because there is a very high level of risk pooling in  		this market even in the absence of regulation; there is not much more that  		regulation can (or, apparently, does) do. That the effect of rate regulation on  		overall coverage is also rather small (even if negative) probably helps to  		explain why informal cross state analyses of those regulated states whose  		insurance markets have not collapsed fail to find much;<sup><font><a href="risk-pooling-and-regulation-todays-individual-health-insurance-market.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> there is too much turbulence to measure this  		little zephyr.</p>
<p>The individual markets main failing is not how it treats high  		risks but how it treats all risks: by charging them all high premiums relative  		to the value of benefits, and by not being able to offer them the generous tax  		subsidies available to group insurance, it performs poorly. Perhaps the  		development of ways to lower the administrative expenses for individual  		insurance across the board, rather than further tinkering with the structure of  		high premiums, would be the most helpful public policy. </p>
<p>Here is an additional reason for this conclusion: while regulation does  		slightly increase the number of high risk low-income people who obtain coverage  		compared to unregulated risk rating, the overall proportion of low-income  		people at all risk levels who are willing to buy individual insurance coverage  		is so low, at less than 10 percent, that in the end very few people are helped.  		In contrast, even in relatively unregulated states the individual market treats  		middle income higher risks rather well. It pools a very large fraction of total  		risk, and it gets coverage to people who are higher risk by virtue of being  		older. </p>
<p>Lowering administrative cost or creating high risk pools, rather than  		rate regulation, would also avoid regulation-induced incentives to insurers to  		avoid money-losing high risks. Our analysis strongly suggests that insurance  		policymakers should be much less concerned about the Achilles heel  		of risk variation and more concerned about victory in the overall effort to  		make individual insurance more affordable to more people at all risk  		levels.</p>
