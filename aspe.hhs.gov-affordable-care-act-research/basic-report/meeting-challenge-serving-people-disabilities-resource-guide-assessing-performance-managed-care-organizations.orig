<p>The preparation of this Resource Guide would have been impossible  		without the cooperation of dozens of people who demonstrated their commitment  		to ensuring the quality of care provided to people with disabilities. In  		particular, project staff would like to acknowledge the contributions of a  		group of advisors, whose names are listed below. The group's make-up mirrored  		our intended audiences, and therefore included staff in State Medicaid agencies  		and others who work with State Medicaid agencies; staff from managed care  		organizations; health care providers; and families and other advocates for  		people with disabilities. A subset of the group provided critical input at the  		inception of the project by helping us think through the framework for the  		document; the criteria that should be used in selecting measures; and how the  		document might best be organized to be useful to different audiences. A second,  		partially overlapping subset of the advisors actually reviewed the draft  		document in detail and provided extensive feedback. Of course, none is  		responsible for the final product, but their comments were both thoughtful and  		helpful and led to significant changes, and we hope, improvements. One  		organization, the Center for Health Care Strategies, went above and beyond the  		call of duty not only by providing input from their staff, but also by  		supporting Ruth Martin, a consultant to the Center. Ruth Martin made written  		contributions to the Resource Guide on the important topic of the resources  		needed to implement an effective performance measurement system.</p>
<p>We were also supported by many experts who had used, reviewed or  		developed measures and measurement systems that could be considered relevant to  		the health care needs of people with disabilities. These subject matter experts  		provided copies of their own materials, referred us to others working in the  		field, shared their own visions and caveats with us, and shaped our thinking  		significantly. We are especially indebted to the organizations whose measures,  		measurement systems and criteria sets are included in the Resource Guide. Not  		only did they provide us with their materials, but they also helped us present  		them accurately and completely.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to acknowledge the continuous encouragement and  		assistance of staff of the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care  		Policy (DALTCP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE). Mary Harahan, Deputy to the Deputy Assistant  		Secretary/DALTCP, had the vision and the courage to pursue this project, the  		type of which is a departure from "traditional" ASPE undertakings. Gavin  		Kennedy, our Task Order Monitor, was consistently supportive, resourceful and  		patient. In the final stages of our work, we were pleased to get additional  		input and advice from Lisa Lang, from ASPE's Office of Health Policy; her  		expertise in health care quality was especially valuable.</p>

<h3>A. The Context: Meeting the Challenge of Serving People  		with Disabilities in Managed Care</h3>
<p>More and more people covered by Medicaid are enrolling in managed care  		organizations (MCOs). Under voluntary Medicaid managed care, beneficiaries can  		choose between an MCO and more traditional Medicaid arrangements, such as  		fee-for-service (FFS) or the more structured primary care case management  		(PCCM) program. Under mandatory Medicaid managed care, beneficiaries must  		enroll in an MCO under contract with their State's Medicaid agency. Most State  		Medicaid managed care programs began by enrolling people eligible for Aid to  		Families with Dependent Children, or as it now called, Temporary Assistance for  		Needy Families (TANF). However, several States have now begun to implement, or  		seriously consider, the use of managed care for people covered by Medicaid  		because they are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI); all eligibles  		in this category are by definition persons with a disability.</p>
<p>Several advantages have been attributed to Medicaid managed care.  		Proponents believe it will:</p>
<ul><li>enhance access to high quality health care providers who have  		  previously been unwilling to serve Medicaid eligibles; </li>
<li>do better at integrating and coordinating care over time and across  		  service delivery settings than the more decentralized FFS system; </li>
<li>avoid unnecessary and costly care; </li>
<li>reduce the inappropriate use of service sites, such as hospital  		  emergency rooms, that are often used by low-income people with limited access  		  to primary care physicians; and </li>
<li>focus more on the provision of preventive health services. </li>
</ul><p>However, others have concerns about whether MCOs can and will meet the  		health care needs of Medicaid eligibles. They worry, for example, that:</p>
<ul><li>MCO networks will not include traditional providers of care to  		  Medicaid eligibles (e.g., public hospitals and clinics; community-based health  		  centers and clinics; and inner-city teaching hospitals) who know the special  		  health care needs and personal characteristics of Medicaid eligibles, and are  		  more able and willing to meet those needs; and that </li>
<li>the financial incentives of capitated payments will cause MCOs to  		  place barriers to access to needed health services. </li>
</ul><p>These concerns become more significant when decisions are being made  		about the use of MCOs to care for people with disabilities, many of whom need a  		complex (and sometimes uncommon) mix of health and social services to maintain  		health and functioning. One advantage of MCOs is that it is easier to measure,  		and thus to improve, the performance of a given MCO than it has been to  		measure, and especially to improve, the performance of a community's FFS  		system. The expansion of managed care has been accompanied by increased  		attention to performance measurement for health care delivery systems, and an  		increased emphasis on the need to hold systems accountable for their  		performance.<font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></p>
<p>While there is little evidence that Medicaid FFS as a system took very  		good care of the population of persons with disabilities, it is clear that  		specific health professionals, facilities and programs have provided excellent  		and responsive care to particular patients in particular communities. For many,  		the ultimate value of managed care will be determined by whether it works well  		for people with complex and specialized health care problems and needs, the  		kind of problems and need of many persons with disabilities. As more and more  		people with disabilities enroll in managed care, it is critical, for us all, to  		determine whether MCOs are performing well in meeting their needs.</p>
<p>Comprehensive systems for measuring the performance of health care  		systems in caring for persons with disabilities do not yet exist. At the same  		time, thousands of individual quality measures exist but it is often difficult  		to discern which will be most reliable and relevant to measure MCO performance  		in caring for people with disabilities. In these circumstances, it is easy to  		respond either by (1) doing little or nothing to measure MCO performance or (2)  		mounting costly efforts to measure hundreds of highly specific aspects of  		quality that may fail to provide a coherent picture of performance. <b>This  		Resource Guide is designed to help those who want to begin to work toward a  		comprehensive system, today, by using measures available right now that have a  		clear relationship to domains of performance important to the care of persons  		with disabilities</b>.</p>
<h3>B. Purpose of the Guide</h3>
<p>This Resource Guide is designed to support efforts to measure and  		improve Medicaid MCO performance for people with disabilities. It presents the  		results of an extensive search for existing performance measures that can be  		used for quality measurement and improvement by:</p>
<ul><li>State Medicaid agencies; </li>
<li>managed care organizations themselves; </li>
<li>providers within MCOs; and </li>
<li>people who advocate for the health care needs of those with  		  disabilities. </li>
</ul><p>The purpose of the Resource Guide is threefold:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>To provide an <b>overview of the issues to be considered</b> in  			 measuring the performance of MCO in taking care of people with  			 disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To bring together in one volume <b>key information about  			 measures</b> that now exist, or are about to be made available, that can be  			 counted on to support efforts to measure and improve the care provided by MCOs  			 to people with disabilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make clear the <b>areas where technically strong measures do not  			 exist</b>, in order to encourage further measurement development in these  			 areas.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The Resource Guide is the result of a ten-month effort by the Center for  		Health Outcomes Improvement Research<font><a href="#note2">2</a></font> at the George Washington University Medical Center.  		This effort was supported by the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care  		Policy of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy and Evaluation  		(ASPE) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ASPE commissioned  		the Resource Guide in response to numerous requests from the field to  		disseminate, sooner rather than later, the best available measures of  		performance in caring for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Two important features of the project must be noted. First, the project  		was not designed to develop new measures. Rather, it identified existing  		measures, or measures that are about to be released. The time and resources  		available were not sufficient for the development of new measures. It is  		relatively easy to identify a dimension of performance for MCOs, and even to  		reach consensus across stakeholders that this dimension is significant to  		meeting the needs of people with disabilities. It is far more difficult, and  		takes considerably longer, to develop a reliable and valid way of  		<i>measuring</i> a dimension of performance. The project has helped to identify  		the gaps in existing performance measures, i.e. the dimensions of performance  		that many people think are critical but for which valid and usable measures are  		not available. It can, therefore, serve as a guide to future measurement  		development efforts.</p>
<p>A second feature of the project is that it did not focus on measures  		that would be used to assess the care provided to people, such as the frail  		elderly, who are in nursing homes or other residential long-term care  		facilities. Again, given time and resource limitations, the project's goal was  		to concentrate on care delivered to other populations of Medicaid eligibles  		with disabilities who are being enrolled in MCOs.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b><font>An Example: Measuring  				Coordination</font></b></p>
<p><font>Virtually everyone agrees that effective  				care for people with disabilities requires the coordination of a wide and  				complex range of medical and non-medical services. Coordination of care is  				clearly a dimension of performance. It is quite difficult to coordinate care,  				especially across multiple agencies and providers. It is at least as difficult  				to gather pieces of information from multiple agencies and providers that, when  				put together, will provide a clear picture of whether or not services are being  				coordinated. The project found few reliable measures of coordination of  				care.</font></p>
</div>
<h3>C. How the Guide is Organized</h3>
<p>Following this Introduction, the Resource Guide has four chapters. <b><a href="#two">Chapter Two</a>: Developing Systems to Measure the Performance of  		Managed Care in Serving People With Disabilities</b>, discusses issues that  		should be considered in the selection and use of performance measures,  		including:</p>
<ul><li>the characteristics of people with disabilities; </li>
<li>the health care needs of people with disabilities; </li>
<li>what performance measurement is, who can use performance measurement  		  and how; and </li>
<li>what it takes to build an effective performance measurement system.  		  </li>
</ul><p><b><a href="#three">Chapter Three</a>: Domains of Managed Care  		Performance in Serving People with Disabilities</b>, presents a framework for  		categorizing the aspects of MCO performance considered important in providing  		quality care to people with disabilities. <b>This Chapter should be read by  		everyone</b>. The framework it presents performs two roles:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>It presents the full range of topics that are important to address  			 with respect to serving people with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It serves as an organizing tool for describing and categorizing  			 particular measures; the framework will be used for that purpose throughout the  			 Resource Guide.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In <b><a href="#four">Chapter Four</a>: Specific Measures to Assess the  		Performance of Managed Care in Serving People with Disabilities</b>, presents  		measures and measurement systems that deserve serious consideration for  		inclusion in a performance measurement system. We are not recommending that  		anyone use ALL these measures. Rather, they are a good range from which to  		select a sub-set for implementation. This Chapter includes:</p>
<ul><li>a discussion of how we selected the measures; </li>
<li>a specification of the information that will be provided about each  		  measure or measurement system; </li>
<li>a matrix that indicates what domains are addressed in each measure or  		  measurement system in the Resource Guide;</li>
<li>a summary, for each domain, of the specific measures available; and  		  </li>
<li>a detailed description of each measure or measurement system. </li>
</ul><div class="bordered-text">
<p><b><font>Measures vs. Measurement  				Systems:</font></b></p>
<p><font>A measure typically addresses a very  				specific characteristic. A measurement system is typically a collection of  				measures that may be quite comprehensive in scope. For example, one measure of  				the performance of MCOs in taking care of children is the rate of complete  				immunization of children by the age of two. This specific measure is one of  				many that are included in the best known managed care measurement system: the  				Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS<font>®</font>) of the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA).  				The Resource Guide includes both measures and measurement  				systems.</font></p>
</div>
<p>The Resource Guide does not include copies of actual measures, such as  		complete surveys, or the full technical specification of measures. The  		inclusion of such material would make the document large and cumbersome.  		Rather, the Guide provides sufficient information on each measure to help  		potential users decide whether further consideration of the measure is  		warranted, as well as information about where and how to get actual  		instruments, technical specifications, other documentation and in several cases  		technical support.</p>
<p><b><a href="#five">Chapter Five</a>: Criteria Sets for Assessing Managed  		Care Organizations</b>, presents material that may also be of use in examining  		the performance of MCOs in serving people with disabilities. Several groups  		have identified specific characteristics of MCOs that they think have important  		consequences for the care of people with disabilities. These are criteria sets,  		rather than formal technical measures. That is, no method has been specified  		for collecting information to determine whether a characteristic is present or  		absent. In some cases, determining whether a characteristic is present may be  		relatively easy; in other cases, it may be quite difficult. We have included  		three criteria sets in the Resource Guide because:</p>
<ul><li>unlike most technical measures, they have been developed specifically  		  to address the concerns of people with disabilities;</li>
<li>they can often be used to examine MCOs prior to finalizing contracts;  		  and </li>
<li>they provide a starting point for the development of more formal  		  measures and data collection efforts. </li>
</ul><p>Finally, a list of <b><a href="#reference">References and  		Resources</a></b> provides information on other resources and documents that  		you might find useful in developing a performance measurement system.</p>
<h2><a name="two" id="two">II. DEVELOPING SYSTEMS TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF  		MANAGED CARE IN SERVING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<h3>A. The Population of People With Disabilities</h3>
<p>To determine how best to assess the performance of MCOs in serving  		Medicaid eligibles with disabilities, it is important to understand key  		characteristics of this population. When the last U.S. Census was conducted in  		1991-1992, there were 48.9 million Americans with a disability, or nearly 19.4  		percent of the total U.S. population (McNeil, 1993). At that time,  		approximately 19 percent of persons with disabilities aged 15 to 64 were  		covered by Medicaid.</p>
<p>In 1995, according to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),  		approximately six million people with disabilities were covered by Medicaid, of  		whom 1.3 million were children. Within Medicaid, those with SSI were the second  		fastest growing eligibility group between 1990 and 1994, increasing at an  		average annual rate of 10 percent (Davis and O'Brien). These authors also  		report that as of 1995, the disabled "make up only 15 percent of all Medicaid  		users, while their spending accounts for 39 percent of all program  		payments."</p>
<p>The 1994 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) included a supplement  		designed to learn more about people with disabilities. Utilization of medical  		care among the Medicaid SSI population was slightly higher than utilization in  		the general Medicaid population, but similar to utilization for all people with  		disabilities. The survey reveals that many children with disabilities are  		eligible for Medicaid not under the SSI, but under TANF. This implies that  		measuring the performance of MCOs in serving people with disabilities, and  		especially children with disabilities, may be a significant concern even when a  		Medicaid program does not enroll SSI-eligible persons in MCOs.</p>
<p>Analysis of the NHIS also reveals that estimates of the size of the  		population with disabilities vary widely, depending upon the definition used.  		Some respondents who would be classified as having a disability under certain  		definitions (e.g., impairments, disease conditions, inability to perform  		certain activities of daily living) do not self-identify as having a  		disability. This may reflect differences in attitude between people with  		disabilities and their health care providers. As Harahan noted in a discussion  		of these results, people with disabilities "may demand control over their own  		lives and maximum choice."</p>
<div class="bordered-text">

<li> <font>Medicaid-eligible persons with  				  disabilities may be covered under TANF as well as SSI, so that even when a  				  State enrolls only the TANF and not the SSI population in managed care, they  				  may still need to measure MCO performance in caring for people (especially  				  children) with disabilities;</font></li>
<li> <font>on average, persons with disabilities  				  need and use more health services than other Medicaid eligibles;</font></li>
<li> <font>however, the extent and nature of their  				  need for an use of health services varies widely;</font></li>
<li> <font>many have a distinctly different  				  definition of their circumstances and needs than their health care providers;  				  and</font></li>
<li> <font>many have strong preferences about their  				  care that they expect will be honored.</font></li>
</ul></div>
<h3>B. What Are the Health Care Needs of People With  		Disabilities?</h3>
<p>As already noted, the extent and nature of health services needed by  		people with disabilities varies widely. This section presents the health care  		needs of three subgroups: healthy people with disabilities; people with  		disabilities who have ongoing but not particularly complex health conditions;  		and people with disabilities who have complex and uncommon health conditions.  		Through this discussion, we highlight the issues that must be addressed in  		measuring the performance of MCOs in caring for a population of people with  		disabilities.</p>
<h4>Taking Care of Healthy People with Disabilities</h4>
<p>People with disabilities need the same set of preventive and curative  		health services as those without disabilities. Indeed, as in the general  		population, many people with disabilities need regular preventive care but only  		episodic curative care, since they are basically in good health.</p>
<p>In providing health services even to healthy people with disabilities,  		however, delivery systems must identify, and take into account, the particular  		challenges facing each person. For example, HCFA data cited by Davis and  		O'Brien (1996) reveal that "Mental impairments, including mental illness,  		mental retardation, and developmental disabilities, predominate among both the  		adult and child SSI populations." People with these conditions comprise 67  		percent of adult and 57 percent of child SSI recipients. When preventive and  		curative medical care is being provided to this group, it must be tailored to  		take into account their psychological, social and developmental needs and  		problems. This implies two special needs even for the physically healthy person  		with a mental or developmental disability:</p>
<ul><li>the need for coordination of care provided by physical and behavioral  		  health care providers; </li>
<li>the need for health professionals who do not specialize in behavioral  		  health to understand how mental health and developmental problems can affect  		  the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of other medical  		  conditions.</li>
</ul><p>A wide variety of other diagnoses and conditions can result in a  		disability that makes one eligible for SSI. Medicaid SSI eligibles also include  		people who have sensory impairments; neurological problems; mild to very severe  		limitations in their motor functioning; and respiratory limitations. As in the  		case of those with mental impairments, the physical, psychological and other  		challenges presented by their particular condition must be taken into  		consideration in ensuring access to medical care and in ensuring care will be  		appropriate to the individual. Access and appropriateness are concerns for  		everyone. Issues that are often of special concern to persons with disabilities  		include:</p>
<ul><li>facilities and equipment that do not present physical and  		  architectural access barriers; </li>
<li>specialized transportation to care sites; </li>
<li>geographic proximity of health care facilities, with in-home care  		  needed in some cases; </li>
<li>alternative methods of communicating and interacting with enrollees  		  that are appropriate to those with sensory or linguistic impairments; and</li>
<li>active participation of the individual people with disabilities and  		  where appropriate his/her family or other caregivers in decisions about their  		  care.</li>
</ul><div class="bordered-text">
<p><b><font>Examples:</font></b></p>
<p><font>A system caring for a speech- or  				hearing-impaired person must be equipped to communicate effectively with this  				person, both on the telephone and in person. A woman of 53 who is quite healthy  				but in a wheelchair needs an annual screening mammogram like all women of her  				age. However, special equipment and perhaps special outreach efforts may be  				needed to ensure that she gets screened.</font></p>
</div>
<h4>Ongoing Health Care for Persons with Disabilities</h4>
<p>Other persons with disabilities resemble (indeed may be) persons with  		chronic medical conditions. That is, in addition to regular preventive services  		and episodic curative care, they need specific services on a regular basis for  		an ongoing condition. They (and often their family) must often participate  		actively to make sure their condition is well managed. Since their condition  		may never be "cured," the focus of attention shifts to their ability to live as  		full and active a life as possible is maintained, and to avoid preventable  		deterioration and complications of their condition. For this group of persons  		with disabilities, the following needs become especially important:</p>
<ul><li>access to a regular health care provider (whether a primary care  		  provider or a specialist) who understands their particular problem and how it  		  is likely to affect their life; </li>
<li>ability to maintain a relationship with this regular health care  		  provider over time; </li>
<li>careful tracking by the health care system of the individual's  		  condition, of their response to treatment, of changes in their life  		  circumstances and daily functioning; and of the emergence of other medical  		  problems which can affect, or be affected by, their ongoing condition;</li>
<li>access to patient education, nutrition, exercise and other services  		  that support effective management of the underlying condition;</li>
<li>access to services needed to prevent complications or deterioration  		  or to treat them promptly when they do occur;</li>
<li>access to health services that can maintain or enhance the person's  		  independence and improved functioning in daily life;</li>
<li>links to non-medical services (e.g., housing, education, employment  		  training and placement, transportation, etc.) that also support independence  		  and improved functioning in daily life; </li>
<li>active involvement of the person and where appropriate his/her family  		  in decisions about treatment alternatives and in the implementation of  		  treatment plans; and</li>
<li>support for family members who care for or are simply significantly  		  affected by the health and functioning of a person with an ongoing and  		  disabling condition.</li>
</ul><h4>Caring for People with Complex and Uncommon Needs</h4>
<p>Compared to the general population, a higher proportion of people with  		disabilities face quite serious and often uncommon medical problems, that must  		be treated or managed effectively, and that can significantly influence the  		treatment of other medical problems that occur over their lifespan. Their  		health care needs are complex and specialized. Multiple providers may care for  		an individual patient at any given point in time. The specific services  		required may change over time. Given these circumstances, the following issues,  		in addition to those already mentioned, become particularly important:</p>
<ul><li>access to highly specialized providers and facilities experienced in  		  diagnosing and treating the individual's condition; </li>
<li>access to rarely performed tests and procedures; </li>
<li>access to rarely prescribed medications, medical supplies and  		  equipment; </li>
<li>coordination of care across providers; </li>
<li>continuity of care over time; and </li>
<li>careful tracking of changing circumstances and needs as well as  		  relevant medical advances. </li>
</ul><p>Most MCOs are not organized, at the outset, to take care of the full  		range of complex and uncommon medical problems that may be faced by their  		members. Their network may not include the required specialists. Their  		formulary may not include the required medications. <b>MCOs that agree to take  		responsibility for a population of persons with disabilities need to expect the  		unexpected, and be ready, willing and able to respond</b>. The responsiveness  		of MCOs to complex and uncommon medical problems is influenced by the following  		factors:</p>
<ul><li>the use of a reasonable definition of medical necessity that does not  		  exclude services essential to diagnosing and treating uncommon conditions;  		  </li>
<li>the willingness and ability to add highly specialized providers and  		  facilities to their network in order to diagnose and treat uncommon conditions;  		  </li>
<li>the willingness and ability to provide medications not included on  		  their formulary when essential to treating uncommon conditions or preventing  		  complications;</li>
<li>the availability of user-friendly, well-understood methods that  		  members can use to appeal denials of care and get prompt responses; and</li>
<li>the availability of care coordination services.</li>
</ul><h3>C. Performance Measurement: What is It? How Can it be  		Used?</h3>
<p>This section of the Resource Guide addresses how to think about and plan  		for a system for measuring MCO performance in serving people with disabilities.  		It begins by defining performance measurement, and then describes how  		performance measurement can be used by different groups, and what resources are  		needed to use it well. The section ends with a discussion of how to enhance,  		over time, our efforts to measure and improve performance.</p>
<h4>What is Performance Measurement?</h4>
<p>In this Guide, performance measurement is defined as:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>the process of using formal, scientifically grounded tools and  		  methods to collect information about a health care delivery system, such as an  		  MCO, to determine whether its characteristics and actions, and the consequences  		  of its actions, meet expectations.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance measurement is a key element in holding health care delivery  		systems accountable for what they do. It is intended to inform decisions and  		guide actions. It is not measurement simply for the sake of measurement, or to  		conduct research.</p>
<p>As implied in our definition, performance measurement involves comparing  		performance against a set of expectations about what an MCO can and should be  		doing for its members. These expectations come in part from what research tells  		us can and should be done to achieve desired outcomes. However, the performance  		measures we choose, and in particular what we choose to measure, invariably  		reflect, in addition, values and preferences.</p>
<p>This leads to a question: whose expectations, and whose values and  		preferences, should drive the development of performance measures? The  		development of effective performance measurement systems will require  		participation from many different stakeholders: purchasers (such as State  		Medicaid agencies); policy makers; MCOs; health and social service providers;  		and consumers, including persons with disabilities and their families and other  		informal caregivers. Each of these stakeholders is likely to have distinct  		values, preferences and expectations. To develop a performance measurement  		program, it is essential to develop sufficient consensus about expectations.  		While it is difficult to reach complete agreement on expectations, it is  		clearly possible to identify a set of important and widely shared  		expectations.</p>
<h4>How Can Performance Measurement be Used?</h4>
<p>Performance measurement can be undertaken by different organizations,  		for different purposes. We will discuss how measuring performance of MCOs in  		serving people with disabilities might be used by four different and  		significant constituencies: State Medicaid agencies; MCOs; people with  		disabilities and those who care or advocate for them; and health care  		providers.</p>
<p><b>State Medicaid agencies</b> can use performance measurement to:</p>
<ul><li>identify areas where improvement is needed in the performance of  		  particular MCOs, set goals for improvement and in some cases incorporate them  		  into contract specifications;</li>
<li>identify exemplary behavior in particular MCOs to highlight and  		  disseminate, or use as a benchmark for the performance of other plans; </li>
<li>provide useful and reliable comparative information to Medicaid  		  eligibles who are trying to choose among various MCOs they can join; </li>
<li>select an MCO for persons who do not explicitly choose one for  		  themselves; </li>
<li>decide whether to contract with a given MCO in the future; </li>
<li>determine if there should be a ceiling set for new enrollments in a  		  given MCO; </li>
<li>in extreme cases, introduce intermediate sanctions or even terminate  		  a contract with a plan; and </li>
<li>identify patterns of poor performance across multiple plans that may  		  signal the need for broader changes in policies, procedures or even  		  legislation.<font><a href="#note3">3</a></font> </li>
</ul><p><b>Managed care organizations</b> can use performance measurement  		to:</p>
<ul><li>identify where they need to focus internal quality improvement  		  activities; </li>
<li>track their progress over time in making quality improvements; </li>
<li>make decisions about which provider groups or facilities it wants to  		  include in its network in the future;<font><a href="#note4">4</a></font> and </li>
<li>market themselves to potential enrollees. </li>
</ul><p><b>People with disabilities, their caregivers and advocates</b> can use  		performance measurement to:</p>
<ul><li>make more informed choices both between managed care and FFS systems  		  and among various MCOs;</li>
<li>become more capable of making their own choice, instead of being  		  arbitrarily assigned to an MCO by the State Medicaid agency;</li>
<li>identify and publicize significant problems either in a particular  		  MCO or across several MCOs, in a way that moves beyond individual  		  anecdotes;</li>
<li>identify and publicize positive findings to highlight what can be  		  achieved for people with disabilities, how it can be done, and who is doing  		  it.</li>
</ul><p>Health care providers (such as hospitals, health centers, individual  		physicians and physician groups) can use performance measurement to:</p>
<ul><li>support their own quality improvement efforts; </li>
<li>highlight for the public the things they do best; and</li>
<li>decide which MCO networks they would like to join or remain a part  		  of.</li>
</ul><div class="bordered-text">
<p><b><font>The Goal of Performance  				Measurement</font></b></p>
<p><font>Performance measurement is designed to  				achieve a fundamental goal: to improve the overall performance of the health  				care delivery system by encouraging and rewarding good performance and by  				discouraging or eliminating poor performance. When MCOs know that their  				performance is being measured, and that important decisions and actions will be  				shaped by the results, they will pay more attention to whether their  				performance meets expectations. A set of performance measures is like a test.  				In education, people often complain when teachers "teach to the test." In  				measuring MCO performance, however, the intention is quite explicit that MCOs  				will shape their behavior so they do well on the test. This means that we must  				make sure we have the right test. This Resource Guide is intended to help  				people put together the right set of performance measures, i.e., the right  				test.</font></p>
</div>
<h4>Performance Measurement and Comparisons</h4>
<p>Performance measurement always involves making comparisons. Here are  		some comparisons that can be made using performance measurement:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>comparing different MCOs to each other:</p>
<p>who is performing better at ensuring that patients are actively  			 involved in decisions about their care? who is not doing as well?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparing each MCO's performance to an explicit standard:</p>
<p>do people get seen for urgent care within 12 hours? do at least 90  			 percent of children get all required immunizations by the age of two? are sign  			 language interpreters always available for regularly scheduled appointments  			 with hearing impaired persons?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparing how an MCO performs at a certain point in time to how they  			 performed at another point in time:</p>
<p>is the MCO reducing how long patients wait in the office before they  			 are seen? or are patients actually waiting longer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparing the performance of MCOs in caring for people with  			 disabilities to their performance in caring for other members:</p>
<p>how do rates of mammography compare between women over 50 with and  			 without disabilities? how often do people with disabilities disenroll from a  			 given MCO because of quality concerns, as compared to disenrollment among those  			 without disabilities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparing the performance of MCOs, across the board, with the  			 performance of other delivery systems such as FFS or PCCM:</p>
<p>how do people with disabilities who join MCOs rate their access to  			 specialists, as compared to those who remain in FFS or PCCM?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Different kinds of comparisons reflect, sometimes implicitly and  		sometimes explicitly, different expectations. For example, when MCOs are being  		compared to each other, they are implicitly measuring their performance against  		the "average" performance in the group. Saying that a particular MCO is "better  		than average" may be misleading if everyone is performing poorly. Saying  		performance is "just about average" may similarly be misleading is everyone is  		performing very well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, comparing each MCO's performance to a standard makes  		expectations very explicit. Standards, like measures, have to be developed.  		They can be derived from:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>what can actually be achieved because at least some pathbreaking  			 MCOs have achieved it (this is often called a benchmark):</p>
<p>for example, a small group of MCOs has found methods to ensure that  			 primary care physicians diagnose depression and make appropriate referrals  			 where needed for 80 percent of their patients </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what research shows is essential, or critical, to achieve desired  			 outcomes:</p>
<p>for example, when 90 percent of a population has been immunized, the  			 population as a whole achieves "herd immunity" reducing to virtually nothing  			 the chance of disease transmission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what stakeholders agree is both achievable and morally right:</p>
<p>for example, a standard can be set that <i>no one</i> should face  			 physical barriers to access to health care facilities</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Finally, when the performance of MCOs in serving people with  		disabilities is compared to their performance in serving other members, there  		is an implicit expectation that people with disabilities deserve, can, and  		should get at least the same quality of care as everyone else.</p>
<h3>D. Selecting Performance Measures</h3>
<p>There are innumerable attributes of an MCO that can affect the health,  		functioning, quality of life and satisfaction of the people it serves. There  		are thousands of measures of the quality of medical services, most designed to  		determine whether, for a patient with a particular diagnosis or condition, the  		correct services were provided at the right time by the appropriate people and  		achieved the desired consequences. But very few MCO attributes, and very few  		condition-specific quality measures, are likely to work well as part of a  		system of performance measurement. Why? For one thing, no one has the resources  		to measure everything that could be measured. No one has the time or resources  		to use all the information that would be generated by such a massive  		measurement effort. Indeed, it is important to avoid spending so many resources  		on performance measurement that it detracts from, rather than adds to, our  		ability to provide good service to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>To build a performance measurement system, it is critical to select a  		limited number of good measures that together provide a coherent picture of a  		health care delivery system, rather than measure everything. As noted earlier,  		the performance measures selected will get the attention of MCOs, so it is  		important to select the right set. Here are some criteria that can be used to  		select measures; they were also used to select the measures included in this  		Resource Guide:</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b><font>Criteria for Selecting  				Performance Measures</font></b></p>
<ol><li> <font>The measure should tell you about  				  something that is considered of great significance.</font></li>
<li> <font>The measure should address an aspect of  				  the performance that the MCO can significantly influence.</font></li>
<li> <font>The measure should tell you something  				  that reflects the performance of an MCO as a system of care, rather than a very  				  narrow aspect of its functioning.</font></li>
<li> <font>The measure should let you make the  				  comparisons you want to make.</font></li>
<li> <font>The measure should address an event that  				  can be observed often enough to produce reliable results.</font></li>
</ol></div>
<ol><li>
<p><b>The measure should tell you about something that is considered of  			 great significance.</b></p>
<p>As noted above, performance measures reflect expectations and  			 values. Some things that an MCO does (or does not) do are far more significant  			 that others, depending on your expectations and values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The measure should address an aspect of the performance that the  			 MCO can significantly influence.</b></p>
<p>Performance measurement is a tool to hold MCOs accountable. It is  			 neither sensible nor fair to hold an organization accountable for what it  			 cannot influence. Notice this criterion uses the term influence rather than  			 control. No organization can control anything completely. However, MCOs have  			 significant <b>influence</b> over many things they do not <b>control</b>.  			 Another way to put this is this: does the measure address something that is  			 <i>actionable</i>, something that the MCO can work to improve? does it give the  			 MCO clear direction about what it needs to work on?</p>
<p>Related to this criterion is the issue of what the MCO is  			 contractually required to provide to its members, and in particular to its  			 members with disabilities. Thus, for example, if a contract between a State  			 Medicaid agency and an MCO does not specify that a given service must be  			 provided to enrollees, it may not be appropriate to measure whether or not that  			 service is indeed provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The measure should tell you something that reflects the  			 performance of an MCO as a system of care, rather than a very narrow aspect of  			 its functioning.</b></p>
<p>This criterion is somewhat difficult to understand and apply. An  			 example may help. When health care delivery systems in different countries are  			 compared, one of the performance measures that is almost always used is the  			 infant mortality rate. This measure meets our first two criteria well:  			 increasing the number of newborns who survive to at least the age of one is  			 clearly important; and while the health care delivery system cannot control all  			 the factors that influence infant mortality, it has a significant influence on  			 many others. It also meets this third criteria, because reducing infant  			 mortality requires that many different parts of the health care system do a  			 good job. The infant mortality rate reflects whether women get prompt access to  			 pre-natal care; whether the care is consistent and effective; whether the most  			 up-to-date tests and treatments are being used; whether potentially high-risk  			 pregnancies are being identified early; and whether action is being taken to  			 reduce or address risks swiftly and effectively.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this criterion is in terms of whether a  			 particular action that an MCO can take would have a big effect on the entire  			 experience a member or a patient has in the MCO. For example, whether a new  			 member of an MCO is linked to a primary care provider quickly (say within 30  			 days) could be critical for their ability to use and benefit from the entire  			 system. Another example of special importance to people with disabilities is  			 whether the MCO has an efficient and timely process for bringing new, highly  			 specialized providers into their network when a new member enrolls who needs  			 such providers to maintain or improve health and functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The measure should let you make the comparisons you want to  			 make.</b></p>
<p>As discussed above, performance measurement always involves  			 comparisons. Measures should be selected that are relevant to the comparisons  			 being made. Just as important, measures have to be selected that can be  			 implemented across all the organizations or systems being compared. In  			 particular, the data needed for the measure has to be available across all  			 these organizations and the measures need to be sufficiently specific to ensure  			 that data are collected exactly the same way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The measure should address an event that can be observed often  			 enough to produce reliable results.</b></p>
<p>Most performance measures are rates; they measure how often, or for  			 what proportion of people, an event takes place. The denominator of a rate  			 indicates the maximum number of times, or the maximum number of people, for a  			 given event. For example, the denominator for a disenrollment rate would be the  			 number of people enrolled in a plan over a given time period. The numerator of  			 a rate indicates the actual period of time, or the actual number of people, for  			 a given event. Thus, the numerator for a disenrollment rate would be the number  			 of people in a plan who disenrolled (typically for specific reasons related to  			 their dissatisfaction with care) in that same time period. When the denominator  			 or the numerator are likely to be quite small, it becomes difficult, for  			 statistical reasons, to have confidence in the reliability of a rate. It also  			 becomes very difficult to make comparisons.</p>
<p>This "small number problem" makes it difficult to include as  			 performance measures events that are specific to a particular health problem or  			 condition, especially if that condition is not very common in the general  			 population, in the population of people with disabilities, or in the population  			 of people enrolled in a particular MCO or group of MCOs. For this reason, we  			 have emphasized, in the Resource Guide, measures that are applicable to larger  			 groups of people, rather than condition-specific measures.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>E. What it Takes to Build a Performance Measurement  		System</h3>
<p>Measures are not the only resource needed to build, and to use well, a  		system of performance measurement. In this part of the Resource Guide we will  		discuss the other resources that need to be in place to build a system.</p>
<h4>Planning and Designing a System of Performance  		Measurement</h4>
<p>As noted above, performance measurement requires that we clarify  		expectations. Also as noted, many constituencies have an important stake in  		what gets measured, how it is measured, how it gets reported, and to whom. For  		this reason, it is highly desirable to design systems of performance  		measurement with input from multiple stakeholders. In most but not all cases,  		the lead in development of such systems will come from State Medicaid agencies.  		The lead organization should convene all stakeholders, including other State  		agencies who provide health and related social services to people with  		disabilities. Experiences in several States indicates that the initial planning  		and design process can take up to a year. The convenor needs to have skills in  		planning, in facilitating group processes and in managing conflict, as well as  		technical knowledge. Some may find it useful to contract with an external  		consultant as a facilitator, since an outsider may appear more neutral than any  		of the parties.</p>
<h4>Resources Needed to Collect and Analyze Performance  		Data</h4>
<p>No matter how carefully measures are selected to assess MCO performance  		in caring for people with disabilities, the system will fail unless accurate  		and comparable data are collected in a systematic manner and unless it is  		analyzed and interpreted correctly. Two key players, State Medicaid agencies  		and MCOs, are most likely to be directly involved in data collection and  		analysis. Two kinds of data are likely to be collected for performance  		measures: primary data, collected for example through surveys of members; and  		secondary data, collected from existing administrative and clinical records and  		information systems.</p>
<h4>State Medicaid Agency</h4>
<p>Within State Medicaid agencies, a critical resource is people. One or  		more dedicated staff members will be needed with knowledge of the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>performance and quality measurement; </li>
<li>the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to data  		  collection; </li>
<li>basics of survey research and sampling; </li>
<li>contracting and coordinating with third-party vendors to conduct  		  surveys; </li>
<li>drawing survey samples using State and MCO records; </li>
<li>the structure, potential and limitations of State and MCO management  		  and clinical information systems;</li>
<li>methods for auditing and validating data provided by MCOs; </li>
<li>data tracking and management; </li>
<li>alternate approaches to the transformation of raw data into rates and  		  other findings; </li>
<li>methods for risk adjustment of performance and quality data; </li>
<li>comparative analysis of data; and </li>
<li>presentation of data to multiple audiences. </li>
</ul><p>States need to decide how they want to receive performance information.  		There are three basic choices:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>MCOs submit the calculated performance measure; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MCOs submit the data required to calculate the numerator and  			 denominator of the performance measure and the State calculates the  			 measures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for measures calculated from administrative data only, the MCOs  			 submit all claims or encounter data and the State calculates the measures.  			 </p>
</li>
</ol><p>The approach chosen has implications for the extent and nature of  		computer hardware and software resources, and for how many and what types of  		staff are needed to receive, clean, and load the data and calculate the  		performance measures.</p>
<p>States must also choose how they will audit and validate data. The need  		for validation increases as the MCO, rather than the State, takes  		responsibility for data collection and the calculation of performance measures.  		But much of the data will inevitably be based on MCO records. Unless the data  		are audited, the State cannot assess the level of confidence that it should  		have in the reported performance measures or correct the problems with the  		performance measures. There are several ways in which the State can audit the  		data:</p>
<ul><li>using State staff; </li>
<li>using a contractor, such as the External Quality Review Organization  		  (EQRO); or </li>
<li>requiring that the MCOs hire independent auditors to certify their  		  performance measures.<font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></li>
</ul><h4>Managed Care Organizations</h4>
<p>To participate effectively in a performance measurement system, MCOs  		need three broad categories of resources:</p>
<ul><li>staff with appropriate knowledge and analytic skills; </li>
<li>an appropriate management/medical information system; and </li>
<li>staff with appropriate skills to collect data from clinical records.  		  </li>
</ul><p>Specific staff expertise includes:</p>
<ul><li>performance and quality measurement; </li>
<li>how to translate the definition of a performance measure into  		  detailed operational specifications for data collection; </li>
<li>an understanding of MCO program operations, including related quality  		  assurance and quality improvement activities; </li>
<li>and understanding of the potential and limitations of the MCOs'  		  management and clinical information systems (and the quality of information  		  systems at the provider level); </li>
<li>the history of data collection and information systems to identify  		  changes that would affect the reliability of trend data; </li>
<li>data collection methods, including abstraction of data from  		  non-electronic medical records; </li>
<li>data tracking, cleaning and management; and </li>
<li>auditing and validating methods. </li>
</ul><p>If MCOs choose to implement performance measures based on surveys, they  		will also need either an in-house survey capacity or more likely the capacity  		to select and work with an outside vendor.</p>
<p>As performance measurement and reporting have become more critical for  		MCOs, the need for management information systems that can support these  		efforts has grown. In an ideal world, all medical records would be automated  		and MCOs would have direct access to clinical data that could be combined with  		administrative data, such as enrollment records, to produce timely, accurate  		performance measures. Unfortunately, current reality is far from ideal.  		Therefore, clinical information is derived, to the extent possible, from claims  		and/or encounter data. Information is further limited by the type of coding  		used for office visits and procedures and the coding used for diagnosis. For  		Medicaid members, enrollment data come directly from the State and are not  		under the control of the MCO; these data are sometimes critical to specifying  		the population for which a measure will be relevant. Therefore, collaboration  		at the operational level will almost always be needed between the State  		Medicaid agency and MCOs in order to generate many performance measures.</p>
<p>An MCO's ability to participate in an effective performance measurement  		system depends on its having a management information system (and related  		staff) that:</p>
<ul><li>Collects and reconciles enrollment data and maintains an enrollment  		  history; </li>
<li>Collect and processes claims/encounter data in a timely and accurate  		  fashion and maintains a claims history; </li>
<li>Can integrate data from other sources, such as pharmacy claims data  		  from a third-party vendor; and</li>
<li>Has a flexible report-generator or can export data to a report  		  generation program in order to calculate the performance measures.</li>
</ul><p>Many performance measures will require the use of clinical information  		(that may well not be computerized) as well as administrative data (that is  		more likely to be computerized).<font><a href="#note6">6</a></font>  		This means it is important to have staff with expertise and experience in the  		abstraction of medical records. As important is a healthy relationship between  		the MCO and its providers. Especially in more loosely organized and  		decentralized provider networks, the MCO will need to work carefully with its  		providers to ensure that data are reliably and consistently collected. In this  		context, auditing and validation are even more important.</p>
<h4>Level of Resources</h4>
<p>The amount and type of data collection and analysis resources needed by  		States and MCOs depend on the number and type of performance measures chosen,  		the frequency of reporting, and the level of statistical confidence needed. In  		general:</p>
<ul><li>More frequent reporting requires more resources, unless data are  		  readily available from a computerized management information system. </li>
<li>Measures that require manual data collection (e.g., medical records  		  review) require more resources than measures that can be calculated directly  		  from computerized records. </li>
<li>When sampling is used to collect data to calculate measures (for  		  example with manual medical records review or surveys), higher statistical  		  confidence levels require more resources than lower confidence levels.</li>
<li>If different samples have to be drawn for multiple measures, more  		  resources are required. This can be somewhat mitigated when data for several  		  measures can be collected from a single medical record.</li>
<li>When oversampling or screening is used to ensure that a sufficient  		  number of people with disabilities are included, higher levels of resources are  		  needed.</li>
</ul><h4>Resources Needed for Disseminating Performance  		Information</h4>
<p>All too often, based on traditional practice, performance measurement is  		viewed as of interest only to technical professionals. In fact, however, a  		critical value of performance measurement is that it promotes both general  		accountability to the public and the generation of information that can support  		decisions and actions made by individual members of the public. Performance  		data can only be used by those who have access to it. In planning a performance  		measurement system, attention needs to be given to whether, how, when and to  		whom performance data will be disseminated.</p>
<p>MCOs and State Medicaid agencies may find themselves uncomfortable at  		the thought that they will not be the only people who see, interpret and use  		performance information. It does "raise the stakes" both on the relevance and  		quality of the data when wider dissemination is planned. In some ways, however,  		this a good reason to pursue dissemination: the quality of data may rise when  		people know that the public will see it.</p>
<p>The implication is not only that dissemination needs to be considered in  		planning, but also that resources will be required to develop and implement the  		dissemination strategy. The resources include staff or third-party consultants  		and vendors with skills and experience in:</p>
<ul><li>communication, including writing and graphic design; </li>
<li>the use of formal and informal media and channels for reaching target  		  audiences; and </li>
<li>tailoring the presentation of data to the characteristics and  		  interests of the audience, including their literacy levels, cognitive and  		  sensory impairments, language preferences, and trusted information channels.  		  </li>
</ul><p>People with disabilities, their caregivers and advocates are not just  		another audience in this context; they understand best how they can be reached  		effectively and it is wise to involve them from the outset in planning  		dissemination efforts.</p>
<h4>Enhancing Efforts to Measure and Improve  		Performance</h4>
<p>At the outset, State Medicaid agencies and MCOs will not have all the  		resources needed to implement an ideal performance measurement system,  		including in particular:</p>
<ul><li>skilled and knowledgeable staff; </li>
<li>effective systems for collecting and analyzing data; </li>
<li>methods for disseminating the results of performance measurement; and  		  </li>
<li>an accepted forum where various stakeholders can participate in the  		  process of planning and trouble-shooting. </li>
</ul><p>Performance measurement systems will be "works in progress" for many  		years. They will not be ideal and should not be expected to be ideal at the  		outset. This is one area where the adage that "the perfect can be the enemy of  		the good" is very applicable.</p>
<p>The development of performance measurement systems has to start  		somewhere. We strongly recommend beginning with a limited set of measures that  		are scientifically well-grounded, relevant to the concerns of stakeholders, and  		feasible to implement given the current state of available data collection and  		information systems. The planning process should be designed to help you  		identify these measures. It will also serve to identify the more basic  		structural barriers to using performance measurement. Often, simultaneous work  		may be needed on structural barriers and the first stages of building a  		performance measurement system.</p>
<p>Experience can be a harsh but excellent teacher. For this reason, we  		also recommend learning about and staying in touch with others who are embarked  		on similar efforts, so you can gain from their experience as well as your own.  		The reverse is true: share your experiences with others.</p>
<p>The long-range development of performance measurement systems clearly  		requires investment of resources. Acquiring and maintaining those resources  		also means that the benefits of performance measurement be made clear to those  		with influence over resource allocation. Ultimately, however, development of an  		effective performance measurement system will require that senior officials in  		State Medicaid agencies, MCOs, in the community of people with disabilities,  		and among health care providers, make a commitment to using objective  		information to assess and improve our systems of care.</p>
<h2><a name="three" id="three">III. DOMAINS OF MANAGED CARE PERFORMANCE IN SERVING  		PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p>This Chapter presents a framework of domains of managed care performance  		that the project identified as critical to serving people with disabilities  		well. These domains permit measures to be categorized into broad topics that  		have been identified as important to serving the needs of people with  		disabilities. These domains and the example measures we present in each were  		based on:</p>
<ul><li>interviews with numerous experts and stakeholders; </li>
<li>review of research on what people find important about their health  		  plans; and </li>
<li>analysis of many documents (see <a href="#reference">References and  		  Resources</a>). </li>
</ul><p>The framework represents a synthesis, by project staff, of many sources  		of information, including existing approaches to categorizing measures. For  		example, quality measures were first categorized by Donabedian into three  		types: structure, process and outcome. Many people are familiar with this  		framework, but it does not address the actual content and substantive issues  		addressed by measures. It is therefore less useful for those trying to think  		about performance measurement and to select specific measures.</p>
<p>This framework of domains represents an ideal: it would be highly  		desirable to find well-grounded and usable performance measures across all the  		domains. However, our search for measures indicates that some domains are  		thinly populated compared to others. Nevertheless, it is useful to have a  		comprehensive set of issues and concerns to consider, even if measures do not  		exist today. By starting with a comprehensive set of domains, it has been  		possible to identify clearly the gaps in existing measures, thus providing  		direction for future measurement development efforts.</p>
<p>The nine major domains in our framework are presented first. Details and  		discussion of each domain follow.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">

</ol></div>
<h3>Detailed Discussion of Domains</h3>
<h3>A. Creating a System with the Right Capacities</h3>
<p>As noted above, quality measurements have been distinguished in terms of  		<i>structure, process and outcome</i>. The earliest quality measures emphasized  		<i>structure</i> and were typically used to give a facility a license or to  		accredit a program. This first domain of MCO performance also emphasizes  		structure, but we use here the broader term <i>capacity</i>. One great  		advantage of structural or capacity measures is that they can be used  		prospectively, that is before people with disabilities are enrolled in a  		particular MCO. They can also be used even after enrollment, to make sure that  		capacities are in fact present and perhaps being enhanced. Here are examples of  		indicators of the capacity of an MCO to take care of people with disabilities.  		As with all the lists in this section of the Resource Guide, these examples are  		not considered to be complete; you may well identify additional indicators and  		measures, as we have.</p>
<ul><li>The number, mix and qualifications of providers included in the MCO  		  network; </li>
<li>The stability of the MCO provider network; </li>
<li>The presence of procedures for adding new providers to meet  		  unexpected needs of members; </li>
<li>The presence of well-designed and active quality assurance and  		  quality improvement systems; </li>
<li>The presence of a system for assessing and tracking the health and  		  functional status of members (especially those with disabilities); and</li>
<li>The presence of a method for coordinating the care provided to  		  members (especially those with disabilities) with complex or exceptional  		  needs.</li>
</ul><p>Note that in these examples, the emphasis is on whether the capacity is  		in place. We view this as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for high  		performance. It is also important to determine whether these capacities are  		actually used and whether or not they are effective. These issues are addressed  		in other domains.</p>
<h3>B. Providing Access to Needed Services</h3>
<p>Access to care has long been a critical element of any assessment of a  		health care delivery system. When access barriers exist, people have less  		chance to get the services and care they need. Here are examples of indicators  		of access to needed services that are of particular relevance to people with  		disabilities; many are important to anyone.</p>
<ul><li>Facilities, medical equipment and communication equipment accessible  		  to those with physical challenges, including visual and hearing impairments;  		  </li>
<li>Availability of transportation to care sites; </li>
<li>Availability of convenient times of service; </li>
<li>Timeliness of access to routine and urgent care (e.g., waiting time  		  for appointments; waiting time after arrival); </li>
<li>Access to needed tests and treatments without extensive delays or  		  hassles waiting for prior approvals; </li>
<li>Access to needed prescription medications (including medications not  		  included in the MCOs formulary, although they are on the State's Medicaid  		  formulary); </li>
<li>Access to identified/selected primary care providers; </li>
<li>Access to specialists; </li>
<li>Access to services of special importance to persons with disabilities  		  (e.g., durable medical equipment and provision for the prompt repair of such  		  equipment; rehabilitation services; physical, occupational and speech therapy;  		  home health care (both skilled and unskilled); respite care); and</li>
<li>Availability of translation and interpretation services for  		  non-English speakers (including people with speech and hearing disabilities who  		  use American Sign Language).</li>
</ul><h3>C. Supporting Member Involvement in Decision Making and  		System Improvement</h3>
<p>Increasingly, Americans want to be more active in their interactions  		with the health care system. People with disabilities have been pioneers in  		pursuing a more active role and greater autonomy. In this domain, there are two  		levels at which it is important for MCO members with disabilities to be  		involved in decision making and system improvement. The first level is the  		individual patient's interaction with the MCO and their health care providers.  		The second level is the policy decisions that affect or guide a given MCO, or  		the entire program of care for people with disabilities.</p>
<h4>Involvement in Decisions and Improvements at the  		Individual Level</h4>
<ul><li>Provision of understandable information on how to get needed services  		  and resolve member problems; </li>
<li>Provision of understandable information on methods for filing  		  complaints and grievances; </li>
<li>Provision of understandable information on the definition of medical  		  necessity used by the plan, on the criteria applied to determine medical  		  necessity, and on the process used in making medical necessity decisions,  		  including the process for appealing such decisions in a timely manner;</li>
<li>Involvement of members in treatment planning for management of  		  ongoing conditions; </li>
<li>Provision of information on all treatment options; involvement of  		  members in decisions regarding choice of treatments and specialty providers;  		  and</li>
<li>Support for the development and implementation of advanced  		  directives.</li>
</ul><h4>Involvement in Decisions and Improvements at the System  		Level</h4>
<ul><li>Inclusion of members, family and other caregivers and advocates on  		  MCO governing and advisory boards;</li>
<li>Inclusion of members, family and other caregivers and advocates on  		  task forces and other groups organized by MCOs, State Medicaid agencies or  		  others, to plan or track the use of managed care for people with  		  disabilities;</li>
<li>Participation of members, caregivers and advocates in the planning of  		  quality improvement activities, including setting priorities on issues and  		  conditions that should be the focus of such efforts; and </li>
<li>Systematic use of methods to gather qualitative and quantitative  		  information from members, caregivers and advocates to identify their priorities  		  and their experiences using the system. </li>
</ul><h3>D. Resolving Member Problems and Concerns</h3>
<p>Many, though not all, MCOs are relatively inexperienced in serving  		people with disabilities. For this reason if no other, it is critical to  		determine whether MCOs have put themselves in a position to learn quickly from  		their experiences and to correct their mistakes. One place where this would  		show is in how well they resolve the problems and concerns of particular  		members. In addition, as already noted, some health care needs of people with  		disabilities are rare or unexpected, and may only come to the surface in a  		crisis situation. Here are examples of indicators of whether an MCO is  		resolving member problems and concerns:</p>
<ul><li>Timely, courteous and helpful responses from plan customer service to  		  member requests for information about the plan and how to use it; </li>
<li>Timely, courteous and helpful responses from plan customer service to  		  member requests to resolve questions and problems regarding access to  		  care;</li>
<li>Rapid response to resolve problems involving exceptional needs and  		  circumstances; </li>
<li>Use of appropriate procedures to hear and address member appeals,  		  complaints and grievances (including rapid responses); and </li>
<li>Reductions over time in the rate of disenrollment for cause by  		  members with disabilities. </li>
</ul><h3>E. High Quality Interpersonal Interactions Between  		Members and Providers</h3>
<p>Extensive consumer research indicates that everyone values highly the  		opportunity to have high quality interpersonal interactions with people in  		health care systems. There is also evidence that good patient-provider  		relationships have a positive effect on the management of long-term conditions  		and on the outcomes of health care. This domain of performance is an example of  		one that is important to everyone and especially important to and for people  		with disabilities. Here are examples of indicators in this domain:</p>
<ul><li>Proactive engagement of new members with primary care providers they  		  have selected from the plan network;</li>
<li>Providers who listen carefully to members and their caregivers; </li>
<li>Providers who explain things clearly to members and their caregivers;  		  </li>
<li>Providers who treat members and their caregivers with courtesy and  		  respect; </li>
<li>Providers who spend enough time with members and their caregivers;  		  and </li>
<li>Medical office staff who are courteous, helpful and respectful of  		  members and their caregivers.</li>
</ul><h3>F. Using Preventive Services to Keep Members Healthy and  		Functioning</h3>
<p>This is another domain which is important to everyone and also very  		important for people with disabilities. Equity considerations are of special  		relevance here: it is critical that those with disabilities get the services we  		know are effective in prevention or early identification of various diseases,  		even though it may take special efforts to ensure they get these services at  		least as often as people with no disabilities. This remark applies to our first  		general indicator:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Delivery of age- and gender-appropriate preventive health  			 services.</p>
<p>Considerable work has been done to identify, across the age  			 spectrum, and by gender where relevant, specific primary and secondary  			 prevention services and interventions of known value. Many measurement systems  			 have identified sub-sets of these services of particular importance. However,  			 for people with disabilities, there is another kind of prevention that is  			 important, what public health people call tertiary prevention, i.e., the  			 prevention of unnecessary complications and unnecessary deterioration in  			 functioning for people who already have a defined condition. Our second general  			 indicator is relevant to this kind of prevention. Unfortunately, less work has  			 been done to specify and bring together services which are effective in this  			 kind of prevention, although some have certainly been identified and are  			 already in use as performance measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivery of services to maintain and enhance functioning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>G. Coordinating and Integrating Medical and Non-Medical  		Services</h3>
<p>Coordination of care has been consistently identified as critical for  		people with disabilities. One of the greatest hopes many have about managed  		care is that it will do a better job of coordinating and integrating care. The  		examples below provide different perspectives on coordination that can all be  		important to people with disabilities:</p>
<ul><li>Continuity of primary care and specialty providers over time; </li>
<li>Ongoing coordination of medical services provided to a member by  		  multiple providers; </li>
<li>Coordination of physical and mental health/substance abuse service  		  providers; </li>
<li>Identification of non-medical services needed to maintain and enhance  		  member health, functioning and autonomy; referral and follow-up to support  		  delivery of such services;</li>
<li>Referral to plan- and community-based psycho-social support and  		  patient education services; and</li>
<li>Ongoing coordination with providers of critical non-medical services  		  that affect health and functioning.</li>
</ul><h3>H. Using State of the Art Treatments</h3>
<p>This domain of performance comes closest to traditional quality  		assurance and quality improvement efforts. The domain emphasizes <i>process</i>  		measures, indicators that health care providers are using the right diagnostic  		and treatment procedures, medications, etc., in caring for their patients. To  		develop and select performance measures in this domain, it is essential to  		focus on a limited number of specific conditions that are sufficiently common  		to permit meaningful data collection and that have significant health  		consequences. These conditions can be identified in two different manners. The  		first is to build on the work already done by multi-stakeholder groups working  		with experts (see for example the Sentinel Conditions for Medicaid MCOs  		developed collaboratively by plans, State agencies and HCFA). Alternatively,  		the set of conditions could also be identified through multi-stakeholder  		interactions in a particular State. For these conditions, the strategy would  		then be to identify indicators that MCOs:</p>
<ul><li>Use interventions known to be of importance in the management and  		  resolution of significant medical care problems; and </li>
<li>Use interventions known to be of importance in the management and  		  resolution of significant behavioral health problems </li>
</ul><h3>I. Improving the Outcomes of Care</h3>
<p>Many believe that the most significant performance measures are those  		that reflect the <i>outcomes</i> of care, that is, whether people get better  		and how quickly; whether their conditions are managed effectively even if they  		cannot be cured; whether their functioning and quality of life are maintained  		to the extent possible; and whether and when they die. In addition to these  		traditional definitions of good outcomes, which tend to be driven by the  		expectations of professionals, many people believe there is another important  		outcome of care: the degree to which patients or plan members are satisfied  		with the care they receive.</p>
<p>In spite of the acknowledged importance of medical outcomes, project  		staff were consistently advised, even by those who have devoted their lives to  		the development of outcome measures and the conduct of outcomes research, that  		it would not be sensible to include medical outcome measures in our list of  		performance measures. Outcome measures have been used primarily in highly  		controlled research studies, in which an identified group of individuals are  		carefully tracked over time to see how they respond to a new treatment, as  		compared to either no treatment or a more conventional treatment. Care is taken  		to ensure that the groups of people who get the different kinds of treatment  		are extremely similar to one another. This is all to ensure that any  		differences in outcomes can, with confidence, be attributed to differences in  		the treatment.</p>
<p>However, these controlled circumstances do not exist when MCO  		performance is being measured. First, there is no guarantee that the people  		with disabilities who enroll in one MCO are going to be at all similar to the  		people with disabilities who enroll in another, or who remain in Medicaid FFS  		or PCCM systems. Second, there is no guarantee that these people will stay in  		an MCO so their progress (or lack of progress) can be tracked. Finally it is  		important to choose performance measures that address things the MCO can  		strongly influence. Many factors besides medical care are known to have a  		strong influence on outcomes. Research studies are carefully structured to  		track these other influences and take them into account, but it is very  		difficult and expensive to set up these controls in examining a population of  		MCO member.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, this domain should emphasize that MCOs  		are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Demonstrating improvements over time in the overall satisfaction,  			 among members who have disabilities, with the plan, its providers, and the  			 quality of care they are receiving.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, MCOs can and should conduct their own outcome studies.  		Another indicator in this Domain would therefore be the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>With respect to conditions of special importance to persons with  			 disabilities, the MCO conducts studies to:</p>
<ul><li>Support or demonstrate improvements over time in the health  				outcomes of care; </li>
<li>Support or demonstrate improvements over time in the functional  				status of members; or </li>
<li>Support or demonstrate improvements over time in the quality of  				life of members. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="four" id="four">IV. SPECIFIC MEASURES TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF  		MANAGED CARE IN SERVING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p>This Chapter includes measures and measurement systems that should be  		considered for use in assessing the performance of MCOs in serving people with  		disabilities. The Chapter begins by describing how measures were selected. The  		Chapter then presents a matrix that allows the reader to identify which major  		domains of measurement are addressed by each measure or measurement system. For  		example, if you are interested in learning about HEDIS<font>®</font> measures, the matrix will show which major domains of  		performance are, and are not, covered by these measures. After the matrix, we  		present, for each major domain, the specific items in the domain that are  		available in different measures and measurement systems. For example, if you  		are interested in the domain of Providing Access to Needed Services, you should  		consult this section to get a quick overview of the specific access measures  		available. Based on these summaries, we then comment briefly on which domains  		have extensive measures and which do not, with recommendations for measurement  		development.</p>
<p>The Chapter then moves to details about each measure. A standard set of  		information is presented for each measure, and these items of information are  		described to orient the reader. Finally, each measure or measurement system is  		presented.</p>
<h3>A. How We Identified and Selected the Measures in the  		Guide</h3>
<p>The measures in the Resource Guide were identified through an extensive  		search process that included the following:</p>
<ul><li>a review of published literature; </li>
<li>a review of unpublished literature, including the proceedings and  		  hand-out materials for relevant conferences; and </li>
<li>in-depth interviews with experts in performance measurement, and in  		  the delivery of health care services to people with disabilities.</li>
</ul><p>In selecting the measures to be included in the Resource Guide, we used  		the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li><b>High relevance to the domains of performance included in our  		  framework (see <a href="#three">Chapter Three</a>);</b></li>
<li><b>Appropriateness as a measure of the performance of a system of  		  care rather than for the evaluation of individual health care providers;  		  </b></li>
<li><b>Applicability to a population of people with disabilities with a  		  broad mix of illnesses and impairments; </b></li>
<li><b>Sufficient specificity for consistent measurement to occur over  		  time and across settings; </b></li>
<li><b>Evidence of scientific reliability and validity, as demonstrated  		  either through the procedures used to develop the measure or the results of  		  psychometric tests conducted after initial use of the measure; </b></li>
<li>History of development or use of the measure with people with  		  disabilities; </li>
<li>Ease, cost and burden of data collection; </li>
<li>Availability of the measure in the public domain; </li>
<li>Availability of technical documentation for the measure and  		  information on how data for the measure should be collected; and </li>
<li>Availability of technical support for the use of the measure,  		  preferably at low or no cost. </li>
</ul><p>All the measures do not meet all these criteria. Criteria in boldface  		are met by all measures in the Guide. With respect to other criteria, some  		measures rate more highly than others, the Guide includes information that  		permits readers to make their own assessments on these criteria. A few measures  		are not available as we go to press, but are expected to be available very  		shortly.</p>
<h3>B. Summary Matrix of Domains Addressed in Each  		Measure</h3>

</ul><h3>D. Areas Where Measures Are and Are Not Available</h3>
<p>The preceding summary of the specific measures available in each domain  		reveals clearly that in certain domains there is a rich and varied choice of  		measures, while in others there are relatively few measures. There is an  		especially wide choice of measures in these areas:</p>
<ul><li>Domain 2. Providing Access to Needed Services; and </li>
<li>Domain 5. High Quality Interpersonal Interactions Between Members and  		  Providers. </li>
</ul><p>Research has indicated that these two areas are of special importance to  		all kinds of patients and consumers, in the context of managed care, and they  		are certainly of importance to people with disabilities. In addition, it is  		easy to gather data on these topics from patients and consumers themselves, who  		are often in the best position to provide useful information on these  		topics.</p>
<p>There is a reasonable number of measures available in these two  		areas:</p>
<ul><li>Domain 6. Using Preventive Services to Keep Members Healthy and  		  Functioning; and </li>
<li>Domain 8. State of the Art Treatments. </li>
</ul><p>These two areas have been a focus of a good deal of measurement  		development efforts that build on the foundations of measurement of clinical  		quality of care. However, there is still work needed in these areas to develop  		measures that address conditions and concerns specific to people with  		disabilities, including more and better measures of mental health and  		developmental problems. In contrast, there are relatively few measures  		available in Domain 9, Improving the Outcomes of Care. As noted earlier, there  		are methodological difficulties in applying traditional clinical outcome  		measures in the assessment of the outcomes of care for a population of members  		in MCOs. In the early stages of the process of measuring the performance of  		MCOs in caring for people with disabilities, other arenas may therefore have  		higher priority for new measurement development.</p>
<p>In particular, the scarcity of measures in the following areas is of  		concern:</p>
<ul><li>Domain 1. Creating a System with the Right Capacities </li>
<li>Domain 3. Supporting Member Involvement in Decision Making and System  		  Improvement </li>
<li>Domain 4. Resolving Problems and Concerns; and </li>
<li>Domain 7. Coordinating and Integrating Medical and Non-Medical  		  Services. </li>
</ul><p>Several of these domains can and often are addressed by looking at MCO  		structures. <a href="#five">Chapter Five</a> includes several criteria sets  		that specify structural and procedural characteristics of MCOs that are  		believed to be necessary, if not sufficient, for the delivery of high quality  		care to people with disabilities. As we note, criteria are not, in and of  		themselves, measures, but the judicious use of structural criteria can help to  		complement other measures.</p>
<p>However, some aspects of these domains cannot be addressed simply in  		structural terms. First, we need to know if structures are not only in place,  		but working to meet the needs of people with disabilities. Second, some aspects  		of these domains go beyond structural issues. Project staff believe that it is  		especially critical that priority be given to measurement development in the  		following areas:</p>
<ul><li>the involvement of individual people with disabilities (and where  		  appropriate their family and other caregivers) in decisions about their health  		  care; </li>
<li>the involvement of people with disabilities, their families and other  		  caregivers, and their advocates, in decisions about the design and improvement  		  of health care delivery systems; </li>
<li>the degree to which member problems, concerns and grievances are  		  promptly addressed and resolved to their satisfaction;</li>
<li>continuity and coordination of medical care services; and </li>
<li>coordination of medical and related social and ancillary services.  		  </li>
</ul><h3>E. Overview of Information to be Provided About Each  		Measure or Measurement System</h3>
<p>The following information is presented below, wherever it is available,  		for each measure and measurement system in the Resource Guide:</p>
<p><i><b>Name of Measure</b></i>: The formal name of the measure or  		measurement system</p>
<p><i><b>The Author or Organization That Developed the Measure</b></i>:  		This would include the key contact person and location information for where to  		get a complete copy of the measure and any documentation that is available for  		the measure.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Measure</b></i>: Many of  		the measures in the Resource Guide address more than one of the domains of  		performance we have discussed in <a href="#two">Chapter Two</a>, Section E. We  		will list each of the domains of performance to which the measure is relevant  		and usually give examples of specific items or indicators in each domain that  		are addressed in the measure.</p>
<p><i><b>Data Collection Strategies Required for Use of the  		Measure</b></i>: This includes the following issues:</p>
<ul><li>What type of data collection is required? </li>
<li>From whom are data collected? </li>
<li>What kind of sampling or oversampling is needed? </li>
<li>What if any methods are available for risk-adjustment of the data  		  collected? </li>
</ul><p><i><b>What Evidence is Available to Support the Validity and Reliability  		of Measure</b></i>: The Guide summarizes evidence drawn from the process of  		developing the measure and/or from psychometric testing of the measure that  		indicates that it is likely to be valid and reliable.</p>
<p><i><b>What Are the Populations and Settings in Which the Measure Has  		Been or Could Be Used</b></i>: Very few performance measures have been  		developed specifically to assess care for people with disabilities. This  		section provides information on the populations and settings for which the  		measure was originally developed, and where it has been used, and gives an  		assessment of the additional populations or settings where it could be  		used.</p>
<p><i><b>What Written Documentation is Available to Support Use of  		Measure</b></i>: This section lets the reader know whether there is written  		documentation that can be used in implementing the measure, and the level of  		detail of this documentation.</p>
<p><i><b>What Consultation is Available to Support Use of Measure</b></i>:  		This section indicates whether technical consultation is available, from the  		original developers of the measure or from others, about its use. When  		consultation is only available at a charge this is noted.</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Measure</b></i>: This final section presents  		any limitations on the use of the measure, or on the interpretation of results,  		that need to be taken into consideration in a performance measurement  		context.</p>
<h3>F. Descriptions of Measures and Measuring Systems</h3>
<h4>1. Selected Measures from the Health Plan Employer Data and Information  		Set (HEDIS<font>®</font>), Version 3.0</h4>
<p>HEDIS<font>®</font> is one of the most well-known  		performance measurement systems for MCOs. It is a measurement system that  		includes dozens of specific measures. We have selected, from HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0, those measures that are most relevant to assessing  		the performance of MCOs in caring for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Name of Measurement System</b></i>: HEDIS<font>®</font>3.0</p>
<p><i><b>Author/Developer</b></i>: National Committee for Quality Assurance  		(NCQA), 2000 L Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20036, Phone (202)  		955-3500</p>
<p>NCQA is a non-profit organization formed specifically for the purpose of  		assessing and improving the quality and performance of health maintenance  		organizations. It is governed by a Board of Directors that includes  		representatives from purchasers of health care, from MCOs, and from the public.  		NCQA began its work by developing standards for the independent accreditation  		of HMOs. It then moved into performance measurement, with the HEDIS<font>®</font> system. HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 includes  		measures considered relevant for the commercially insured population, for  		people on Medicaid, and for people on Medicare. It was developed by the NCQA  		Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM), whose membership mirrors that of  		the NCQA Board.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Measure</b></i>: </p>
<p>HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 measures are organized by NCQA  		into sub-sets which do not map with our domains. We have chosen specific  		measures from several sub-sets, including the following: (1) <i>effectiveness  		of care</i>; (2) <i>health plan descriptive information</i>; (3) <i>health plan  		stability</i>; and (4) <i>use of services</i>. Using our domains of  		performance, we will list the specific HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0  		measures we recommend:<font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></p>
<p><b>Domain 1. Creating a System with the Right Capacities</b></p>
<ul><li>Pediatric mental health network </li>
<li>Chemical dependency services </li>
<li>Quality assessment and improvement systems </li>
<li>Provider turnover </li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 2. Providing Access to Needed Services</b></p>
<ul><li>Mental health utilization--percentage of members receiving inpatient  		  day/night and ambulatory services</li>
<li>Mental health utilization--inpatient discharges and average length of  		  stay </li>
<li>Chemical dependency utilization--percentage of members receiving  		  inpatient, day/night and ambulatory services</li>
</ul><p>(Note: Utilization rates can only be interpreted if there is a  		well-grounded standard for determining what the "correct" level of utilization  		should be for a given population of individuals. For example, if utilization  		rates are compared over time or across plans, there needs to be confidence that  		the rate at which members in different plans need a specific service is very  		similar. Even in that cases, only wide disparities would generate cause for  		concern.)</p>

<li>Readmission for chemical dependency </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Data Collection Strategies Required for Use of the  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p><i>Type of Data Collection</i></p>
<p>The measures listed above require a wide variety of data collection  		strategies, but are primarily based on administrative and clinical records.</p>
<p><i>From Whom Are Data Collected</i></p>
<p>All data are collected by the MCO, using the detailed specification  		provided by NCQA. It is essential to validate these data using an independent  		auditor. NCQA is currently training and licensing organizations to serve this  		role.</p>
<p><i>Sampling and Oversampling Issues</i></p>
<p>Hundreds of MCOs collect HEDIS<font>®</font> data, either  		on their entire population or on members supported by particular sponsors  		(private employers, Medicare, etc.). Especially since NCQA earlier developed a  		version of HEDIS<font>®</font> specifically for Medicaid (which  		has now been integrated into HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0), many MCOs  		collect HEDIS<font>®</font> data on Medicaid populations.  		However, it is very likely that if a routine general population sample is taken  		of MCO members for purposes of HEDIS<font>®</font>, the number of  		people with disabilities in the sample will not be sufficient to permit  		meaningful conclusions. It is therefore essential either to target data  		collection at members who are known (for example by their eligibility category)  		to have a disability, or to develop methods for "oversampling" the records of  		people with disabilities.</p>
<p><i>Risk Adjustment</i></p>
<p>The documentation for HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 includes  		information on whether and how specific measures can be risk adjusted.</p>
<p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of  		Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>HEDIS<font>®</font> measures are selected using a rigorous  		and extended process of examination and testing of candidate items against  		criteria of scientific validity and reliability. The documentation for each  		measure includes detailed information on the specific evidence of validity and  		reliability. </p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Measures Have Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>The original HEDIS<font>®</font> measures were designed to  		assess care provided to commercially insured populations enrolled in HMOs.  		HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 incorporates measures targeted to  		Medicaid and Medicare populations. As a measurement system, HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 is intended to address a cross section of the  		American people. To the extent that people with disabilities have been enrolled  		in various kinds of MCOs (commercial, Medicaid, Medicare) the measures have  		been used with this group. Given appropriate sampling and oversampling,  		HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 measures can be used specifically to  		assess care for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The extensive use of HEDIS<font>®</font> among populations  		without disabilities facilitates comparisons of MCO performance for people with  		disabilities to their performance for other populations. For example, HCFA has  		mandated the collection of HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 data by all  		Medicare risk-contract HMOs serving Medicare beneficiaries (including those  		eligible because of a disability).</p>
<p>NCQA has developed "Quality Compass," a system through which HMOs  		voluntarily provide the results of HEDIS<font>®</font>  		measurement to the agency, for incorporation into a data base that provides  		information on performance on individual measures for a substantial sample of  		HMOs. This can be useful in comparing performance and in developing benchmarks.  		However, because HEDIS<font>®</font> measures are specific to  		HMOs, they do not permit comparisons with FFS or PCCM.</p>
<p><i><b>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>Extensive and detailed documentation is available from NCQA on  		individual HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 measures and on the entire  		HEDIS<font>®</font> data collection process. Since the  		documentation is voluminous, there is a charge for it.</p>
<p><i><b>Consultation Available to Support Use of Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>Some consultation is available from NCQA regarding the use of HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0. As noted above, NCQA is currently identifying  		organizations qualified to validate HEDIS<font>®</font> data  		collection efforts. In addition, NCQA has begun to work on the dissemination of  		HEDIS<font>®</font> information, and in the design of materials  		to report the results of HEDIS<font>®</font> to different  		audiences, including consumers. Perhaps more significant, hundreds of HMOs have  		used the system and are familiar with it, and many private and public  		purchasers, including State Medicaid agencies, have also used the system and  		could provide information regarding their experiences on an informal basis.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>Limits on the use of utilization rate measures have already been noted.  		It should also be noted that descriptive information provided by HMOs, such as  		that included in Domains 1 and 7, is quite difficult to validate. The same is  		true for all forms of self-reported structural data.</p>
<h4>2. Selected Measures from the Performance Measures for  		Managed Behavioral Healthcare Programs (PERMS)</h4>
<p><i><b>Name of Measurement System</b></i>: PERMS 2.0 (Performance  		Measures for Managed Behavioral Healthcare Programs)</p>
<p><i><b>Author/Developer</b></i>: American Managed Behavioral Healthcare  		Association (AMBHA), 700 Thirteenth Street, NW, Suite 950, Washington, D.C.  		20005, Phone (202)434-4565, Contact: E. Clark Ross, D.P.A., Executive  		Director</p>
<p>Founded in 1994, AMBHA is an association of managed behavioral health  		organizations (MBHOs) based in Washington, D.C. The member organizations, from  		38 States, manage the mental health and substance abuse health plan benefits  		for over 98 million people. The association was formed to work on issues of  		public accountability, quality, and public policy and communication. The  		mission statement of the organization has as one of its objectives: "To promote  		health plan, management agent, and provider accountability through performance  		measurement."</p>
<p>At the time PERMS 1.0 was first administered, AMBHA included 19 member  		organizations, of which 13 responded to parts of PERMS; these firms had covered  		lives of approximately 21 million people. As PERMS 2.0 evolved, portions of it  		were incorporated within the HEDIS<font>®</font> measures  		released by the NCQA in January of 1997. Developmental work on PERMS 2.0 is  		still ongoing, and reflects areas "requiring more attention" such as substance  		abuse, the severely and persistently mentally ill, and special populations. As  		AMBHA develops and refines measures, their goal is to "act as a testing site  		and a prod" so that quality measurement organizations that operate on a  		national level will incorporate what AMBHA considers to be valid and realistic  		behavioral health performance measures. The NCQA has incorporated a number of  		these measures into their HEDIS<font>®</font> Measurement system;  		other measures for consumer satisfaction may be incorporated into the Consumer  		Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) surveys, in particular the Behavioral Health  		Survey, which are discussed in section 3 below.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>PERMS 2.0 categorizes its measures into Access to Care, Quality of Care,  		and Consumer Satisfaction under the headings of "Core Measures," and  		"Leadership Measures." The Core Measures domain consists of "HEDIS-type"  		measures, with the addition of an item on "call abandonment reporting." The  		Leadership Measures domain incorporate HEDIS-type measures for diagnoses of  		depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol abuse, by age and by gender.</p>
<p><b>Domain 2. Providing Access to Needed Services</b></p>
<ul><li>Telecommunications standards--standards such as a call abandonment  		  rate of less than 5% of calls on-hold for less than 30 seconds, and an average  		  answer time speed of five rings or fewer </li>
<li>Consumer satisfaction with the time interval to the first appointment  		  </li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 8. State of the Art Treatments</b></p>
<ul><li>Encouragement by provider to use self-help or consumer-run programs  		  </li>
<li>Medication management for individuals with schizophrenia </li>
<li>Family visits for children undergoing mental health treatments </li>
<li>Ambulatory follow-up within 7 and 30 days of discharge for mental  		  health </li>
<li>Ambulatory follow-up within 7 days of discharge for substance abuse  		  </li>
<li>Ambulatory follow-up after hospitalization for major depressive  		  disorder </li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 9. Improving the Outcomes of Care</b></p>
<ul><li>Rates of successful engagement in treatment for substance abuse</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Data Collection Strategies Required for Use of the  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p><i>Type of Data Collection</i></p>
<p>PERMS data are collected through mailed surveys of which are sent to  		Harvard Medical School for analysis.</p>
<p><i>From Whom Are Data Collected</i></p>
<p>Data are collected from member organizations of AMBHA who respond based  		on their administrative and clinical records. These members in turn collect  		data from their patients about satisfaction. AMBHA has over 48,000,000  		enrollees across 38 States.</p>
<p><i>Sampling and Oversampling Issues</i></p>
<p>The AMBHA Managed Behavioral Healthcare Quality and Access Survey was  		sent to all members; the patient population of these organizations accesses  		behavioral health services through from multiple sources: 26 percent are  		covered by employee assistance programs; 27 percent by managed  		indemnity/utilization review models; 27 percent by HMOs, and 20 percent by  		network-based models. There is no breakdown of Medicaid or commercial  		subpopulations. Special arrangements would be needed to identify and target or  		oversample people with disabilities in the patient populations of AMBHA members  		in order to get a sufficient sample to provide information specifically on this  		group.</p>
<p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of  		Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>The original measures used in PERMS were developed by the AMBHA Policy  		Subcommittee on Quality and Access Standards, which has seven working groups.  		The groups used research and their own knowledge to develop the indicators to  		measure quality and access. A contracted survey firm, Foster Higgins, reviews  		the questions for wording and structure "in accordance with accepted research  		standards." The measures which are part of other measurement sets (such as  		HEDIS<font>®</font>) are tested as part of their protocol. "The  		large sample size assures the statistical validity of the information and the  		ability to generalize information to the rest of the population," according to  		the Foster Higgins firm which conducted the survey.</p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Measures Have Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>Measures are considered by AMBHA to be appropriate for all patients of  		MBHOs including Medicaid populations.</p>
<p><i><b>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>Sections encapsulated by HEDIS<font>®</font> will have the  		support of NCQA. A list of AMBHA reports, studies, and publications and  		information on how to obtain these documents is available at their web page:  		<a href="http://www.ambha.org/">http://www.ambha.org</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Consultation Available to Support Use of Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>The availability of consultation for use of PERMS outside of AMBHA's  		membership is unclear, but presumably AMBHA staff would be available to their  		membership for assistance.</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>The results of the "report card" from PERMS 1.0 is available to the  		public and to health care purchasers. Results on PERMS 2.0 will also be  		available to the public upon publication.</p>
<p>Underlying all measurement of behavioral managed care performance is a  		"fundamental lack of consensus about what constitutes quality of care in the  		behavioral arena" (Gore, 1998); therefore, the use of the measure may be  		limited by differing opinions of the definition of good care in the behavioral  		health field. In addition, consultation would be needed with AMBHA and the  		experts with whom it works to develop an approach to the use of PERMS measures  		by sponsors other than behavioral health care organizations.</p>
<h4>3. Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) 2.0  		Surveys</h4>
<p><i><b>Name of Measurement System</b></i>: Consumer Assessment of Health  		Plans (CAHPS) Surveys</p>
<p><i><b>Author/Developer</b></i>: The CAHPS surveys, which are designed to  		gather information from people who have been in and used health plans about  		their experiences in the plans, and their ratings of the plans, are being  		developed by three teams of researchers. Here are the three organizations  		leading the teams, with the name of the Principal Investigator(s).</p>
<p>Paul Cleary, Ph.D., Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical  		School, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115-5899</p>

<p>James Lubalin, Ph.D., Research Triangle Institute (RTI), 1615 M Street,  		N.W., Suite 740, Washington, D.C. 20036-3209</p>
<p>The CAHPS project has been conducted with initial and primary support  		from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), with supplemental  		support from HCFA and private foundations. In addition to their support of the  		three CAHPS teams listed above, AHCPR has also created and is supporting a  		Survey User's Network (SUN network), whose role is to disseminate the CAHPS  		surveys and the reporting templates associated with these surveys, and to  		provide hands on support to those interested in sponsoring CAHPS surveying  		efforts. The organization operating the SUN network is Westat, Inc., 1650  		Research Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850, Primary Contact Person: Vasudha Narayanan.  		The CAHPS Hotline is (800) 492-9261</p>
<p>AHCPR's website has information on CAHPS. By accessing  		<a href="http://www.ahcpr.gov/qual">http://www.ahcpr.gov/qual</a> you can get both basic and detailed information on  		the project.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>CAHPS is a measurement system, rather than a measure. It is a collection  		of surveys that focus on different groups of health plan members. Most but not  		all CAHPS surveys are designed for use with people enrolled in a wide range of  		health insurance plans, including MCOs of various kinds, and FFS plans. CAHPS  		surveys have been fully developed that address the following populations:</p>
<ul><li>Adults who are privately insured (this is considered the "core" CAHPS  		  survey); </li>
<li>Children who are privately insured; </li>
<li>Adults who are eligible for Medicaid (with special emphasis on those  		  eligible under TANF, i.e., women with children);</li>
<li>Children who are eligible for Medicaid (again with special emphasis  		  on the TANF population);</li>
<li>Persons with chronic conditions and disabilities; and </li>
<li>Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs. </li>
</ul><p>Surveys are currently under development that address several other  		special populations or issues.</p>
<ul><li>Behavioral Health Services; </li>
<li>Children with Special Needs; </li>
<li>Medicaid SSI; </li>
<li>Disenrollment from Health Plans by Medicare beneficiaries; and </li>
<li>Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in traditional fee-for-service  		  Medicare. </li>
</ul><p>These surveys are not final, and certain items that appear in currently  		available drafts may not be present in the final version, or may be  		reworded.</p>
<p>CAHPS surveys address a number of domains of performance, highlighting  		those for which people in plans can be considered good sources of data. Under  		each domain covered by one or more CAHPS surveys, the kinds of questions  		relevant to that domain are listed. When a question is found only in one survey  		that is indicated.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b><font>IMPORTANT  				NOTE</font></b></p>
<p><font>It is not appropriate to use individual  				CAHPS items. Rather, the entire survey should be used. There are few if any  				items in CAHPS surveys that would be irrelevant to the measurement of  				performance of MCOs in serving the needs of people with  				disabilities.</font></p>

</ul><p><i><b>Data Collection Strategies Required for Use of the  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p><i>Type of Data Collection</i></p>
<p>The CAHPS 2.0 measurement system is a set of surveys. Each can be  		administered by either telephone or mail or a mix of the two methods. Testing  		has been conducted that indicates no differences in results between phone and  		mail administration. In order to administer a CAHPS survey it is essential to  		have a sampling frame of members of each health plan whose performance is being  		assessed. If a specialized survey is used, the sampling frame must be specific  		to the particular group of members for whom that survey is relevant. Note,  		however, that initial screening questions confirm the individual's membership  		in the plan.</p>
<p><i>From Whom Are Data Collected</i></p>
<p>CAHPS requires the collection of survey information from members of  		health plans. Typically, several health plans are surveyed because they are  		being offered either to a population (the privately insured; Medicaid  		eligibles) by a sponsor (a large employer or purchasing coalition; a State  		Medicaid agency) that decides to implement CAHPS. Sometimes however, CAHPS  		surveys are implemented for all or almost all health plans in a State or  		region. The survey(s) used depends on the member populations of interest to the  		sponsor. CAHPS surveys are intended to be administered by an independent  		organization, not by the health plans themselves. The goal is to generate data  		that will be viewed as credible, especially by the public and individuals  		making a health plan choice.</p>
<p><i>Sampling and Oversampling Issues</i></p>
<p>If a routine general population sample is taken of MCO members for  		purposes of a CAHPS survey, it is likely that the number of people with  		disabilities in the sample will not be sufficient to permit meaningful  		conclusions. It will be essential either to target data collection for members  		who are known (for example by their eligibility category) to have a disability,  		or to develop methods for "oversampling" the records of people with  		disabilities.</p>
<p><i>Risk Adjustment</i></p>
<p>Items have been included in all CAHPS surveys that gather information on  		the demographics and general health status of respondents. These data permit  		basic adjustments for differences between plans in such common risk-adjusters  		as age and overall self-reported health. Note that these are intended to be  		adjustments that might affect how people report on their experiences with  		plans.</p>
<p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of  		Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>CAHPS measures have been developed by nationally recognized experts on  		surveys of consumers' experiences in health plans and their ratings of health  		plans. They have been subjected to intensive cognitive testing with the  		populations for which they are intended, in order to ensure that all questions  		and response options are understood as intended. Surveys have also been  		field-tested with relevant populations and psychometric analyses have been  		conducted to assess their validity and reliability. In addition, surveys have  		been reviewed by external advisers and experts on such issues as the required  		educational level for reading surveys (a sixth grade level is the standard for  		all surveys), and have been subject to public comment. A number of  		demonstration sites have implemented CAHPS surveys in a context where formal  		evaluations are being conducted by the CAHPS research teams. Other "early  		adopters" have used the survey in the course of their normal performance  		measurement activities. State Medicaid agencies have been among both the  		demonstration sites and early adopters.</p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Measures Have Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>CAHPS surveys, as noted above, have been designed with specific  		populations in mind. All surveys include the "core" items; these items make up  		the survey of privately insured adults. Other surveys include supplemental item  		sets designed specifically to address the concerns and needs of particular  		populations. People eligible for Medicaid and people with chronic illnesses and  		disabilities were from the outset important survey populations for CAHPS. In  		addition, HCFA commissioned the development of a CAHPS Medicare HMO survey,  		which includes many items that are similar to those in the survey of people  		with chronic illnesses and disabilities. Surveys currently under development,  		in particular the survey of Children with Special Needs (being developed by  		Harvard) and the Survey of Medicaid SSI (being developed by RAND) are highly  		specific to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>One of the major strengths of the CAHPS surveys is that, with the  		exception of the Medicare survey, they are designed to permit comparisons of  		member experiences across different kinds of delivery systems. Thus, for  		example, the survey can be and has been used for people on Medicaid who are in  		FFS or PCCM systems. As with HEDIS<font>®</font> measures, HCFA  		has mandated the collection of the CAHPS Medicare HMO survey data for all  		Medicare risk-contract HMOs serving Medicare beneficiaries (including those  		eligible because of a disability). This will provide a useful basis for  		comparisons.</p>
<p><i><b>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>Extensive and detailed written documentation is available from the  		Survey Users Network (SUN Network) on each of the fully developed surveys.  		CAHPS surveys are currently undergoing revisions to reflect the integration of  		initial CAHPS surveys (Version 1.0) with the NCQA Member Satisfaction Survey.  		Version 2.0 of CAHPS surveys and a revised version of the "Survey and Reporting  		Kit" will be available in early 1999. In the meantime, however, written  		documentation remains available for earlier versions and much of the  		information is still valid. As with Version 1.0, demonstration sites and other  		early adopters will have access to the most current version of any fully  		developed CAHPS survey for implementation, and can get support from SUN.</p>
<p>In addition, CAHPS has developed methods and materials for reporting the  		results of CAHPS surveys to consumers, including print materials and an  		interactive computer program. Templates of these materials and documentation on  		how to adapt them are included in the "Survey and Reporting Kit." These  		educational materials have gone through the same process of testing and  		scrutiny as the surveys themselves. Certain reporting products are specific to  		the Medicaid population.</p>
<p><i><b>Consultation Available to Support Use of Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>The Survey Users Network contractor can provide consultation on the use  		of CAHPS surveys that are fully developed, and information on the status of  		surveys under development. CAHPS research teams that are taking the lead in  		development of newer surveys would be available for limited consultation on  		these surveys. In addition to providing technical assistance, the SUN  		contractor periodically brings together users to share what they have learned  		about the use of these surveys.</p>
<p><b><i>Limits on Use of the Measure</i></b>:</p>
<p>By definition, surveys of consumers are vehicles for gathering  		information that the members of plans and users of health care are in a  		particularly good position to assess and rate. Not all aspects of health plan  		performance can be assessed and rated by consumers. In addition, there are  		limits on the use of surveys by individuals who are cognitively impaired or  		mentally dysfunctional. Finally, while to date the Medicaid surveys have been  		translated into Spanish, most CAHPS surveys are available only in English.  		Resources are currently being sought to permit translation of a wider range of  		the surveys into other languages. It is likely that CAHPS research teams would  		be willing to work with sites interested in pursuing translation efforts.</p>
<h4>4. Oregon Health Plan Adult Satisfaction Survey of  		1997</h4>
<p><b><i>Name of Measurement System</i></b>: The Oregon Health Plan Adult  		Satisfaction Survey of 1997</p>

Contact: Judy  		Mohr-Peterson, Evaluation Research Coordinator, Office of Medical  		Assistance</p>
<p>This is an example of an instrument developed by a State in order to  		ascertain both the quality and performance of its managed care and  		fee-for-service models, from the perspective of Medicaid clients. The survey  		was developed by the Office of Medical Assistance Programs of the Oregon Human  		Resources Department in Salem, Oregon.</p>

</ul><p><i><b>Data Collection Strategies Required for Use of the  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p><i>Type of Data Collection</i></p>
<p>Survey forms are mailed by OMAP to Medicaid beneficiaries. The surveys  		are returned to OMAP and then electronically scanned.</p>
<p><i>From Whom Are Data Collected</i></p>
<p>Survey recipients are sampled at random from all Oregon Medicaid  		beneficiaries who have been enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan for a minimum of  		six months. The survey is available in Spanish, Russian, and Vietnamese.  		Potential respondents who speak other languages can use an AT&amp;T translation  		operator and complete a telephone survey. There is a Client Hot Line to respond  		to questions from respondents and a prepared list of questions and answers for  		those answering the hot line telephone.</p>
<p><i>Sampling and Oversampling Issues</i></p>
<p>In order to generate a sufficiently large sample of people with  		disabilities to ensure reliable estimates, this survey, like others presented  		in the Guide, would either need to be based on a targeted sampling frame, or  		would require the use of oversampling and/or a special set of screening  		questions to identify individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p><i>Risk Adjustment</i></p>
<p>A limited number of questions in the survey address health status of  		respondents; they are probably insufficient to support risk adjustment of  		responses. However, depending upon how the sampling frame for the survey was  		structured (e.g. by eligibility category) it is possible that responses could  		be calculated for different groups.</p>
<p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of  		Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>Information not available at this time.</p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Measures Have Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>The measure has been used with Medicaid and low-income populations who  		represent a cross-section of eligibility categories, including people with  		disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>The survey instrument, as well as sample letters used for mailing the  		instrument, and scripts used to address Frequently Asked Questions from survey  		recipients (i.e., beneficiaries of Medicaid and other governmentally support  		health insurance programs) are available from Judy Mohr-Peterson (see contact  		information above).</p>
<p><b><i>Consultation Available to Support Use of Measures</i></b>:</p>
<p>Oregon has provided copies of the measure to several other State  		Medicaid agencies and has provided informal consultation on its use.</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>The primary limitation on the measure is that some questions, for  		example those on Exceptional Needs Care Coordinators, might not be appropriate  		for settings in which such resources are not required or available. However, it  		may be possible either to eliminate those questions or replace them with items  		that are more appropriate to a particular context.</p>
<h4>5. Picker Institute Patient Surveys</h4>
<p><i><b>Name of Measurement System</b></i>: Picker Institute Surveys of  		Adult Medical/Surgical Hospital Stays; Rehabilitation Programs; and Home Care  		Services</p>
<p><i><b>Author/Developer</b></i>: The Picker Institute, 1295 Boylston  		Street, Suite 100, Boston, MA 02215, Phone (617)667-8484. Contact: Ms. JoAnne  		Leamey, Marketing Manager</p>
<p>The Picker Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to  		increasing the extent to which health care services are patient-centered. They  		have developed a number of patient surveys that focus on specific aspects of  		health care, including three that are of particular relevance to the needs of  		people with disabilities:</p>
<ul><li>A survey of adult patients who have recently utilized inpatient  		  hospital services in a medical or surgical ward (including questions that  		  address admission through an emergency room if that occurred);</li>
<li>A survey of patients who have recently utilized a rehabilitation  		  program; and </li>
<li>A survey of patients who have recently utilized home care services.  		  </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>The Picker Institute surveys address several domains of performance. We  		indicate each domain, and give examples of specific items covered in one or  		more surveys. When an issue is addressed in only one survey, this is so  		indicated. Note that in the Picker surveys, questions are often directed to the  		patient's experience with a particular kind of provider; thus several issues  		are addressed with respect to different providers (e.g., doctors, nurses,  		social workers, home health aides etc.)</p>
<p><b>Domain 2. Providing Access to Needed Services</b></p>

<li>Patient ratings of home care (Home Care Survey) </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Data Collection Strategies Required for Use of the  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p><i>Type of Data Collection</i></p>
<p>The Picker Institute instruments are surveys of patients. They are  		administered by mail.</p>
<p><i>From Whom Are Data Collected</i></p>
<p>Data are collected from individuals who have been identified as having  		used a particular kind of facility or service, within a specified time period.  		Data are typically collected by The Picker Institute itself, under contract  		with health care organizations, MCOs, employers and business or purchaser  		coalitions.</p>
<p><i>Sampling and Oversampling Issues</i></p>
<p>The key sampling issue for Picker Institute Surveys is the ability to  		identify from records individuals who have used particular services and to  		contact a random sample from this list. Valid records would need to be provided  		either by the MCO or by the health care facilities under contract with the MCO.  		Normally, the surveys would not be conducted only for people with disabilities,  		although if information were available as to disability status as well as use  		of services, this could be done. Sample size will, as in all cases, be an  		issue. On the other hand, it is more likely that a sizable portion of people  		using rehabilitation and home care services would have some kind of  		disability.</p>
<p><i>Risk Adjustment</i></p>
<p>Information is collected in the surveys on demographic characteristics  		and health status that could be used for risk adjustment purposes.</p>
<p><b><i>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of  		Measures</i></b>:</p>
<p>Picker Institute measures are developed using a rigorous and extended  		process. The process typically begins with focus groups of patients who have  		used the service in question, to identify what is of greatest interest and  		importance to them. Surveys are usually cognitively tested prior to field  		testing. Psychometric analyses are conducted on the reliability, validity and  		discriminate ability of the surveys. As data are collected using a particular  		survey, these data are analyzed and used to continue psychometric analysis and  		survey refinement.</p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Measures Have Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>Picker Institute surveys have been used in a wide range of health care  		organizations and MCOs. Surveys are not targeted to patients on the basis of  		their source of insurance, but rather on their use of the facility in question.  		The surveys presented here appear to be relevant to the needs and concerns of  		people with disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of  		Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>The Adult Inpatient and Rehabilitation surveys are not in the public  		domain; they are copyrighted and can only be used with permission. The Home  		Care survey is in the public domain. The Picker Institute has written  		documentation of the psychometric analyses conducted on their surveys; some  		articles have also appeared in the academic literature.</p>
<p><i><b>Consultation Available to Support Use of Measures</b></i>:</p>
<p>As noted earlier, The Picker Institute typically administers the surveys  		themselves for a variety of clients. This would involve a charge to be  		negotiated with the client.</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Measure</b></i>:</p>
<p>The primary limitation on the use of these surveys measure is that two  		of the three are not in the public domain; however, Picker staff are extremely  		interested in the widespread use of their surveys and in issues significant to  		people with disabilities. Translations of the instruments would be required if  		non-English speaking populations were involved.</p>
<h2><a name="five" id="five">V. CRITERIA SETS FOR ASSESSING MANAGED CARE  		ORGANIZATIONS</a></h2>
<p>This Chapter presents work that has been done to identify structural  		characteristics and procedures of MCOs that are viewed as highly significant to  		their capacity to serve the needs of people with disabilities. By themselves,  		structural characteristics can be seen as <b>criteria</b> for assessing MCOs,  		rather than as <b>measures</b>. They indicate what should be present, but do  		not necessarily provide a way to find out if the characteristic is present. The  		great advantage of structural criteria is that they can be used prospectively,  		i.e., before an MCO begins to serve people with disabilities. The disadvantage  		is that the existence of a structure does not guarantee its appropriate use.  		Structures are necessary, but not sufficient, to the delivery of good care.  		</p>
<p>Another advantage of the criteria sets in this Chapter is that several  		were developed with the health care needs and concerns of people with  		disabilities specifically in mind. The same kind of information on criteria  		sets is offered as that presented in <a href="#four">Chapter Four</a> on  		measures and measurement systems. For example, criteria are organized using the  		framework of domains of MCO performance presented in <a href="#three">Chapter  		Three</a>. In many cases, the complete criteria set goes beyond the domains of  		performance we have laid out in this Resource Guide. Readers are therefore  		encouraged to go to the complete sets since there may be additional criteria  		they would want to apply.</p>
<p>How can you use structural criteria sets in a performance measurement  		system? How can you find out whether a characteristic is in place? There are  		several options to consider:</p>
<ul><li>In many cases, structural characteristics and criteria can become  		  contract specifications. Indeed, one criteria set we present was developed as a  		  set of specifications for Medicaid MCO contracts. </li>
<li>MCOs can be asked to report whether these characteristics are in fact  		  present, and to provide documentary evidence of their presence, such as  		  contracts with providers; provider listings; memoranda of understanding; and  		  procedure manuals. </li>
<li>Visits can be made and interviews conducted with MCO staff to further  		  probe these characteristics, to answer questions raised by descriptions or  		  documentation, and to gather information from multiple individuals who would be  		  knowledgeable about a given aspect of the MCO's functioning. Such visits and  		  interviews could also be conducted by MCO staff with provider organizations,  		  since MCOs want to know the structural characteristics of those in their  		  network.</li>
</ul><p>Structural criteria often do not specify a clear standard. For example,  		while an MCO needs sufficient numbers of the right kind of providers in order  		to serve a patient population, there are few if any research-based standards  		about how many of what mix of providers is actually sufficient. The Chapter  		does not suggest such standards. It may be more appropriate for a group of  		people representing the perspectives of multiple constituencies to work to  		develop consensus on such standards.</p>
<h3>A. Quality Improvement System for Managed Care  		(QISMC)</h3>
<p>The intent of QISMC is to serve as a system for "assuring that managed  		care organizations contracting with Medicare and Medicaid protect and improve  		the health and satisfaction of enrolled beneficiaries." HCFA and State Medicaid  		agencies are expected to use QISMC as a uniform set of quality standards for  		assessing Medicaid and Medicare contractors. Given the health plan performance  		and quality requirements embodied in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA), it is  		likely that the final version of QISMC will become mandatory for Medicare  		contracts and optional for state Medicaid contracts. States opting to use QISMC  		in their Medicaid contracting will likely meet the BBA requirements.</p>
<p>QISMC is described in a 132-page document divided into four parts:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>A description of a framework for understanding QISMC requirements,  			 including a background on the origins and goals of the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of standards that each organization must meet under QISMC,  			 grouped under four domains:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>quality assessment and performance improvement; </p>

<li>
<p>enrollee rights; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health services management; and </p>

<p>NASHP is a non-profit multidisciplinary forum of and for State health  		policy leaders from the executive and legislative branches. Under contract from  		HCFA, NASHP began development of QISMC in 1996 and released a draft version for  		public comment in January 1997. Numerous comments were received, and panels of  		representatives of plans, providers, regulators and advocates were convened. A  		second round of public comments on the January 1997 draft was initiated by HCFA  		in May 1998. Based on the comments received on this draft in both rounds, and  		on its own internal review, HCFA will revise the system and issue it in final  		form. Readers are advised to contact HCFA at the above address for information  		regarding the final content of the system.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>We have selected the criteria that are most representative of our  		domains. QISMC contains many more provisions relating to a broad range of  		health care and delivery issues.</p>
<p><b>Domain 1. Creating a System with the Right Capacities</b></p>
<ul><li>Projects conducted under the organization's QAPI [Quality  		  Assurance/Performance Improvement] program address and achieve improvement in  		  major focus areas of clinical and non-clinical services. Clinical focus areas  		  applicable to Medicaid enrollees include the following:
<ul><li>chronic diseases affecting elderly or disabled Medicaid  				enrollees; </li>
<li>care of Medicaid enrollees residing in long-term care facilities;  				</li>
<li>care of Medicaid enrollees who are unusually dependent on others  				or on devices but who do not reside in long-term care facilities;</li>
<li>mental health treatment for Medicaid enrollees; </li>
<li>substance abuse treatment for Medicaid enrollees; and </li>
<li>care of Medicaid enrollees who are developmentally disabled.  				</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The organization maintains and monitors a network of providers,  		  supported by written arrangements, that is sufficient to provide timely access  		  to covered services.
<ul><li>A new contractor, or an established contractor seeking an  				expansion of its service area, demonstrates that the numbers and types of  				providers available to enrollees are sufficient to meet anticipated needs of  				the population and area to be served.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each physician or other individual practitioner, including each  		  practitioner within a contracting group who provides services to the  		  organization's enrollees, the process includes:
<ul><li>Formal selection and retention criteria that do not discriminate  				against practitioners who serve high-risk populations or who specialize in the  				treatment of costly conditions. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 2. Providing Access to Needed Services</b></p>
<ul><li>The organization assures that services are accessible to all  		  enrollees, including those with limited English proficiency or reading skills,  		  with diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and with physical and mental  		  disabilities.</li>
<li>Enrollee information is
<ul><li>readable and easily understood; </li>
<li>available in the language(s) of the major population groups  				served and, as needed, in alternative formats for the visually impaired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An established contractor establishes standards for timeliness of  		  access to care and member services that meet or exceed such standards as may be  		  established by HCFA or the State Medicaid agency, continuously monitors the  		  extent to which it meets these standards, and takes corrective action as  		  necessary.</li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 3. Supporting Member Involvement in Decision Making and System  		Improvement</b></p>
<ul><li>The QAPI program provides opportunities for enrollees to participate  		  in the selection ofproject topics and the formulation of project goals.</li>
<li>Each enrollee has a right
<ul><li>to choose providers from among those affiliated with the  				organization
<ul><li>Each enrollee may select his or her primary care provider  					 from among those accepting new Medicare or Medicaid enrollees;</li>
<li>Each enrollee may refuse care from specific practitioners or  					 providers. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>to participate in decision-making regarding his or her health  				care
<ul><li>The organization provides for the enrollee's representative  					 to facilitate care or treatment decisions when the enrollee is unable to do so.  					 </li>
<li>The organization provides for enrollee or representative  					 involvement in decisions to withhold resuscitative service, or to forgo or  					 withdraw life-sustaining treatment, and complies with requirements of Federal  					 and State law with respect to advance directives. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>to receive information on available treatment options or  				alternative courses of care; </li>
<li>to have access to his or her medical records in accordance with  				applicable Federal and State laws</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 4. Resolving Problems and Concerns</b></p>
<ul><li>Each enrollee has a right
<ul><li>to obtain a prompt resolution, through established procedures, of  				issues raised by the enrollee, including complaints or grievances and issues  				relating to authorization, coverage, or payment of services. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>The organization has a system for resolving issues raised by  		  enrollees, including complaints or grievances; issues relating to authorization  		  of, coverage of, or payment for services; and, in the case of Medicare  		  enrollees, issues relating to a discontinuation of a service. [NOTE: references  		  to an enrollee in these standards include reference to an enrollee's  		  representative.] </li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 6. Using Preventive Services to Keep Members Healthy and  		Functioning</b></p>
<ul><li>The organization conducts a quality assessment and performance  		  improvement (QAPI) that achieves, through ongoing measurement and intervention,  		  demonstrable and sustained improvement in significant aspects of clinical care  		  and non-clinical services that can be expected to affect enrollee health  		  status, functional status, and satisfaction.</li>
<li>[QAPI includes] measures to assure that enrollees are informed of  		  specific health care needs that require follow-up and receive, as appropriate,  		  training in self-care and other measures enrollees may take to promote their  		  own health.</li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 7. Coordinating and Integrating Medical and Non-Medical  		Services</b></p>
<ul><li>The organization promotes continuity of care and integration of  		  services through:
<ul><li>Programs for coordination of care, including:
<ul><li>Identification of enrollees with complex needs and  					 development of services and programs to assist them in meeting those  					 needs;</li>
<li>Coordination of medical care, mental health services and  					 substance abuse services, and social services and community resources.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 8. State of the Art Treatments</b></p>
<ul><li>The organization adopts and disseminates practice guidelines or  		  criteria for the provision of specific services.
<ul><li>Guidelines are based on reasonable medical evidence or a  				consensus of relevant practitioners, are developed in consultation with  				affiliated providers, and are reviewed and updated periodically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The organization implements written policies and procedures for  		  evaluating new medical technologies and new uses of existing technologies.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of the Criteria  		Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>These standards were developed by NASHP utilizing its recognized  		expertise in analyzing the myriad roles and responsibilities of States as  		purchasers, regulators, and partners of health plans, particularly as these  		roles have become increasingly complex with the growth of managed care. A  		broad-based consensus development process that incorporated the perspectives of  		diverse stakeholders was employed to bring both depth and quality to QISMC.  		HCFA is continuing this approach as each of the standards are "vetted" during  		its own public comment and review period. The fact that HCFA intends for QISMC  		to become a required feature of Medicare contracting and that the agency highly  		recommends it as an option for State Medicaid contracting is evidence of its  		confidence in the utility and reliability of the system.</p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Criteria Set Has Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>QISMC was developed to apply across the needs of all Medicare and  		Medicaid managed care enrollees.</p>
<p><b><i>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of Criteria  		Set</i></b>:</p>
<p>The January 1997 version of QISMC and a summary of public comments and  		proceedings from the April 1998 meeting of the Quality of Care panel are  		available free of charge as WordPerfect 6.1<font>©</font>  		self-extracting zip file at HCFA's website, the address of which is  		<a href="http://www.hcfa.gov/quality/qlty-3e.htm">http://www.hcfa.gov/quality/qlty-3e.htm</a>. When a final version of QISMC is  		released by HCFA, it will also be available on the website and through the  		contact person identified above. </p>
<p><i><b>Consultation Available to Support Use of Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>NASHP staff are available to provide consultation and technical  		assistance to State-level government officials regarding the history and  		development of QISMC free of charge. Other users are advised to contact NASHP  		regarding their policies on rates for consulting. Inquiries to HCFA should be  		directed to Brian Agnew of that office for appropriate guidance on the scope  		and cost of consultation and technical assistance.</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>Among the comments received during the April 1998 Quality of Care  		meeting were: (1) "Plans and some other commenters noted that plans can't  		identify some of the populations referred to, such as the developmentally  		disabled or persons dependent on assistance or devices; even encounter data  		might not identify these enrollees;" and (2) "Advocates wanted stronger  		requirements in [the area of coordination]. There was agreement to add  		'identification <i>and assessment</i>' to the standard [3.2.2]. There was a  		wider consensus that guidelines should reflect the need for screening enrollees  		to determine who has complex needs and may require an assessment, and to better  		define the term 'complex needs.'"<font><a href="#note8">8</a></font>  		HCFA has taken these, as well as all other comments, under advisement as it  		completes the final version of QISMC. Readers interested in how it may  		ultimately reflect the needs of people with disabilities should contact HCFA  		for the most up-to-date information.</p>
<h3>B. Key Indicators from the 1997 Santa Fe Summit on  		Behavioral Health</h3>
<p>In 1997 the American College of Mental Health Administration (ACMHA)  		held a "Summit" in Santa Fe, New Mexico as the final process of consensus  		development on core values and indicators that should guide the assessment of  		behavioral health programs. Their final report presents these core values and  		indicators, and also, unlike other criteria sets in this Chapter, presents  		information on potential approaches to measurement for these indicators. Since  		measurement strategies have not been fully developed for all indicators,  		however, it is more appropriate at this time to present them as a criteria set.  		Work is ongoing, however, to move these indicators closer to the measurement  		process.</p>
<p><i><b>Name of Criteria Set</b></i>: Key Indicators from the 1997 Santa  		Fe Summit on Behavioral Health </p>
<p><i><b>Author/Developer</b></i>: The indicators are clearly the result of  		the work of multiple individuals and their organizations. However, the final  		report was produced by The American College of Mental Health Administrators,  		7625 West Hutchinson Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15218-1248, Phone (412) 244-0670.  		Contact: Lawrence Heller, Ph.D., Executive Director</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>The Summit Final Report categorizes its indicators into four domains:  		Outcomes, Process, Access and Structure. We have reorganized these into the  		domains used in the framework presented in this Guide.<font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></p>
<p><b>Domain 1. Creating a System with the Right Capacities</b></p>
<ul><li>The organization's structure is consistent with the delivery of  		  mental and addictive disorder treatment, with effective consumer and  		  professional representation in policy making. </li>
<li>Staffing levels are appropriate for delivery of the array of services  		  and provide for meeting the diverse needs of the individuals served, including  		  linguistic and cultural competence. </li>
<li>Data on clients are secure, available only to those who need to know.  		  </li>
<li>There is a single, fixed point of responsibility for each client.  		  </li>
<li>There is a quality assurance system in place to examine adverse  		  clinical events. </li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 2. Providing Access to Needed Services</b></p>
<ul><li>Service denials, terminations or refusals are assessed. </li>
<li>Penetration (i.e. utilization) rates demonstrate benchmarked levels  		  of service delivery to like populations. </li>
<li>Access to a full range of services is demonstrable. </li>
<li>Children and their families receive the appropriate services that  		  they need, when they need them.</li>
<li>Consumer experiences of treatment (both positive and negative) are  		  assessed on dimensions of appropriateness, timeliness and sensitivity of  		  services delivered.</li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 3. Supporting Member Involvement in Decision Making and System  		Improvement</b></p>
<ul><li>Consumers actively participate in decisions concerning their  		  treatment. </li>
<li>Consumers receive inpatient mental health services in a voluntary,  		  non-coercive manner. </li>
<li>Consumers receive adequate information to make informed choices.  		  </li>
<li>Consumers and their families are educated about their rights, the  		  array of services available to them and likely outcomes of treatment  		  interventions. </li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 4. Resolving Problems and Concerns</b></p>
<ul><li>Consumer rights are clearly defined and procedures for resolution of  		  complaints and grievances are in place and easy to use.</li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 7. Coordinating and Integrating Medical and Non-Medical  		Services</b></p>
<ul><li>The system of care assumes responsibility for continuous and  		  integrated care appropriate to the needs of families and children.</li>
<li>There are appropriate linkages to other service systems with which  		  consumers need to interact.</li>
<li>There is continuity of care within the organization and effective  		  integration with external caregiving systems.</li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 8. State of the Art Treatments</b></p>
<ul><li>Consumers who use inpatient services (i.e., 24-hour,  		  medically-supervised services for a primary mental or substance abuse  		  diagnosis) receive face-to-face follow-up care within seven days of  		  discharge.</li>
<li>Consumers with mental health and addictive disorders are engaged in  		  treatment (i.e., continue in treatment).</li>
<li>Children and their families are being assessed for and offered  		  services at appropriate levels (i.e., with respect to use of out-of-home or  		  restrictive environments).</li>
</ul><p><b>Domain 9. Improving the Outcomes of Care</b></p>
<p>The Summit indicators are especially useful with respect to their  		specification of outcome criteria. They have developed three for all adults,  		including those with serious and persistent disorders, and five relevant only  		for adults with serious and persistent disorders:</p>
<p><i>Indicators for All Adults</i></p>
<ul><li>Adults reside in their own homes or living arrangements of their own  		  choosing. </li>
<li>Adults are working (defined to include education, job training,  		  volunteer work). </li>
<li>Adults have good physical health and report good mental health  		  (psychological well-being). </li>
</ul><p><i>Indicators for Adults with Serious and Persistent Disorders Only  		</i></p>
<ul><li>Adults with serious and persistent mental or chemical dependency  		  disorders report feeling safe.</li>
<li>Adults with serious and persistent mental or chemical dependency  		  disorders avoid trouble with the law.</li>
<li>Adults with serious and persistent mental or chemical dependency  		  disorders maintain a social support network. </li>
<li>Adults with serious and persistent mental or chemical dependency  		  disorders are able to manage their daily lives.</li>
<li>Adults with serious and persistent mental or chemical dependency  		  disorders report a positive quality of life.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of the Criteria  		Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>The Summit Indicators were developed through extended discussions of  		multiple working groups. Participants in these groups included mental health  		and substance abuse professionals working in both private and public sector  		organizations; academic experts in these field; and some representatives of  		people with mental health and substance abuse diagnoses. The process used is  		similar to the consensus development process often used within the National  		Institutes of Health with respect to the appropriateness of a particular  		approach to a medical intervention, with this difference, that the values and  		expectations of participants in the process, as well as their expertise and  		experience, are brought to bear in the discussions.</p>
<p><i><b>Populations and Settings in Which Criteria Set Has Been/Could Be  		Used</b></i>:</p>
<p>The criteria were designed for use in assessing the performance of  		behavioral health care organizations, and could be applied to the performance  		of MCOs providing behavioral health services to their members.</p>
<p><i><b>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of Criteria  		Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>The complete Final Report on the Santa Fe Summit, entitled <i>Preserving  		Quality and Value in the Managed Care Equation</i> is available from ACMHA at  		the address noted above. Additional materials which go into greater detail on  		indicators and on measures related to these indicators may also be available  		from the organization and its collaborators.</p>
<p><i><b>Consultation Available to Support Use of Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>ACMHA indicates that it would be available to discuss the report with  		interested parties.</p>
<p><i><b>Limits on Use of the Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>Some of the indicators are at a very high level of generality; others  		are more specific and would be easier to use as a basis of assessments. It is  		important to note, however, that this effort is ongoing, in particular with  		respect to the dimension of identifying and coming to consensus on appropriate  		measures for the indicators.</p>
<h3>C. National Health Law Program (NHeLP) Advocacy  		Checklist for People With Disabilities</h3>
<p>The NheLP Advocacy Checklist was originally developed as a guide for  		advocates to use in reviewing the specifications of contracts between State  		Medicaid agencies and MCOs. While contract specifications are one approach to  		determine whether or not structural characteristics are in place, the NHeLP  		Advocacy Checklist can be viewed as a set of criteria that can be assessed  		using other methods besides inclusion in contracts.</p>
<p><i><b>Name of Criteria Set</b></i>: National Health Law Program (NHeLP)  		Advocacy Checklist for People with Disabilities</p>
<p><i><b>Author/Developer</b></i>: National Health Law Program (Main Los  		Angeles Office), 2639 South La Cienaga Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90034, Phone  		(310)204-6010, E-mail <a href="mailto:nhelp@healthlaw.org">nhelp@healthlaw.org</a>, Internet Website  		<a href="http://www.healthlaw.org/">http://www.healthlaw.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The National Health Law Program, with offices in Los Angeles and  		Washington, D.C., is a non-profit organization that has served as a resource  		center for legal services programs and other advocates for the health care  		needs of low-income people. The Advocacy Checklist was originally developed, as  		its title suggests, for use by advocates for people with disabilities. However,  		the criteria can be used not only by such individuals and organizations, but by  		State Medicaid agencies, MCOs and health care organizations and  		professionals.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains of Performance Addressed by the Criteria Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>The NHeLP Advocacy Checklist includes criteria that go well beyond the  		domains of performance included in this Resource Guide. For example, they  		address marketing issues, the use of third-party organizations to enroll  		Medicaid eligibles in MCOs, public disclosure issues, etc. We present only  		those criteria and standards that are relevant to the domains of performance we  		have articulated. Readers are advised to review the entire checklist.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases a criterion incorporates a specific standard,  		e.g., that face-to-face health assessments be provided with 60 days of  		enrollment.</p>

</ul><p><i><b>Evidence to Support Validity and Reliability of the Criteria  		Set</b></i>:</p>
<p>These criteria are based on NHeLP's experience in providing advocacy to  		people with disabilities, as well as other people on Medicaid. In some cases,  		the criteria and standards are based on research evidence, but in most cases  		the criteria have what could be called "face validity," i.e. those with  		concerns about how health services are provided to persons with disabilities  		believe that the conditions are necessary to the delivery of good care. It is  		important to note that people concerned about people with disabilities may  		disagree about the appropriateness of certain criteria. These criteria reflect,  		as do all performance measures, values and expectations, which may differ from  		person to person.</p>
<p><b><i>Populations and Settings in Which Criteria Set Has Been/Could Be  		Used</i></b>:</p>
<p>This criteria set was developed specifically to address the needs of  		Medicaid eligible people with disabilities, including both adults and  		children.</p>
<p><b><i>Written Documentation Available to Support Use of Criteria  		Set</i></b>:</p>
<p>The complete Advocacy Checklist is available from NHeLP's Website, the  		address of which is <a href="http://www.healthlaw.org/checklist-disabilities">http://www.healthlaw.org/checklist-disabilities</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Consultation Available to Support Use of Criteria Set</i></b>:</p>
<p>NheLP staff would be available to discuss the checklist and its  		development, but are not experts in the translation of criteria into formal  		measures.</p>
<p><b><i>Limits on Use of the Criteria Set</i></b>:</p>
<p>As noted above, these criteria do not represent fully developed  		measures. Additional work is needed to develop methods for collecting data to  		determine if the criteria are being met. In addition, many criteria represent  		necessary but not sufficient conditions for high performance, and must be  		supplemented by the use of other performance measures. Finally, work will be  		needed to develop consensus on which criteria are appropriate in a given  		context, and where necessary to specify standards as well as criteria.</p>

<h2><a name="appendix" id="appendix">APPENDIX</a>: COLLECTING DATA FOR A PARTICULAR  		PERFORMANCE MEASURE: AN EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>This example illustrates in some detail the process, resources and  		issues in collecting data for a particular performance measure, the HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 childhood immunization measure. These data could  		only be produced from claims/encounter data if:</p>
<ul><li>All children who turn 24-months-of-age during the reporting period  		  were continuously enrolled from date of birth through their second birthday;  		  AND</li>
<li>All children received their immunizations from their MCO primary care  		  physician or another MCO practitioner; AND</li>
<li>The MCO practitioner correctly coded the specific immunization given  		  on the claim/encounter form, regardless of whether the practitioner was  		  directly compensated for the immunization and the serum.</li>
</ul><p>However, recognizing that Medicaid children may have short periods of  		enrollment, the HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 specifications require  		that for a Medicaid child to be included in the at-risk population, the child  		need only be enrolled for 11 out of 12 months in the second year of life. Thus,  		the child may not have received any immunizations through the MCO in the first  		year of life and the MCO may not have claims/encounter data for these services.  		Additionally, even while enrolled in the MCO, the child may have received  		immunizations through other providers, such as the health department, at  		immunization health fairs, in a Head Start program, etc. Again, the MCO would  		not have claims/encounter data. Lastly, the MCO may have difficulty getting  		accurate, detailed claims/encounter information from its practitioners if it  		does not reimburse its practitioners on a fee-for-service basis for these  		services. For example, if practitioners receive free vaccine through the health  		department, they only bill the MCO for administration of the vaccine and may  		not be concerned about using the correct vaccine code when they are receiving a  		standard fee for administration of the vaccine. Similarly, primary care  		physicians who are paid on a capitation basis may not be highly motivated to  		provide timely and accurate immunization encounter data since the data are not  		directly related to reimbursement.</p>
<p>Consequently, almost all MCOs that report the HEDIS<font>®</font> 3.0 childhood immunization measures must use a  		combination of claims/encounter data and review of medical records to collect  		the data. Medical record review is costly because it is labor-intensive,  		requires knowledgeable data abstractors, and involves data entry. In sum,  		collecting data on performance measures is dependent on how MCOs are organized,  		and on the sophistication and reach of their management and clinical  		information systems. States may require, through contract specifications for  		example, that specific data be provided by MCOs in a certain form. However, it  		is important that all participants in performance measurement systems be  		realistic about whether resources are available to collect data that inspire  		confidence.</p>
