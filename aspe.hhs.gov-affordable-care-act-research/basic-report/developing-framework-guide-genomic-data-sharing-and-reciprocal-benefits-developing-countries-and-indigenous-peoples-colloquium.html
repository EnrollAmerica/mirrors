<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ONeill Institute for National and Global Health Law invited twelve thought leaders with extensive experience in the conduct of biomedical research among indigenous peoples and developing countries to a colloquium at Georgetown University on January 7-8, 2009. The colloquium addressed a basic question: as genomic science develops across the world, how can the global community assure that indigenous nations and developing countries reciprocally benefit from their contributions to research? We invited thought leaders with broad experience with biomedical science research, public health, indigenous peoples and developing nations. On Day One of the colloquium, each thought leader gave a fifteen minute talk outlining key points on the colloquiums basic question based on their individual experiences (see schedule and summary of individual contributions). Each thought leader spoke during one of three sessions, namely Hearing Indigenous Perspectives, Hearing the Perspectives of Developing Countries and Implications for Genomics and Healthcare. Group discussion of the talks occurred at the end of each specific section as well as the end of the day. Day Two opened the floor entirely for group discussion of the issues and next steps. Members of the ONeill Personalized Medicine Workgroup observed the presentations and contributed to general discussion. This report offers a thematic analysis of the issues and recommendations of the two days work.</p>

<h3>Results of the Colloquium</h3>
<p>            From the perspective of indigenous peoples and developing countries, the promises and perils of genomic science appear against a backdrop of global health disparity and political vulnerability.  These conditions pose a dilemma for many communities when attempting to decide about participating in genomic research or any other biomedical research.  Genomic research offers the possibility of improved technologies for managing the acute and chronic diseases that plague their members.  Yet, the history of particularly biomedical research among people in indigenous and developing nations offers many examples of unethical practice, misuse of data and failed promises.  This dilemma creates risks for communities who decide either to participate or not to participate in genomic science research. Like communities themselves, participants in the colloquium disagreed about the relative importance of the horns of the dilemma.  Some argued that the history of poor scientific practice justifies refusal to join genomic research projects.  Others argued that disease poses such great threats to the well-being of people in indigenous communities and developing nations that not participating in genomic research risks irrevocable harm.  All agreed, however, that the dilemma potentially diminishes if the scientific community engages indigenous and developing communities in new ways - ways that employ genomic research as one tool for community development as well as a source of scientific information.  Adopting these new ways would also improve biomedical science by including continuous community engagement and progressive community empowerment as components of “rigorous scientific research”.  </p>
<h3>The Dilemma</h3>
<p>            Indigenous nations and developing countries share a history of underdevelopment and colonial exploitation that has often left their peoples politically and economically marginalized.  People in these communities suffer disproportionately from both infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diarrhea and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease.  Personalized medicine promises dramatic improvements in treatment for these illnesses through healthcare tailored to the genotype of individual patients.  Yet, genomic science has just begun to collect the data necessary to support personalized medicine and requires some degree of participation by all the world’s people to succeed in its objectives, including people in indigenous and developing nations.  The colloquium posed the question of how to assure that people in indigenous and developing nations realize benefit from their participation in genomic research. </p>
<p>            Spokespersons from indigenous communities asserted, however, that genomic investigators should not presume that all communities would agree to participate in the research.  Indeed, indigenous organizations such as the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples and many indigenous communities have already decided not to participate in genomic research citing negative experiences with earlier projects such as the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), the National Geographic Genographic Project, and others (see also the background paper for the colloquium).   From this perspective, the struggle of indigenous peoples worldwide to achieve recognition of their sovereignty and rights of self-determination informs the discussion about biomedical research, particularly when scientific investigators act in untruthful, clandestine and other unethical ways.  Insisting that investigators respect the sovereignty of indigenous nations helps protect community members from the social disruption, cultural theft and shame that potentially follow from scientific abuse. </p>
<p><strong>Select examples of scientific misconduct in genomics research</strong></p>
<ul><li>Arizona Court of Appeals. Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents. (Arizona Court of Appeals, 2008)</li>
<li>Tribe blasts 'exploitation' of blood samples. (Dalton, 2002)</li>
<li>Safari Research in Mexico (Seguin et al., 2008)</li>
</ul><p>Others, particularly spokespersons for developing countries, acknowledged the importance of sovereignty and colonial history but expressed great concern that people from their communities could easily miss benefitting from advances in personalized medicine as they had missed so many other technological “revolutions”.  Indeed, a “genomic gap” already exists between Africa and the developed world that may be impossible to close.  The global community faces a challenge to not let Africa fall farther behind in genomic science.  Mexico offers an important case study because, as a developing country with many indigenous communities, it has faced the questions of scientific practice and health disparity in the design and implementation of its National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) (Seguin B., et al, 2008). </p>
<h3>Resolving the dilemma</h3>
<p>            As the colloquium participants discussed these points and evaluated their implications for genomic science and healthcare, conversation began to focus on fundamental importance of engaging indigenous and developing communities in the discussion about and process of genomic research.  Four topics emerged from the discussion, including:</p>
<ul><li>consulting with communities</li>
<li>complexities of consent</li>
<li>training members of local communities in science and healthcare, and</li>
<li>training scientists in how to work with indigenous and developing communities. </li>
</ul><p>The urgent necessity of training members of indigenous and developing communities to function as interlocutors between the scientific and local communities ran as a common thread through the discussion about each of these topics.  This approach eventually identified genomics research as a potential entry point into the social development of local communities in indigenous nations and developing countries. </p>
<p>    <em>Consulting with local communities</em>:  Canadian case law requires consultation with indigenous peoples about issues involving them and their well-being.  It further requires providing good reasons for not following their advice.  The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has engaged in extended consultations and deliberations with Canadian indigenous communities to develop guidelines that protect indigenous participants and promote research (CIHR, 2007).  Such consultations acknowledge the basic sovereignty and right of self-determination of indigenous peoples as expressed in documents such as the General Assembly Resolution 61/295, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN Declaration). Consultation marks a first step in but does not necessarily imply consent to participate in research.</p>
<div><strong>Consulting with Indigenous Canadians about Research</strong>
<ul><li>CIHR established the Aboriginal Ethics Working Group (AEWG) in March 2004 as part of a broader national endeavor to develop the “Guidelines for Health Research Involving Aboriginal People”. The AEWG met to deliberate, discuss and draft the Guidelines over the course of two years. A series of commissioned background papers and contributions from the Aboriginal Capacity and Developmental Research Environments (ACADRE) network informed the deliberations of the AEWG.</li>
<li>The ACADRE network is a unique university-based resource with links to academic research communities and partnerships with regional First Nation, Inuit and Métis communities. Early ACADRE activities focused on work with communities to translate traditional values and ethics into guidance for health researchers.</li>
<li>The CIHR Ethics Office along with the National Council on Ethics in Human Research conducted workshops and consultations with Aboriginal communities, researchers and members of research ethics boards to obtain feedback on the draft Guidelines. CIHR and its partners electronically posted the document to enable widespread access and awareness, and to solicit comments prior to final revision. The Guidelines were then edited by CIHR Ethics Office, in consultation with Health Canada and Justice Canada, to optimize internal consistency, and to ensure that the Guidelines reflected CIHR's mandate (CIHR, 2007).</li>
</ul></div>
<p><em>Complexities of Consent</em>:   Requiring free, prior and informed consent in matters pertaining to the well-being of indigenous communities constitutes one of four basic principles structuring the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN, 2007).  Working with local communities to obtain consent, however, raises complexities not encountered in conventional biomedical research protocols. The CIHR guidelines recognize that group consent precedes individual consent among indigenous peoples because they are communitarian.  Although individuals may refuse to participate in research, scientists may not even approach individuals without first receiving the community’s consent in some instances.  In other instances such as obtaining consent from married women as described in the textbox about INMEGEN, individual rights of consent or refusal remain inviolate.  In the case of Mexico, INMEGEN sought consent at three levels including the individual, local community and the state.    </p>
<div><strong>How the National Institute of Genomic Medicine of Mexico Obtains Consent in Genomic Research </strong>
<p>The government of Mexico established the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) in 2004. INMEGEN’s large-scale Mexican Genome Variability Project has included two phases to date.  Phase 1 focused on genotyping the Mestizo population across the country including border states who provide many migrants to the USA.  Phase 2 focused on genotyping indigenous people.  In both phases INMEGEN worked with the Departments of Health in each Mexican state as well as local leaders from participating communities to enable state and local review of the research plans and procedures.  INMEGEN implemented a broad, community-based consent process based on 12 questions and answers mounted on public posters, three weeks of public education in each state, and community meetings that enabled local media and community members to ask questions.  Before sample collection, each participant had an individual session with an investigator to address any additional questions and sign the consent form with two witnesses of the local community. The consent form, based on the current Federal Laws in Mexico, included the eight guidelines from the International HapMap Project Ethical, Legal and Social Issues  Program and reflected the 12-question format of the public campaign. INMEGEN trained local university students to collect samples at the university-based collection stations on behalf of the state governments.  Phase 2 posed special challenges because indigenous people speak 65 separate languages, rarely speak Spanish and often lack basic science education.  INMEGEN adapted its consent process when working with indigenous communities, including explaining the project in local languages, translating the consent posters into local languages, and consulting with local chiefs to obtain community consent.  INMEGEN did not agree to allow men to grant consent for women.  People from two indigenous communities joined the<strong> </strong>university students as trained sample collectors.  Some communities obtained healthcare services in exchange for their participation in the project (Seguin et al., 2008; Lara-Alvarez et al, 2007).</p>
</div>
<p><em>Train community members as scientists and healthcare workers</em>:  Grassroots research conducted by members of local communities themselves on topics of their own choosing constitutes the gold standard for research in indigenous and developing nations.  This approach offers many social and scientific benefits.  Training and employing community members as researchers or healthcare workers builds human capital with the potential for yielding general improvements in the local standard of living.  Community investigators also make possible “morally valid” consent; that is, consent based on cross-cultural translation of science and local traditions.  Examples exist of locally-run Institutional Review Boards such as among the Navajo (University of Arizona, 2008)  and the Alaska Native Medical Center (see http://www.anmc.org/).  Multicultural members of local communities function as “champions” for science as well as protectors of their community.  Community investigators help assure that research focuses on topics relevant to local communities, prepare communities for scientific advances and facilitate the adaptation of local culture and customs to changing circumstances. Communities not interested in training as scientists should also be able to benefit from genomic research. The Amish provide a strong example of a community fully interested in participating in genomic research (Ruder, 2004), but not necessarily interested in training as scientists.</p>
<div><strong>The Native American Research Center for Health Initiative</strong>
<p>The NARCH initiative is an effort coordinated through the National Institutes of Health and the Indian Health Service to build the research capacity of Federally-recognized Tribes, Tribal Organizations (including Tribal Colleges) and Tribally authorized Indian Health Boards. Specifically, these groups have the opportunity to form partnerships with research institutions and to apply for funding to create a Native American Research Center for Health (NARCH) (IHS, 2008).</p>
<p>            The NARCH initiative is founded on the principle that research is most relevant to the needs of Tribes when conceptualized and carried out by members of the organizations themselves. Through providing funding that supports partnerships NARCH seeks to:</p>
<ul><li>To develop a cadre of AI/AN scientists and health professionals</li>
<li>To reduce distrust of research by AI/AN communities</li>
<li>To reduce health disparities (HHS, 2008) </li>
</ul><p>To date, the NARCH initiative is entering its seventh year and fifth funding cycle. The emphasis of the program is to provide funding to AI/AN Tribes or Tribally based organizations in partnerships to conduct high quality biomedical, behavioral and health services research.  For FY 2007, NARCH grantees received awards ranging from $100,000 to over $1,000,000, for a total budget of more than $7 million (IHS, 2008).  The budget for FY09 is expected to be a minimum of $3 million (HHS, 2008). </p>
</div>
<p><em>Teach scientists how to work with indigenous and developing nations</em>:  The controversies over genomic research and expectations for consultation with local communities justify training scientists in how to conduct research in indigenous and developing communities.  Successful cross-cultural interactions depend on people understanding that they see other cultures through their own cultural perspective and bring their own culture to the negotiating table.  Colloquium participants made recommendations for training scientists in many specific topics, such as:</p>
<ol><li>Respecting the different values held by different groups</li>
<li>Understanding the paramount importance of tribal sovereignty and the complexities of consent</li>
<li>Engaging in real consultation with communities</li>
<li>Recognizing differences between heritage and citizenship for indigenous nations</li>
<li>Implementing the methods and value of grassroots and participatory action research, and</li>
<li>Incorporating methods and requirements for interdisciplinary community development into research awards.</li>
</ol><div><strong>Capacity Development in Indigenous health research: An Australia Approach</strong>
<p>In Australia over the last decade, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has developed a four prong approach to the investment in Indigenous health research as a means of contributing to improving the poor health status which is experienced.  With Indigenous health research goals and intentions embedded in the strategic plan, the NHMRC has developed a strong work plan to:</p>
<ul><li>Provide guidance to the broader research community to focus activity on national priorities, through the development and dissemination of the <em>Roadmap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research</em>.</li>
<li>Develop high level ethical &amp; research processes to govern the conduct of research which involves and/or impacts on Indigenous people, including Ethical Guidelines (which have evolved since 1992), and an established <em>Criteria for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research</em> which is a part of the national peer-review assessment processes for research grant applications;</li>
<li>Improve participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the policy and decision making processes of the NHMRC as the peak national health research body.  This entails representation on committees (policy and peer-review), and as members of staff.</li>
<li>Build capacity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to undertake research relevant to their communities, with significant emphasis placed on Indigenous capacity building through the above mentioned Criteria.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
		<em>           Make genomics an “entry point” for community development</em>:  The processes of consultation, consent, and training in genomic science and personalized medicine potentially yield many secondary benefits for local communities, including stimulation of multiple paths for community development.  Colloquium participants made several suggestions for realizing this potential along the broad path of genomics and personalized medicine, including:</p>
<ol><li>Ensure that local communities “own” the results of genomic research by controlling the biological samples and developing the expertise to use the data for local needs and development,</li>

<h2><a name="_Toc226776117" id="_Toc226776117">White Paper Prepared by the research team as background to the colloquium</a></h2>
<h2><a name="_intro" id="_intro"> Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This paper presents the results of background research conducted in preparation for a colloquium on approaches to data sharing and assurance of reciprocal benefits with developing countries and indigenous peoples in genomic research held on January 7-8, 2009 at Georgetown University.  The colloquium included representative thought leaders from developing countries, indigenous peoples, genomic science, genomic medicine and global health and constituted the first step in a long term effort to stimulate a global conversation about the implications of genomic science for indigenous peoples and developing countries. As genomic science develops momentum throughout the world, strong arguments exist for assuring its benefits reach peoples in developing countries and indigenous nations.  These arguments are particularly persuasive given that genomic science will not reach its full potential in improving the health of the world’s people without participation of developing and indigenous peoples as sources of genetic information and as participants in basic and clinical research projects. Projects such as the HapMap project (IHC, 2003), the National Geographic’s Human Genome project (NGHG, 2005), biodiversity sampling and pandemic flu strain sharing offer examples from which to learn.  Yet, advancing the reciprocal benefits that genomic science can provide also requires hearing the voices and examining the circumstances of developing countries and indigenous peoples. This project will mobilize past experiences with contemporary perspectives to ensure that all people throughout the world reap the benefits of genomic science.</p>
<p>Based on case studies of three developing countries that have launched major genomic science projects, Seguin et al. (2008) identify five factors of a “Roadmap” necessary to assure that developing countries receive benefits from genomic science including political will, local health benefits, institutional leadership, genomic sovereignty, and knowledge-based economy.  When successfully implemented, the “Roadmap” for genomic science contributes to “the establishment and potential future success of” genomic science initiatives.  Although indigenous peoples worldwide enjoy varying degrees of sovereignty, they almost always live as encapsulated nations in a larger state, dominated by non-indigenous majorities. Thus, they rarely stand structurally placed to accrue benefits from genomic science as described by Seguin et al. (2008).  Examining the similarities and differences about the implications of genomic research for the world’s developing countries, and indigenous peoples potentially offers a path toward a generalized, global framework for assuring the benefits of genomic science for all.</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples share two factors of the Roadmap, namely concerns for genomic sovereignty and achieving local benefits from genomic science.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Genomic sovereignty: Indigenous peoples clearly understand possession and use of their members’ genomic information as a question of sovereignty;</li>
<li>Local benefits: Thanks to experience with genetic research on diabetes (Ferreira and Lang, 2006) indigenous people will highly value but raise straight questions about benefits to them from genomic science. </li>
</ol><p>These similarities notwithstanding, important differences exist.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Political will:  the political wills of the national government and of an indigenous government or leadership could easily diverge on genomic science;</li>
<li>Institutional leadership: Leaders of different tribal governments or local indigenous communities will undoubtedly vary in their attitudes toward and willingness to participate in genomic science projects.  Indigenous people will distrust any public relations campaign about genomic science as pure hype designed to use them for other peoples’ benefit.</li>
<li>Genomic sovereignty:  Intellectual property laws about ownership of discoveries in genomic science will not necessarily ensure return to people who only provide samples. </li>
<li>Knowledge-based economy:  One cannot assume any benefits of a general knowledge-based economy for encapsulated populations with dependent economies.</li>
</ol><p>With these introductory points, the colloquium set the stage for discussion of four basic questions, namely:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>What are the similarities and differences in assuring return on contributions to genomic science for developing countries, and indigenous people?</li>
<li>What conditions and approaches are necessary to assure benefits of participation in genomic science projects for indigenous people and developing countries, specifically:<br /><ol start="1"><li>What specific conditions should exist before requesting participation of indigenous peoples and developing countries in genomic science projects (e.g. genetic sovereignty, local self-determination of participation)? </li>
<li>If no specific benefits from genomic science could easily accrue to indigenous people or developing countries, what other types of (healthcare) benefits should be returned in their stead?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What barriers prevent indigenous people from directly participating in genomic science?</li>
<li>What principles and mechanisms should define, implement and evaluate the impact of a global framework for guiding introduction and assuring benefits of genomic science for developing countries and indigenous peoples.</li>
</ol><h2><a name="_method" id="_method"> Project Design and Methods</a></h2>
<p>This project, “Developing a Framework to Guide Genomic Data Sharing and Reciprocal Benefits to Developing Countries and Indigenous Peoples,” was launched on January 7-8, 2009 with a colloquium of invited thought leaders from developing countries, indigenous peoples, genomic science, genomic medicine and global health, including:</p>

<p>The colloquium began with groups of short presentations from each participant on the general topics of “Hearing the Indigenous Perspective”, “Hearing the Perspectives of Developing Countries” and “Implications for Healthcare and Genomic Science”.  An open discussion followed the talks on each topic.  After hearing and initially discussing the ideas of all participants, the colloquium closed the first day by “Identifying Key Issues” that had emerged from its work.  This discussion set the stage for “Tackling the Issues”, the colloquium’s work for the second day.  The colloquium closed with a discussion of “Next Steps” to take in the project.  The conversations during the colloquium were recorded and transcribed for later use by all participants. </p>
<p>Report:  The O’Neill Institute prepared and submitted a colloquium report titled “Thematic Analysis of Colloquium” in partial fulfillment of its obligation to the Personalized Healthcare Initiative, Department of Health and Human Services who helped support the colloquium.  The O’Neill Institute sent drafts of the colloquium report to all participants for review, comment and revision.  The final report reflected the perspectives of all participants who have received a copy for their own records.</p>
<p>Researchers from the O’Neill Institute and the Personalized Healthcare Initiative began investigating the open literature to better understand the context and content of the colloquium before the colloquium.  Without in any way attempting to preempt discussion during the colloquium, we sought to identify common concerns about genomic science, clarify lessons learned from past experience and briefly compare formal codes, guidelines and protocols that have been developed to regulate research and healthcare related to genomic science among indigenous people and developing countries.  This background paper explains the results of our work.</p>
<h2><a name="_concern" id="_concern"> Common Concerns about Genomic Science among Indigenous Peoples</a></h2>
<p>The first publication of the human genome sequence in 2001 marked the dawn of the “Post-Genome Era” and led to a new public awareness of genetics and genomics (Lander at al., 2001; Venter et al., 2001).  The data generated by these projects were the DNA sequence of a handful of individuals, as they were not designed to capture the diversity of the human genome.  Concurrently with sequencing projects, efforts were underway to capture this diversity by sampling the DNA of many people from distinct geographic locations.  The approaches to ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of these projects differed, as did their success at interacting with indigenous peoples and residents of developing countries.  In some cases, genomic scientists and local communities have effectively collaborated.  In others, work has yet to commence.  We can learn important lessons from these past experiences (Cavalli-Sforza, 2005).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc226776118" id="_Toc226776118">Case Study 1: The Human Genome Diversity Project</a></h3>
<p>In 1991, as the Human Genome Project began sequencing the human genome, a group of geneticists hypothesized that there was great value in cataloging the genetic variations existing in human populations around the world (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1991).   This idea was the inception of the HGDP.  Over the next two years meetings were held to plan this undertaking, including a workshop at the National Institutes of Health on ethical issues and funding (Greely, 2001).  In 1993, the Human Genome Diversity Project was launched with the stated mission “to arrive at a much more precise definition of the origins of different world populations by integrating genetic knowledge, derived by applying the new techniques for studying genes, with knowledge of history, anthropology and language.”  The proposed plan was to compile genetic information, in addition to biological samples from “populations that are representative of all of the world's peoples.”  The aims and protocols of the HGDP were articulated in a meeting summary along with ethical guidelines to address concerns of cultural sensitivity informed consent, intellectual property and racism (Bodmer et al, 1993). The project encountered harsh criticism from organizations speaking out on behalf of many communities, such as Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB, 1995), the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI, 1994).  The objections grew from multiple aspects of the HGDP:  the assumption of extinction for some groups of indigenous peoples without concomitant assistance to these groups, the potential for discrimination, the lack of control of access to genetic information, the issue of individual and community informed consent, the possibility of biological weapons targeted at indigenous peoples, and the conflict between theories of human migration and the cosmologies of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>In 1997, the HGDP released a model ethical protocol for collecting DNA samples (Weiss et al., 1997).  The National Research Council also undertook an ethical review in 1997 which concluded that  there existed “numerous ethical, legal, and human-rights challenges in the prosecution of a global effort and offers possible guidelines to the resolution of some, albeit not all, of the challenges that the committee identifies” (NRC, 1997).   The efforts of the HGDP to engage with the targeted populations have not succeeded and the HGDP website reports that no samples have been collected under the auspices of the project in North America, since its last update in August of 2006 (Bodmer et al., 1993).  What does this case teach us about conducting genomic science?</p>
<p>Preservation of Self: DNA as a Cultural Identity</p>
<p>Indigenous people share common concerns about the conduct and implications of genetic research in their communities. The most frequent samples used in biological research come from blood, oral/buccal swabs, and hair fragments (Turman, 2001). These samples may continuously regenerate within the body and therefore seem to not be permanently ‘lost’ from the participant. Such a view depends on the assumption that all participants share a similar concept of the body. Dr. Frank Dukepoo, a Hopi Indian and geneticist, explains that “to us, any part of ourselves is sacred. Scientists say it’s just DNA. For an Indian, it is not just DNA, it’s part of a person, it is sacred, with deep religious significance. It is a part of the essence of a person” (Petit, 1998). Recognizing that the samples are not merely data, but a valued, sacred, and significant component of a cultural identity is a first step towards identifying mutually satisfactory approaches to further research.</p>
<p>Given the sacrosanct nature of the samples, one approach to DNA research with indigenous communities is regarding the samples as “on loan” to researchers. This reaffirms the indigenous peoples’ outright ownership of the biological information (Arbour and Cook, 2006). The researcher is not, under any circumstance, permitted to use the samples for any other study at any time without further specific consent. Recognizing samples in this context would be a critical first step towards discussions of reciprocal benefits and detailing guidelines for additional research.</p>
<p>Who grants consent, the Individual or the Community?</p>
<p>Professor Henry T. Greeley of Stanford Law School notes pursuing DNA samples from indigenous communities is “no more a helicopter science. You can’t just fly in, jump out in your white coats, gather some samples and leave” (Petit, 1998). The need to obtain consent for each specific research aim is further complicated by the organizational structures of the indigenous communities. For example, an individual member of the Mohawk community clearly has the right to loan his or her biological samples to researchers. However, that individual may live on a Mohawk reservation, which may identify with a larger Mohawk national community, which in turn is a part of the League of Iroquois and broader still the National Congress of American Indians (Underkuffler, 2007). These self-defined authorities frequently overlap and indigenous governing bodies are rarely acknowledged formally in developed nations (Rosenthal, 2006).</p>
<p>Unclear hierarchical authority within and among indigenous communities has complicated even good-faith efforts made by researchers to obtain proper consent for genetic studies.  In 2000, the Australian biotech company Autogen received permission from the Tongan government to collect biological samples from the archipelago’s original inhabitants (Schuklenk and Kleinsmidt, 2006). The intent of the research was to investigate diabetes, which was rampant throughout the community. Individual consent from participants was planned, but due to very public objections from community leaders reflecting the views of a minority subset of the prospective participants, all plans were cancelled for any collection of samples or research with the samples (Schuklenk and Kleinsmidt, 2006).</p>
<p>Representative organizations can be instrumental in drafting general guidelines that are culturally sensitive to Aboriginal communities. The Canadian Institute for Health Research’s Guidelines for Health Research Involving Aboriginal People is one promising example of collaboration between government and regional representatives, in this case with First Nation, Inuit, and Métis communities (CIHR, 2007). Regarding community and individual consent, Article 4 of the guidelines states that researchers “should consult community leaders to obtain their consent before approaching community members individually. Once community consent has been obtained, the researcher will still need the free, prior and informed consent of the individual participants” (CIHR, 2007). Though representative leadership is useful in relaying general cultural concerns, consent should ultimately remain on an individual participant level. Participatory research methods are also frequently advocated as a collaborative approach that continuously reaffirms community consent for varying studies based on the same data.</p>
<p>Does genomic science threaten indigenous cosmology or sovereignty?</p>
<p>Indigenous populations are potentially a very valuable source of DNA information. The biological samples are valuable in terms of potential advances in the field of health (including the monetary benefits of patenting), but also valuable in studying the history of populations across the globe. Both of these areas of study present obstacles and risks to indigenous populations, requiring strict and specific guidelines for conducting responsible research. Genetic studies are already offering alternative explanations for human migration patters over centuries (Daniel, 2001).  Some people fear that DNA studies may contradict specific indigenous cultural histories, which could undermine arguments for sovereignty and other legal claims (Harmon, 2006).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc226776119" id="_Toc226776119">Case Study 2: </a>The National Geographic Genographic Project</h3>
<p>The Genographic Project, sponsored by IBM and the National Geographic Society, began collecting DNA samples in the spring of 2005 (Behar et al., 2007).  This project has a much more circumscribed mission than that of the HGDP.  As stated, the “Genographic Project is seeking to chart new knowledge about the migratory history of the human species by using sophisticated laboratory and computer analysis of DNA contributed by hundreds of thousands of people from around the world” (NGGP, 2008).  It is clearly stated that this research is focused on human migration and ancestry, the data will be made publicly available, and no cell lines will be created.  Furthermore, the project is “nonprofit, nongovernmental, nonpolitical, and noncommercial,” and clearly states that no patents will be filed using information gathered by the project.  With a decade of experience since the HGDP, the Genographic Project has extensive ELSI information on its website and has created the Genographic Legacy Fund to support education and cultural conservation efforts in communities of indigenous peoples and in developing nations.</p>
<p>Many indigenous people share the excitement for scientific advances from genetic research; however, there are sensitive cultural and political considerations that must be explored further. Council members from the Georgetown tribe in Alaska note the potential for the DNA information to link them with other tribes throughout the continental United States (Harmon, 2006). This could increase solidarity and unite communities facing similar issues with non-indigenous governing bodies. The worry that the research will be used to discredit tribal histories contrasts with the view that research could unite indigenous communities. Dr. Linita Manu’atu, a Tongan senior lecturer at Auckland University of Technology, reaffirms that “for Tongans, we were created in Tonga. We have gods, our own gods, which we created the same as the people of Israel. We have our own stories, but we are being told they’re not good enough” (Harvey, 2005). More directly, genomic studies of indigenous populations have been described as “race-based research” which is “highly political” (Harvey, 2005). The stated aims of the research outline a desire to understand how all human beings are related.  For some but not all indigenous spokespersons, the conclusions of these investigations have potentially severe consequences for indigenous communities. In addition, a precedent of less-than-honest genetic research by non-indigenous scientists has fostered doubt in the integrity of future studies. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc226776120" id="_Toc226776120">Case Study 3: </a>The International HapMap Project</h3>
<p>The International HapMap Project (IHC, 2003) has the goal of developing a map of the human genome, complete with variations that occur in different populations, for the purposes of supporting genome-wide association studies that are the standard investigational protocol to look at common, complex human diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders.  The HapMap Project also declared its intention to publicly release data in an expedient fashion for use by the larger research community.  From the outset, this project focused on ELSI issues that plagued the HGDP and published this framework in <em>Nature Reviews Genetics</em> 2004 (Foster, 2004). It incorporated Community Advisory Groups as liaisons between studied populations and the institutional bio-banking specimens and planned community tailored compensation for study participants.  Samples for the HapMap Project have been collected from four populations, people of European ancestry in Utah, the Yoruba people of Ibadan, Nigeria, Japanese people from the Tokyo area and Han Chinese from Beijing.  The communities from Utah, Tokyo and Beijing are being sampled by researchers from their own country.  Interaction with the Yoruban people occurs through an existing collaboration between Howard University and the University of Ibadan.  This collaborative group had built a trust with the Yoruba prior to the HapMap Project.  In discussions with the National Human Genome Research Institute, several leaders of the Native American health research community expressed a lack of interest in participating in the project.  The reasons cited were concerns that the data would be used for population-history studies and comparisons between indigenous populations (Foster, 2004).  The leadership of NHGRI, being sensitive to the autonomy of tribes, did not push further.</p>
<p>Distrust in Integrity of Scientific Community</p>
<p>Distrust in the integrity of genetic research has consistently been reinforced through histories of errant misuse of biological samples, as well as institutionalized oppression of indigenous communities. John Liddle, Director of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, reaffirms these strong sentiments, articulating that “over the last 200 years, non-Aboriginal people have taken our land, language, culture, health- even our children. Now they want to take the genetic material which makes us Aboriginal people as well” (RAFI, 1994). The list of examples is extensive both in terms of scope of the research conducted without consent, and the length of time the loaned samples have been preserved and studied. </p>
<h3><a name="_case4" id="_case4"> Case Study 4: Misuse of biological samples from the Havasupai Indians </a></h3>
<p>As recently as November 2008, Havasupai Indians were granted permission through the Arizona Court of Appeals to proceed with legal action related to misuse of biological samples taken by Arizona State University and the University of Arizona. Over 200 genetic samples were consensually loaned for diabetes research in the early 1990s. Within two years, researchers published that diabetes was growing too rapidly within the community to be associated with genetics (Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents, 2008). Years after these published findings, the samples were then used without the consent of the Havasupai to investigate schizophrenia, inbreeding, and population migrations (Davenport 2008).</p>
<h3><a name="_case5" id="_case5"> Case Study 5: Misuse of biological samples from the Nuu-chah-nulth </a></h3>
<p>Unethical use of biological samples is not limited to our most recent advances in genetics. Over 25 years ago more than 800 genetic samples were taken from the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe by researchers at the University of British Columbia. The consent was given by the Nuu-chah-nulth to investigate rheumatoid arthritis, which significantly affects their community. These samples have since been used and shared for a variety of different studies, without consent, among many different collaborators throughout the world (Dalton, 2002). Dr. Shiela van Holst Pellekaam, a molecular anthropologist from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, concludes “there have been many instances where information has been given to researchers in an attitude of trust (and an implied, though often not stated) belief that the trust will not be violated. However, because there has often been a fundamental failure on the part of researchers to disclose the full intention of the research project, particularly with regard to publication, the researched have felt betrayed by people who have taken information away, obtained higher degrees from the work, published …and never returned to the communities concerned” (Pellekaan, 2000).</p>
<p>Lessons Learned from Past Experience</p>
<p>What are the key lessons learned from the range and development of formal codes, guidelines and protocols for conducting genomic research among indigenous people.  Genomic surveys ask questions about the biological basis of communities and human history.  For this reason, the recent history of genomic research among indigenous peoples and developing countries everywhere on the globe instructs us that researchers and communities must cultivate trust prior to the initiation of research.  Cultivating trust requires</p>
<ul><li>Communicating project goals to both communities and individuals</li>
<li>Disclosing and discussing alterations in the initial purposes of a research project as they occur</li>
<li>Obtaining secondary consent when proposing new uses of collected data and samples </li>
</ul><p>Researchers must actively work to promote mutual understanding of intentions and consequences of research through ongoing dialog between researcher and community.</p>
<p>Experience also shows that open-ended studies create more apprehension than focused ones.  We must also recognize that the legacy of past projects affects the success of current and future projects.</p>
<h2><a name="_survey" id="_survey"> Survey of Existing Guidelines for Genomic Research with Indigenous Populations</a></h2>
<p>A matrix of existing guidelines for genomic research with indigenous populations presented below (<a href="developing-framework-guide-genomic-data-sharing-and-reciprocal-benefits-developing-countries-and-indigenous-peoples-colloquium.html#Table">Table I</a>) has been constructed based on the principles outlined by Sharp and Foster (2002) in <em>An Analysis of Research Guidelines on the Collection and Use of Human Biological Materials from American Indian and Alaska Native Communities.</em>  The table reports and compares the different guidelines/principles currently used by various international organizations.  The categories included in the matrix are divided into five complimentary principles: community consultation, sample collection and informed consent, use and storage of biological materials, prioritization of research uses and post-research obligations. Guidelines are individually coded according to the complementary principles based on their inclusion or exclusion of fifteen sub-principles.  One axis of the matrix is the fifteen sub-principles. The other axis of the matrix represents individual sets of guidelines listed by organization and year of publication. This work builds on the previous analysis by Sharp and Foster (2002) by applying the existing framework to more recent guidelines for ethical research with indigenous populations. The selection criteria for guidelines is limited to those created by English speaking countries or international bodies which explicitly address genomic research or generally address health research with indigenous populations.  A matrix key has been created to provide the guideline name with full citation information for each set of guidelines.</p>
<p>Preliminary observations</p>
<ul><li>The matrix demonstrates the evolution of research guidelines over time. As late as the mid-1990s guidelines rarely recommended community consultation. Today all of the recent guidelines published by state-run organizations explain the need for individual and community approval on issues such as secondary uses of data and withdrawal of samples.</li>
<li>The matrix underscores the importance of explicitly consulting communities and individuals in efforts to conduct research with indigenous populations.</li>
<li>Guidelines have evolved from showing little emphasis on the enumeration of reciprocal benefits to the point where all guidelines require benefit sharing with contributing populations. An increasing number also take a clear position on how to benefit contributing populations when research leads to commercial applications.</li>
<li>The overall trend shown in the matrix is a movement towards guidelines that prescribe mutually beneficial and deeply collaborative research partnerships, many of which can be categorized within the framework of participatory research.</li>
<li>The CIHR guidelines (2007) present the most comprehensive contribution on this issue according to our analysis. The guidelines touch on all fifteen of the coded sub-principles and capture the intended spirit of these principles in a comprehensive and concise manner.</li>

<h2><a name="_Toc226776121" id="_Toc226776121">Appendix - Examples from Biodiversity</a></h2>
<p>Current and past experience in biodiversity research provides an example of existing frameworks in data sharing and reciprocal benefits outside of the realm of human genetics.  The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups and the Convention on Biological Diversity both address the issues of data sharing and reciprocal benefits around international research involving genetic material, generally interpreted as non-human genetic material.</p>
<h3>International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups</h3>
<p>The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) program (FIC, 1992) was developed and initiated in 1992 as a collaborative effort of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to improve human health through drug discovery, conservation of biodiversity and research on sustainable economic activities for the environment, health, equity and democracy.  Funding for this program is managed by the NIH Fogarty International Center and is currently supported by the NIH, NSF and the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for funding in the ICBG program, the following objectives must be part of the research proposal (HHS, 2008):</p>
<p>1.      Discover and promote development of plants, animals, and micro-organisms and their molecular constituents toward human health therapeutic agents. While not required, an ICBG project may also incorporate microbial research toward energy applications,</p>
<ol start="2"><li>Undertake biodiversity inventory, and promote conservation and bioresource planning and policy in collaborating countries,</li>
<li>Train U.S. and developing country research scientists and transfer research tools related to the scope of the work of this funding opportunity announcement to collaborating research institutions in the developing world, and</li>
<li>Establish models for ethical and practical scientific collaboration with biogenetic resources.</li>
</ol><p>In addition, applicants must establish a plan to address issues relating to genetic resources access, intellectual property and benefit-sharing.  The ICBG program does not define what may be appropriate in general, but instead requires that investigators work closely with host countries and collaborators to determine the appropriate intellectual property and benefit-sharing for the specific community with which they will work.  Award grantees are required to submit their collected bioinventory and drug discovery data to a Global Data Center.  This data is considered proprietary, confidential and the property of the grantees and their collaborators.</p>
<p>This program has supported the discovery of over 5,000 plant, animal and fungus species around the world and is currently building research capacity in over 20 institutions.  The ICBG funded project working models for intellectual property, benefit-sharing and technology transfer have provided useful information around policy discussions.</p>
<h3>Convention on Biological Diversity</h3>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity is a multilateral treaty that was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (Earth Summit, 1992).  It established three main goals:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>The conservation of biological diversity,</li>
<li>The sustainable use of the components of biodiversity, and</li>
<li>The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources.</li>
</ol><p>One of the cross-cutting themes of the Convention is access to and sharing of the benefits of genetic resources.  The usage of plant genetic resources to develop pharmaceutical products without fair benefits to the source country is a an example of what drives this focus, particularly considering that much of the world’s biodiversity exists in developing countries.  The treaty recognizes that countries have sovereignty over their genetic resources, and therefore access to such biological resources must have “prior informed consent” from the host country, carried out on “mutually agreed terms”.  The treaty further recognizes that any genetic resources that are used in commercial applications gives the host country right to benefits in a variety of forms, for example cash, equipment, shares of profits or training for national researchers.  These benefits sharing arrangements are established separately by individual countries.</p>
<p>Another cross-cutting theme of the Convention is traditional knowledge.  Similar to physical genetic resources, the Convention recognizes the close ties of indigenous people to biological resources and the need to ensure benefits from the use of that traditional knowledge.  Members of the Convention have agreed to "to respect, preserve and maintain" and encourage benefits sharing from the usage of traditional knowledge.</p>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<ul><li>Host country ownership of plant and animal genetic material is recognized and accepted by participants of the program and/or treaty.</li>
<li>Prior consent is necessary to access a country’s genetic resources and the manner in which access is given must be agreed upon in advance.</li>
<li>Reciprocal benefits for access to plant and animal genetic material are appropriate and/or necessary.</li>
<li>Training of national students/researchers is a recommended and/or necessary immediate reciprocal benefit for the host country.</li>
<li>The Treaty recognizes that compensation is necessary for commercial applications of a host country’s genetic resources.</li>
<li>In general, reciprocal benefits and intellectual property around genetic resources is determined on a country by country basis.</li>
</ul><h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>The ICBG program and the Convention on Biodiversity provide examples of efforts to ensure reciprocal benefits to indigenous people and developing countries regarding access to their genetic resources.  Both operate on a system that encourages individual agreements with host countries to determine the benefits that are most appropriate for their local populations.  Given that these general lessons are in place for plant and animal genetic resources, are they appropriate to extend to human genetic resources?</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc226776122" id="_Toc226776122">Glossary of Terms</a></h2>
<p><strong>Communitarian: </strong>Unlike classical liberalism, which construes communities as originating from the voluntary acts of pre-community individuals, “communitarian” groups emphasize the role of the community in defining and shaping individuals. In the context of this report, it refers to the tendency of many local people in Indigenous nations and developing countries to require consultation and consent with community representatives before approaching individuals about participating in research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Community Investigators: </strong>people who conduct and/or assist in conducting research about their own communities. See also “grassroots research”.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Countries: </strong>No single criterion exists for unambiguously distinguishing “developed” from “developing” countries.  Common practice labels Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in North America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe as "developed" regions or areas because of their high Gross National Products, high level of per capita income or high level of industrialization.  Countries that combine these kinds of measures in various ways warrant designation as “developing”.  (Soubbotina, T, <em>Beyond Economic Growth: Meeting the Challenges of Economic Growth</em>, Washington, DC: World Bank, 2000)</p>
<p><strong>Free, Prior and Informed Consent: </strong>The underlying principles of free, prior and informed consent can be summarized as follows: (i) information about and consultation on any proposed initiative and its likely impacts; (ii) meaningful participation of indigenous peoples; and, (iii) representative institutions. (Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Jan. 2005)</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Sovereignty: </strong>in the context of global research about genomics, genetic sovereignty refers to the capacity of a people, country or nation to own, control access to and use of samples, data and knowledge of human, plant or animal genes.</p>
<p><strong>Genomic medicine, science and research: </strong>the adjective “genomic” modifies medicine, science and research concerning interactions of human genes with each other and an individual’s environment. Genomics involves the scientific study of complex diseases such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes and cancer because they are caused more by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genomics offers new possibilities for therapies and treatment of some diseases, as well as new diagnostic methods. The major tools and methods related to genomics studies are bioinformatics, genetic analysis, measurement of gene expression, and determination of gene function (NHGRI, Frequently Asked Questions about Genetic and Genomic Science, http://www.genome.gov/19016904). See also, (Genomics and World Health: Report of the Advisory Committee on Health research, Geneva, WHO (2002)) and (WHA 57.13: Genomics and World Health, Fifty Seventh World Health Assembly Resolution; 22 May 2004)</p>
<p><strong>Genotype:</strong> The genetic identity of an individual that does not show as outward characteristics. (NHGRI Talking Glossary, Available from: http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=genotype)</p>
<p><strong>Grassroots Research:  </strong>quantitative and qualitative approaches to research that engage members of local communities in the identification of topics, conduct and/or analysis of research.  Also known as “participatory action research”, this approach usually but not always focuses on “applied” research about topics of immediate concern to local communities.</p>
<p><strong>“helicopter research”/ “safari research”: </strong>a term that refers disparagingly to research projects that drop into communities, collect data and leave without establishing any short or long term relationship with local people.</p>
<p><strong>Indigenous Communities, Nations and Peoples:</strong> Indigenous communities, peoples and indigenous nations are those who, having a historical continuity with societies prior to the invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed in their territories, consider themselves different from other sectors of society now prevailing in those territories or parts thereof. They currently comprise non-dominant sectors of the society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories and ethnic identity as a foundation for their continued existence as a people, according to their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems. (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, http://www.un.org/spanish/indigenas/2003 Available from: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BOLIVIA/Resources/Bolivia_CSA_ANNEX_2.1_Def_of_Indig_Peoples.pdf)</p>
<p><strong>Multicultural: </strong>Of or relating to or including several cultures (Webster’s Online Dictionary, Available from: <a href="http://www.websters-onlinedictionary.org/definition/">http://www.websters-onlinedictionary.org/definition/</a></p>
<p>multicultural)</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Medicine:</strong> The use of individual molecular (often genetic) information to prevent disease, choose medicines and make other critical decisions about health. (Biotechnology Industry Organization, Science for Life, 2009, Available from: http://www.bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/glossary_p.asp)</p>
<p><strong>Self-Determination:</strong> The principle of self-determination refers to the right of a people to determine its own political destiny. (Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, 2002, Available from: (<a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132482">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132482</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> is the right or capacity of countries to determine their own affairs. More specifically, it is the right of the supreme political authority - usually a government - to unqualified and unrivalled authority over its people and land. Sovereignty and the concept of the nation state are closely related. It is argued that globalization is eroding the world of sovereign states, and that many national decisions are now influenced by global forces. This issue is also referred to as global democracy deficit.</p>

<h3>Charles Rotimi, Ph.D., M.P.H.</h3>
<p>Dr. Rotimi is the Director of the Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health (CRGGH), whose mission is to advance research into the role of culture, lifestyle, genetics and genomics in health disparities. Dr. Rotimi develops genetic epidemiology models and conducts population genetics research that explores the patterns and determinants of common complex diseases in the African diaspora and other human populations.</p>
<p>A key focus of Dr. Rotimi's research is understanding the triangular relationship between obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, which together account for more than 80% of the health disparity between African Americans and European Americans. Genetic epidemiology models developed by his group are helping to address whether high disease rates are the result of exposure to environmental risk factors, genetic susceptibility, or an interaction between the two.</p>
<p>Dr. Rotimi has been extensively involved in a number of genetic epidemiology projects that are being conducted in several African countries and in the United States. These projects have included the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study, the Howard University Family Study, the Genetics of Obesity in Blacks Study, and the Engagement of African Communities for the International HapMap Project.</p>
<p>Dr. Rotimi's group is engaged in the first genome-wide scan of an African American cohort, with the goal of identifying genes associated with obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. More than 2,000 participants from multigenerational African American families are enrolled in this large-scale genetic epidemiology study. In collaboration with investigators at the Coriell Institute for Biomedical Research, this research will explore how the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach can inform complex disease mapping in a genetically admixed population such as African Americans.</p>
<p>Dr. Rotimi's group is also participating in the Black Women's Health Study, a national longitudinal study begun in 1995 to determine the underlying cause of selected illnesses in black women. It includes 59,000 women aged 21 to 69 at the time of enrollment. Over 25,000 DNA samples have been processed to date, and the data derived from these samples are being used in a number of scientific investigations, including those examining the genetic bases of cancer, diabetes and lupus.</p>
<p>Since much of his research activities are focused on vulnerable populations, Dr. Rotimi is collaborating with investigators at Case Western Reserve University and the University of Ibadan in Nigeria to study issues related to informed consent in genetics studies. These efforts are investigating whether subjects in genetics studies perceive their participation as voluntary, and whether consented individuals understand the purpose of the genetic studies in which they are participating.</p>
