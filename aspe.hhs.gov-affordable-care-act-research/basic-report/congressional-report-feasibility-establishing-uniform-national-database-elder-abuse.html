<p>The limited research in the area of elder abuse suggests that the  		problem is widespread and largely unreported. In a 1988 study, 3.2 percent of  		older adults reported having experienced physical or verbal abuse or  		neglect.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref1">1</a></font></sup> An estimated 5  		million older people may be victimized by financial exploitation each  		year.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref2">2</a></font></sup> There is evidence  		to suggest that the number of reported incidents has increased. Between 2000  		and 2004, total reports of elder abuse and neglect to state Adult Protective  		Services (APS) agencies increased 19.7 percent,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref3">3</a></font></sup> but it is not clear whether the increase in  		number of reports is due to a greater underlying incidence of elder abuse or an  		increase in public awareness of elder abuse as an issue that should be reported  		to authorities, or both. These reports to APS likely represent only a small  		fraction of total cases, as most abuse is never reported.</p>
<p>Over the next several decades, the problem is elder abuse is expected to  		grow as the population of Americans age 65+ rapidly expands.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As early as 1992, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  		Secretarys Task Force on Elder Abuse discussed elder abuse data  		collection as a vital first step that must be taken before effective policy  		solutions can be developed: </p>
<blockquote><p><i>Despite increased media coverage and state and community concern,  		  it is premature to try to develop a systematic legislative response to the  		  problem of elder abuse and neglect because there is insufficient information  		  and understanding about the nature and extent of the problem, how it is  		  changing over time, and its causes.</i><sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref5">5</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Task Forces first recommendation was to develop  		and fund a national research and data collection strategy.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref6">6</a></font></sup> The Task Force report and more recent expert  		opinions note that a uniform national data system would benefit state and  		federal policymakers, as well as practitioners, researchers, and advocates, by  		providing the information needed to understand such basic issues as: the extent  		of elder abuse and neglect; characteristics of victims, perpetrators, and  		reporters; the nature of abuse; the causes of abuse; trends in the nature and  		magnitude of the problem over time; and outcomes of interventions. </p>
<p>Thus far, little progress has been made in collecting the information  		needed to understand the phenomenon of elder abuse on a national scale. Data  		continue to be collected by and housed in numerous state and local agencies.  		These agencies use their own definitions for data elements and gear their  		collection and analysis procedures to their individual needs. </p>
<p>In the absence of coordinated national data collection, independent  		investigators have undertaken a number of studies to shed light on the nature  		and extent of elder abuse.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref7">7</a></font></sup> However, the studies differ in research  		methods, sample sizes, and operational definitions, making it nearly impossible  		to compare their results. Research has also been significantly challenged by  		inconsistencies and gaps in data collection systems. Information about the  		number of elder abuse reports, the source of these reports, types of abuse,  		characteristics of perpetrators and victims, and outcomes of interventions are  		still lacking.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, as part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Congress  		directed the Secretary of HHS to conduct a study, in consultation with the  		Attorney General, assessing current elder abuse data collection systems and  		examining the feasibility of establishing a uniform national elder abuse  		database to improve the quality and accessibility of data (Public Law  		109-432).<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref9">9</a></font></sup> To develop the  		basis for its report to Congress, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) contracted with the Lewin Group to conduct  		research in support of this effort. </p>
<p>The elder abuse field lacks answers to basic questions such as: How many  		people are abused, neglected, and exploited? Who are the perpetrators, victims,  		and reporters of elder abuse? What are the victims outcomes after the  		system responds? National data would help to answer questions about the  		characteristics of victims and perpetrators and system response. </p>
<p>There are two primary options for answering these questions, one of  		which may be more appropriate depending upon the purposes of a data collection  		effort. If the primary objective of data collection is to determine how many  		older adults are abused, neglected, or exploited then a national prevalence  		study would best serve this purpose. A national prevalence or incidence study  		(or a series of ongoing studies) could more accurately assess the total amount  		of elder abuse in the United States, including an estimate of the level of  		unreported abuse. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the purpose is to examine the outcomes of services  		and other interventions after abuse is reported, then a nationally coordinated  		administrative dataset is more appropriate. A national dataset comprised of  		administrative data on elder abuse that is reported to local authorities and  		then centralized and analyzed in an ongoing, iterative manner, would provide  		information on reported cases of elder abuse and could be used to evaluate  		intervention efforts. </p>
<p>There was a general consensus among experts consulted for this research  		that both of these two complementary, but separate, data collection efforts are  		needed:</p>
<ol><li>A national dataset comprised of <b>administrative data</b> on elder  		  abuse that is <i>reported</i> to local authorities and then centralized and  		  analyzed on an ongoing basis.</li>
<li>A national <b>prevalence study</b> (or a series of ongoing studies)  		  to assess the <i>total</i> amount of elder abuse in the United States,  		  including an estimate of the level of <i>unreported</i> abuse.</li>
</ol><p>Both data collection efforts are critical and would complement each  		other to provide a comprehensive picture of the scope and nature of elder abuse  		and the system response to cases. </p>
<p>This Report to Congress examines the feasibility of a national data  		collection effort involving administrative data on elder abuse. </p>
<p>A national administrative data collection effort could serve a variety  		of purposes. A broad range of stakeholders, including policymakers,  		practitioners, researchers, advocates, and others would potentially benefit  		from the use of national elder abuse data. Such a data collection effort could  		be used to document the demographic characteristics of victims and  		perpetrators, risk factors, fatalities, services received by victims, the  		consequences of elder abuse, and the outcome of any criminal investigations.  		Analyses of these data over time could be used to help researchers and  		practitioners develop better risk assessment tools and identify high-risk  		cases. Ongoing data collection could be used to measure the impact of policies  		designed to stop or reduce elder abuse. A national elder abuse data collection  		effort could be designed to serve this broad range of potential purposes and  		with these different users in mind. </p>
<h3>Sources of Administrative Data</h3>
<p>Administrative data on elder abuse are currently collected by numerous  		state and local entities that play largely separate roles in investigating,  		reporting, and responding to cases. A range of entities that collect  		administrative data on elder abuse are relevant to any coordinated national  		elder abuse data collection effort (see <i><b><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#table1">Table  		1</a></b></i>). </p>
<p>In many cases of elder abuse the involved parties have contact with  		multiple entities such as law enforcement, medical personnel, and APS. Each of  		the many entry points of the system exist for a different purpose, and  		therefore each requires and collects different types of information. These  		entities may or may not view it as their responsibility to collaborate with  		other entities that operate under different mandates.</p>
<p>The quality and capabilities of systems, agencies, and individuals vary  		across states and local areas. Practices in one segment of the service system  		may affect the way a case is handled by other service systems, as well as  		collaboration between agencies. For example, police officers may fail to report  		suspected elder abuse to APS if they believe that such a report will not result  		in a positive outcome for a vulnerable elder. Similarly, APS workers may be  		frustrated when they perceive that referrals to law enforcement are not taken  		seriously and not acted on in an efficient and thorough manner. This impacts  		both the responses by service providers and law enforcement, as well as the  		types of data which are collected.</p>

</tr></table><p>Experts have identified a number of weaknesses and limitations in  		existing data systems that would need to be addressed in any effort to collect  		useful data on a national level, such as:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The prevalence of, and reasons for, underreporting of  			 abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variations among states in the persons covered by elder abuse laws  			 and reporting requirements. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistencies in definitional interpretations across individuals,  			 programs, and states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability of data systems to desegregate data by common data  			 elements.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref10">10</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent staff training across states on identifying, coding,  			 and reporting abuse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent levels of modernization and integration of paper and  			 electronic records across states and agencies.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Because most elder abuse is not reported to <i>any</i> authority,  		administrative data alone cannot provide a complete understanding of the  		problem. Prevalence or incidence studies can provide additional insight into  		the issues by assessing the nature and extent of abuse overall.  		<i>Prevalence</i> refers to the total number of ongoing incidents, and  		<i>incidence</i> is the number of new incidents that occur during a specific  		time period, (e.g., a year). The few studies on the prevalence or incidence of  		elder abuse have used diverse methods, including surveys of potential victims,  		surveys of family members or paid caregivers, reports from  		sentinels, and analyses of administrative data. The studies tend to  		be based on small samples and vary in definitions and methods, making it  		difficult to compare their results. </p>
<h3>Report Purpose and Organization</h3>
<p>The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 directed the Secretary of HHS  		to conduct a study, in consultation with the Attorney General, assessing  		current elder abuse data collection systems and examining the feasibility of  		establishing a uniform national elder abuse database to improve the quality and  		accessibility of data (Public Law 109-432).<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref11">11</a></font></sup> To develop the basis for its Report to  		Congress, ASPE contracted with the Lewin Group to conduct research in support  		of these efforts. This Report to Congress synthesizes the findings and  		discusses considerations and recommendations for a national elder abuse data  		collection effort.</p>

</ul><h2><a name="current" id="current">CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING  		SYSTEMS ON ELDER ABUSE</a></h2>
<p>This section focuses on administrative data on elder abuse collected by  		federal, state, and local agencies that have a role in responding to elder  		abuse incidents. A summary of these systems, organized by governing structure,  		and a description of the information they collect is provided in <b><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#appendA"><i>Appendix A</i></a></b>.</p>
<p>There are seven overarching sources of administrative data on elder  		abuse with varying degrees of relevance: (1) APS agencies; (2) law enforcement  		agencies; (3) nursing facility survey and certification agencies; (4) MFCUs;  		(5) long-term care ombudsman programs; (6) guardianship and representative  		payee programs; and (7) health indicator data. The strengths, weaknesses and  		commonalities of each corresponding data system are described below. </p>
<h3>Adult Protective Services (APS) Data</h3>
<p>All 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that  		authorize the provision of APS in cases of elder abuse. A large amount of  		information is gathered in the course of an investigation of alleged elder  		abuse and during the provision of services to the affected person or persons.  		As a result, APS administrative data systems are one of the most important  		archives of information on elder abuse that occurs in community settings. For a  		summary of APS procedures while pursuing a report, see <i><b><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#appendB">Appendix B</a></b></i>.</p>
<p>APS was established under title XX of the Social Security Act in 1975 as  		a federally-mandated program, but with little or no funding attached. Since  		that time, APS programs developed in each state in accordance with local needs,  		laws, and regulations.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The lack of both federal funding and national coordination has resulted  		in marked differences in the way APS programs and services are structured and  		delivered across states. For example, some state APS laws only apply to  		vulnerable citizens who experience abuse in the community, while others go  		further to protect people who live in nursing homes and other long-term care  		facilities. Statutes governing APS differ from state to state in several ways,  		including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Age at or circumstances under which a victim is eligible to receive  			 protective services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitions of abuse, neglect, and exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classification of the harmful act as criminal or civil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory versus voluntary reporting requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation responsibility and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remedies or interventions for reported abuse.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref13">13</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Just as eligibility and jurisdictional requirements differ, APS systems  		also vary in the particular elements of information collected about an incident  		while it is being handled by caseworkers. Two major research efforts that  		attempted to examine APS data across the states were hindered by this lack of  		standardization. In the 2004 Survey of State Adult Protective Services produced  		by the National Center on Elder Abuse, only 32 states were able to separate  		information on reports where the victim was at least 60 years old from all  		reports received about adults, and 23 states had no information on the number  		of reports of financial exploitation.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref14">14</a></font></sup> In addition, only 13 states were able to  		provide data on the race of victims, and only three states could compare  		Hispanic and non-Hispanic victims.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another factor that limits the current utility of aggregated APS data is  		that APS data collection efforts <i>within</i> states may not be  		well-coordinated. State law in Ohio, for example, gives the Department of Job  		and Family Services the authority for individual counties to designate their  		APS responsibilities to other entities. Counties designate local public and/or  		private agencies to perform the APS services of conducting investigations and  		providing protective services. With only one full-time employee responsible for  		oversight of APS at the state level, coordination across the states 88  		counties is minimal at this time. Because each county is, in effect, its own  		system, the comparability of data across counties is poor.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>States also vary in the sophistication of their APS data collection  		systems and the integration of electronic and paper records. Some states use  		fully electronic records while others use paper records exclusively. More  		commonly, certain program elements such as client intake are computerized to  		track basic information such as the name and address of the victim, the date of  		the report, the type of mistreatment alleged, the supposed perpetrator, and  		other basic fields.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref17">17</a></font></sup>  		Paper files are often maintained simultaneously to collect different types of  		information and/or evidence during ongoing investigation and service  		provision.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref18">18</a></font></sup> Efforts to  		modernize and streamline these program processes have encountered many  		obstacles including budget shortfalls, organizational resistance to change,  		union opposition, hardware or software failure, and so on. A few states, such  		as Texas, have implemented large-scale APS reform and modernization efforts in  		recent years.</p>
<p>Currently, the assessment and documentation of circumstances surrounding  		an allegation of elder abuse will leave any uncertainties up to the judgment of  		individual investigators. Because APS caseworkers may view situations  		differently based on their personal perspectives, coding and rates of  		substantiation are inconsistent. Some investigators may look for an  		inappropriately high burden of evidence before substantiating a claim, leading  		to under-substantiation of cases,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref19">19</a></font></sup> while others might be more aggressive in  		pursuing case file information, such as pushing a bank to share information in  		a financial exploitation case.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref20">20</a></font></sup> There is general consensus in the elder abuse  		field that the utility of informational outputs are limited by the lack of  		standards for contact and documentation at the state and local  		levels.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Law Enforcement Data</h3>
<p>When an alleged case of elder abuse is reported as a crime, these  		entities collect information in fulfillment of their law enforcement duties.  		Police departments are generally involved in elder abuse investigations  		as-needed for a criminal investigation, most frequently in cases of serious  		crime such as sexual assault or financial exploitation involving large sums of  		money.</p>
<p>When the a local police department is involved in the investigation of  		elder abuse, they generally record the information collected in a police report  		of the incident, and the report is categorized by the type of crime involved,  		such as assault, fraud, or even homicide.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref22">22</a></font></sup> Most police jurisdictions do not, however,  		currently have a specific categorization for elder abuse. </p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies collect data on criminal offenses and report to  		the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through two voluntary reporting  		systems. First, the FBI operates the UCR system, which provides an aggregate  		total of crimes based on information provided to the FBI by limited number of  		local law enforcement agencies throughout the country.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref23">23</a></font></sup> The UCR system includes arrestee demographic  		characteristics and data on eight categories of crime: (1) criminal homicide;  		(2) forcible rape; (3) robbery; (4) aggravated assault; (5) burglary; (6)  		larceny theft; (7) motor vehicle theft; and (8) arson.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The FBI also administers the NIBRS, which is related to the larger UCR  		system, but operates as an independent incident-based reporting  		system.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref25">25</a></font></sup> NIBRS includes  		more thorough data on offenses such as the nature and types of specific crimes,  		characteristics of the victim(s) and offender(s), types and value of property  		stolen and recovered, and characteristics of persons arrested are collected for  		each incident.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref26">26</a></font></sup> Data on  		the relationship between victim and offender, however, are sometimes  		missing.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref27">27</a></font></sup> The NIBRS  		requires 52 data elements to be reported for every crime, and states must meet  		certain reporting standards in order to participate.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref28">28</a></font></sup> As of 2007, 31 states were certified to  		report incident-based data to the FBI, although full participation in reporting  		by law enforcement agencies occurs in only ten states.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref29">29</a></font></sup> Many large police jurisdictions do not report  		to the NIBRS because of the FBIs strict reporting format and element  		requirements. In some states, law enforcement agencies are required to collect  		and report information in addition to what is collected by the FBI. </p>
<p>The utility of these systems for collecting elder abuse data is limited.  		The UCR system only reports an aggregated count and does not include  		incident-specific information. There is no category or data element dedicated  		to elder abuse in the UCR or NIBRS databases. These systems cannot be used to  		identify rates of offenses against older adults because such crimes are  		dispersed across categories and elder abuse <i>per se</i> cannot be identified  		as its own phenomenon. Additionally, because information from NIBRS is  		organized by incident, the database may or may not include elements of interest  		to researchers, policymakers, and program administrators, such as detailed  		information on the victim and perpetrator of the offense.</p>
<h3>Medicare/Medicaid Survey and Certification and State  		Licensure Data </h3>
<p>Health care providers who receive reimbursement from the Medicare and/or  		Medicaid, including hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and  		hospices, are charged with keeping older adults safe from harm. In order to  		ensure that charge is met, the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  		(CMS) uses a survey process to ensure compliance with health and safety  		standards. CMS contracts with state survey agencies in all 50 states, the  		District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and two territories to document and enforce  		the safety and quality standards.  Some states have additional health and  		safety licensure requirements, but monitoring and tracking of state law  		violations are at the discretion of the state and not reported to any national  		database.</p>
<p>Nursing facilities are required to be surveyed approximately on an  		annual basis. A complaint may also trigger an on-site survey to investigate a  		problem. The information collected during surveys includes provider  		characteristics, resident characteristics, and any deficiencies in compliance  		to health and safety standards that have been identified during the annual  		survey or complaint investigations. Deficiencies from surveys and other  		facility information are entered into the OSCAR system, making it the most  		comprehensive source of provider-level information on the operations, patient  		census, and regulatory compliance. </p>
<p>In addition, CMS developed quality measures from the patient assessment  		tool, the MDS, used in nursing homes. Quality measures can be used to identify  		facilities with problems with quality assurance.  MDS data are collected  		on regular intervals for every resident in a Medicare or Medicaid certified  		nursing home.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref30">30</a></font></sup>  		Information is collected on the resident's health, physical functioning, mental  		status, and general well-being.  These data are used by the nursing home  		to assess needs and develop a plan of care unique to each resident. State  		survey agencies use the MDS to develop quality indicators that help the agency  		focus on specific quality issues for the facility during the survey  		process.  </p>
<p>One important difference between these survey data and other forms of  		elder abuse data is that the mandate of a state survey agency is narrowly  		confined to addressing deficiencies in care at the facility-level that qualify  		as violations of state and federal standards. While it may be important to  		monitor this information, the data collected in a survey is designed to ensure  		standards are met, not identifying whether a resident or patient might  		experience abuse or neglect.  There is even less information available on  		abuse and neglect in board and care homes, assisted living, and similar  		settings.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref31">31</a></font></sup> These  		providers are not regulated by federal standards and thus there is no national  		database containing information on deficiencies. Some small residential care  		settings may also fall outside the jurisdiction of state licensure, so no  		information would be collected by a state agency on potential elder abuse in  		that type of residence.  </p>
<p>There are a number of additional limitations to using this survey data  		for assessing elder abuse. First, these databases only make it possible to  		identify cases of elder abuse at the facility level. A case might include one  		or more residents or perpetrators, so it is also not possible to accurately  		establish a number of victims or perpetrators. Substantiation is an issue.  		While a case of elder abuse may be claimed, there is variation across states  		and surveyors as to the resolution of the case. For example, in some states the  		facility is not cited if the situation is resolved, which generally  		includes firing the accused perpetrator and educating the rest of the staff  		about abuse, while in other states, evidence that abuse occurred will lead to a  		citation. Finally, at any given time, under 5 percent of the population aged 65  		and older is living in a nursing facility,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref32">32</a></font></sup> so the institutionalize population represents  		just a fraction of vulnerable elders.  </p>
<h3>Medicaid Fraud Control Unit Data</h3>
<p>The enactment of the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse  		Amendments of 1977 established and authorized federal funding for the state  		MFCUs.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref33">33</a></font></sup> The mission of  		the MFCUs is to investigate and prosecute Medicaid provider fraud and  		incidences of patient abuse and neglect. The MFCUs also pursue civil monetary  		repayment of Medicaid program funds when a Medicaid provider does not provide  		adequate services to recipients.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref34">34</a></font></sup> The majority of the MFCUs are located within  		the office of a states Attorney General, though a small number of the  		MFCUs are located in various other state agencies.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref35">35</a></font></sup> The OIG provides oversight at the federal  		level. </p>
<p>To become involved in a case of elder abuse, a MFCU must first receive a  		referral about a potential criminal violation that has taken place within a  		licensed residential facility or board and care home. These referrals might  		come from a states APS agency, a Long-Term Care Ombudsman, an  		elders family, facility employees, local law enforcement, or any number  		of others who might report suspected elder abuse.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref36">36</a></font></sup> These referral channels vary by state  		depending upon jurisdiction, mandatory reporting laws, local relationships, and  		other factors, ultimately resulting in differences in the number of reports  		received by individual MFCUs. State MFCUs engage in a variety of other  		activities related to elder abuse, such as conducting public awareness  		campaigns that encourage reporting and monitoring Certified Nurse Assistant  		registries to detect patterns of potential mistreatment by facility  		employees.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The MFCUs are required to submit quarterly and annual reports to the OIG  		on the status of their activities. These reports include information on the  		number of resident abuse cases currently open and closed, but they do not make  		distinctions with regard to many case details, such as the type of abuse  		alleged. The OIG reports on aggregated data from state MFCUs on an annual  		basis. The OIG also maintains a list of excluded individuals/entities that have  		been barred from receiving payment from any federal health care program.  		Placement on this list can quickly drive a residential care facility out of  		business. Bases for exclusion include convictions for program-related fraud,  		patient abuse, and licensing board actions.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref38">38</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Long-Term Care Ombudsman Data</h3>
<p>State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen are charged with protecting the rights of  		residents of long-term care facilities. Ombudsmen advocate for residents'  		rights and quality care, educate consumers and providers, and resolve  		residents complaints. Under the federal Older Americans Act, every state  		is required to have an ombudsman program that addresses complaints and  		advocates for improvements in the long-term care system. </p>
<p>The HHS Administration on Agings NORS data summarizes the work of  		state long-term care ombudsman offices. All state ombudsman programs are  		required to report to this national database. NORS data includes the number of  		facilities visited by ombudsman representatives and the types of complaints  		filed and handled by the program. Seventeen categories of complaints are  		collected in the NORS system, including six subcategories pertaining to abuse,  		gross neglect and exploitation. Information on ombudsman activities has been  		collected at the state level and reported nationally since 1996, providing a  		profile of the extent of ombudsman activities nationwide.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref39">39</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In each NORS report relating to abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the  		complaint is grouped as (i) physical abuse including corporal punishment, (ii)  		sexual abuse, (iii) verbal or psychological abuse including punishment and  		exclusion, (iv) financial exploitation, (v) gross neglect, or (vi)  		resident-to-resident physical or sexual abuse. Ombudsman data are focused on  		the type and outcomes of complaints, and NORS does not capture demographic  		information about the victim or perpetrator, such as gender, age, activities of  		daily living, impairments, or other characteristics.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The quality and uniformity of data collected and reported by ombudsmen  		may be limited by low staffing levels and different levels of training about  		reporting for staff and volunteers across states. In 1995, the Institute of  		Medicine published an evaluation of long-term care ombudsman programs that  		recommended one full-time ombudsman for every 2,000 nursing facility beds in  		the state.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref41">41</a></font></sup> Most states  		rely heavily on volunteers to operate their ombudsman programs in addition to  		paid staff. Ombudsman representatives are trained to be advocates, not  		protective services caseworkers or forensic investigators, and may not report  		all complaints to the NORS system or to a states survey agency or nurse  		aide registry.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In general, confidentiality laws are not thought to hinder the  		collection of data on elder abuse by ombudsman representatives, but they do  		interfere with sharing that information across enforcement and service systems.  		Ombudsmen are prohibited from sharing information about cases with law  		enforcement unless they have the specific consent of the resident or his or her  		guardian. Residents may be reluctant to allow the ombudsman to report to law  		enforcement or the states licensing agency for fear of retaliation by the  		perpetrator(s).<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref43">43</a></font></sup> Some  		ombudsman representatives reportedly find this to be a significant and  		frustrating barrier. </p>
<h3>Guardianship and Representative Payee Data</h3>
<p>Additional sources of information about potential elder abuse are  		courts guardianship data and SSAs representative payee  		information.</p>
<p><b><i>Guardianship</i></b></p>
<p>When the effects of Alzheimers disease, stroke damage, and other  		conditions leave some older adults unable to care for themselves, or to make  		and articulate decisions, family members may assume those responsibilities on  		their behalf. In cases where an older adult does not have a family member to  		take over, has not provided a living will or advance health care directives,  		and has not appointed someone to assume durable power of attorney, the  		government can intervene with several measures to protect a person after they  		become incapacitated.</p>
<p>A guardianship is a relationship created by state law in which a court  		gives a designated individual (the guardian) the duty and power to make  		decisions on behalf of another person who has been judged to lack that capacity  		for himself or herself (the ward). Guardians may be appointed to oversee a  		wards personal welfare (termed guardian of the person),  		financial well-being (termed guardian of the estate), or both. A  		person under guardianship is not able to vote, sign contracts, buy or sell real  		estate, or make medical decisions, creating the inherent opportunity for abuse  		and exploitation of the relationship. Although most guardians serve selflessly,  		others act in their own interests rather than those of the people they are  		designated to protect. The incidence of elder abuse and financial exploitation  		at the hands of a guardian or representative payee is unknown, but some cases  		have received significant public attention.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Each state has its own process for initiating and evaluating petitions  		for guardianship appointment, and there is variation in the amount of power  		customarily granted to guardians across states. Likewise, states differ in the  		extent to which they collect information on guardianships and monitor them for  		possible abuse or exploitation. At a minimum, most states laws require  		guardians to submit a periodic report to the court regarding the well-being of  		the ward. Recent reports have called for strengthening the oversight of  		guardianships, but progress has been confined to a handful of jurisdictions  		thus far.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref45">45</a></font></sup> In 2004, a  		report by the GAO on guardianship found a general lack of information related  		to guardianship:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>With few exceptions, courts and federal agencies dont  		  systematically notify other courts or agencies when they identify someone who  		  is incapacitated, nor do they notify them if they discover that a guardian or a  		  representative payee is abusing the person. This lack of coordination may leave  		  incapacitated people without the protection of responsible guardians and  		  representative payees or, worse, with an identified abuser in charge of their  		  benefit payments</i>.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref46">46</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither the states nor the Federal Government collect data on the number  		of people who have been assigned a guardian or representative payee. A 2006  		study by Wood surveyed state court administrators regarding the information  		they collect and found that:<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref47">47</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Only 24 percent of responding state court administrative offices  			 receives information from trial courts on filings and dispositions for adult  			 guardianship of the person and/or property. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only five states collect data on elder abuse as a distinct case  			 type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly 45 percent of respondents indicated that they are interested  			 in compiling information on guardianship, conservatorship, and elder abuse, but  			 named substantial barriers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Information on elder abuse within the guardianship system is scarce.  		Experts have noted that additional funding and supervision would be required to  		produce data robust enough for effective management and monitoring of  		guardianship, conservatorship, and representative payee relationships by the  		courts. Wood commented separately that there is a need for a single  		commonly-utilized tool that courts could use to identify and track potential  		and actual elder abuse in adult guardianship.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref48">48</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Representative Payees</i></b></p>
<p>SSA does not recognize durable powers of attorney for managing federal  		benefits, so SSA assigns representative payees for incapacitated persons to  		receive these funds. Generally, when an older adult is under a guardianship (or  		other arrangement) SSA and other federal agencies that manage benefit programs  		will appoint that guardian as the representative payee. More than 7 million  		recipients of Social Security benefits have a representative payee.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref49">49</a></font></sup></p>
<p>States do not monitor or collect information on representative payees.  		In fact, representative payees are entirely independent of court supervision  		unless they also serve as a court-appointed guardian to the beneficiary in  		question. Instead, representative payees are supervised by the federal agencies  		that appointed them, although each agency has different monitoring procedures.  		The SSA uses the RPS database for this purpose,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref50">50</a></font></sup> but this database is thought to be flawed.  		For example, the 2007 National Research Council study, <b><i>Improving the  		Social Security Representative Payee Program: Serving Beneficiaries and  		Minimizing Misuse</i></b>, recommended many improvements to the RPS system  		including Recommendation 6.15 which suggests including all payees  		in the system and creating data elements for violations by payees.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref51">51</a></font></sup> Redesign of the RPS would create  		a potential opportunity to craft data elements to collect information about  		abuse or exploitation of beneficiaries and to make these elements consistent  		with elder abuse data elements collected elsewhere.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref52">52</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Health Indicator Data</h3>
<p>The HHS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the  		nations foremost public health agency and the most trusted source for  		information about health indicators in the United States. There are efforts  		already underway at the CDC to plan for elder abuse surveillance that have  		consisted of a series of meetings with the purposes of: (1) addressing a  		recommendation that CDC attempt to coordinate activities regarding the use of  		APS and criminal justice data on elder abuse; and (2) developing a system to  		measure the prevalence and incidence of abuse, and a definition and set of data  		elements for surveillance purposes. Researchers with CDCs Violence  		Prevention Program are developing a definition of elder abuse and potential  		data elements that could be used by other entities in future associated  		prevalence or incidence study. </p>
<p>More generally, the CDC regularly conducts large-scale surveys to  		monitor critical health indicators nationwide. One such effort is the National  		Health Care Survey (NHCS) performed by the HHS National Center for Health  		Statistics, a division of the CDC. The NHCS, as well as most of the CDCs  		health surveillance efforts, relies on the International Classification of  		Diseases (ICD-9) to code and classify information on morbidity and mortality.  		The ICD-9 classification includes five codes for types of adult  		maltreatment that might be used to determine the incidence or  		prevalence of abuse or neglect. However, these diagnostic codes for abuse of  		adults are not age-specific, so any elder abuse analysis would require  		cross-checking by date of birth in order to rule out the victimization of  		younger adults. </p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that the ICD-9 codes for abuse are rarely used  		in practice. Elder abuse is often secondary to other conditions that are more  		likely to be coded and reported. Health care providers often lack the training  		to recognize elder abuse and therefore are unlikely to code for it.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref53">53</a></font></sup> Physicians lack training on how  		to identify possible elder abuse and neglect and need more consistent  		guidelines on how to determine whether malnutrition and weight loss, bruises,  		and fractures result from deliberate harm or from medical conditions.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref54">54</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="law" id="law">ELDER ABUSE DEFINITIONS AND LAWS</a></h2>
<p>The general term elder abuse encompasses a range of harmful  		actions and inactions that affect older adults, including (but not limited to)  		seven generally recognized categories: physical, sexual, emotional, verbal, and  		psychological abuse; financial exploitation; neglect; and in some cases,  		self-neglect. Researchers have also used the terms elder  		mistreatment or elder maltreatment with similar intention.  		Other definitions in use may exclude self-neglect as a form of elder abuse  		and/or require that abuse, neglect, or exploitation be at the hand of a  		caregiver or other person in a position of trust.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p>At the federal level, the terms <i>elder justice</i>,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref56">56</a></font></sup><i>exploitation</i>,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref57">57</a></font></sup><i>neglect</i>,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref58">58</a></font></sup> and  		<i>self-neglect</i><sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref59">59</a></font></sup>  		are all defined in the 2006 amendments to the Older Americans Act (Public Law  		109-365), but these definitions and others have not been uniformly adopted  		across federal agencies, states, or state agencies. </p>
<p>In the absence of firm national guidelines, a variety of autonomous  		agencies and private organizations have defined elder abuse in the context most  		useful for fulfilling their own specific mandates, roles, and responsibilities.  		For example, many states definitions of elder abuse are found in laws  		authorizing APS agencies to respond to reports of endangered and vulnerable  		elders, but parameters for what constitutes abuse and the groups eligible to  		receive services from this program are different in each state. </p>
<p>A uniform definition of elder abuse could be used to address the  		following questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Who are the victims of elder abuse?</i> Although elder abuse is  			 usually characterized as mistreatment of a vulnerable elder, others  			 might argue that mistreatment of anyone over the age of 65 should counted as a  			 form of elder abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Who are the perpetrators of elder abuse?</i> Most definitions  			 define elder abuse as harm perpetrated by a person in a position of  			 trust, although clear guidelines for what is meant by a position of  			 trust are lacking. In addition, some experts have argued that abusive  			 acts committed by strangers should also be included. Financial exploitation by  			 strangers is a growing form of crime experienced by older adults.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref60">60</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What types of actions constitute abuse?</i> It is fairly clear  			 that a deliberate action taken against a vulnerable elder should be considered  			 abuse, but there is some disagreement as to whether an inaction that harms an  			 elder should also be included. Additionally, some definitions count only  			 intentional acts that result in harm to a person as abuse, while others include  			 unintended harm as well.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Legal Framework for Reporting Elder Abuse</h3>
<p>Federal law related to abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults  		is found in Title II, <i>Elder Abuse Prevention and Services</i> and Title VII,  		<i>Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection, </i>of the Older Americans Act. Title  		VII provides funding to support efforts to prevent and address abuse, neglect,  		and exploitation. Title VII also includes provisions for states long-term  		care ombudsman programs and state legal assistance development. The 2006  		amendments to the Older Americans Act contained additional language that  		encouraged multi-disciplinary and collaborative programs for elder abuse in the  		community.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref61">61</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the Federal Government, through CMS, is charged with  		ensuring that nursing homes and other health care facilities meet standards of  		care. As stated in federal regulations, residents have the right to be free  		from verbal, sexual, physical, and mental abuse, corporal punishment,  		involuntary seclusion, mistreatment, neglect, and misappropriation of their  		personal property.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref62">62</a></font></sup> CMS  		contracts with agencies in every state to enforce minimum standards of quality  		in facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These  		state agencies perform ongoing site inspections and respond to complaints. Any  		violations or deficiencies noted by the state surveyors are reported to a  		national database maintained by CMS.</p>
<p>State laws addressing elder abuse designate various agencies to receive  		and investigate reports of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The types of  		agencies most frequently designated to receive reports are state or local APS  		human service agencies and law enforcement agencies.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref63">63</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Laws requiring the reporting of suspected elder abuse exist in all  		states but differ significantly. Mandatory reporting laws require certain  		people to report known and suspected incidents of abuse, neglect, and  		exploitation to the proper authorities, usually APS. The list of who is  		mandated to report by law varies greatly from state to state, and can range  		from every citizen to a small number of professional groups, such as physicians  		and social workers. Under voluntary reporting laws, no one is absolutely  		required to report, but any person may report incidents of elder abuse to  		officials. As of 2006, 45 states and the District of Columbia had mandatory  		reporting laws of some kind. Five states (Colorado, New Jersey, New York, North  		Dakota, and South Dakota) had voluntary reporting laws.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref64">64</a></font></sup> All states reporting laws provide  		immunity from civil liability for those who report in good faith, and most also  		offer protection from criminal liability.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref65">65</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Abuse, neglect, or exploitation that takes place in a home or community  		setting may be reported by the abused elder, a family member, friend or  		neighbor, physician, postal worker, or any number of concerned persons. The  		initial report is likely to be handled directly by APS via a telephone hotline.  		In other cases, reports of elder abuse will first go to the local police  		department. In many states, law enforcement is mandated to report cases of  		suspected of elder abuse that they receive to APS. Experts have indicated that  		these required reports are not always made, but that police officers are likely  		to involve the APS system if they fear the elder is in imminent danger and are  		reasonably confident that APS will be able to provide sufficient services to  		protect the victim.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref66">66</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Elder abuse that takes place in a nursing home setting may also be  		reported by the abused elder, a family member, friend or neighbor, facility  		employee, or other party. That report is likely to be handled first by the  		facilitys own staff, especially if the allegation involves abuse at the  		hand of another resident or a facility employee. The facility is required by  		federal regulations to report the allegation immediately to the state survey  		agency. In other cases, especially where a resident might benefit from an  		outside advocate, a concerned person might report suspected abuse or neglect to  		the state long-term care ombudsman, who is tasked with ameliorating the  		complaint. If a case is considered to involve a crime, local law enforcement  		might also receive a report, directly or as a referral from another agency.  		Complaints and reports of incidents of abuse may also reach a states  		MFCU. </p>
<p>The setting in which the elder resides, the type of alleged abuse, the  		relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, public awareness, and many  		other factors all contribute to the likelihood that a report of elder abuse  		will reach any of the entities mentioned above.</p>
<h2><a name="other" id="other">EXAMPLES FROM OTHER FIELDS</a></h2>
<p>While elder abuse is different from child abuse and intimate partner  		violence (IPV), there are many common issues around vulnerability, stigma,  		violence, and exploitation. Historically, child abuse and IPV issues have  		received more attention, research, and funding than elder abuse, which is much  		less developed. A 1998 review of interventions in child abuse, elder abuse, and  		domestic violence identified 144 controlled evaluations, yet only two addressed  		the topic of elder abuse.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref67">67</a></font></sup> In 2007, the Federal Government spent  		approximately $153 million on programs addressing elder abuse,<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref68">68</a></font></sup> compared to $6.7 billion on  		child abuse and $520 million for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). </p>
<p>The government has also made substantial investments in data collection  		systems for the field of child abuse, creating data systems that are used to  		track trends in abuse on a regular basis, and can be used to examine risk  		factors for abuse and track the impact of policies and interventions on abuse  		rates. Two additional national data reporting systems are that are of interest  		for their data gathering and quality control procedures are described below.  		</p>
<h3>Child Abuse</h3>
<p>The current Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended  		by the <i>Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003</i>, defines child  		abuse and neglect as, at a minimum, any recent act or failure to act on  		the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or  		emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act that  		presents an imminent risk of serious harm.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref69">69</a></font></sup> Within the broad minimum standards set by  		federal law, each state provides its own definitions of child abuse and  		neglect.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref70">70</a></font></sup> Most states  		recognize four major types of child maltreatment: neglect, physical abuse,  		sexual abuse, and emotional maltreatment. Some states define other categories  		of abuse or neglect, such as medical neglect or truancy. Efforts to standardize  		state statutory definitions of child abuse have been limited.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref71">71</a></font></sup> In the field, structured  		decision-making models have been developed to help caseworkers assess the  		risk of abuse, but definitions of abuse, standards for substantiation, and  		interventions differ from state to state. </p>
<p><b><i>National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS)</i></b></p>
<p>Despite differences in definitions across states, data from state Child  		Protective Services (CPS) agencies are the primary source of statistics on  		child abuse and neglect. These data have been compiled into a national database  		for nearly 20 years. The 1988 CAPTA (42 U.S.C.A. §5106g) directed HHS to  		establish a national data collection and analysis program that would make  		available state child abuse and neglect reporting information.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref72">72</a></font></sup> HHS, through the National Center  		on Child Abuse and Neglect, responded by developing the NCANDS as a voluntary  		and collaborative effort with the states to collect and analyze annual child  		abuse and neglect data from state CPS agencies. NCANDS data were first reported  		in 1990. The Childrens Bureau, within HHS, manages the collection and  		analysis of the data.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref73">73</a></font></sup></p>
<p>CPS are also funded primarily by the states, which influenced the  		decision to make reporting into NCANDS voluntary.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref74">74</a></font></sup> Experts remarked that voluntary reporting  		requirements have been a beneficial aspect of the program because it allowed a  		federal-state partnership to be cultivated through ongoing discussions with  		states.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<p>States have participated in the development of NCANDS through two  		forums.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>A <b>State Advisory Group</b>, comprised of individual states  			 CPS program administrators and information systems managers, helped to identify  			 initial data elements and definitions to include in the national  			 database.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref76">76</a></font></sup> The state  			 representatives subsequently assisted in pilot testing and implementing NCANDS.  			 Experts remarked that holding the early design meetings with the states and  			 using a consensus-building approach to developing the system worked  			 well.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref77">77</a></font></sup> The State  			 Advisory Group continues to suggest strategies for improving the quality of  			 data submitted by the states and reviews proposed modifications to  			 NCANDS.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref78">78</a></font></sup> The  			 Childrens Bureau convenes the State Advisory Group annually; it currently  			 consists of representatives from 18 states. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <b>national technical assistance meeting</b> for all states is  			 convened annually. The technical assistance meeting provides an opportunity for  			 states to receive guidance for their annual data submissions, and discuss data  			 utilization and training needs. </p>
</li>
</ol><p>The Childrens Bureau funds travel for state CPS administrators to  		attend both types of meetings, and also provides technical assistance to states  		through the National Resource Center for Child Welfare Data and Technology  		(NRC-CWDT) (<a href="http://www.nrccwdt.org">http://www.nrccwdt.org</a>).</p>
<p>NCANDS was developed incrementally, and has grown and evolved  		considerably over time based on the available data and the needs of the  		field.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref79">79</a></font></sup> When the system  		was first developed, 11 states participated.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref80">80</a></font></sup> As the data began to be used for more high  		profile reports, other states began to recognize the utility of the NCANDS  		data, as well as the pressure to participate from reporters and elected  		officials who wanted to see how their state compared. Now, all states report at  		least some data and the majority report most data elements.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref81">81</a></font></sup> In 2006, 51 states (including  		the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) reported case-level data, and one  		state provided aggregate data.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref82">82</a></font></sup> Clearance from the U.S. Office of Management  		and Budget is required to make changes to the elements or methods of reporting  		data to NCANDS, but this has not been a barrier to changes.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref83">83</a></font></sup> The Childrens Bureau  		requests input from state CPS offices every three years, and states vote on  		proposed changes.</p>
<p>One important change that has taken place since NCANDS was first  		developed is that the system has evolved from collecting aggregate to  		case-level data. In the early years, states were not able to provide case-level  		data, but were able to report aggregated data as the first stage of  		contributing to the national database. In 1993, a few states began to  		voluntarily submit case-level data. For a number of years, states provided both  		datasets, but beginning in the year 2000, the case-level dataset became the  		primary source of data for the annual report. The aggregated data file is  		phasing out as more states are able to provide case-level data. </p>
<p>Currently, NCANDS collects case-level data on all children who received  		an investigation or assessment by a CPS agency.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref84">84</a></font></sup> These quantitative data include demographics  		and important indicators of child abuse and neglect: information about the  		characteristics of a referral, the child or children referred, the type or  		types of maltreatment that are alleged, the findings of the investigations, the  		risk factors of the child and the caregivers, the services that are provided,  		and the perpetrators. The case-level data in NCANDS are completely  		de-identified, so that confidentiality provisions can be met.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref85">85</a></font></sup> NCANDS data fields represent  		only a small subset of all CPS data collected by the states. For example, most  		states have 20-30 discrete classifications of child maltreatment; NCANDS  		collapses them into about six categories. States also tend to have more  		assessment data, such as risk factors, and more information on the household  		than are reported nationally.</p>
<p>Some variations in the specific data fields collected and reported  		across states persist, but the overall quality and consistency of the reported  		data have reportedly improved over time.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref86">86</a></font></sup> This is partially a result of the effort of  		federal staff and the technical assistance resource center that have worked  		directly with states for long periods of time to improve the integrity of their  		information. </p>
<p>NCANDS data have many constituent users. Federal agencies are some of  		the most important users of the information.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref87">87</a></font></sup> They include the Administration for Children  		and Families, CDC, other HHS agencies, the Department of Justice (DoJ), and the  		Government Accountability Office. Other primary audiences include states,  		advocates, researchers, providers, and the media. </p>
<p>NCANDS data are disseminated primarily through three regular  		reports:<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref88">88</a></font></sup></p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Child and Family Services Reviews</b> report on a system of  			 performance-based measures to monitor state welfare programs, ensuring  			 conformity with state plan requirements in titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social  			 Security Act.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref89">89</a></font></sup> The  			 reviews assess states performance on a number of national indicators, two  			 of which are based on NCANDS data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual report <b><i>Child Maltreatment</i></b> (<a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/index.htm#can">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/index.htm#can</a>).  			 This report summarizes the data in the NCANDS and is sent to state  			 governors offices and congressional committees, which creates a  			 constituency for the data.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref90">90</a></font></sup> States may be embarrassed if there are blank  			 spaces indicating unreported data from their state, and this is a major  			 incentive for states to report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Child Welfare Outcomes</i></b> annual reports to Congress also  			 include data from NCANDS and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and  			 Reporting System (AFCARS) (<a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cwo03/index.htm">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cwo03/index.htm</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In addition, researchers and others may obtain NCANDS data to perform  		their own analyses from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect,  		maintained by Cornell University, at <a href="http://www.ndacan.cornell.edu">http://www.ndacan.cornell.edu</a>.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref91">91</a></font></sup> Federal agencies may also make a  		request for data analysis to the Childrens Bureau.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref92">92</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are a few noteworthy limitations of NCANDS data. The data system  		was designed to support casework and surveillance, not research, so it is not  		as user friendly as other dataset.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref93">93</a></font></sup> While the collected data are fairly  		comprehensive, information on services received is often missing or in text  		form rather than categorized. Another gap is that NCANDS lacks information on  		the severity of abuse or neglect.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref94">94</a></font></sup> In addition, states have had to make  		decisions about how to report abuse investigations versus more general  		assessments, because the latter are not necessarily indicative of a report of  		abuse.</p>
<p>Finally, the total operating cost of NCANDS includes the costs of  		collecting, validating, and analyzing the data and producing profiles and  		reports.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref95">95</a></font></sup> The federal  		costs for the initial design were approximately $1 million over two years. The  		cost of the current annual contract to operate NCANDS is $1,385,000.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref96">96</a></font></sup> States bear the costs of  		collecting, formatting, and sending data to the system. </p>
<p><b><i>Other Child Welfare Data Collection Systems</i></b></p>
<p>Data about children placed for adoption and foster care are reported in  		AFCARS, which does not include abuse and neglect data, but is another example  		of a similar data collection effort. In contrast to NCANDS, state participation  		in AFCARS is mandatory.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref97">97</a></font></sup> Unlike CPS, AFCARS is largely funded by the  		Federal Government. Federal matching funds for foster care were increased to  		support development of the database. States that receive federal funding for  		Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information Systems (SACWIS) are required to  		link AFCARS data with NCANDS.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref98">98</a></font></sup> Currently, most states and the District of  		Columbia are at some stage of SACWIS planning, development, implementation, or  		operations.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref99">99</a></font></sup> Total  		approved SACWIS developmental project costs currently exceed $2 billion. This  		amount continually increases, because several states are still planning,  		developing, or implementing their SACWIS projects.</p>
<p>Another source of child welfare data are the state child abuse  		registries, which contain information on cases of child abuse that have been  		substantiated by CPS. A current HHS study is examining possible approaches to  		developing a national registry, merging state registries. The national registry  		would include identifying information and be used for investigation and  		enforcement purposes. In that way, a registry user could check the national  		system to obtain information from other states on whether a family or  		individual had previously been investigated by CPS elsewhere. The study was  		mandated by the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Public Law  		109-248).<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref100">100</a></font></sup> An expert  		commented that confidentiality laws are a significant issue with respect to  		building a national registry that includes identifying information.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref101">101</a></font></sup> Another challenge is that  		current state child abuse registries vary, reflecting different definitions of  		abuse and neglect and different standards for substantiation. At this early  		point in the study it is not clear what relationship, if any, there will be  		between NCANDS and the national registry.</p>
<p><b><i>Studies of the Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse</i></b></p>
<p>The National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS) is a  		congressionally mandated, periodic research effort to assess the incidence of  		child abuse and neglect in the United States.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref102">102</a></font></sup> The NIS is conducted approximately every  		ten years. The first NIS (NIS-1) was mandated under Public Law 93-247 of 1974,  		conducted in 1979 and 1980 and published in 1981.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref103">103</a></font></sup> Subsequent studies have assessed not only  		the current national incidence of child abuse and neglect, but also how the  		severity, frequency, and character of child maltreatment had changed since  		earlier NIS studies. Work on the NIS-4 began in 2004 was transmitted to  		Congress on January 25, 2010.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref104">104</a></font></sup> The Office of Planning, Research, and  		Evaluation, in the Administration for Children and Families within HHS, manages  		the research. </p>
<p>The NIS provides information about the nature and severity of the  		maltreatment, the characteristics of the children, perpetrators, and families,  		and the extent of change in the incidence or distribution of child maltreatment  		over time.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref105">105</a></font></sup> One  		expert commented that the NIS provides the child abuse field with important  		insights about the incidence and distribution of child abuse and neglect, and  		about changes in incidence since previous studies.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref106">106</a></font></sup> The NIS includes data on cases investigated  		by CPS and on children seen by community professionals who were not reported to  		CPS or were screened out by CPS without investigation. The study is based on a  		nationally representative sample.</p>
<p>In 2008, CDC released child maltreatment uniform definitions and  		recommended data elements.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref107">107</a></font></sup> The uniform definitions draw upon  		definitions that are currently in use in the literature, as well as input from  		a panel of experts on child maltreatment and public health surveillance. An  		expert explained that CDC-recommended definitions are intended for research and  		surveillance purposes, not for investigation and enforcement by the  		states.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref108">108</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Intimate Partner Violence Data</h3>
<p><b><i>Laws and Definitions of Intimate Partner Violence</i></b></p>
<p>The Office on Violence Against Women, within DoJ, defines domestic  		violence (also called intimate partner violence or IPV) as a pattern of  		abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or  		maintain power and control over another intimate partner.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref109">109</a></font></sup> This includes behaviors that  		intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, terrorize, coerce,  		threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or wound the victim. Types of IPV include  		physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of  		actions.</p>
<p>As with the analogous terms <i>elder abuse</i> and <i>elder  		mistreatment</i>, the terms <i>violence against women</i>, <i>domestic  		violence</i>, and <i>intimate partner violence</i> have been used to describe a  		wide range of acts. These inconsistencies have led to varied conclusions about  		the extent of violence against women just as researchers are unsure about the  		extent of elder abuse. The lack of consistent data on IPV has reportedly  		impeded efforts to plan effective interventions and to monitor changes over  		time. All states have enacted legislation that defines domestic or IPV, but  		statutory definitions vary from state to state.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref110">110</a></font></sup> In most states, the definition includes  		couples who have ever had some kind of romantic relationship, regardless of  		gender and cohabitation status. However, several states limit the definition to  		couples who have lived together or who share a child.</p>
<p>CDC published uniform definitions and recommended data elements for IPV  		surveillance in 1999 and revised them in 2002.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref111">111</a></font></sup> Developing CDC uniform definitions and  		recommended data elements took several years and involved a literature review,  		collecting written feedback from reviewers, and discussions at several meetings  		and workshops with state representatives and other experts. The definition and  		data element recommendations are intended for voluntary use by individuals and  		organizations interested in gathering data on IPV.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref112">112</a></font></sup> As a next step, CDC funded pilot tests of  		the data elements in three states and encouraged other jurisdictions to conduct  		limited pilot tests. Once the testing is complete, the data elements and  		definitions will then be revised to incorporate comments and lessons learned  		from the pilot.</p>
<p><b><i>Administrative Data on Intimate Partner Violence </i></b></p>
<p>There is currently no comprehensive source of national data on  		IPV.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref113">113</a></font></sup> Instead, most  		data on IPV exist primarily in state criminal justice systems. These data are  		reported to the FBI through the UCR system and the NIBRS, described previously  		in this report.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref114">114</a></font></sup>  		NIBRS includes offense, victim, offender, property, and arrestee information  		are provided for each incident, but data on the relationship between victim and  		offender, however, are sometimes missing.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref115">115</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because law enforcement data represent only incidents that are known to  		the police, it is widely believed that many offenses are  		underrepresented.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref116">116</a></font></sup> As  		with people who are harmed by elder abuse, victims of domestic violence may not  		report the abuse for fear of reprisal, embarrassment, or other reasons. Other  		sources of domestic and sexual violence data include victimization surveys,  		service providers, victim compensation offices, and health/medical entities.  		The quantity and quality of the information differs from state to state.</p>
<p>There are several additional gaps and limitations of domestic violence  		that are similar to weaknesses seen in law enforcement information about cases  		of elder abuse:<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref117">117</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Because police reports focus on discrete incidents, the data are out  			 of context of the dynamics and history of the relationship. An incident that,  			 in of itself, may appear to be relatively minor may actually be a sign that the  			 victim is in serious danger when viewed in context of the ongoing pattern abuse  			 in the relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abusers tend to minimize their abusive actions in  			 self-reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is sometimes not possible to determine the seriousness of the  			 injury or whether or not the violence was in self-defense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there is no recidivism, it is unclear whether this is a sign of  			 an interventions success or because the victim opted not to call the  			 authorities after a repeated incident because they were not helpful the first  			 time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical violence is easier to capture than emotional  			 abuse.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The VAWA called for a study to assess how the states could centralize  		data collection on sexual and domestic violence offenses and to examine federal  		data collection on domestic violence-related criminal complaints. In response  		to the legislation, the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice  		Statistics jointly published a report in 1996, titled <b><i>Domestic and Sexual  		Violence Data Collection</i></b>.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref118">118</a></font></sup> The study found that the Federal Government  		and the majority of states were collecting some statistics annually on these  		crimes.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref119">119</a></font></sup> However,  		states varied widely in how they defined these offenses, determine what is  		counted, and measure or report incidents. States also varied in the types of  		victims included in reports. This variability reflected differences in state  		domestic or family violence laws and reporting systems. The study also  		identified the need to include data from other parts of the criminal justice  		system. It emphasized the need for collaborative data collection within law  		enforcement and with outside sources such as health care providers, employers,  		and schools, in order to develop a more detailed picture of domestic and sexual  		violence. Nearly identical challenges have emerged in this research effort with  		respect to elder abuse data collection.</p>
<p><b><i>Studies on the Prevalence and Incidence of Intimate Partner  		Violence</i></b></p>
<p>In the absence of a national database on IPV, several national studies  		have made estimates of the prevalence of the problem, of which these are a  		subset:<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref120">120</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>CDCs Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, conducted in  			 the United States yearly since 1984, offers a seven-question optional module on  			 IPV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1996, the National Institute of Justice and CDC jointly sponsored  			 the National Violence Against Women Survey.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref121">121</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NCVS, the primary source of information on criminal  			 victimization in the United States, includes data on victimization rates for  			 various types of crimes for the population as a whole and for various segments,  			 including women and older persons.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Similar to attempted analyses of elder abuse data, researchers seeking  		information on domestic violence have had to rely on multiple data systems  		(e.g., police and hospital records), which were designed for purposes other  		than monitoring the scope of abuse. Data collection is complicated by the fact  		that multiple records may reflect repeated incidents involving the same victim.  		</p>
<h3>Other National Databases on Violence</h3>
<p><b><i>National Violent Death Reporting System</i></b></p>
<p>In 1999, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center launched the  		National Violent Injury Statistics System (NVISS) with funding from six private  		foundations to pilot a model injury reporting system and to advocate for its  		implementation at the national level by the Federal Government. While the  		project initially focused on firearm injuries, in its second year it expanded  		to incorporate all homicides and suicides. Based on that work, in 2003 the CDC  		later launched the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) with the  		participation of seven states.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref122">122</a></font></sup> An additional six states joined in 2004  		(Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin) and four  		in 2005 (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, Utah) for a total of 17  		participating states to date.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref123">123</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The NVDRS aims to provide communities with facts to inform a clearer  		understanding of violent deaths so they can be prevented. NVDRS informs  		decision-makers and program planners about the magnitude, trends, and  		characteristics of violent deaths so appropriate prevention efforts can be put  		into place; and state-based prevention programs and strategies can be  		evaluated.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref124">124</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The system consolidates data from many sources since individual systems  		do not always provide all of the information needed to accurately assess the  		factors associated with a violent death. For example, death certificates  		provide data on the victim but do not provide information on the perpetrator;  		this information is more commonly found in police reports. Together, these  		sources and others offer a more comprehensive picture of the circumstances  		surrounding a violent death.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref125">125</a></font></sup> An entry into the NVDRS system consists of  		information documented by coroners and medical examiners, vital records  		registries, law enforcement, and crime laboratories which is gathered at the  		local level, linked in a standardized database, stripped of individual  		identifiers, and forwarded to the national database.</p>
<p>The NVDRS uses specific quality control measures that may inform  		potential future data collection of elder abuse information from disparate  		sources. </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Data are entered into source-specific computerized data entry  			 screens</b>. For example, police report data are entered into police report  			 screens and death certificate data into death certificate screens. In addition  			 to allowing independent entry for each source, this approach permits later  			 review of what each source contributed and identification of missing sources.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Automatic electronic importation of specific data sources</b> is  			 possible. This requires no manual entry of information, minimizing the  			 additional opportunity for human error.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref126">126</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hierarchical rules for each variable are assigned to minimize  			 inconsistency across sources</b>. For each variable in the analysis set of the  			 NVDRS, a primacy rule is established on the basis of a hierarchy of assumed  			 reliability of all the possible sources for a given variable. For example, the  			 primacy rule for sex is expressed as death certificate then medical examiner  			 record then police report.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref127">127</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Coding training is held annually for all participating  			 states</b>. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS): Motor Vehicle  		Deaths</i></b></p>
<p>A final national database that links multiple sources of information  		across states is the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) which monitors  		motor vehicle deaths in the United States and is operated by the National  		Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This system was established  		in 1975 to provide an overall measure of highway safety and offer an objective  		basis on which to evaluate the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards  		and highway safety programs.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref128">128</a></font></sup></p>
<p>NHTSA has a cooperative agreement with an agency in each state  		government to provide information on fatal crashes that occur in the state.  		FARS analysts are state employees who extract the information and put it in a  		standardized format. Data are collected, coded, and submitted into a computer  		data system at the state before being transmitted to the national database.  		Each FARS analyst attends a formal training program, and also receives  		on-the-job training.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref129">129</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Each case has more than 100 coded data elements that characterize the  		crash, the vehicles, and the people involved. Documents consulted for entry  		into FARS include: Police Accident Reports, state vehicle registration files,  		state driver licensing files, state highway department data, vital statistics,  		death certificates, coroner/medical examiner records, and emergency medical  		service reports. More than 40,000 deaths from motor vehicle incidents are  		reported each year.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref130">130</a></font></sup>  		Quarterly files are produced for analytical purposes to study trends and  		evaluate the effectiveness of highway safety programs. </p>
<h2><a name="recommend" id="recommend">CONSIDERATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</a></h2>
<h3>Purpose of National Data Collection Effort</h3>
<p>The design of the data collection effort needs to be lead by the goals  		and purposes of such an effort. For example, the goal may be to track trends in  		elder abuse. Alternatively, the focus may be how and what data elements to  		collect it order to help research, policymakers, and practitioners prevent and  		reduce the risk for and consequences of elder abuse. Measuring the impact of  		the interventions through administrative data may be another goal for these  		data. The considerations and recommendations below will each need to be  		adjusted to meet these goals, so it is important to set these goals before  		taking additional steps. </p>
<h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
<p>There are a number of technical considerations for establishing any  		national elder abuse data collection effort. These include creating a uniform  		national or benchmark definition, whether reporting should be mandatory or  		voluntary, what data elements and populations to include, how to ensure  		confidentiality, and data systems issues. Some considerations for each of these  		issues are outlined below.</p>
<h3>National Benchmark Definition</h3>
<p>Studies and expert committees dating back more than 15 years have  		recommended a uniform definition of elder abuse to enable more consistent data  		collection.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref131">131</a></font></sup> A  		consensus or benchmark definition of elder abuse could serve the following  		purposes:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Provide a gold standard for use in research and  			 practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to a more comprehensive and consistent framework for  			 understanding and responding to elder abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve quality and comparability of elder abuse data in academic  			 research and social services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance systems ability to track trends in elder abuse over  			 time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate a need for more social services resources for victims of  			 elder abuse.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>However, it has been consistently challenging to establish a definition  		that is broad enough to incorporate the variation of forms of elder abuse, and  		yet narrow enough to be meaningful. Some experts have argued that a  		one-size-fits-all approach to defining elder abuse is impractical,  		if not impossible. Different levels and concepts must be used depending on the  		context and goal of the definition. For example, elder abuse could be loosely  		and broadly defined for purposes of prevention and intervention from a public  		health perspective. At the opposite end of the spectrum, criminal statutes  		would need to set forth a much more specific description of the characteristics  		of an elder abuse victim, alleged perpetrator, and nature of the crime itself  		in order to lead to successful, consistent, and just prosecution of abusers.  		</p>
<p>Whether a federal definition is created in the short or long-term, most  		informants consulted for this research agreed that such a definition is  		absolutely necessary for a national data collection effort to coalesce in this  		field, although a national definition is not used for child abuse. Experts also  		stressed the importance of operationalizing all of the individual terms within  		the larger definition of elder abuse so that interpretations of what is meant  		by the terms vulnerable or position of trust are as  		consistent as possible.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref132">132</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Mandatory or Voluntary Reporting </h3>
<p>Within the other data collection systems discussed previously in this  		report (e.g., NCANDS, NVDRS), state participation is mandatory only when  		federal funds are received for the program or the development of the data  		system. For example, long-term care ombudsman programs are supported, in part,  		by federal funding from the Older Americans Act, so reporting to the NORS is  		mandatory. In contrast, state-funded programs are generally a part of voluntary  		national data systems. CPS programs are primarily state-funded; therefore  		states voluntarily submit data to NCANDS. However, federal funding has been  		made available for SACWIS, and states that receive this funding are required to  		submit data to NCANDS. These patterns suggest that a national database of APS  		data would likely be developed as voluntary with stakeholder input since APS  		programs are not federally-funded, but like SACWIS, could also include  		incentives that assist states in developing statewide information systems with  		the condition that states accepting the incentive would link to a national APS  		reporting system. While it is inherently more difficult to ensure cooperation  		with a voluntary effort, experts in child abuse data noted that the voluntary  		and collaborative approach to designing and implementing a national database of  		CPS data has been effective.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref133">133</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Data Elements</h3>
<p>A significant level of effort will be required to <b>develop the correct  		data elements</b> for the national database and to communicate the qualities of  		those data elements properly to state and local programs. In reference to child  		abuse, the Childrens Bureau convened an advisory group of state CPS  		representatives and other stakeholders to help shape the data elements and  		definitions to be included in NCANDS and experts have reported that this  		process worked very well. Stakeholders consulted for this research similarly  		suggested convening an advisory group of state APS representatives and other  		stakeholders to determine what definitions and data elements to initially  		include in a national database. A states participation in a voluntary  		national data collection effort may be more likely if the data requested are  		already being collected by the state.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref134">134</a></font></sup> Thus, the design of any elder abuse data  		system should consider what data elements are already commonly collected by  		states and in what form.</p>
<p>The number of data fields should be kept to a minimum. The following  		data elements may be particularly useful to collect: </p>
<ol><li>
<p>Victim Characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type of Incident (Physical Abuse, Neglect, Financial Exploitation,  			 etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporter of Incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perpetrator Characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationship of Perpetrator to Victim (e.g., guardian, spouse, adult  			 child).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting (e.g., community, facility) and Living Arrangement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cognitive Status/Capacity of the Victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Health of the Victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the Abuse was Substantiated, Indicated, or  			 Inconclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>APS System Response/Disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Some of these data elements and the number of states (including the  		District of Columbia and the United States territories) that were able to  		report them are shown in <b><i><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#table2">Table 2</a></i></b>.</p>
<p>It is equally important to clearly <b>define all of the individual  		terms</b> so that interpretations of what is meant by the terms  		vulnerable or position of trust are as consistent as  		possible when the national data collection effort is implemented in the  		field.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref135">135</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><h3>Populations Included</h3>
<p>Another technical consideration is <b>what service population to  		include</b> in the database. In contrast to CPS, in which the service  		population is clearly defined as children under the age of 18, APS service  		populations vary across states. Most states offer APS services to younger,  		vulnerable adults in addition to elders. An estimated one-third of APS clients  		are younger adults with a disability.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref136">136</a></font></sup> Experts commented that there may be  		resistance to providing funding for elder abuse data collection from the APS  		system that would partition resources for serving elders from the rest of the  		service population.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref137">137</a></font></sup>  		An alternative to this arrangement would be to include information about the  		abuse and exploitation of younger adults with disabilities in the national data  		collection effort and any associated funding. </p>
<h3>Use of Aggregated or Case-Level Data</h3>
<p>Another decision will be whether the database will contain <b>aggregated  		or case-level data</b>. Duplication of records is an issue for any database  		comprised of multiple sources. A single incident sometimes exists in the files  		of multiple entities under slightly different guises, or an individual may  		experience multiple incidents of abuse or neglect. Linking data at the  		individual level would allow for calculating unduplicated numbers of incidents  		and individuals involved. This methodology could also greatly enhance the  		fields understanding about the risk factors for abuse and patterns of  		abuse. In the field of child abuse, NCANDS began with a small number of states  		reported aggregated data, because these data were more readily available. As  		data collection evolved, states gradually began to report case-level data,  		which provides richer information. Today, nearly all states report case-level  		data.</p>
<h3>Ensuring Confidentiality</h3>
<p>An additional consideration for any national data collection effort is  		<b>the need to ensure confidentiality</b> and comply with applicable  		confidentiality laws when working with case-level data. Many entities are  		prohibited from sharing information about cases with others unless they have  		the specific consent of the affected older adult or his or her guardian.  		Experts agreed that rigorous procedures to ensure confidentiality would need to  		be included. Techniques to protect privacy include restricting access to the  		database, creating numeric identifiers, and encrypting names.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref138">138</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The level of personally identifiable information included in a national  		database will be governed by the ultimate purpose that the database is expected  		to serve. In general, databases designed for policy and planning purposes do  		not require identifying information. For example, the case-level data in NCANDS  		are completely de-identified, so that confidentiality provisions can be  		met.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref139">139</a></font></sup> Data in NVDRS  		are also stripped of individual identifiers. In contrast, HHS is currently  		exploring the possibility of developing a national child abuse registry that  		would contain individual identifying information. </p>
<h3>Data Systems and Coding</h3>
<p><b>Methods for entering and coding the data</b> will also need to be  		developed. The NVDRS suggests quality control measures for combining data from  		multiple sources. For example, data may be entered into source-specific data  		entry screens, data can be automatically imported, and hierarchical rules are  		assigned to each variable to minimize inconsistency across sources. Similarly,  		the FARS incorporates a series of checks to ensure data consistency,  		timeliness, completeness, and accuracy.</p>
<p><b>Data Ownership</b> is another consideration: <b>which entity or  		entities will own the data</b> that are to be collected and who  		will have authority to access the data. This is especially relevant in  		situations in which data management in states or programs might be contracted  		out to private vendors. For example, the Childrens Bureau contracts with  		William R. McDonald and Associates to maintain and analyze NCANDS data and with  		Cornell University to operate the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and  		Neglect, which makes NCANDS data available to researchers to conduct their own  		analyses.</p>
<p>Given the inconsistencies in current data systems and the additional  		burden of reporting to the national level, ensuring consistency and  		completeness is another concern. States may be limited initially in the amount  		and quality of data they are able to report. After the national database is  		established, efforts should be made to continue to <b>work collaboratively with  		states and other stakeholders to continually improve the consistency and  		completeness of the reported data</b>. This was the approach used in developing  		NCANDS, which initially contained aggregated data from 11 states and eventually  		grew to collect case-level data from 51 states and territories. Experts noted  		that state APS agencies have perpetually constrained operating budgets and  		suggested that financial incentives to enable states to enhance their data  		collection practices would be advisable. </p>
<h3>Cost and Funding Considerations</h3>
<p>An important consideration for determining feasibility of and potential  		approaches for implementing a national elder abuse data collection effort is  		potential costs.</p>
<p>A national data collection effort is a highly complex undertaking that  		will not occur without the investment of human and financial resources.  		Political will and the ability to address these costs can ultimately make or  		break the feasibility of any proposed data collection strategy. A national  		elder abuse data collection effort would likely require some level of federal  		funding but the amount will greatly depend on the extent to which states and  		localities can leverage other older adult systems change efforts and continue  		to invest in Information Technology and/or Management Information Systems  		improvements. </p>
<p><b><i>Cost Components</i></b></p>
<p>Based on the cost components of related national data collection  		efforts, a national elder abuse data collection effort would likely involve the  		following: </p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Federal infrastructure</b>: A comprehensive national database  			 would likely require a specific federal entity to manage and oversee the data  			 collection effort. Such an entity would provide structure to the project,  			 allocate funding, and work to leverage resources and leadership in support of  			 the endeavor. The organization responsible for oversight of elder abuse data  			 collection would also play the important role of distributing any findings from  			 the national data collection effort to other federal agencies and the public.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Development and pilot testing</b>: Development of the new system  			 will entail costs to hold meetings to work with states and other stakeholders  			 to identify initial data elements and develop data collection methods and the  			 database design. The initial cost to design NCANDS was approximately $1 million  			 over two years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Collecting, validating, and analyzing the data nationwide and  			 producing profiles and reports</b>: The cost of the contract to operate NCANDS  			 is $1,385,000 for the current year. As of September 2003, Congress has  			 appropriated $3 million to CDC for the NVDRS, and CDC has augmented that with  			 internal monies to fund 13 states to implement the system; additional states  			 will be added to the system as funds become available.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref140">140</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Federal-state collaboration for ongoing improvements and  			 modifications</b>: The database will evolve over time as states data  			 systems improve and as stakeholders data needs change. In the child abuse  			 field, the Childrens Bureau convenes a State Advisory Group annually to  			 develop strategies for improving the quality of the data and review proposed  			 modifications to NCANDS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Technical assistance and staff training</b>: The consistency and  			 quality of data are both affected by the extent to which professionals are  			 trained on how to identify and code abuse, and how to refer cases to other  			 agencies if necessary. Legal definitions are often unclear and may be subject  			 to inconsistent interpretations by caseworkers in the field. Additional  			 training of staff will be necessary to ensure that workers understand modified  			 operational definitions and are coding appropriately. For example, the  			 Childrens Bureau funds states to attend an annual technical assistance  			 meeting on NCANDS and also provides technical assistance to states through the  			 NRC-CWDT. For NVDRS, ongoing coding support is provided through an email help  			 desk, monthly conference calls with all states, and regular conference calls  			 with individual states. A coding manual is also provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Federal funding for service improvements</b>: In our review of  			 the literature and discussions with experts, it was generally agreed that  			 efforts to address elder abuse are under-funded in general. Federal dollars  			 fund services and shelters for victims of child abuse and domestic violence at  			 the state and local level, but no comparable, dedicated, federal funding stream  			 for elder abuse services exists, though elders do have access to services such  			 as batter womens shelters. APS is not a federal program. The Older  			 Americans Act provides funding for elder abuse awareness, prevention,  			 identification, response, and coordination activities. States have discretion  			 on how to use those funds, including for supporting APS programs, emergency  			 beds, or elder shelters. However, there is great variability in elder abuse  			 programming across the states, and few states use their OAA funds for those  			 purposes. Experts reported that it is especially difficult to house male  			 victims of elder abuse because many shelters refuse to serve them.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref141">141</a></font></sup> Experts in Wisconsins  			 Department of Health and Family Services reported that abuse is more likely to  			 be consistently reported when funding is available to provide services to  			 victims.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref142">142</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal funding for services might also be used as an <b>incentive  			 for states</b> to provide certain data elements. For example, in national child  			 abuse data collection, federal financial incentives have affected the data  			 elements collected and reported by states. In 1996, the CAPTA was amended to  			 require all states that receive funds from the Basic State Grant program to  			 provide specific data, to the extent practicable, about children who had been  			 maltreated. These required data elements were incorporated into the NCANDS, the  			 national dataset of information from state CPS agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hiring new staff to consolidate data</b>: The NVDRS and FARS  			 databases have employees fully dedicated to collecting and reviewing individual  			 sources of reported data and consolidating them into unduplicated entries for  			 input into the national databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Funding to support APS data collaboration with other  			 entities</b>: Our findings suggest that states would likely need incentives to  			 integrate any national database of APS data with other sources of data on elder  			 abuse, similar to the arrangement with SACWIS for child abuse data. Total  			 approved SACWIS developmental project costs currently exceed $2 billion. This  			 amount continually increases, because several states are still planning,  			 developing, or implementing their SACWIS projects.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>Based on these considerations, we next examine the feasibility of  		several options to address the current lack of national data on elder abuse,  		organized by a continuum of increasing complexity. Three primary approaches to  		national administrative data collection emerged:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Strengthen existing data collection systems but do not move forward  			 with combining the data at the national level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a national database of administrative data on elder abuse,  			 drawing from data sources on an incremental basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a national database of administrative data on elder abuse,  			 drawing from many data sources from the outset.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Again, the goals and purpose of this data collection effort should lead  		the decision on the most appropriate approach. The third option -- to build an  		all-inclusive national database that draws from multiple sources via uniform  		reporting forms -- was the approach proposed in the Elder Justice Act  		introduced in the 109th Congress, but has been dropped in subsequent versions  		of the bill.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref143">143</a></font></sup> The  		experts consulted for this research unanimously agreed that such an ambitious  		undertaking, while a worthy long-term goal, might be difficult at this time due  		to the limitations, gaps, and inconsistencies in existing data collection  		systems.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref144">144</a></font></sup> Federal  		partners added that this approach would be very costly, potentially over-burden  		many Federal and state staff, and still not provide good data due to poor  		quality of current data collection systems.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref145">145</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Rather, Congress might consider a multi-step approach to developing a  		national database of administrative data on elder abuse. Initially, the effort  		could focus on developing a national database of states APS data. While  		there are several important limitations of using and aggregating APS data as  		outlined earlier in this report, APS data are the most directly relevant to  		this topic as well as the most readily accessible. Subsequent efforts would  		contribute to the longer-term goal of creating a comprehensive and  		cross-disciplinary database of elder abuse data. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Step 1</b>: Address systemic weaknesses in existing elder abuse  		  data collection systems. There are a number of limitations in current data  		  systems that would need to be addressed before the disparate systems  		  potentially involved in national data collection would be able to contribute  		  meaningfully consistent information. There are a number of pertinent examples  		  of innovative state efforts that improve elder abuse data collection systems,  		  such as web-based systems and cross-disciplinary teams, which can be found in  		  Georgia, Wisconsin, Texas, and Minnesota, among others, which could be applied  		  elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b>: Compile a national database of state APS data.  		  States APS agencies are primarily responsible for responding to reported  		  cases of elder abuse that occur outside of long-term care facilities.  		  Therefore, APS data are the primary source of information on elder abuse that  		  occurs in domestic settings. A national APS database could be developed that is  		  similar to the NCANDS database for CPS. Building a data system capable of  		  reconciling states vastly different APS systems will be a complex  		  challenge, but collecting this information annually and compiling it nationally  		  would likely be a relatively lower cost, more feasible, and more useful option  		  than combining data from different types of sources nationally from the  		  outset.</p>
<p>Any national data collection effort, even one that begins solely in  		  the APS system, should first be piloted in a number of states before being  		  implemented full-scale. If the experiences of the early participants provide  		  evidence of success, the pilot could serve as a basis for other states to begin  		  participating in national data collection, incorporating comments and lessons  		  learned from the pilot. States may be limited initially in the amount and  		  quality of data they are able to report, but their reporting ability would be  		  expected to improve over time, given the experience of the NCANDS development  		  in the child abuse arena. </p>
<p><b>Step 3</b>: Plan to build a comprehensive cross-disciplinary  		  national database of administrative data on elder abuse by combining sources  		  incrementally. Any initial database planning efforts should continue to explore  		  and preserve the potential for combining or linking data from multiple systems,  		  even if the first phase involves much more limited data collection from a  		  single system, namely APS. The results of National Institute on Aging-funded  		  research underway in the state of Rhode Island that is seeking to link multiple  		  elder abuse administrative data sources will be particularly informative to  		  discussions of the overall feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of  		  linking many sources of elder abuse data on a national scale.<sup><font><a href="congressional-report-feasibility-establishing-uniform-national-database-elder-abuse.html#ref146">146</a></font></sup> Potential data sources beyond  		  APS would include law enforcement, nursing facility survey agencies, MFCUs,  		  long-term care ombudsman programs, courts guardianship records,  		  SSAs representative payee data, and medical records. Other sources of  		  information not listed here may also be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>HHS was charged with examining the technical considerations for  		implementing a uniform national data collection effort on elder abuse. This  		report provides context and background of the national elder abuse data  		collection effort. There currently are a number of different programs and  		systems that collect data on cases of elder abuse at federal, state, and local  		levels. The nature, scope, details, and level of information collected on cases  		of elder abuse differs greatly across systems and is driven in large measure,  		by the mission of the system collecting the data. This is further complicated  		by the variation in definitions and laws between states and local  		jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Even with similar challenges, data collection efforts in other fields  		have successfully be implemented nationally. In particular, lessons may be  		learned from the experience in the development of the NCANDS, which collects  		data from state CPS agencies despite varying definitions, and was developed  		incrementally with significant input from state CPS agencies. Many of the data  		collection issues in the field of IPV are the same as the challenges for elder  		abuse, making it possible to leverage solutions applied in one field to the  		other. </p>
<p>Despite the many challenges and considerations, an investment in a  		national data collection effort could build upon the existing systems. The  		primary recommendations for action steps are first to establish the goals and  		purposes of a national database of administrative data on elder abuse. Once  		these have been established, decisions can be made about the best data sources  		and ways to draw these data. One option may be drawing primarily from APS data,  		in a few states and incrementally expand the types of measures include and  		states participating. This process could build upon the lessons learned in the  		area of child abuse, maximize existing systems and resources, and build  		stakeholder support for a national data collection effort.</p>
