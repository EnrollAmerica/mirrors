<h3>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>This report summarizes key findings of a research initiative to survey  		consumers about their long-term care knowledge, attitudes and behavior both  		prior to and after a comprehensive consumer education campaign conducted in  		five states.</p>
<p>The Long-Term Care Awareness Campaign, called Own Your  		Future, is the first large scale effort of its kind to attempt to  		increase public awareness of the need to plan for future long-term care needs.  		Evaluation activities were conducted to identify the impact that the  		communication strategies in the various campaign states had on consumer  		knowledge, attitudes and awareness of long-term care planning options, as well  		as on consumers willingness to consider or take specific planning steps.  		</p>
<p>The consumer survey was conducted both prior to and following  		implementation of the Awareness Campaign. The pre-campaign survey instrument  		was designed to measure baseline levels of knowledge, awareness, attitudes and  		behavior about long-term care planning. Selected respondents included 4,500  		individuals between the ages of 50 and 70 in the five campaign states of  		Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, New Jersey and Virginia. Subsequent to the  		pre-campaign survey, these 4,500 individuals, along with approximately two  		million additional consumers in these states, were exposed to a broad-based  		awareness campaign (see campaign summary below). </p>
<p>The pre-campaign survey, which was conducted in November and December  		2004, gathered baseline data regarding consumers: </p>
<ul><li>understanding of long-term care issues and concepts; </li>
<li>personal experiences with long-term care and caregiving; </li>
<li>financial planning options such as reverse mortgages and long-term  		  care insurance; and </li>
<li>lifestyle choices, such as home modification and relocation. </li>
</ul><p>The campaign activities varied by state, and were designed to increase  		consumer awareness and knowledge of long-term care options, and the need for  		advance lifestyle and financial planning to effectively meet long-term care  		needs as people age. </p>
<h3>B. About the Campaign</h3>
<p>Before presenting survey findings, we briefly summarize the Campaign  		Components and interventions which were the subject of this analysis.</p>
<p><b><i>Campaign Summary</i></b></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) designed and  		implemented the Phase I Long-Term Care Pilot Awareness Campaign, Own Your  		Future, to promote increased awareness about the importance of planning  		ahead for future long-term care needs. Specifically, in January 2005, the  		Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, the  		Administration on Aging (AoA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services, working closely with the National Governors Association, launched the  		Own Your Future Pilot Long-Term Care Awareness Campaign in five  		states: Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, New Jersey and Virginia.</p>
<p>Many people today do not think about their future long-term care needs  		and therefore fail to plan appropriately. If individuals and families are more  		aware of their potential need for long-term care, they are more likely to take  		steps to prepare for the future. From a public policy perspective, increased  		planning for long-term care is likely to increase private financing, which may  		in turn reduce the burden on public financing sources. </p>
<p><b><i>Campaign Materials and Activities</i></b></p>
<p>The Campaign used materials that were developed, tested and approved by  		the HHS as part of an earlier project. These included:</p>
<ul><li><b>Letter from the Governor with a brochure</b> offering a Long-Term  		  Care Planning Kit.</li>
<li><b>Television and Radio spot</b> featuring a woman who is thinking  		  about her elderly fathers long-term care needs when she realizes that she  		  should begin to plan ahead for herself as well.</li>
<li><b>Follow-up postcard</b> reminding consumers to order the Kit.</li>
<li><b>The Long-Term Care Planning Kit</b>, which featured:
<ul><li>A 28-page brochure describing what is and what is not covered by  				public programs related to long-term care. The brochure also describes several  				ways to plan ahead, addressing legal issues, assessing services and private  				financing options for long-term care. </li>
<li>An audio CD with interviews of persons engaged in different types  				of planning activities such as obtaining a reverse mortgage, making home  				modifications, or buying long-term care insurance. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The core components of the Campaign were the direct mail initiative and  		a media initiative. The direct mail component included a letter from the  		Governor of each state to every household with a member between the ages of 50  		and 70.  The letter included the tri-fold brochure described above as well  		as a toll free number through which the Long-Term Care Planning Kit could be  		requested.  Over 2.1 million letters were sent to households across the  		five pilot states.  Follow-up postcards to remind those in the target  		group of the availability of the Planning Kit were also used in all of the  		campaign states.  </p>
<p>The second component of the campaign was a series of paid media spots  		and Public Service Announcements to further publicize the toll free number for  		ordering the Planning Kit.  Paid media included television and radio spots  		selected to maximize exposure in the target audience of 50-70 year-olds.   		Due both to both budget constraints and a desire to test various approaches,  		the media used varied across the five pilot states. In three of the states, the  		Governors filmed an introduction to the media spot, expanding it to a 60-second  		spot. In those states, the media buy included a mix of both 30 and 60-secoond  		spots.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the media campaign was to achieve market  		delivery of 175 general television rating points per week in all markets and 50  		direct response radio rating points per week in Idaho and New Jersey for a  		sustained period of eight weeks. The result is 1,400 total target rating points  		in television and 400 total radio target rating points in Idaho and New Jersey  		over the eight weeks. The table below shows the mix of communications used in  		each campaign state. </p>

<p>Over all the campaign states, the response rate was 7.7%. This means  		that 7.7% of the individual households that received the Governors  		letters requested the Planning Kit. Duplicate Kit orders were removed in  		calculating these response rates. The total number of Kits distributed  		represents a larger number because it includes both duplicate requests as well  		as requests from individuals not receiving the Governors letters (e.g.,  		agents, government officials, residents of other states, and the like.) </p>
<p>While response rates were highest in Virginia (9.1%), in all states, the  		response rate met or exceeded our baseline estimate of 5% which is considered  		an appropriate response rate for a social marketing campaign. These response  		rates are also significantly higher than comparable private sector direct mail  		campaigns on this topic (which might see responses of 0.1%-2.0%). </p>

Those results can  		be found in the Final Report for Phase I which is posted at  		<a href="http://www.aoa.gov/ownyourfuture">http://www.aoa.gov/ownyourfuture</a>.

<h3>D. Survey Methodology</h3>
<p>Specifically, the survey sample for the pre-campaign baseline survey  		included 4,500 respondents across the five pilot states.</p>

</tr></table><p>As Phase I concluded in these five states, a post-campaign interview was  		conducted with as many of the same group of 4,500 respondents as were willing  		to participate, in order to measure the impact of the campaign in terms of any  		changes in their long-term care knowledge, attitudes and planning behaviors.  		The survey explored changes in key attitudes or planning activities as well as  		exposure to and opinions of the campaign activities. The post-campaign survey  		also included a replacement sample of individuals who requested the  		Long-Term Care Planning Kit but who were not included in the baseline  		interview. Including these Kit respondents better enabled us to  		evaluate differences between Kit responders and  		non-responders to the initial campaign message -- which was a  		simple call to action to order the Long-Term Care Planning Kit.  		Thus, the survey design enables us to both examine changes over time among the  		same population as well as differences between Kit responders and  		non-responders. </p>
<p>The post-campaign survey included the same questions asked in the  		pre-campaign survey, with the addition of a special series of questions  		designed to evaluate the impact of specific communication and media strategies  		used in campaign states. The post-campaign questions were designed to learn  		more about the usefulness of specific media messages and channels to specific  		segments of the target populations. </p>
<p>Fielding for the post-campaign survey began on October 27, 2005 and was  		completed on December 20, 2005. Individuals were surveyed about their recall  		and reaction to the Own Your Future Campaign roughly 5-7 months  		after completion of the campaign. While our ability to measure recall of  		specific campaign elements could have been enhanced by fielding the survey  		sooner after the campaign concluded, it was felt that a greater interval was  		needed in order to detect meaningful behavioral changes as a result of the  		campaign.</p>
<p>Therefore, the final sample analyzed in this report includes 2,904  		individuals who participated in both the pre and post-campaign survey (called  		the follow-up sample), as well as 1,600 individuals in the campaign  		states who participated only in the post-campaign survey and were identified by  		our records to have requested the Planning Kit (Kit responders).  		Specifically, approximately 65% of the individuals who participated in the  		baseline pre-campaign survey also participated in the follow-up post-campaign  		survey. These figures vary only slightly by campaign state. Therefore, the  		remaining 35% of the survey sample consisted of the replacement  		sample drawn randomly from Kit responders. Across the entire sample  		participating in the post-campaign survey, approximately 41% of the sample  		received the Planning Kit. We specifically over-sampled responders for the  		replacement sample in order to have a sufficient number of  		responders and non-responders on which to analyze differences. The number and  		distribution of survey participants, by state and by status is shown below and  		on the following page. </p>
<p>Fieldwork was conducted by Market Strategies, Inc., in conjunction with  		LifePlans, Inc., and Long Term Care Group, Inc. The 18-minute computer-assisted  		telephone survey generated the following performance statistics.</p>
<p>The refusal rate (people contacted who refused to participate in the  		survey) was lower for the follow-up sample (19%) than for the new  		replacement sample (31%). This is likely due to the fact that the pre-survey  		sample group already felt some investment in the survey, having completed the  		pre-campaign survey, and also may represent an eager to comply  		population. Given the salience of the campaign to the replacement sample (since  		they had all requested the Planning Kit), we would have expected a better  		acceptance rate to participate in the survey, but that was not the case.  		Similarly, the follow-up survey sample had a higher rate of  		completion of the survey -- 92% -- compared with a cooperation or completion  		rate once the survey began of 75% among the replacement sample.  		Across both groups, the completion rate for the survey was approximately  		85%.</p>
<p>The average interview length was slightly shorter for the  		follow-up survey sample compared with the replacement  		sample (16.5 vs. 17.9 minutes). This finding makes sense given that the  		follow-up sample had more familiarity with the survey questions,  		the vast majority of which were asked in both the pre and post-survey. Also,  		the replacement sample had a slightly longer questionnaire since it  		included questions about the Kit which individuals in the follow-up  		survey who did not request the Kit (about 90% of them) were not asked. </p>

<p>The research questions addressed were as follows. Would people, as a  		result of the Campaign:</p>
<ul><li>Respond to the offer to order the Planning Kit?</li>
<li>Gain a better appreciation for the value of planning for long-term  		  care needs?</li>
<li>Gain additional knowledge about long-term care planning options?</li>
<li>Undertake concrete and specific planning actions?</li>
</ul><p>Specific research questions around which our analysis was designed  		include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Did the campaign result in people ordering Kits? This issue has been  		  answered in Section I, <a href="#sectionI.C">Campaign Results</a>, with an  		  overall response rate of 7.7% of the target market ordering the Planning  		  Kit.</li>
<li>Did views charge regarding the value of planning?</li>
<li>Did we increase knowledge of planning options?</li>
<li>Did the campaign have any impact on planning behavior?</li>
<li>Which elements of the campaign were associated with planning  		  behavior?</li>
</ul><p>Addition research questions in each of these areas include the  		following: </p>
<p><b><i>Campaign Exposure</i></b></p>
<ul><li>Can people recall information about the campaign?</li>
<li>Which campaign activities do people remember hearing, viewing or  		  receiving?</li>
<li>What did people think about the campaign components?</li>
<li>Which components had the most impact?</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Long-Term Care Planning Actions</i></b></p>
<ul><li>What planning actions did people take?</li>
<li>How does this differ by attitudinal and demographic  		  characteristics?</li>
<li>Was the planning associated with campaign exposure?</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Responders vs. Non-Responders</i></b></p>
<ul><li>What seems to motivate someone to order a Kit or take a specific  		  planning action?</li>
<li>Are there any significant differences across the pilot states?</li>
<li>Does the Kit itself seem to lead to additional actions?</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Pre and Post-Campaign</i></b></p>
<ul><li>Did people exposed to the campaign components show any change in the  		  post-campaign attitudes and behavior?</li>
<li>Does awareness of the campaign seem to be related to pre and  		  post-campaign differences in attitudes and behavior?</li>
</ul><h2><a name="responder" id="responder">II. FINDINGS: COMPARING KIT RESPONDERS AND  		NON-RESPONDERS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Demographic Differences</h3>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> summarizes the demographic differences  		between individuals who requested the Long-Term Care Planning Kit (Responders)  		and those who did not (non-responders). Statistically significant differences  		are noted in the table.</p>
<p>The average age of responders is significantly higher than that of  		non-responders, although the average age for both when rounded is just at 61  		years old. Also, in general, responders are more likely to:</p>
<ul><li>Be between the ages of 65 to 69.</li>
<li>Have an educational level of college graduate or beyond.</li>
<li>Be retired.</li>
<li>Cite their health as poor.</li>
<li>Either have assets under $10,000 or to have assets of $125,000 or  		  greater.</li>
<li>Have household assets over $30,000.</li>
<li>Have an individual retirement account (IRA), 401K or annuity.</li>
</ul><p>Responders are less likely to be:</p>
<ul><li>Between the ages of 55 to 59.</li>
<li>Married.</li>
<li>Female.</li>
<li>Have adult children living nearby.</li>
<li>Cite their health as good.</li>
</ul><p>These findings suggest individuals with more education who are slightly  		older and who have already retired are more likely to express interest in  		ordering the Planning Kit. Planning for long-term care may be more salient for  		them at this point in their lives, perhaps because they have newly retired and  		are thinking more broadly about planning for long-term care in the context of  		overall retirement planning. Not being married and not having adult children  		nearby can also make concerns with planning ahead for long-term care needs more  		salient, as this may mean that informal supports are less readily available.  		</p>
<p>Income did not appear to differ significantly across the responder vs.  		the non-responder groups. This suggests that individuals along the financial  		spectrum, with respect to income and assets, found some relevance in the  		campaign. This finding is consistent with the broad range of topics addressed  		in the Planning Kit, with an emphasis not only on financial planning  		approaches, but also on lifestyle and household options like home modification,  		a reverse mortgage or moving in with family or friends, which might hold more  		appeal for individuals with more limited means. One goal of the campaign, to  		speak with some relevance to all segments of the target market and to present  		viable planning options for a wide variety of personal scenarios, would appear  		then to have been met. </p>
<p>Individuals with financial vehicles indicative of being a planner (e.g.,  		having a 401K, annuity or IRA) are also more likely to be interested in  		planning for long-term care; this finding is consistent with other research on  		the topic. </p>

</tr></table><h3>B. Long-Term Care Experiences</h3>
<p>We also compared the long-term care experiences of responders and  		non-responders. While in the past this variable has been an important factor in  		explaining interest in long-term care insurance, it has become a less important  		factor in that regard as the population as a whole has gained more exposure to  		long-term care issues. In studies of buyers and non-buyers of long-term care  		insurance, for example, having some personal experience with long-term care  		used to be a significant variable in differentiating buyers from non-buyers. In  		more recent analyses, it still plays an important role in terms of the type and  		amount of coverage someone buys, but is less likely to play a role in  		ones decision about whether or not to buy coverage. </p>
<p>The findings from this study are consistent with prior research in that  		individuals who had a close family member who needed long-term care or who knew  		someone who used up savings paying for care were more likely to order the Kit  		than those who did not share those same experiences.</p>

</tr></table><h3>C. Attitudes about Planning and the Need for Long-Term  		Care</h3>
<p>We asked survey participants about the importance of planning ahead for  		long-term care needs and the challenges of doing so. A series of questions  		focused on how strongly the individual agreed with various statements about the  		value of planning and the obstacles to being able to plan ahead for long-term  		care needs.</p>
<p>Responders who ordered the Planning Kit were more likely to perceive the  		value of planning ahead and to express a certain degree of confidence about  		their ability to do advance planning. With respect to general planning styles,  		those ordering the Planning Kit were significantly more likely to say:</p>
<ul><li>I leave nothing to chance.</li>
<li>I make lists most of the time.</li>
<li>There are planning steps I can take now that will help me in  		  the future.</li>
</ul><p>They were also more likely to strongly disagree with the statement:</p>
<ul><li>I dont know what planning steps to take for long-term  		  care.</li>
</ul><p>In contrast, the survey respondents who did not order the Planning Kit  		had responses which indicate that they are less planning-oriented in general  		and less focused on planning specific to long-term care. They were more likely  		to say:</p>
<ul><li>I plan only when I have to.</li>
<li>I make lists hardly ever or never.</li>
<li>I will deal with long-term care when I get to it.</li>
</ul><p>There are also significant differences between these two groups when we  		look at their opinions of the value of planning ahead. Those who ordered the  		Planning Kit were more likely to say that:</p>
<ul><li>Planning gives me more control over care choices.</li>
<li>Planning enables me to better protect my income and my  		  family.</li>
<li>Planning ahead will help me be able to stay at home if I need  		  care.</li>
</ul><p>In contrast, survey respondents who did not order the Planning Kit  		disagreed that planning ahead would help them have more control over the care  		and services they could receive, although they did agree, but not strongly,  		that planning ahead could help them receive care at home. </p>
<p>With respect to the perceived risk of needing long-term care, those who  		ordered the Planning Kit were more likely to say that they feel it is very  		likely they will need long-term care someday. They are also less likely to see  		relying on family care as a feasible option. At the same time, they are more  		worried about the financial impact that their long-term care need might have on  		their loved loves. </p>
<p>In contrast, those that did not order the Planning Kit were more likely  		to say that they would rely on care from family or friends, expressed less  		concern about the impact of their long-term care needs on family finances and  		in general see themselves at lower risk of needing long-term care.</p>
<p>Thus the combination of traits associated with the probability of  		ordering the Planning Kit include:</p>
<ul><li>A belief in the value of planning.</li>
<li>A belief in the benefits of planning ahead.</li>
<li>A belief that long-term care may someday be needed.</li>
<li>Concern about the burden on their family if they needed long-term  		  care.</li>
<li>Concern about how or whether they will get the help they need if they  		  need long-term care.</li>
<li>An unwillingness or inability to rely on family or friends to provide  		  care. </li>
</ul><table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure3" id="figure3">FIGURE 3</a>: Attitudes  			 toward Planning by Responder Status</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68841/OYFsurvey-fig3.JPG" /></td>
</tr></table><p>One possible explanation for the findings observed above is that the  		invitation to order materials to learn about how to plan ahead for long-term  		care resonated more to those already concerned about these issues and those  		with a general belief in the value and importance of planning. This is  		consistent with other research which shows that people who take certain  		planning actions, like buying long-term care insurance, are significantly more  		likely to believe strongly in the importance of planning and to see themselves  		at risk for someday possibly needing long-term care. </p>
<p>It seems then, that the campaign message overall, as measured by whether  		or not someone ordered a Planning Kit, did not seem to effectively reach what  		we would describe as non-planners. At least, at this point in their  		lives, they are non-planners. However it is possible, because the  		non-responders are younger, that the campaign message may become  		more salient to them as they come closer to retirement or pre-retirement age,  		as they have fewer competing daily living demands by virtue of possibly still  		being in their prime parenting/working years, or as they have more personal  		exposure to long-term care issues. </p>
<p>One critical question, however, is whether these individuals ordered the  		Planning Kit because of the salience of these planning issues for  		them in their lives, or if having received and read the Planning Kit helped to  		foster some of these planning attitudes among this population. This  		question is examined in more detail in <a href="#campaign">Part III</a> of the  		analysis.</p>

<p>We found differences between Kit responders and non-responders in terms  		of their knowledge and perception of who would pay for long-term care if they  		needed it on an extended care basis (for more than six months). Those who did  		not order the Kit were more likely to say that Medicare and/or Medicaid would  		pay some of the costs, while those who did order the Kit were more likely to  		see Medicare and Medicaid as paying none of those costs. </p>
<p>In contrast, those who ordered the Kit were more likely to feel that  		they would be responsible for paying on their own out of income or savings for  		long-term care, while those who did not order the Kit were more likely to say  		that their own financial resources would not pay for any of their care.  		Finally, individuals who ordered the Kit were more likely to say that children  		would not be involved in paying for their care, while non-responders were more  		likely to say that they would rely on children to pay for their care. </p>
<p>This analysis does not tell us whether respondents held these viewpoints  		before they ordered the Planning Kit, or whether those who ordered the Kit had  		a better understanding of who pays as a result of having received  		it. Based on other research, however, we do see that those who have more  		accurate knowledge about the costs of long-term care and that public programs  		offer a limited solution for them, do tend to take specific planning actions  		(e.g., like buying long-term care insurance) so ordering the Planning Kit may  		have been an expression of knowing that they had a need to plan. </p>

<p>We asked respondents whether they had heard, seen or read anything about  		long-term care within the past several months and whether they took any action  		as a result of this. This was an unaided recall of information, not specific to  		the campaign, and thus may include that or any other information they may have  		heard, read or seen. As shown in <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>, individuals who  		ordered the Kit were more likely to say they had been exposed to long-term care  		during the past few months. When asked where they had read, seen or heard this  		information, those who ordered the Kit were more likely to mention direct mail,  		a magazine, or the Internet. Curiously, they were less likely than  		non-responders to mention television as where they heard about long-term care  		recently, despite the fact that, in most of the states, there was a media  		campaign. </p>
<p>When asked if they took any action as a result of the information they  		read, heard or saw, those who ordered the Kit were significantly more likely to  		say that they had taken some action. They may be referring to having ordered  		the Kit as the action they have taken as a result, or they may also  		be thinking of some of the other planning actions they said they have taken.  		</p>

</tr></table><p>In terms of exposure to the campaign activities, specifically, just  		under half of the respondents recalled receiving the Governors letter,  		even though the sample was drawn exclusively from households that were sent the  		Governors letter. In some cases, of course, it is possible that the one  		member of the household who was in our survey sample was not the same household  		member that opened or discarded the Governors letter when it arrived. So  		this variable is not entirely a measure of recall on receiving the  		letter. Also the lag time between receipt of the Governors letter and the  		survey may reduce the number of respondents who recall receiving it. Those who  		ordered the Kit were twice as likely to recall receiving the Governors  		letter so salience of the long-term care topic is also likely a factor here.  		Certainly, it makes sense that someone who took action as a result of the  		Governors letter (i.e., ordering the Kit) would be more likely to recall  		having receiving that letter. </p>
<p>Fewer than 40% of the sample said they saw a television ad and about 13%  		heard a radio ad. While we do not have good numbers on the market share exposed  		to radio, we do know that just about 45% of the target population was exposed  		to the television spots, so it seems as if the audience had a level of recall  		for television consistent with the level of exposure. </p>
<p>As stated previously, about 8% of the sample ordered the Planning Kit.  		Of these, a high percent -- 80% -- indicated that they had read the Kit. In  		contrast, however, only 17% of those receiving the Kit listened to the  		Success Stories CD included in it. We were not able to ask  		follow-up questions to learn more about why people did not listen to the CD --  		whether the reasons were technical or reflected a lack of interest in the CD  		material.</p>

<p>We asked respondents if they had ever heard of a variety of  		planning steps that some people may take in preparation for  		understanding and dealing with their future long-term care needs. Individuals  		who ordered the Kit were more aware of purchasing long-term care insurance and  		learning about long-term care on the Internet as an option, while those that  		did not order the Kit were more likely to be aware of moving closer to  		family as a planning option. Otherwise, there were no statistically  		significant differences between these two groups in terms of their awareness of  		the existence of these various planning steps. These differences seem  		reasonable given the other differences between the groups in terms of their  		demographic and attitude profiles described above. Also, someone who read about  		long-term care on the Internet or who might have already been aware of  		long-term care insurance could have greater curiosity on the subject and, as a  		result, want to receive the Planning Kit. </p>
<p>Next we asked respondents if they had either considered or taken any of  		the planning steps of which they said they were aware. If a respondent said  		they had never heard of a planning step, they were not asked if they had  		considered or taken it. The planning steps that individuals who ordered the  		Planning Kit were more likely to have considered include:</p>
<ul><li>Buying long-term care insurance.</li>
<li>Consulting with a financial planner.</li>
<li>Consulting with an insurance agent.</li>
<li>Moving closer to family or friends.</li>
<li>Reading information on the Internet about long-term care.</li>
<li>Planning to move to a new residence better suited to their  		  needs.</li>

</tr></table><p>We also looked more closely at respondents who said they bought  		long-term care insurance after the campaign, by state. In New Jersey, Arkansas  		and Virginia, the differences are statistically significant. The likely reason  		that these differences are not statistically significant in Idaho and Nevada,  		but are significant in Arkansas (which had a similar sample size to the other  		two smaller states) is that the differences observed in Arkansas are larger  		than the differences in Idaho and Nevada. A larger difference is important for  		the smaller sample size among these three states. It is possible that, with a  		larger sample in these two states, we may have observed a statistically  		significant difference there as well. </p>
<p>Again, we do not know whether these differences between those who  		received the Kit and those who did not choose to order it were evident before  		the campaign or whether having received the Kit helped to increase awareness  		and action along these lines. This issue is explored further in  		<a href="#responder">Part II</a> of this report which looks at findings of the  		pre and post-campaign survey populations.</p>
<p>Individuals who recalled the campaign communications and those who read  		the Planning Kit and/or listened to the CD were more likely to take one of the  		planning actions listed above. For example, individuals who recalled getting  		the Governors letter were more likely to review their existing insurance  		coverage to see if it covered long-term care (26% vs. 16%), to talk to an agent  		or financial planner about long-term care (25% vs. 14%), to look into a reverse  		mortgage (8% vs. 5%), or to buy long-term care insurance after the campaign (3%  		vs. 2%).</p>
<p>While individuals who ordered the Kit may have already had a  		planning orientation and thus been more likely to engage in  		planning activities after receiving the Kit, the fact that, among all who  		received the Kit, there are important differences in planning actions taken  		based on whether or not the recipient read the Kit and/or listened to the CD,  		provides some evidence that the Planning Kit in and of itself is influential in  		moving planner types to taking action. </p>

<p>Finally, we looked at factors related to the probability of ordering a  		Planning Kit based on a multivariate regression analysis. This approach says,  		holding all else constant, what variables are significant in explaining  		differences between those who ordered the Planning Kit and those who did  		not? This is important because many variables that may prove to be  		significant on a bi-variate basis, may only be significant because they are  		proxies for or correlate with other variables -- for example, the males in the  		survey are also more likely to be married; individuals with higher incomes have  		a greater likelihood of also having greater asset levels and both are  		associated with higher levels of education. </p>
<p><a href="#table9">Table 9</a> shows all of the variables tested in the  		equation. Variables that emerged as significant in the multivariate analysis  		include: </p>
<ul><li>A variable constructed to measure ones attitude toward  		  planning.</li>
<li>A variable constructed to measure the level of campaign  		  exposure.</li>
<li>A belief in someday needing long-term care.</li>
<li>Age.</li>
<li>Being female.</li>
<li>Being married.</li>
<li>Having a college degree or higher.</li>
<li>Having taken some action as a result of something they read,  		  heard or saw about long-term care in the media.</li>

</tr></table><p>The coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship (negative or  		positive), while the Exp (B), known as the odds ratio, can be used to interpret  		the magnitude of the effect of each variable on the probability of ordering a  		Kit. For example, an odds ratio of 1.492 for Being a New Jersey  		Resident means that New Jersey residents were roughly 1.5 times more  		likely to order the Planning Kit, all else being equal. Similarly, an odds  		ratio of 0.632 for Being Female means that, all else equal, females  		are only 0.63 times as likely to order the Kit as males.</p>
<p>Focusing first on demographics, these results include both some expected  		and some unexpected relationships. For example, consistent with our findings,  		other research has shown that higher education correlates with being a planner  		and being more likely to take planning actions in general, and specifically to  		be involved in planning for both retirement and long-term care needs (those  		with a college degree or higher are roughly 1.3 times more likely to have  		ordered a Kit). </p>
<p>Other research, however, suggests that long-term care is a more salient  		issue for females -- they are more likely to have caregiving experience,  		raising their awareness of the value of planning, and are also more likely to  		be single at the time that they might need long-term care, thus raising the  		importance for them of planning. Yet these results show that, all else held  		constant, females are less likely to have ordered the Planning Kit. One  		possible explanation may be that females do not feel they need the Planning Kit  		because they may have already done some long-term care planning. Indeed, other  		research does suggest that a greater portion of females buy long-term care  		insurance, given the salience of this issue for them. We also see strong  		differences in qualitative (focus group) research on long-term care, where  		females tend to be better informed and have a greater acceptance of the  		importance of long-term care planning. </p>
<p>Similarly, married people were also less likely to order the Planning  		Kit. This may be because they are more likely to have other resources for  		planning available to them, such as a personal financial planner or insurance  		agent. Or it may reflect the fact that they feel they are best served by  		talking with each other about these issues, rather than ordering a guide on the  		subject. Additionally, it is possible that married couples believe that they  		may have each other (and more likely to have adult children) on whom they can  		rely should the need for long-term care arise. Also, like females, some  		evidence suggests a greater participation in long-term care insurance and  		similar planning activities among married couples (for a variety of reasons),  		so our data may well reflect the fact that married couples are further along in  		planning and, therefore, did not feel the need to request the Planning Kit.  		</p>
<p>Consistent with other studies, people who see themselves at risk for  		long-term care and who believe in the value of planning, as measured by the  		attitude scale toward planning, are more likely to engage in  		planning activities, in this case, ordering the Planning Kit. The attitude  		scale was based on responses to the following questions (with one point given  		for each answer that indicated a planning orientation): </p>
<ul><li>I can take steps now to plan for a time when I may no longer be able  		  to take care of myself.</li>
<li>If I became ill or unable to take care of myself, I am confident that  		  I could get the help I need.</li>
<li>When it comes to planningI do not know what steps to take.</li>
<li>If I prepare nowI am more likely to have control over the type  		  of care I receive.</li>
<li>If I make arrangements nowI can better protect my familys  		  income and savings.</li>
<li>Planningwill help me stay in my home.</li>
<li>I worry that the cost of care would burden my family.</li>
<li>I feel confident that family or friends would care for me.</li>
<li>I will deal with it when I get to it.</li>
<li>How likely do you think it is that you may ever need care?</li>
</ul><p>An important research question is whether the exposure to campaign  		elements in general, and the media specifically, increased the likelihood that  		someone would order a Planning Kit. Indeed, the analysis suggests that those  		with a higher score on a composite variable for level of campaign  		exposure were much more likely to order the Kit (two times more likely).  		This variable was derived based on the following elements:</p>
<ul><li>Recalled receiving the Governors letter.</li>
<li>Recalled seeing the television ad.</li>
<li>Recalled hearing the radio ad.</li>
</ul><p>Respondents could receive a score from zero to three, based on the  		number of yes answers they had on these items. </p>
<p>Our findings here are consistent with other research which shows that  		the number of touches or exposures to a message that an individual  		receives is positively related to their taking whatever action is directed in  		that message. Individuals with a higher score on the campaign  		exposure variable reported that they received more communications urging  		them to order the Planning Kit -- including mail, television and/or radio. This  		does not, however, tell us which type of media exposure was most important:  		television, radio, follow-up postcard, or initial Governors letter? It  		merely tells us that the more exposure to the message, the better. </p>
<p>The variable Took Action as a Result of Media refers to the  		general survey question for those that indicated that they had seen,  		heard or read something recently about long-term care, and asked whether  		they took any action as a result. The question was very general and may not be  		capturing actions taken as a result of exposure to our campaign messages. The  		media in this case could refer to other outside messages about  		long-term care to which the population was exposed. This finding makes sense,  		given the statement above, that multiple touches are more likely to  		provoke someone to take action. Survey respondents who said they took action as  		a result of some media exposure, by definition, include individuals who may  		have had additional touches beyond those provided by the campaign.  		<i></i></p>
<p>Finally, it is more puzzling to explain why being a New Jersey  		resident, holding all else constant, had a favorable impact on the  		probability of ordering the Planning Kit. Other variables not captured by or  		influenced by the campaign may be at work here including the following:</p>
<ul><li>More urban/densely populated than other campaign states. Helps  		  promote word of mouth awareness of the campaign.</li>
<li>Impact of multiple touches from spillover from the New  		  York State media campaign and Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program  		  marketing.</li>
<li>More active insurance market.</li>
<li>More industry activity designed around the campaign.</li>
<li>Nature of the Medicaid program in the state.</li>
<li>Cost of care and occupancy rates for nursing homes in the state.</li>
<li>Perhaps New Jersey has fewer extended families living there, such  		  that people would be concerned about not having informal supports available to  		  them for long-term care support.</li>
</ul><p>Some of these variables may be unique to New Jersey compared to the  		other Phase I states, but Virginia is likely to be similar to New Jersey in  		some respects, in terms of having an active insurance market, especially  		exposure to messages from the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program campaign  		and a more similar urban/density mix. Some of the other states (e.g., Idaho,  		Nevada and Arkansas) are likely to have fewer extended families and perhaps  		fewer long-term care resources -- which should theoretically increase interest  		in learning more about how to plan for long-term care needs, but it did not  		appear to do so. </p>
<p>Another possibility is that a letter from the Governor of New Jersey  		provoked greater interest there because the Governor was very much in the  		news for reasons unrelated to long-term care at the time just prior to  		the campaign. While the campaign letter was sent from the Acting Governor who  		took over for him, the media exposure over the Governors departure may  		have raised interest in a letter from the Governors office. Indeed, even  		though New Jersey residents had fewer touches by virtue of not  		having any television as part of our campaign, their overall response rates in  		terms of Kit requests is fairly similar to the states that did have television,  		either alone or in combination with radio. This suggests that perhaps other  		factors were acting to stimulate interest.</p>
<h2><a name="campaign" id="campaign">III. FINDINGS: COMPARING PRE-CAMPAIGN AND  		POST-CAMPAIGN RESPONSES</a></h2>
<p>This section summarizes findings exclusively from the follow-up  		sample -- those nearly 3,000 individuals who participated in both the  		pre-campaign and post-campaign survey. The pre-campaign survey was conducted in  		late fall 2004. The awareness campaign was conducted from January to May 2005.  		The post-campaign survey was conducted about one year after that in the fall of  		2005. </p>
<p>This section of the analysis focuses on the sequence of survey questions  		that asked about several specific planning options and whether or  		not the respondent was aware of any or all of these options. For each option,  		if they indicated that they were aware of it, they were subsequently asked if  		they had ever considered the option. If they had considered it, then they were  		asked if they had taken the action. </p>
<p>Responses on these questions were then compared for the segment of the  		sample that participated in both the pre and post-survey interviews. We further  		divided the analysis by those who received the Kit and those who did not to see  		whether or not receiving the Kit had an impact on raising awareness of these  		planning options. </p>
<p>Awareness of planning options, in every case, increased between the  		pre-survey and post-survey interviews. This holds true both for those who  		received the Kit and for those who did not. Moreover, the percent increase in  		awareness of a planning option is not significantly different between those who  		received the Kit and those who did not receive it. One possible explanation for  		this is that, during the campaign, increased attention in the market area was  		focused on the issue of planning for long-term care; in fact, the largest  		percent increase observed in comparing the pre and post-survey results (21%) is  		in response to the question, In the past few months, have you seen, heard  		or read anything about long-term care? This question is not specific to  		the campaign, but could well indicate that residents of these states were  		receiving planning messages in the media and from direct mail initiatives  		sponsored by insurers seeking sales lift from the campaign. </p>
<p>When asked if they had taken any actions as a result of what they saw,  		read or heard, individuals receiving the Planning Kit had a statistically  		significant increase in the percent of respondents who said YES in  		post-campaign survey compared with the pre-campaign survey. Specifically, the  		increase was 20% for Kit receivers and only 11% for those who did not receive  		the Kit. So while the general media and other communications about long-term  		care going on during the campaign may have raised awareness of options in all  		respondents, receiving the Kit seems to have promoted individuals to take some  		type of action as a result. </p>

They also showed a significant increase in their likelihood, after the  		campaign, to consider moving closer to family or friends if they needed care  		(14% vs. 9% change). In the post-campaign survey, those who received the Kit  		were less likely to consider reading information or making checklists on how to  		plan, perhaps because they had already read meaningful information in the Kit  		and felt more ready to plan, compared with those who had not  		received the Kit (-4% vs. 1% change). </p>
<p>Individuals who received the Kit did not show any change after the  		campaign in their consideration of talking with family or friends about  		long-term care planning. Those who did not receive the Kit were more inclined  		to do so (0% vs. 5% change). Again, those who received the Kit may have felt  		less need to consult with others since they had information from the Kit to  		give them a focus for planning activities. </p>

Both groups showed some increase in terms of whether they said they had  		taken any of these steps. This could, in part, also reflect the influence of  		other long-term care messages being delivered at the time of the campaign.  		Another important factor to consider is that this sequence of questions was  		rather tedious. This question represented the third time an individual who have  		been asked about a specific planning action. Some respondents may have  		learned that if they said NO to the prior question  		(e.g., have you considered this option), then they would not be  		asked the follow-up question (e.g., have you taken this option?).  		</p>

</tr></table><p>Indeed, there are some inconsistencies in the responses in the pre and  		post-survey which suggest that this question sequence may not have worked very  		effectively. For example, some people said YES to the question  		Have you heard of this option? in the pre-survey, but said  		NO in the post-survey. Certainly, it does not make much sense that  		someone would have heard of long-term care insurance in the pre-survey but not  		have heard of it in the post-survey. It is possible, however, that they  		learned that there would be fewer follow-up questions if they said  		NO than if they said YES. </p>
<p>Additionally, we do observe some inconsistencies in the data overall in  		that, when asked directly about whether certain actions were taken (e.g., talk  		to an agent or financial planner, consider a reverse mortgage, review existing  		coverage, or buy long-term care insurance), we do see statistically significant  		differences between those who received the Kit and those who did not. Since  		this question was not asked in the pre-survey, we are not able to compare  		respondents pre and post-campaign answer to this question.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">IV. CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Key findings and conclusions based on the Consumer Survey from Phase I  		of Own Your Future Awareness Campaign include the following:</p>
<p><b><i>Did Consumers Order and Read the Planning Kit?</i></b></p>
<p>The campaign was successful in terms of generating requests for the  		Long-Term Care Planning Kit. The response rate to the direct mail and media  		campaign was about 8% across these states. This response rate compares  		favorably to the generally 5% seen in social marketing campaigns and far  		exceeds the typical response rates for industry-based direct mail campaigns.  		</p>
<p>While the vast majority of those receiving the Planning Kit say they  		read it (80%), only a small portion (17%) said they listened to the  		Success Stories CD in the Kit.</p>
<p><b><i>Who Ordered the Planning Kit?</i></b></p>
<p>Individuals from all demographic segments within the target market found  		relevance in the campaign. Consistent with other research, attitudes are more  		important than demographics in explaining differences between individuals who  		ordered the Kit and those who did not do so. Still, some demographic  		differences were observed. Individuals who ordered the Planning Kit better fit  		the profile associated with a planner in terms of a having a higher  		educational level and having other financial products typical of  		planners such as an IRA, 401K, or annuity.</p>
<p>Salience of the long-term care issue seems to also be an important  		factor in whether or not someone ordered the Planning Kit. Individuals who are  		closer to the time when they might need long-term care (e.g., retirees; those  		age 65-69 as compared to those ages 55-59) are indeed more likely to request  		the Planning Kit.</p>
<p>However, some individuals associated in other research with being more  		focused on planning behaviors for long-term care (e.g., buying  		long-term care insurance) were actually less likely to order the Kit, all else  		equal. Specifically, females and married couples were less likely to request  		the Planning Kit. This may in part reflect the fact that they are already  		further along in their planning activities or have or planned to seek out other  		venues for getting information on their long-term care options.</p>
<p><b><i>What Roles do Long-Term Care Experience or Knowledge  		Play?</i></b></p>
<p>Long-term care experience is an important factor influencing whether or  		not someone requests a Planning Kit. This is consistent with other research  		which finds, as this study did, that individuals who had a close family member  		who needed long-term care or who knew someone who used up their savings paying  		for care were more likely to order the Kit than those who did not share those  		same experience. This is one reason that personal stories and  		testimonials to tell the facts about long-term care and the value  		of planning are an important way to motivate interest in this topic among those  		that do not yet have this personal experience of their own. </p>
<p>The campaign resonated most effectively with planners --  		people who possess the following combination of traits: a belief in the value  		and benefits of planning; a belief that they may someday need long-term care;  		concern about being a burden on their family for care; and concern about how  		they will get help if they need it. </p>
<p>We found significant differences between Kit responders and  		non-responders in terms of their knowledge and perception of who pays for  		long-term care. Individuals who ordered the Planning Kit were more likely  		to see long-term care as an area of personal financial responsibility, while  		those who believed Medicare or Medicaid would pay were less inclined to order  		the Planning Kit. This analysis, however, does not tell us whether these  		viewpoints were held before they ordered the Kit, or whether receiving the Kit  		helped to accurately inform these individuals about the risks and costs  		associated with future long-term care needs.</p>
<p><b><i>Did Receiving the Kit Have an Impact on Planning  		Actions?</i></b></p>
<p>Both groups (those receiving Planning Kit and those who did not) have  		been exposed to a great deal of long-term care information in the media and  		mail over the duration of the campaign. However, those receiving the Planning  		Kit were nearly twice as likely to take any action as a result of what they  		saw, read, or heard. Specifically, individuals who received the Planning Kit  		were nearly twice as likely to buy long-term care insurance after the campaign  		as those who did not receive the Kit. They were also more likely to take other  		planning actions, including evaluating their existing insurance coverage to see  		if it covered long-term care, to consult with a financial planner or agent, or  		to look into a reverse mortgage.</p>
<p><b><i>Multivariate Analysis</i></b></p>
<p>Several variables emerged as significant in a multivariate analysis  		explaining factors important in motivating someone to order the Planning Kit.  		Specifically, a variable was constructed to measure ones attitude  		toward planning. As mentioned above, individuals with a planning  		orientation are more likely to have an interest in learning more about  		how they can plan ahead for their long-term care needs.</p>
<p>A variable was also constructed to measure the level of campaign  		exposure. Consistent with other research, multiple exposures to the key  		messages was found to be important and to increase the likelihood that someone  		will request the Planning Kit. These multiple touches could be in the form of  		the initial Governors letter, a media spot, or a follow-up postcard.</p>
<p>The analysis also showed that people who believe that they may someday  		need long-term care are, naturally, more interested in learning more about how  		they can protect themselves from the risks and costs of that event.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, age, being female and being married are all negatively  		related to the probability of ordering a Planning Kit. Younger individuals  		likely have competing needs (e.g., school age children) and may not have begun  		other important planning like general retirement. Perhaps they are likely to  		see long-term care as something they can put off until the event  		seems closer. Other research finds that females and married individuals are  		actually more likely to engage in a variety of long-term care planning  		activities, most notably, buying long-term care insurance. In our survey, they  		may have been less likely to order the Planning Kit because they had already  		begun or were about to begin other planning activities on their own.</p>
<p>Consistent with other research, individuals who having a college degree  		or higher are more likely to take steps to plan ahead for their long-term care  		needs. In our survey, they were more likely to have ordered the Planning  		Kit.</p>
<p>Finally, a more difficult finding to explain is the importance of  		Being a New Jersey resident on the probability of ordering the  		Planning Kit, holding all else equal. The report provides a variety of possible  		explanations, most notably that this may be standing in for a variable we were  		unable to measure (e.g., the amount of private insurance industry activity in a  		state) or might have been influenced by a heightened curiosity among New Jersey  		residents, given the controversy around the Governors office at the time  		of the campaign. </p>
<p>The comparison of responses for the pre-campaign and post-campaign  		survey tells us something about changes in awareness, attitudes and behaviors  		during the timeframe of the campaign. </p>
<p>Looking across time, awareness of planning options, in every case,  		increased between the pre-survey and post-survey interviews. However, the  		percent increase in awareness of a planning option was not found to be  		significantly different between those who received the Planning Kit and those  		who did not. One possible explanation is that, during the campaign, increased  		attention in the market area was focused on the issue of long-term care  		planning, so it is possible that awareness grew as a result of the campaign and  		related activities rather than specifically as a result of the Planning  		Kit.</p>
<p>However, when we look at planning actions under consideration,  		individuals who received the Planning Kit were more likely to report an  		increase in the likelihood that they would consider taking some kind of  		planning action as a result, when compared with those who did not receive the  		Planning Kit. These actions included: consulting with an agent or financial  		planner, moving closer to family or friends or talking to family or friends  		about long-term care issues. </p>
