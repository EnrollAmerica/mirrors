</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>This report to Congress responds to a mandate of the Orphan Drug Act  		(P.L.97-414, Jan. 4, 1983), which called for the Secretary of Health and Human  		Services to conduct demonstration projects to test methods for identifying  		individuals at risk of institutional placement who could be treated more  		cost-effectively with home health and other noninstitutional services. This  		report considers whether it is possible to make community-care programs  		cost-effective by defining the target groups more rigorously. Evidence is  		reviewed from a number of demonstrations, but particularly the results of the  		recently completed National Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration, which  		provides the most complete data available on a large sample of frail elderly  		persons.</p>
<h3>TARGETING PROPOSED AS A SOLUTION</h3>
<p>In recent years, a number of community-based long-term care projects  		have attempted to show that their approach toward service provision can reduce  		nursing home use and improve the quality of care provided in the community.  		Although the programs to date have increased the use of community services and  		have generated beneficial impacts on the well-being of clients, they have not  		reduced public expenditures for long-term care. Better targeting has been  		advanced as a potential solution to the problem of making community-based  		programs cost-neutral, possibly even cost-saving, or, by some definition,  		cost-effective.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness is variously defined as the ability of a program to  		save costs, its ability to generate a specified outcome at the least possible  		cost, or its ability to generate benefits that are worth the costs of producing  		them. A broader view of targeting takes as the objective ensuring that  		appropriate care is rendered to all of the elderly in need, whether their needs  		require institutional or community services. In this sense, a community-care  		program might be considered as cost-effective (even if not cost-saving) if it  		creates a better match between needs and services and increases the use of  		needed services by those who would otherwise have to do without them. This  		definition of cost-effectiveness is more subjective--depending not only on the  		size of the impacts generated by the program for those enrolled, but also on  		the value one places on providing care for the elderly. Whichever definition of  		cost-effectiveness is chosen, a targeting approach is needed that can  		successfully identify those persons for whom the program can best achieve its  		intended impacts.</p>
<h3>DETERMINANTS OF NURSING HOME USE</h3>
<p>Community-care programs are intended to generate cost savings primarily  		by reducing the use of nursing homes; thus, it is important to understand the  		factors that determine nursing home use and how community-care programs affect  		that use by elderly persons with various characteristics. Several factors have  		been shown to be associated directly with nursing home admissions and the  		number of days of nursing home care. Among them are availability of financial  		resources or Medicaid coverage to pay for nursing home care, recent use of  		hospital or nursing home services, and favorable attitudes toward  		institutionalization. There is also recent evidence to suggest that the  		attitudes of family members toward nursing homes and the stress and/or burden  		perceived by caregivers are associated with future admission to nursing homes.  		Although persons in nursing homes are more impaired in terms of Activities of  		Daily Living (eating, transferring, dressing, bathing, and toileting) and  		Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (such as meal preparation,  		housekeeping, and shopping) than those in the community, these impairment  		measures alone have not proved to be effective predictors of <b>subsequent</b>  		nursing home use by persons in the community. Even multiple regression models  		based on a large number of explanatory variables do not successfully predict  		who will enter a nursing home.</p>
<h3>THE TARGETING EXPERIENCE OF DEMONSTRATIONS</h3>
<p>Of the numerous long-term care demonstrations conducted to date, the  		only one that has both enrolled a population who proved to be at high risk of  		nursing home admission and showed significant reductions in nursing home use is  		the South Carolina Community Long Term Care Project. This project was linked to  		a preadmission screening process which identified clients who were certified as  		requiring care at the nursing home level. Even with this extremely selective  		group of elderly persons, the project showed no significant public (i.e.,  		Medicaid and Medicare) cost savings, although it may have essentially been  		cost-neutral.</p>
<p>A more extensive subgroup analysis was undertaken for the National Long  		Term Care Channeling Demonstration, a project that provided case management and  		community-based long-term care services to impaired elderly persons in need of  		assistance. The Channeling demonstration showed significant reductions in  		nursing home use over 12 months only for a few of the groups examined. No  		significant reductions in public costs were associated with any of the  		subgroups. The most notable finding from the subgroup analysis pertains to the  		very small portion of the sample who were not currently eligible for Medicaid  		and were residing in a nursing home (but certified for discharge) at the time  		they entered the demonstration. Evidence indicates that, among this group for  		those with limited financial resources that put them at risk of spending  		down to Medicaid in a nursing home, the basic model of Channeling (which  		provided case management but only limited additional funding for services)  		reduced private costs without increasing public costs. However, this finding is  		based on an extremely small sample, and this group comprised a very small  		fraction of the elderly who were enrolled in community care programs under the  		demonstration.</p>
<p>The findings on the issue of targeting from an analysis of Channeling  		project data can be summarized as follows: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Cost savings, where they were observed, appeared to accrue primarily  			 to private payers rather than to Medicare or Medicaid programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strongest evidence of a reduction in nursing home use was found  			 for persons who were in a nursing home were certified for discharge. A pattern  			 of reductions was also observed for those wait-listed for nursing home  			 admissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only for a few outcomes did any subgroup experience impacts that  			 were statistically different from those experienced by other subgroups;  			 differential impacts among subgroups were the exception rather than the  			 rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most promising results were found for those persons in a nursing  			 home at the screen who had an intermediate level of financial resources  			 whereby, although they were not then currently Medicaid-eligible, they would be  			 eligible within three months if they decided to remain in a nursing home. Even  			 for this group, the cost of operating the case management program and providing  			 community-based services was large enough to preclude significant public cost  			 savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major impact under channeling was a reduction in private  			 expenditures. However, in most cases, the increase in public expenditures  			 greatly exceeded the private cost savings.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>BARRIERS TO THE COST-EFFECTIVE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY  		CARE</h3>
<p>Long-term care expenditures are lower for impaired elderly persons who  		remain in the community than for those who enter nursing homes. Nonetheless,  		community-care demonstration programs which expand services beyond those  		currently available through Medicare, Medicaid, and social service programs  		have not yet shown significant reductions in rates of nursing home use that are  		sufficient to offset increased public expenditures for community services.  		Three primary reasons explain this result:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The cost of case management programs have been substantial for  			 clients of all types, requiring sizable reductions in nursing home use to  			 offset such costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to predict (and hence target) who among an impaired  			 elderly population will enter a nursing home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For elderly persons living in the community, nursing home placement  			 decisions appear to be affected little by the provision of case management and  			 additional community services. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
<p>Research has shown that community-based long-term care programs for the  		elderly can improve the well-being of clients and their satisfaction with  		service arrangements; moreover, the home health care that is currently provided  		under the Medicare and Medicaid programs forms an important segment of the  		continuum of care necessary to meet the varied long-term care needs  		of the elderly population. Case-managed community service programs may reduce  		nursing home use to some degree, but such programs have not yet effectively  		reduced the cost (either total or public) of care for the elderly. Nor is it  		currently possible to fully explain nursing home placement decisions, to  		predict precisely who will enter a nursing home, or to identify persons for  		whom community-care programs will reduce public costs under Medicare and  		Medicaid.</p>
<p>Unless predictors of nursing home use are improved, perhaps through  		further research, any expanded coverage of community-based long-term care  		services is very unlikely to save public expenditures. Case-managed services  		cannot yet be relied upon as a cost-effective vehicle for reducing the use of  		nursing home care. Expanded community-based services can, however, be viewed as  		valuable to the elderly and their families in terms of meeting their needs in  		the community and such programs are perhaps best judged by the benefit they  		provide to those in the community rather than by their small impacts on nursing  		home use.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the costs while maximizing the benefits of any  		expanded community service program, Congress may wish to consider the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>Administering case management programs through existing mechanisms  		  (e.g., existing State agencies or health care providers) rather than through  		  separate case management agencies</li>
<li>Linking program outreach functions to nursing home preadmission  		  screening programs, nursing home discharge planning programs, or other  		  process-oriented mechanisms, in order to enroll groups who are more likely to  		  enter nursing homes</li>
<li>Limiting eligibility to those with long-term care needs who are least  		  able to afford it themselves, and who are thus most likely to incur Medicaid  		  costs.</li>
</ul><p>There are a number of possible directions for the nation's evolving  		long-term care policy. Among the issues that merit further study and  		consideration are the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that the level of burden perceived by  			 caregivers and their willingness to provide care are important factors in  			 nursing home placement decisions. It is possible that the provision of respite  			 or other support services to caregivers could be cost-effective. Strengthening  			 the viability of informal caregivers merits additional attention in examining  			 approaches to avoid nursing home placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further analysis of the relationship between supply factors and  			 variations in the use of long-term care services may improve our understanding  			 of the overall long-term care service network. Since many States are  			 controlling growth in the number of nursing home beds, it is important to  			 ensure that adequate community or institutional services be made available to  			 the growing elderly population. More research into the appropriate mix of  			 institutional and community services is warranted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative payment models in which a single provider assumes  			 responsibility for a full range of acute and long-term care services under a  			 prospectively determined fixed budget must be tested more fully. In such  			 models, the provider has strong financial incentives to furnish the most  			 cost-effective array of institutional and noninstitutional services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The findings of the South Carolina project suggest that preadmission  			 screening systems are promising approaches for identifying patients who are at  			 high risk of institutionalization. Additional study should be undertaken to  			 determine whether the South Carolina results are generalizable to other States  			 and populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs that concentrate large amounts of services on persons who  			 are at risk of high cost episodes of care should be analyzed further.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is no simple solution to the long-term care problem that will  		enable us simultaneously to cut costs and to greatly improve the services  		available to the elderly. Research and demonstration projects have, however,  		provided a wealth of information on the long-term rare needs of the elderly and  		the effects of programs designed to assist them. This information, if refined  		by continued research, can provide a basis for making the choices necessary to  		design a national long-term care policy that will best meet the needs of the  		elderly within inevitable budgetary constraints.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This report to Congress responds to a mandate under the Orphan Drug Act  		(P.L.97-414, Jan. 4, 1983) which directed the Secretary of Health and Human  		Services to develop and carry out demonstration projects to test methods for  		identifying patients at risk of institutionalization who could be treated more  		cost-effectively with home health services and other noninstitutional health  		services. It summarizes the experience of recent demonstration projects in  		terms of their capacity to identify persons who are likely to use nursing home  		services, and it provides the results of a study designed to identify persons  		for whom community-based services could be a cost-effective alternative to  		institutional care. The report focuses particularly on the evidence generated  		by the recently completed National Long Term Care Channeling demonstration  		(referred to as Channeling in this report), which employed the largest sample  		of all such interventions to date and offers the most complete information yet  		available, not only on the use of long-term care services but also on the  		public and private expenditures devoted to such services for an impaired  		elderly population.</p>
<p><a href="#background">Chapter I</a> describes community-based long term  		care alternatives and discusses issues associated with targeting such services  		toward those at risk of nursing home placement. <a href="#what">Chapter II</a>  		reviews evidence from Channeling and other demonstrations on the determinants  		of nursing home use and the ability to identify persons who are at high risk of  		nursing home placement. <a href="#target">Chapter III</a> discusses the results  		of a series of long-term care demonstrations which attempted to target  		community services. It also describes the results of a study that simulated  		screening criteria for a community care program. <a href="#conclude">Chapter  		IV</a> concludes the report by discussing the potential for achieving  		cost-effective community-based long-term care programs through targeting.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">I. BACKGROUND AND ISSUES</a></h2>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Methods for delivering and coordinating long-term care services in the  		community have long received attention by policymakers, advocates for the  		elderly, and researchers. In recent years, such interest has intensified,  		partly in response to the recognized need for long-term care by the nation's  		growing elderly population, partly in response to concerns about the rising  		public and private costs of nursing home care, and partly in response to the  		preferences of many of the elderly to remain at home rather than being placed  		in a nursing home.</p>
<p>Rapid growth in the use of and expenditures devoted to institutional  		long-term care which followed the advent of the Medicaid program in the  		mid-1960s raised concerns that too much long-term care was being provided in  		nursing homes. Several studies undertaken in the 1970s found that many persons  		in nursing homes appeared to differ little from many community residents in  		terms of their functional capacity and apparent need for assistance. These  		studies raised an important question: If a significant number of nursing home  		residents could live at home, might not costs be saved and the well-being of  		the elderly improved by used limited public support to maintain such persons in  		the community.</p>
<p>A number of projects designed to test the feasibility of community-based  		alternatives to nursing homes were conducted, and the results of many of them  		are now available. These demonstrations have included provision of expanded  		community-based services (such as personal care, homemaker services, and  		home-delivered meals), often through Medicare and Medicaid waivers. In  		addition, the demonstrations have attempted to provide both a central point of  		contact and case management services to help the elderly and their families  		deal with a system of community long-term care that is often viewed as  		fragmented and difficult to understand.</p>
<p>While these projects were generally successful at providing additional  		community-based services, they yielded little evidence that they reduced the  		cost of caring for the elderly. Most of the projects enrolled populations that  		included persons who did not turn at a out to be high risk of nursing home  		placement. In recognition of this fact, the National Long Term Care Channeling  		demonstration limited eligibility to a highly impaired group of elderly persons  		in need of assistance; yet, even for this group, the fraction of the control  		group who entered nursing homes om the first 6 months was below 11 percent.  		This report further explores whether indeed it is possible to target program  		eligibility so as to identify a group for whom the provision of community-based  		services can reduce nursing home use sufficiently to justify the costs of the  		program.</p>
<h3>THE GROWING COST OF NURSING HOME CARE</h3>
<p>A salient and frequently noted fact pertaining to future needs for  		long-term care is the high rate of growth of the elderly population. The  		percentage of the U.S. population over 85 years of age is expected to rise from  		1.1 percent in 1985 to 1.8 percent in 2000, to 2.8 percent in the year  		2030.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> Because this  		group of old old uses long-term care services to a much greater  		extent than do the elderly as a whole, we can expect to observe rapidly growing  		demand for long-term care in the coming years. The growing demand for long-term  		care services is not in dispute; but the best approach for dealing with such  		need has been a topic of much controversy.</p>
<p>The bulk of public funding for long-term care has been devoted to  		institutional care. Since the start of the Medicaid and Medicare programs,  		total spending for nursing home care has grown from $2.1billion in 1965 to  		$32.0 billion in 1984.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup>  		After adjustments for price changes, this amounts to a real compound rate of  		growth of 7.5 percent per year. Nursing homes currently account for about 9.4  		percent of total U.S. personal health expenditures. The Medicaid program pays  		nearly half of these costs, though an increasing share of Medicaid nursing home  		expenditures (now about 29 percent) is devoted to intermediate care facilities  		for the mentally retarded, irrespective of age, rather than for the impaired  		elderly. Medicare expenditures for nursing homes, primarily for post-hospital  		short-term stays, constitute less than 5 percent of the amount spent by  		Medicaid. Factors accounting for the expenditure increases include inflation,  		population growth, increases in real costs, availability of public funds,  		expanded coverage of public programs (such as Medicaid coverage of intermediate  		care facilities for the mentally retarded), and increased use of nursing home  		care by the elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In recent years (1982-1984) the growth of government expenditures for  		nursing homes has slowed somewhat, and the share of nursing home expenditures  		financed by public programs has fallen from 56 percent in 1979 to 49 percent in  		1984.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Efforts at  		controlling costs have come largely from the States, many of which have limited  		the number of nursing home beds and have controlled the rates of Medicaid  		reimbursement. However, these regulatory approaches to controlling nursing home  		costs may fail to limit use in the most rational way, as nursing homes may  		choose to limit the admission of difficult patients (for whom costs are  		greater) and Medicaid patients (for whom reimbursement is lowest).  		Consequently, States are beginning to develop case-mix-based methods of nursing  		home reimbursement to compensate providers more fully for the costs of serving  		heavy-care patients. But the tighter nursing home market, coupled with the  		pressures of Medicares prospective payment system to limit hospital  		stays, is placing greater demands on the community service system.</p>
<h3>COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM</h3>
<p>Public initiatives in community-based long-term care include a diverse  		set of programs and services. The current system, which varies widely among  		localities, includes funding from Medicare and Medicaid for home health  		services (nursing, therapies, and home health aide); social service block  		grants used for a variety of services, including personal and homemaker care;  		federal funds provided under the Older Americans Act for social services and  		meals; and various State and local public and private charitable programs for  		all these and other services (which may include transportation, meals on  		wheels, companion and chore services, and respite care).</p>
<p>Formal providers of community-based long-term care include certified  		home health agencies (which may be visiting nurse associations, other private  		nonprofit agencies, governmental agencies, proprietary firms, or hospital-based  		home health agencies), nonprofit or proprietary home care providers, and  		voluntary meals-on-wheels programs. In many places, local Area Agencies on  		Aging (funded under Title III of the Older Americans Act) serve as a referral  		point, help arrange for services, and administer a limited amount of government  		funds for social services and meals.</p>
<p>Informal providers--the families and friends of the elderly--are very  		important providers of long-term care services in the community. A large share  		of personal care, homemaking, and meals services for the impaired elderly is  		provided by family members and friends who receive no monetary compensation.  		Close relatives are consistently reported to be important caregivers and a key  		factor in delaying institutionalization. The extent to which the long-term care  		needs of the elderly are met, and the cost of meeting them, depends on whether  		the elderly and their families choose to provide informal care, prefer to rely  		on formal community-based services, or select nursing home placement. Public  		long-term care policies and programs work largely by constraining or  		influencing these choices which, in turn, determine the cost-effectiveness of  		the existing long-term care system.</p>
<h3>PROBLEMS WITH THE LONG-TERM CARE SYSTEM<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></h3>
<p>The large increase in the demand for long-term care services signaled by  		demographic trends would probably impose strains on even a smoothly functioning  		system, but observers have expressed serious reservations about the capacity of  		the current long-term care system to respond appropriately. Many believe that  		the system fails to provide an efficient match of services to individual needs.  		For every older person in a nursing home, for example, it has been estimated  		that between one and three who reside in the community require an equivalent  		level of care.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> And,  		although there has been some increase in the necessary level of care exhibited  		by nursing home residents,<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> it was estimated that, as recently as 1979,  		between 10 and 40 percent of those in nursing homes were placed at a higher  		than necessary level of care.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The apparent difficulty of linking services to individual needs is  		thought to be the consequence of two basic problems. The first is that older  		persons with long-term care needs and their families and formal caregivers  		frequently lack information about what services are necessary, where they can  		be obtained, and what programs the in-need persons are eligible for. The  		programs that provide services to the elderly are administered by a diverse  		group of Federal, State, and local agencies; there is no single person or  		organization that an elderly person or his or her family can rely on to  		identify, arrange, provide, and monitor the entire package of services needed  		by an individual.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> The  		lack of coordination between medical and social services is particularly  		evident. Critics have argued that it can be so difficult for an impaired  		elderly person and his or her family to gain access to and coordinate the  		services necessary for living in the community that he or she may enter a  		nursing home because it is the simplest alternative available; still others  		remain in the community without adequate help.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The second problem of the long-term care system concerns the financial  		incentives implicit in public programs. Medicaid, which accounts for the bulk  		of the government financing for long-term care services, contains strong  		incentives to use institutional rather than community care.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> In many States, persons who are  		not eligible for funded services in the community are eligible for  		institutional care under Medicaid. The impaired elderly who have incomes or  		assets just above Medicaid eligibility levels for community care may not have  		enough income to meet their medical and nonmedical needs; for them, asset  		depletion and eventual use of Medicaid-funded institutional care may be the  		only alternative.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As with any insurance program, Medicare, the major source of financing  		for medical services for the elderly, also creates incentives to substitute  		covered services for uncovered ones. Medicare covers only medically oriented  		care, encouraging a substitution of relatively expensive medical services for  		less expensive nonmedical services that in some cases would be equally if not  		more appropriate. In many States, nursing home reimbursement rates have been  		held down, and limits have been placed on the construction and expansion of  		nursing homes. Consequently, the shortage of nursing home beds has led to a  		situation in which some of the functionally impaired elderly remain in acute  		care facilities at higher public cost while awaiting nursing home admission,  		even though they no longer exhibit an acute medical problem.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> The introduction of Medicare's  		prospective payment system involving Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) as a basis  		for hospital reimbursement provides powerful incentives for earlier hospital  		discharges; this situation is likely to increase the necessary level of care of  		patients who are discharged from hospitals and should add to the demand for  		nursing home care.</p>
<h3>OVERVIEW OF LONG-TERM CARE INTERVENTIONS</h3>
<p>Numerous approaches for alleviating the problems of the long-term care  		system have been advanced. Public financing options include block grants,  		insurance, closed-ended or capped funding, and a variety of income transfer  		strategies; private financing options, such as long-term care insurance and  		IRA-type saving plans for long-term care, have also been proposed. Proposals  		for changing benefits and services generally involve incremental modifications  		to the existing public programs. Organizational options are designed to  		rationalize service delivery at the client or system level by creating an  		organization that serves as a single point of contact for those who seek  		community-based long-term care services. Various types of organizations have  		been proposed, and some have been or are currently being tested in  		demonstration projects. They include case management agencies, community  		long-term care centers, and social/health maintenance organizations.</p>
<p>The greatest attention has been focused on programs that provide case  		management and additional community services. This approach has been tested in  		a series of demonstrations undertaken throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.  		A series of projects conducted during the early and mid-1970s examined the  		hypothetical services that the elderly needed to remain in the community. These  		early studies examined the types of elderly who appeared to be at risk of  		nursing home placement, judged the services that they would need to remain in  		the community, and estimated the costs of this hypothetical package of  		services. The service packages were then compared with the costs of nursing  		home care, and the results generally suggested that impaired individuals could  		be served in the community at a cost equal to or lower than the cost in  		institutions. Proponents of in-home care used these results to argue that  		in-home care was cost-effective. However, doubt was cast on their validity  		because the comparisons relied on the unreasonable assumption that all  		community-care clients would be in nursing homes if they did not receive the  		in-home care.</p>
<p>A series of research demonstrations have been designed to address this  		concern.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> Since 1973,  		some 16 research projects, culminating in the National Long Term Care  		Channneling Demonstration, have been implemented to test community-based  		long-term care alternatives. These projects typically made efforts to select  		participants at risk of nursing home placement, considerably expanded the  		amount of community-based care available to those in need of long-term care,  		and provided case management to coordinate services. Although these studies  		varied along several key dimensions (such as the type of intervention  		implemented, their approach to identifying and recruiting clients, and their  		research designs), each had as its major objective a reduction in unnecessary  		institutionalization. Many of the studies also emphasized reductions in  		hospital use, and several (New York City, Project Open, and San Diego) included  		specific targeting criteria in this area.</p>
<p>A review of the results across these studies indicates that although  		several projects reported modest reductions in nursing home use for program  		clients (Georgia, Wisconsin, ACCESS, Washington, On Lok, and Channeling) in  		only two studies were these reductions statistically significant (Nursing Home  		Without Walls and South Carolina). Of these two projects, the South Carolina  		Community Long Term Care Project implemented a more rigorous research design  		and an intervention that differed from most of the other demonstrations, and is  		thus particularly pertinent to the targeting question.</p>
<p>Participation in the South Carolina Community Long Term Care Project  		(CLTC) was limited to individuals who were eligible for Medicaid-sponsored  		nursing home benefits and were certified as eligible for nursing home level of  		care in an SNF or ICF. The South Carolina demonstration was estimated to have  		reduced nursing home use by 31 percent (101 days per client) over 3 years.  		However, even for this sample, the control group spent only half of its  		participation time in a nursing home. The South Carolina project was fairly  		restrictive in terms of authorizing expanded community services. Expanded  		services were made available only after all nonproject services were exhausted.  		CLTC also employed a utilization review team to examine the services that were  		authorized and to ensure that costs were below a cap set at 75 percent of the  		nursing home cost. The program showed no significant impact on total public  		costs (Medicare, Medicaid, and CLTC program), suggesting that the program could  		be provided at little or no additional public cost.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> Thus, the South Carolina Study  		provides some evidence that coordinated community-oriented long-term care  		programs can reduce nursing home use <b>if</b> projects are targeted toward  		individuals who require a nursing home level of care and who would be  		Medicaid-eligible if they were in a nursing home.</p>
<p>The National Long Term Care Channeling demonstration also targeted a  		very impaired group of elderly persons, but had a much more diverse set of  		referral sources than South Carolina's preadmission screen. Channeling was  		typical of community-care demonstrations in that it provided outreach,  		screening, assessment, care planning, service monitoring, and reassessment. Two  		models were tested. The <b>basic model</b> offered case management and limited  		services within the existing system; the <b>financial control model</b> enabled  		case managers to authorize community-based services within a structured care  		plan and pay for such services with program funds.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> The following findings summarize the effects  		of channeling:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The costs of expanding case management and community services beyond  			 what was available in the existing system were not offset by reductions in  			 nursing home or other costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite success in targeting an extremely frail population,  			 Channeling did not identify a population who was at high risk of nursing home  			 placement, and did not substantially reduce nursing home use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling increased the use of formal community services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Channeling population was frequently hospitalized and used  			 physicians and other medical services to a great extent. Channeling did not  			 affect the use of these types of services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither model had a major effect on informal caregiving, although  			 the financial control model led to small reductions in some areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling increased the satisfaction of informal caregivers with  			 service arrangements and their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the most part, Channeling did not affect measures of client  			 functioning, although there was some evidence of reduced physical functioning  			 among clients under the financial control model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling reduced unmet needs, increased clients' confidence in  			 their receipt of care, and increased their satisfaction with life.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>TARGETING COMMUNITY CARE</h3>
<p>The results of the major community-care demonstrations suggest that such  		programs are not likely to be cost-saving if they do not target services  		effectively to a population that is actually at high risk of admission to a  		nursing home. Consequently, it is important to determine whether groups exist  		for whom community-care programs produce substantial beneficial impacts or cost  		savings and, if so, how such persons can best be identified. Before proceeding  		to a more detailed analysis of the determinants of nursing home use and the  		likely outcomes of various targeting criteria, it is useful to set forth the  		objectives of targeting and develop a definition of cost-effectiveness against  		which outcomes can be evaluated.</p>
<p><b><i>Program Objectives and Cost-Effectiveness</i></b></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness is best measured against clearly specified program  		objectives. The broad objectives of community-care programs for the elderly  		have been variously described:</p>
<ul><li>To reduce nursing home use</li>
<li>To improve the match between needs and services</li>
<li>To improve the health and well-being of the long-term care  		  population</li>
<li>To maximize the independence of the long-term care population</li>
<li>To relieve the burden imposed on informal caregivers</li>
<li>To reduce total (public and private) expenditures on long-term  		  care</li>
<li>To reduce public expenditures on long-term care</li>
<li>To relieve excessive financial burdens on long-term care patients and  		  their families</li>
</ul><p>These statements of overlapping program objectives fall short of  		capturing any precise definition of program cost-effectiveness. There are three  		possible alternatives.</p>
<p>The first definition, which is commonly used by government budget  		analysts, is what we shall call <b>fiscal cost-effectiveness</b>. By this we  		mean that the program saves public dollars compared with what would occur in  		its absence. One measure of fiscal cost-effectiveness is the ratio of the  		public dollars that are saved to the dollars that are spent on the program.  		Under this definition, a community-care program would be cost-effective for an  		individual only if it reduced public nursing home expenditures by at least as  		much as the increase in public expenditures for community services.</p>
<p>The second definition pertains to program outcomes--<b>programmatic  		cost-effectiveness</b>. One program is considered more cost-effective than  		another if it achieves the same objectives at lower cost. For example, a  		program that reduced nursing home use by 10 percent would be less  		cost-effective than one which achieved the same reduction in some other, less  		expensive way. Measures of programmatic cost-effectiveness for community care  		would include a reduction in nursing home days per dollar spent and a reduction  		in the number of unmet needs per dollar spent. Within a targeting context, one  		would wish to identify those for whom the intended program impacts are the  		greatest per dollar spent.</p>
<p>The third possible definition is what we term <b>social  		cost-effectiveness</b>. This broader definition of cost-effectiveness answers  		the following question: Are the program benefits worth the additional costs of  		generating them? For community-based long-term care programs, this approach  		would consider both private and public costs and would also account for the  		value and costs of informal care. By this definition, a community-based  		long-term care program could be cost-effective even if it did not affect  		nursing home use at all, provided that the benefits to those in the community  		were worth the cost. This is, perhaps, the most appropriate definition for  		policy making purposes, but it is also the most difficult to measure.  		Evaluating social cost-effectiveness requires placing a subjective value on  		such outcomes as the quality of care and the satisfaction of the elderly with  		their lives and environment. Empirical research in this area can at best  		identify costs and benefits so as to provide a basis for policymakers' value  		judgments.</p>
<p><b><i>Targeting Efficiency</i></b></p>
<p>Whether a program is cost-effective according to any of these measures  		depends to a large degree on the extent to which the program includes those  		persons for whom it is best able to achieve its intended impacts. Targeting  		(screening) criteria must be based on the observable characteristics of  		individuals in the population considered for program eligibility. A good  		targeting variable is one that distinguishes persons for whom the program is  		effective from those for whom it is not.</p>
<p>Thus, the cost savings achieved by a program are determined by:</p>
<ul><li>The cost of providing the benefits to each person enrolled (program  		  cost)</li>
<li>The savings achieved for each person enrolled (program effectiveness  		  and expected cost savings)</li>
<li>The number of persons who meet the eligibility criteria and are  		  enrolled</li>
</ul><p>In practice, a targeting approach may rely on multiple characteristics  		and involve complicated combinations of several targeting variables. But any  		efficient targeting plan must take into account these three determining  		factors. We briefly discuss each as they apply to targeting community-based  		long-term care.</p>
<p><b>Program Cost</b>. In terms of community-based long-term care  		programs, both case management and service costs are important. Case-management  		costs for outreach, screening, assessment, and care planning may not vary much  		from client to client, although some clients will require a greater degree of  		monitoring resources over time. But service costs may vary significantly among  		clients, depending on the client's needs and the availability of informal help.  		Thus, for the program to be considered cost-effective, much smaller impacts on  		institutionalization may be required to justify serving persons with low  		service needs than are required to justify serving those with high service  		needs--though larger percentage reductions in nursing home use might be  		required, since those with low service needs will tend to use nursing homes  		less.</p>
<p><b>Program Effectiveness and Expected Cost Savings</b>. Just as program  		costs may depend on the client's characteristics, so may the expected costs  		saved. For community-care programs, cost savings are expected primarily from a  		reduction in the use of nursing home and, perhaps, hospital services. Nursing  		home costs can be extremely large, and the potential for substituting community  		services for nursing home care is greater than for acute hospital services. For  		these reasons, the ability of a targeting variable to discriminate between  		those who are likely to use and those who are unlikely to use nursing home  		services is very important. In <a href="#what">Chapter II</a> of this report,  		we examine evidence of what causes impaired elderly persons to enter and to  		continue to stay in nursing homes.</p>
<p>It is not enough, however, simply to identify groups that exhibit high  		nursing home use rates. It is even more important that the targeting criteria  		identify groups whose use rates could be <b>reduced</b> by the program. For  		example, although the extremely severely impaired groups may exhibit the  		highest nursing home use rate, many persons in this group may have been  		appropriately placed in nursing homes; thus, in concept at least, case-managed  		community-care programs might be less likely to reduce nursing home use in this  		group than for less severely impaired individuals. The potential for cost  		savings is greatest for groups that have <b>both</b> high nursing home use  		rates <b>and</b> large proportionate responses to community-care services.</p>
<p><b>Number of Persons Eligible</b>. Total cost savings depend, of course,  		on the number of clients for whom cost savings are possible or for whom other  		desired program impacts (such as a reduction in unmet needs) are achievable. An  		important part of this issue is whether a sufficiently large number of persons  		are available for whom the program goals are achievable to warrant establishing  		a community-care program. There may be a minimal optimal scale for such  		programs, below which the number of clients served is so low as to make  		administrative costs per client prohibitively high.</p>
<p><b><i>Targeting Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>The ultimate objective is to develop criteria that can be used to  		determine who should be screened in and who should be screened out of  		community-care programs. The desirable characteristics of targeting criteria  		include the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Efficiency</b>. Criteria should be established to screen in  			 persons whom the program is intended to serve and screen out those for whom  			 services would not contribute to achieving the program goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Objectivity</b>. Criteria should be well defined in a way that  			 permits trained assessment staff to determine, without undue personal judgment,  			 whether a potential client is eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Integrity</b>. The criteria should not be subject to manipulation  			 by either potential clients or local program staff. They should be based on  			 facts that can be audited by impartial outsiders.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The screening criteria for including or excluding a person from the  		program may be simple or complex and can take any of several possible forms.  		Possible criteria can range from a single characteristic to scores based on  		multiple characteristics that are associated with, for example, expected cost  		savings and other desired outcomes. Emphasizing targeting methods that meet the  		above criteria, we review evidence for a wide range of possible screening  		criteria in the chapters that follow.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER SUMMARY</h3>
<p>In recent years, a number of community-based long-term care projects  		have attempted to show that such programs can reduce nursing home use and its  		associated public expenditures while improving the well-being of the elderly  		participants. Programs to date have increased the use of community services and  		have produced beneficial impacts on the well-being of clients, but have not  		shown reductions in public expenditures. Nonetheless, it has been suggested  		that programs might be cost neutral, or possibly even cost-saving, if they were  		targeted more effectively toward persons who are at risk of nursing home  		placement.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness has been defined variously to mean cost-savings, a  		specified outcome generated at the least possible cost, or benefits that are  		worth the costs of generating them. By any definition, a community-care program  		is likely to be cost-effective only if it can identify and serve those persons  		for whom the program best achieves its intended impacts. Because the intended  		cost saving of community-care programs is expected to come primarily through  		reduced nursing home use, it is important to understand the factors that affect  		institutionalization and how nursing home use by various types of elderly  		persons is affected by community-care programs.</p>
<h2><a name="what" id="what">II. WHAT DETERMINES NURSING HOME USE?</a></h2>
<p>Community-based long-term care programs are designed to save costs  		primarily by reducing nursing home use. Understanding the factors that prompt  		the elderly and their families to select nursing home placement over other  		alternatives is important if such programs are to be successful at providing  		services to a high-risk population, and if we are to design policy  		interventions that will cost-effectively divert such persons from nursing home  		placement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to review evidence on the determinants of  		nursing home use. The best evidence on the predictors of nursing home use comes  		from longitudinal studies which examine a population before  		institutionalization occurs and estimate the determinants of <b>subsequent</b>  		nursing home use by that population. A key question for targeting community  		care is the following: What characteristics can be used to identify a  		population at high risk of nursing home placement prior to nursing home  		admission? For purposes of targeting community-care programs, it is also  		important to determine how well we can predict nursing home use with the  		information available at the time of program entry. Several studies have used  		longitudinal data to investigate the determinants of nursing home use (see  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Each of these studies has examined a sample  		drawn from a population thought to be at risk of nursing home placement and has  		followed that sample for a period of time in an attempt to identify differences  		between those who subsequently enter nursing homes and those who do not.</p>
<h3>IMPAIRMENT</h3>
<p>Nearly all the studies that have addressed the issue have found  		differences in physical or mental impairment between those who are in nursing  		homes and those who are in the community. The measures commonly examined are an  		individual's level of disability and impairment according to his or her ability  		to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of  		Daily Living (IADL). ADL impairment scores include eating, transferring from  		bed, toileting, dressing, and bathing. IADL impairment scores include preparing  		meals, performing housework, shopping, traveling, taking medicine, managing  		money, and using the telephone. Those in nursing homes are, on average, more  		impaired along ADL and IADL measures. For example, when the characteristics of  		Channeling sample members in nursing homes are compared with those of the other  		members of the Channeling demonstration sample, the frequency of ADL and IADL  		impairment is much greater among the nursing home residents. Nonetheless, many  		very impaired persons live in the community. For example, nearly half the  		Channeling sample who lived in the community were unable to dress themselves  		(see <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Disability in ADL shows up in several longitudinal studies as a  		predictor of nursing home use (see <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>). But the  		Channeling data (Grannemann and Grossman, 1986b) failed to show a direct  		relationship between ADL impairment and subsequent nursing home use once other  		factors were controlled for by multiple regression methods. The severely ADL  		disabled had more hospital days and fewer survival days but had no more nursing  		home days than did other sample members. Impairment in IADL shows up in only  		one study (Branch and Jette, 1982) as a predictor of subsequent nursing home  		use, a result that was not found in the Channeling data. Cognitive impairment  		has been identified by several studies as a predictor of nursing home use. The  		Channeling data confirmed this finding, but the relationship between cognitive  		impairment and subsequent nursing home use was limited to those who were  		already in a nursing home at randomization; it did not hold for the Channeling  		sample of elderly who were living in the community at the time of  		randomization. In short, cognitive, ADL, and IADL measures may be useful in  		identifying a highly impaired population, but they are not sufficiently strong  		predictors to identify a group at high risk of nursing home placement among  		those in the community.</p>
<p>In none of the studies was health status a predictor of subsequent  		nursing home use, although measures of health status were found to be good  		predictors of survival. None of eight specific health conditions reported in  		the Channeling study was significantly associated with nursing home days in a  		multiple regression analysis.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> Nor were self-reported health status,  		reported bed-bound days, or reported recent change in health conditions useful  		predictors of subsequent nursing home use.</p>
<h3>CONTACT WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM</h3>
<p>Contact with the health care system is an important explanatory factor  		in nursing home use. In the Channeling sample, those who were already on a  		nursing home waitlist were much more likely to have a nursing home admission  		and averaged an estimated 42 more nursing home days in the year following  		randomization than did the rest of the sample.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> The number of days in a hospital in the two  		months prior to randomization was also directly associated with subsequent  		nursing home use. The Wan and Weissert findings agree with the Channeling  		findings--that those with recent hospital stays used nursing homes to a greater  		extent--though there was no evidence in their study, as there was with  		Channeling, that persons with previous nursing home use had greater subsequent  		nursing home use.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>ATTITUDES TOWARD INSTITUTIONALIZATION</h3>
<p>The little evidence that is available indicates that attitudes toward  		living in a nursing home can affect the likelihood of  		institutionalization.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup>  		The self-reported preference for staying in the community rather than entering  		a nursing home was a factor in determining the likelihood of nursing home  		admission and the days of care. Channeling sample members who reported at  		baseline that they would not consider entering a nursing home used 48 percent  		fewer days of nursing home care than those who said they <b>would</b> consider  		moving to a nursing home depending upon their health condition and the  		availability of care at home. However, a willingness to consider nursing home  		placement may have been an indicator of increased disability and an  		unsatisfactory situation in the community. Thus, an expressed willingness to  		consider placement may reflect other determinants in addition to underlying  		attitudes.</p>
<h3>FINANCIAL RESOURCES</h3>
<p>Those with sufficient financial resources to pay for nursing home care  		are more likely to choose nursing home placement. In the Channeling  		demonstration, reported financial assets were directly associated with nursing  		home use; sample members with over $10,000 in financial assets at baseline  		spent an average of 27 more days in a nursing home in the following 12 months  		than those with fewer assets. This may reflect better access to nursing homes  		among those who are able to enter as private-pay patients and, perhaps, a  		willingness of those who can afford to do so to pay for others to take care of  		their elderly family members. However, no significant differences were observed  		for income or home ownership.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, cross-section studies typically find that nursing home  		residents tend to have fewer financial assets and lower incomes than do elderly  		in the community. This finding may reflect the spend-down or transfer of assets  		that often occurs prior to nursing home placement, and low asset levels that  		have been depleted by nursing home expenses. For the Channeling sample,  		Medicaid eligibility was associated with greater nursing home use when income  		and asset levels were controlled statistically. Thus, nursing home use does  		appear to be responsive to the public and private financial resources available  		for nursing home care.</p>
<h3>ETHNIC BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Most studies show that nursing home residents are disproportionately  		white when compared with the elderly population in the community. In the  		Channeling sample, for example, 80 percent of those in nursing homes six months  		following entry into the demonstration were white; 72 percent of those  		remaining in the community were white. This difference by ethnicity is  		consistent across studies but; it is not clear how much of the difference is  		due to cultural and sociological factors and how much is due to economic  		differences among ethnic groups.</p>
<h3>THE ROLE OF INFORMAL CAREGIVERS</h3>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that most older persons who need care receive  		some, if not most, of it from family and friends; in the Channeling sample, 90  		percent of the elderly were able to identify a primary informal  		caregiver.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> Because  		informal caregivers provide or arrange for a large share of long-term care in  		the community, it is important to understand what factors determine the amount  		of care provided by informal caregivers and how informal caregivers affect the  		institutional placement decision.</p>
<p><b><i>Predictors of Caregiving Efforts</i></b></p>
<p>The most consistent predictors of the level of caregiving effort in  		Channeling were the elderly care recipients' degree of impairment, their living  		arrangements, their familial relationship with the primary caregiver, and the  		caregiver's employment status. The elderly person's frailty or need for care  		was also associated with greater caregiving effort. The closeness of the  		kinship relationship is positively associated with caregiving effort; spouses  		and, to a lesser extent, daughters and daughters-in-law provided more hours of  		care than did other informal caregivers. Finally, the number of hours worked  		per week by caregivers was found to be inversely related to the hours of  		informal care they provided.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Burdens on Informal Caregivers</i></b></p>
<p>Caregiving activities do impose burdens on the caregivers. The  		Channeling results show that the number of hours of care provided per week  		affects self-reported measures of caregiving burden and perceived strain; it is  		especially constraining on the caregiver's personal life. Close kin,  		particularly spouses and daughters, also generally experience more personal  		limitations and strain than do less closely associated informal caregivers.  		Limitations in the caregiver's life and his or her reported strain are also  		associated with the quality of the interaction with the care recipient (how  		well the caregiver and care recipient get along and the problems of caregivers  		in dealing with the behavior of the care recipient). The primary informal  		caregivers' personal lives and sense of well-being are also directly affected  		by both the level of and declines in the elderly person's functional  		capacity.</p>
<p>The level of caregiving effort is only modestly associated with the  		caregivers' employment experience. Currently or recently employed caregivers  		reported some restrictions in their employment opportunities, although those  		who worked fewer hours were those who reported more employment restrictions.  		Caregivers who were daughters of the elderly sample member experienced  		significantly more employment limitations than did those who were more  		distantly related caregivers, reinforcing the belief that daughters sometimes  		sacrifice opportunities for employment in order to provide long-term care to  		their elderly parents.</p>
<p>Elderly persons with caregivers who experienced more than average  		emotional strain exhibited a greater likelihood of nursing home admission and a  		greater total number of nursing-home days--suggesting that nursing home  		placement may be chosen as one way to alleviate such strain. The level of  		caregiving effort in terms of the hours of care that were provided was directly  		associated with the decision to place an elderly person in an institution,  		though hours of care was found to be less important in explaining  		institutionalization than were measures of emotional strain.</p>
<p>When asked the reasons that their elderly family member or friend had  		been placed in a nursing home, informal caregivers pointed to the generally  		high level of care required and the increased demands for care associated with  		the deteriorating health of the elderly person.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> Also frequently mentioned was the inability  		of the caregiver to continue to provide care--because of exhaustion, poor  		health, or stress. </p>
<p><b><i>Effects of Caregiving on Nursing Home Use</i></b></p>
<p>Several studies have found that availability of informal support in the  		community reduces the probability of institutionalization.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> The Channeling experience  		showed, for example, that elderly persons who live alone in the community  		without informal support or without outside contacts are more likely to be  		admitted to a nursing home.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> Moreover, elderly who receive care from  		their spouse or children have lower nursing home admission rates, and they use  		fewer days of nursing home care subsequently, than do those who are cared for  		by more distantly related or unrelated caregivers. Conversely, elderly persons  		are more likely to be admitted and/or to spend more days in nursing homes if  		their caregivers provide more hours of care, report that their ability to  		accept paid employment is more restricted, or experience greater emotional  		strain from their caregiving responsibilities.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Multiple regression studies provide evidence that informal caregivers  		help reduce nursing home use.<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup> This is particularly true when spouses are  		the primary source of informal care. While spouses provide more care and  		experience greater personal limitations and strain, particularly emotional  		strain, than do many other types of caregivers, they seem better able to avoid  		nursing home placement for their husbands or wives. And children who are the  		primary source of informal care more often reduce nursing home use by their  		elderly parent than is true of more distant kin or friends.</p>
<h3>NURSING HOME RESIDENTS CERTIFIED FOR RELEASE</h3>
<p>The Channeling experience indicates that nursing home residents who  		applied for Channeling and who were certified for release were similar to  		sample members who lived in the community in terms of impairment, though they  		were more likely to have an acute medical condition and unmet needs for medical  		treatment upon their release. This group also reported more financial assets  		than did Channeling participants who were living in the community at baseline.  		This group was also more likely than those in the community to have a community  		living arrangement characterized as alone without informal support.</p>
<h3>ABILITY TO PREDICT INSTITUTIONALIZATION</h3>
<p>While statistical differences exist between the characteristics of  		elderly persons who live in nursing homes and those who live in the community,  		and while it is possible to identify some of the factors that contribute to  		nursing home placement, research has not shown us how to predict with any  		precision who will enter a nursing home and who will not. The multiple  		regression studies of predictors of nursing home use all report relatively low  		R<sup>2</sup> statistics--indicating that only a small fraction of the  		variation in institutionalization can be explained. We have available only  		imperfect measures of predictors such as impairment and level of family  		support, but a more important obstacle to successful prediction may be  		unforseeable changes in the need for care and families ability to cope that can  		occur just prior to institutionalization.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER SUMMARY</h3>
<p>Several factors have been shown to be directly associated with nursing  		home use. Among them are lack of informal support at home, availability of  		financial resources, or Medicaid coverage to pay for nursing home care; recent  		use of hospital or nursing home services; and favorable attitudes toward  		institutionalization. Persons in nursing homes are more impaired on ADL and  		IADL than are those in the community, but these factors are of limited value in  		predicting <b>subsequent</b> nursing home use by persons in the community. Even  		multiple regression methods with a large number of explanatory variables do not  		successfully predict with precision who will enter a nursing home.</p>
<h2><a name="target" id="target">III. TARGETING EXPERIENCE OF COMMUNITY CARE  		PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<h3>TARGETING APPROACHES AND THE CRITERIA USED IN LONG-TERM  		CARE STUDIES</h3>
<p>Demonstrations conducted to date provide a great deal of evidence about  		the effects of community-care programs for various groups of the elderly.  		Sixteen waiver projects (which include the Channeling demonstration) have been  		conducted over the past 15 years, and represent a range of initiatives that  		vary in terms of both their intervention and their research design. All were  		motivated, in part, by the expectation that the expansion and coordination of  		community-based services would substitute for institutional care. Each of these  		long-term care projects attempted to serve a target population of elderly  		persons who would be in an institution in the absence of project  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Channeling demonstration is the largest and most comprehensively  		analyzed of the series of projects undertaken to test the benefits of  		case-managed community-based care. However the targeting experiences of the 15  		other Federal-State long-term care demonstrations provide useful information as  		well.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup> These  		demonstrations varied in terms of project funding sources (Medicaid or  		Medicare), the type of direct services covered, the authority of case managers  		to purchase services and their control over service allocation, the use of cost  		controls, and even the eligibility criteria used; however, as noted, all were  		designed to serve clients at risk of nursing home placement.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>We have classified the targeting approaches used in these projects into  		four major categories. The first category (as exemplified by the initial phase  		of Triage) attempted to use a preventive model that enrolled applicants prior  		to the point at which they were experiencing severe chronic disabilities.  		Although the Triage program was established as an alternative to institutional  		care, it did not require that individuals exhibit a specific level of  		disability. The second group includes projects that required applicants to be  		functionally disabled and to show a need for community-based services  		(Worcester Home Care, NCHSR day-care homemaker, MSSP Project Open, New York  		City Home Care, San Diego, and Florida Pentastar). Although these projects  		emphasized functional impairment, a specified level of disability was not  		required as an entry criterion. The third group of projects required that  		individuals exhibit both a documented need for service and a specific level of  		functional disability. In these projects, the entry criteria actually required  		either a disability score above a specific cutoff value in a functionally based  		entrance instrument or specified levels of disabilities comparable to nursing  		home admission criteria. These include Wisconsin CCO, Georgia AHS, On Lok, and  		Nursing Home without Walls. The fourth group of projects includes those  		demonstrations that emphasized functional disability and the need for services,  		but also linked program entry to a nursing home preadmission screening process  		(ACCESS and South Carolina CLTC).</p>
<h3>RESULTS OF THE TARGETING EFFORTS OF LONG-TERM CARE  		DEMONSTRATIONS</h3>
<p>Of the demonstrations conducted to date, as already noted, only one  		served a group with high rates of subsequent nursing home use (<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>). In the South Carolina Community Long Term Care  		Project, which required that applicants meet eligibility criteria for placement  		59 percent of the control group had been admitted to a nursing home by the end  		of the 12-month period. The comparison group for the Triage project (the  		project with no disability requirement) had the lowest use of nursing homes, 4  		percent. It is noteworthy, however, that the nursing home rates of the projects  		which used a functional disability criterion, such as Wisconsin and Georgia,  		did not differ dramatically from the Triage result. Even in the Channeling  		demonstration, which used a rather stringent functional disability criterion  		coupled with a documented need for services, less than 25 percent of the  		control group were admitted to a nursing home during the first year.</p>
<p>As expected, nursing home days show a similar pattern. The South  		Carolina control group members spent an average of 130 days in a nursing home  		over the 12-month time period. Once again, this figure is by far the highest  		rate of any of the studies. One additional study, the Nursing Home without  		Walls project evaluation, also showed a high use rate for the comparison group  		in the upstate sites in the demonstration. However, since this project did not  		use comparable procedures for recruiting treatment and comparison group  		members, the reported impact estimates are inconclusive.</p>
<p>The results of the South Carolina study are worth further discussion. As  		noted, 12 months after application, well over half of the control group had had  		a nursing home admission--more than twice as high as the next highest, which  		was channeling. This difference is particularly noteworthy in light of the fact  		that many of the other studies selected individuals whose levels of functional  		disability were high enough to be in the same range as the average level of  		disability of the South Carolina control group.</p>
<p>The frailty of many of the sample members in the various demonstrations  		was also considerable, as evident by the high rates of mortality. In seven of  		the long-term care demonstrations under review, over 20 percent of the control  		group died during the first 12 months of the research. The similarity of  		control group mortality rates and levels of functional disability when combined  		with the very different rates of nursing home use, confirm the evidence in  		<a href="#what">Chapter II</a> that disability alone is not a sufficiently good  		predictor to be considered a successful targeting criterion.</p>

</tr></table><h3>THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAMS ON SUBGROUPS OF ELDERLY  		INDIVIDUALS</h3>
<p>Were the community-care programs more successful for particular  		subgroups of individuals? To answer this question, several of the studies  		identified subgroups of individuals who exhibited particular baseline  		characteristics that were thought to be key factors associated with an  		increased risk of placement. Their placement experience was then compared with  		the experience of other subgroups. For example, the impacts of the program on  		nursing home use by a subgroup of individuals with particularly high levels of  		disability could be compared with those for subgroups with lower disability  		levels. The major subgroups examined in the studies were defined by residence  		at baseline, level of disability, certification for nursing home care, recent  		hospitalization, living arrangements, Medicaid eligibility, ethnicity, age, and  		sex.</p>
<p>The demonstration evaluations did not generally find major impact  		differences across subgroups. In select cases, treatment group members in  		certain subgroups did exhibit larger program impacts, but no major patterns for  		particular subgroups were identified consistently across studies.</p>
<p>The relatively large size of the Channeling sample (over 6,000  		participants at randomization) enabled the evaluators to examine numerous  		subgroup classifications. Subgroups were defined for a set of key participant  		characteristics and also for combinations of characteristics expected to have  		stronger effects than the added effects of each taken separately. Impact  		estimates were calculated based on multiple regression methods which controlled  		for the effects of other determinants of outcomes, including the effects of  		other subgroup variables.</p>
<p>Because subgroups are smaller than the full sample of participants, the  		power of statistical tests to detect impacts for a subgroup is less than for  		program impacts on the full sample. For this reason, failing to observe a  		statistically significant difference among subgroups for an outcome measure  		should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence that no difference exists.  		Conversely, because the number of statistical tests involving subgroups is very  		large, some effects that meet conventional criteria of statistical significance  		will in fact be chance occurrences. Given these limitations, the results for a  		single subgroup and outcome measure should be viewed with caution, unless the  		pattern of impacts for other subgroups or outcome measures provides supporting  		evidence.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable finding is the apparent uniformity of  		Channeling impacts across different subgroups within the sample. No subgroup  		experienced impacts that were statistically different from those of other  		groups for more than a few outcomes; differential impacts among subgroups were  		the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>The subgroups that were examined varied quite widely in terms of their  		characteristics, circumstances, and outcomes, as evidenced by the control group  		means. The "extreme risk" group, for example, used well over twelve times as  		many nursing home days as did the lowest-risk group. But, despite this  		diversity, very limited evidence is available to suggest that Channeling  		impacts differed markedly among the groups except in a few cases. To the extent  		that reductions in nursing home days were achieved, they are more apparent for  		the small fraction of the sample who were already in a nursing home. Some  		evidence also exists that Channeling was effective for a few persons whose  		balance of impairment and lack of informal support might have pushed them to  		the margin at which Channeling made the difference between becoming  		institutionalized and being able to live in the community.</p>
<p>Both Channeling models--the <b>basic model</b> (which emphasized case  		management within the existing system) and the <b>financial control</b> model  		(which provided additional funding for services)--showed reductions in nursing  		home use and/or costs for persons who were residing in a nursing home at the  		time participants were screened into the program. However, this effect was  		statistically significant in the basic model only in months 1-6 and in the  		financial control model only in months 7-12. Control group members who were in  		a nursing home at screen experienced greater than average admissions and days  		of nursing home care. For these subgroups, Channeling reduced private  		expenditures for services (primarily nursing home services), and this effect  		was consistent across models and time periods. In the year following  		randomization, the basic model of Channeling reduced these private expenditures  		for services by an average of $3,057 (or 58 percent) for each client in a  		nursing home at screen. The corresponding figure for the financial control  		model was $2,776 (or 48 percent) for this subgroup. A pattern of reductions was  		also observed for nursing home admissions and days for the in-nursing-home and  		wait-listed subgroups, though reductions in nursing home use for those who were  		wait-listed appeared to be confined to the group that would not be eligible for  		Medicaid.</p>
<p>The basic model of Channeling--which operated with limited funds for  		services and in environments where community services were used somewhat less  		extensively--appears to have reduced nursing home use for clients who were able  		to meet some of their needs on their own. For example, reductions in nursing  		home use were achieved (in the first six months) for those whose financial  		resources were sufficient to preclude them from (current or imminent) Medicaid  		eligibility. Within this higher financial resources group, two subgroups were  		more affected than others: the more severely ADL disabled who lived with others  		and the less disabled who lived alone. Thus, the basic model of Channeling,  		with its limited resources, appears to have been somewhat more effective at  		reducing nursing home use among groups whose balance of needs, resources, and  		informal support placed them at less than extreme risk of nursing home  		admission. Evidence suggesting that, among the risk categories, it was the  		"high risk" not the "extreme risk" group for whom the basic model of Channeling  		significantly reduced nursing home use supports this conclusion. Thus, the  		basic model may have been more effective at reducing nursing home use among the  		elderly who had some capability (due to financial resources or informal  		support) to help themselves.</p>
<p>The stronger (and more expensive) intervention of the financial control  		model may have been able to achieve impacts for some groups that were  		relatively unaffected by the basic model. Compared with the basic model, the  		financial control model appears to have been more effective at reducing nursing  		home use among clients who were more impaired and who had fewer supporting  		resources. In the first six months, nursing home use was reduced for those who  		were living alone at baseline (particularly those living alone who were very  		severely ADL impaired) and those who had the highest risk scores. Neither of  		these groups was affected under the basic model. Impacts were also observed for  		those who were wait-listed, especially the wait-listed non-Medicaid-eligible  		clients. In the financial control sites, where more services were available in  		the existing system and Channeling had more resources to meet client needs, it  		is possible that Channeling was able to achieve impacts for persons who had  		somewhat greater needs than was the case in basic model sites.</p>
<p>There is only very limited evidence that the effect of Channeling was  		achieved because more services were directed toward those who exhibited the  		greatest need. The financial control model increased the percentage of  		individuals who received formal community services, and the amount of the  		increase was fairly equal across subgroups of clients. One group whose formal  		service receipt increased more than average was the group of individuals who  		were in a nursing home at the screen; this result may reflect greater need for  		acute care services by those seeking to return to the community following a  		period of illness. Each of the models provides evidence that Channeling was  		able to reduce nursing home use or costs for some groups. But associated cost  		savings appeared to accrue primarily to private payers, rather than to the  		Medicare or Medicaid programs. Therefore, although the results do suggest that  		it is possible to divert some persons from nursing homes, we cannot be  		optimistic about achieving substantial savings of Medicaid or Medicare nursing  		home expenditures for any subgroup through a Channeling-type program similar to  		the models tested.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence of a reduction in nursing home use pertains to  		persons in a nursing home at screen but certified for discharge. But there is  		also some evidence, albeit more limited and less clear cut, that there are  		other persons for whom Channeling tipped the balance of needs and services and  		reduced nursing home use. Identifying such impaired elderly individuals  		necessitates using multiple characteristics.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> It should also be noted that the groups for  		whom Channeling-type programs can make a difference may vary, depending on both  		the existing service environment and the resources available to the community  		service program. However, reductions in nursing home use do not imply  		cost-effectiveness. In the next section, we examine the impacts of Channeling  		use and costs for selected groups.</p>
<h3>THE EFFECTS OF CHANNELING ON SELECTED TARGET GROUPS</h3>
<p>To pursue the potential effect on selected groups further, the  		channeling data were used to simulate hypothetical eligibility criteria by  		estimating impacts for selected subgroups.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup> The groups examined were those for whom  		previous evidence and multiple-regression analysis indicated that the desired  		effects would be the greatest. These simulations included the subgroup of  		persons in a nursing home (and the combined group of persons in a nursing home  		and those wait-listed), as well as subgroups predicted by multiple regression  		methods as likely to show reduced nursing home use or cost savings.  		<a href="#table5">Table 5</a> summarizes the results of these simulations for  		key outcome measures.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Although the targeting criteria examined did not identify groups of  		individuals for whom channeling significantly reduced public costs, it was  		found that for some groups the program might be cost-neutral, as evidenced by  		the fact that public costs did not significantly differ between treatment group  		members and control group members. This conclusion must be qualified, however,  		because the lack of statistically significant differences may in part reflect  		the small sample sizes for these subgroups.</p>

</tr></table><p>The most promising results pertain to those persons in a nursing home at  		screen who had an intermediate level of financial resources, so that they were  		not currently Medicaid eligible but would be eligible within three months if  		they chose to remain in the nursing home. For this in-nursing-home spend-down  		group, the simulation indicated that the basic model of channeling  		significantly reduced the number of nursing home days, significantly reduced  		nursing home expenditures, significantly reduced Medicaid expenditures, and  		significantly reduced private expenditures for services. But even for this  		group the cost of program operations and services was sufficient to preclude  		significant public cost savings. A similar reduction in nursing home use was  		observed for this group under the financial control model, though the greater  		channeling expenditures and greater Medicare expenditures make this group more  		expensive to serve under financial control channeling, with no significant  		reduction in public or private costs.</p>
<p>Private costs decreased by modest amounts for most of the other  		simulated subgroups. But only a few of them showed reductions in nursing home  		use. None exhibited statistically significant increases in their satisfaction  		with life. Thus, with the one exception noted, there is no evidence that the  		programmatic cost-effectiveness of such programs could be substantially  		increased by targeting.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER SUMMARY</h3>
<p>Of the numerous long-term care random assignment demonstrations  		conducted to date, the only one that has both enrolled a population who proved  		to be at high risk of nursing home admission and also shown reductions in  		nursing home use is the South Carolina Community Long Term Care Project. This  		project used a preadmission screening process to identify clients who were at  		the nursing home level of care and seeking nursing home admission. Even for  		this group, however, there were no significant savings in public costs, though  		the program may have been essentially cost-neutral.</p>
<p>An extensive analysis of subgroups based on the Channeling demonstration  		data showed significant reductions in nursing home use over 12 months for those  		who were not currently eligible for Medicaid and were residing in a nursing  		home at the time of their entry into the demonstration. No group showed  		significant reductions in public costs. For the spend-down group in a nursing  		home evidence suggests that at baseline the basic model of Channeling--which  		emphasized case management rather than substantial additonal funding for  		services--reduced private costs without increasing public costs. However, this  		finding is based on an extremely small sample, and this group constitutes a  		very small fraction of the elderly in need of long-term care.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">IV. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<p>Recent demonstrations of community-based long-term care alternatives  		have provided a wealth of information about the impacts of these programs.  		Demonstrations to date have shown that it is possible to identify impaired  		elderly persons in the community, assess their service needs, and deliver  		community-based services in accordance with a coordinated care plan. These  		initiatives have also revealed the difficulty and complexity of effectively  		identifying impaired elderly persons who are actually at risk of entering  		nursing homes.</p>
<p>In this report we have examined the issue of targeting to determine  		whether it is feasible to design eligibility criteria for community-based  		long-term care programs so as to include only those for whom the programs can  		be cost-effective. We have examined the results of several demonstrations. The  		most extensive evidence comes from the recently completed National Long Term  		Care Channeling Demonstration from which we have detailed data for a large  		sample of elderly persons served in demonstration projects in ten sites. Data  		from the Channeling demonstration have enabled us to examine the effects of the  		program on a large number of subgroups of various types of impaired elderly  		persons in need of services. Together with the results of previous  		demonstrations, a fairly consistent pattern of findings is observed. As we  		discuss in the following paragraphs, when demonstration projects are compared  		with the existing system, evidence that they were cost-effective according to  		any of the usual definitions of cost-effectiveness is limited to a small  		proportion of the elderly in need of long term care.</p>
<p><b><i>Fiscal Cost-Effectiveness</i></b></p>
<p>No group was found for whom Channeling was shown to reduce public costs.  		Even for the groups that exhibited reductions in nursing home use, Channeling  		saved private but not public dollars. These results are consistent with those  		of the South Carolina study, which showed no significant impact on public  		costs. Thus, the targeting methods that have been tested to date have been, at  		best, cost-neutral from the public perspective.</p>
<p><b><i>Programmatic Cost-Effectiveness</i></b></p>
<p>If community-care programs have not saved public funds, do they achieve  		other positive impacts in a less expensive way than would be the case with the  		current policies or programs? Impacts that show up strongly are a reduction in  		nursing home use for some groups, an increase in the use of formal  		community-based services, and a reduction in private expenditures.</p>
<p>In the Channeling demonstration, significant reductions in nursing home  		use were observed for those who were in a nursing home at the start of the  		demonstration. Even for those clients, the financial control model is a rather  		expensive method for reducing nursing use. The basic model results were mixed;  		there was no significant reduction in nursing home use even for those in a  		nursing home, but there is some evidence that the program might reduce nursing  		home use and be cost-neutral for the spend-down group in a nursing home. The  		small sample sizes of these groups,however, leads us to view this finding with  		caution.</p>
<p>An increase in the use of formal community services was found under  		Channeling for most of the groups examined. Here, again, the question arises:  		Could these impacts have been achieved at a lower cost? One alternative method  		for increasing use would be to expand coverage and/or the accessibility of  		Medicare or Medicaid community-based services. But these entitlement programs  		differ from the case management programs, which have demonstrated an ability to  		assess need and limit eligibility to a very impaired group. The disadvantage of  		case management programs is that adding the cost of project operations (i.e.,  		screening, assessment, and ongoing case management costs) to the cost of  		providing services makes such programs a relatively expensive vehicle for  		increasing the use of formal services. Moreover, as evidenced by the uniformity  		of community-based service use across Channeling subgroups, programs have not  		yet effectively concentrated resources on those most in need within a highly  		impaired group of clients. Thus, if the primary goal is to provide benefits to  		this highly impaired group, increasing the coverage of community services for  		those who meet strict Channeling-type eligibility criteria might be less  		expensive than adding the Channeling case management component through a  		free-standing case management agency--but only if the coverage could be limited  		to such a group without the expensive screening and assessment process used by  		Channeling. In other words, there may be less expensive ways to achieve the  		same impacts on the use of services that we observed for Channeling, though  		this has yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>A major impact under Channeling was a reduction in private expenditures.  		The reduction in private costs is statistically significant for many simulated  		groups under the basic model, but only for the in-nursing home and  		in-or-wait-listed groups under the financial control model. This reduction can  		be considered desirable in itself, since it implies less financial burden on  		the elderly and their families. However, in most cases, the increase in public  		expenditures greatly exceeded the private cost savings. This finding raises the  		possibility that providing direct assistance to family caregivers might be a  		more cost-effective means of relieving the burden imposed on families with an  		impaired elderly individual than could a comparably funded community service  		program.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Cost-Effectiveness</i></b></p>
<p>Assessment of social cost-effectiveness requires placing a subjective  		value on the outcomes achieved. The high costs and the very limited number of  		statistically significant beneficial impacts suggest that, unless our targeting  		ability improves, Channeling-type approaches to expanding community care  		services may not be considered socially cost-effective for most patient  		groups--except to the extent that a high value is placed on marginal  		improvements in the quality of life and satisfaction with care, on increases in  		the availability of formal services, and on modest reductions in unmet  		needs.</p>
<h3>WHY TARGETING IS SO DIFFICULT</h3>
<p>An analysis of the Channeling data and a review of other demonstration  		projects have not identified any group for whom community-care programs are  		clearly cost-effective. An important issue is whether any such group exists  		and, if so, whether other approaches and screening criteria may help identify  		groups for whom such programs can be shown to be cost-effective. At this time,  		no conclusive answer exists. There are several reasons that Channeling and  		similar projects did not prove to be cost-effective for the groups  		examined--and the "lessons learned" from these experiences should be considered  		in pursuing alternative approaches. A number of these factors have been  		identified in other studies.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Uniform Costs of Program Operations</i></b></p>
<p>The cost of operating the projects constituted a substantial share of  		expenses. In Channeling, for example, the operating costs of the basic model  		projects was $1,226 per client (excluding expenditures for services) for the  		first 12 months following randomization.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup> A large share of these costs were devoted to  		screening, assessment, and care planning functions, which were required for all  		clients. Thus, no group exists for whom operational costs are clearly lower  		than for the sample as a whole. Hence, targeting a group with a low  		administrative cost does not appear to be a possibility.</p>
<p>However, community-care demonstrations, such as the South Carolina  		project, suggest that it may be possible to use other approaches to perform  		these program functions at a lower operational cost per client served. In 1982,  		it cost South Carolina $32 per client per month to perform screening,  		assessment, and case management functions. This lower cost was primarily a  		result of the nature of the project (preadmission screening), of the fact that  		the number of services available in the catchment area was limited, and of the  		fact that nearly half the treatment group clients were institutionalized (and  		thus did not receive ongoing intensive case management services).<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Uniform Service Impacts</i></b></p>
<p>The impacts of services also varied little across client groups.  		Channeling projects did not direct a disproportionate share of community-based  		services to any one group, and impacts on the amount and cost of services  		received did not differ substantially by type of client. This lack of  		differentiation makes it difficult to identify a group that exhibits either low  		costs or large impacts in terms of nursing home use (or well-being) because of  		community services.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Placement Decisions Were Not Greatly Affected by  		Additional Community Services</i></b></p>
<p>For nearly all the groups examined, as well as for the sample as a  		whole, the impacts of Channeling on nursing home admissions and days of care  		were not statistically significant. The basic and financial control models  		showed significant reductions in nursing home days only for those who were in  		the spend-down group and in a nursing home at randomization. But this group  		comprises a very small fraction of the Channeling sample. In general, decisions  		to enter or remain in a nursing home were not greatly affected by case  		management or the provision of community-based services beyond what was  		currently available.</p>
<p><b><i>Substantial Reductions in Nursing Home Use Would Have Been  		Required to Offset Program Costs</i></b></p>
<p>While no program would be expected to divert 100 percent of its clients  		from nursing homes, cost saving requires that savings from those diverted  		offset case management and community-based service costs incurred for the  		entire group of participants. As can be inferred from <a href="#table6">Table  		6</a>, the basic model of Channeling would be expected to save about $6,131  		(14,969 - $8,838) in public cost by converting a nursing home user in the  		current system into a nonuser with Channeling benefits. The comparable number  		is $5,111 ($16,203 - $11,092) for the financial control model. But for every  		enrolled person who would not have entered a nursing home, Channeling spent  		$2,165 ($8,838 - $6,673) extra in the basic model and $3,257 ($11,092 - $7,835)  		in the financial control model. Thus, to save public costs within the first  		year, the channeling program would have had to identify and successfully divert  		one person from nursing home placement for every three persons ($6,131/$2,165)  		enrolled who remained in the community under the basic model, and one for every  		1.6 persons ($5,111/$3,257) under the financial control model.</p>
<p><b><i>Inability to Predict Institutionalization</i></b></p>
<p>The relatively low rates of nursing home use among the Channeling  		subgroups examined reflects our limited ability to predict nursing home use in  		advance. The multiple regression model used to identify persons at high risk  		had small explanatory power (as reflected in low R<sup>2</sup> statistics).  		Even using all the available information on informal supports, living  		arrangements, and other factors in a multiple regression context to develop  		screening criteria did not generate groups that exhibited a very high rate of  		nursing home services. The highest use subgroup--those in nursing homes at  		randomization--spent half of their survival days over the next 12 months in a  		nursing home. But nursing home use by the other groups, including those  		selected by multiple regression methods, averaged no more than 41 days in the  		following 12 months. Thus, except for those who were already in a nursing home  		or were wait-listed (a small part of the Channeling sample), no identifiable  		subgroup used nursing home services to great extent.</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>Private Rather than Public Savings</i></b></p>
<p>A final reason that Channeling did not produce significant savings in  		public costs, even for the groups most at risk, is that cost savings (where  		they existed) accrued to private rather than to public payers. The basic model  		showed statistically significant private cost savings for most simulated  		groups. The financial control model also showed significant private cost  		savings, but only for those in a nursing home or on a waitlist at  		randomization. None of the simulations produced estimates of statistically  		significant savings in public costs.</p>
<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
<p>Approaches explored to date have not been able to predict effectively  		who will enter nursing homes, nor have we yet identified ways to expand  		community services to bring about direct not savings in public costs.  		Nonetheless, we have gathered valuable insights to help shape further research,  		and the results do have implications for current policies concerning community  		services. Data do indicate that impaired elderly persons who choose to remain  		in the community require fewer public dollars than those who remain in nursing  		homes, and under the current system most impaired elderly persons are able to  		reside in the community with limited publicly funded support services. In  		addition, despite the difficulties that have faced these projects, in terms of  		targeting a group of clients at high risk of institutionalization, they have  		also provided considerable information about the factors that affect admissions  		to nursing homes.</p>
<p><b><i>Roles of Families</i></b></p>
<p>Data from the projects have shown that most chronically ill and impaired  		elderly individuals in the community are supported primarily through caregiving  		efforts by family and friends. Projects such as Channeling and South Carolina  		CLTC have demonstrated that additional community-based services can be  		furnished to an impaired population without weakening this informal care  		network. In addition, recent evidence indicates that the attitudes of family  		members toward nursing homes, and indicators of stress and/or burden perceived  		by family caregivers, are associated with future admissions to nursing homes.  		More research in this area might improve the present capacity to target and to  		prevent nursing home admissions.</p>
<p><b><i>Effects of Supply Factors</i></b></p>
<p>In the past, studies have focused primarily on characteristics  		associated with the "demand" for services, such as patient status and the  		availability of family caregivers. The findings of such projects as Nursing  		Home without Walls suggest that in areas where the supply of nursing home beds  		is limited the typical nursing home user may be more severely impaired; hence,  		it may be that a greater fraction of patients entering nursing homes are too  		impaired to be served appropriately by community-care programs than was the  		case when there were fewer constraints on nursing home construction. Another  		factor is the extent to which Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates are  		higher or lower than payments for private patients. This relationship affects  		the number and types of patients who enter nursing homes, and thus the capacity  		of community services to prevent these admissions. Finally, the availability of  		community care services from many funding sources has grown in the long term  		care system; since many Channeling control group members were able to receive  		services from these existing community programs, this growth may have weakened  		the impact of the Channeling intervention on nursing home use. More in-depth  		analysis of the relationship between supply factors and variations in nursing  		home use may help us predict effects of policies that affect the number of  		nursing home beds.</p>
<p>To the extent that the targeting approaches developed to date can be  		used to generate further reductions in nursing use and costs, they are likely  		to be applied-to persons who are already in a nursing home or are on the verge  		of entering, especially those with financial resources that place them just  		above the level for Medicaid eligibility. This suggests that linking the  		expansion of community care to preadmission screening programs and identifying  		those in a nursing home who wish to return to the community are promising  		directions. In fact, many of the States that have implemented Section 2176 home  		and community based services projects in their Medicaid programs are already  		focusing efforts on the spend-down populations and are exploring preadmission  		screening options.</p>
<h3>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h3>
<p>Even though demonstrations to date have not shown significant cost  		savings from community-care programs, the results suggest a number of promising  		directions for the nation's evolving long-term care policy. We briefly consider  		several of the issues here, although it should be emphasized that more  		information on the use of long-term care services in general is required from  		research, demonstrations, or experimental programs before the best course can  		be chart for major national policy initiatives.</p>
<p><b><i>Family Involvement in Long-Term Care</i></b></p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, an important finding from the community care  		demonstrations and other research is the important role that informal  		caregivers--families and friends--play in both providing long-term care  		services and influencing the institutional placement decisions. Strengthening  		the viability of informal caregivers, particularly those who live with the  		elderly or who are close relatives, merits further attention in approaches to  		postpone or prevent nursing home placement. If the levels of burden imposed on  		and the crisis points experienced by caregivers are indeed important factors in  		nursing home placement decisions, it is possible that providing respite or  		other caregiver support services could be cost-effective. More information on  		how such decisions are made might help us design better ways to target services  		toward cases for whom such services can make a difference. The Omnibus Budget  		Reconciliation Act of 1986, P.L. 99-5099 Section 9414, directs the Secretary of  		Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with the state of New  		Jersey to conduct a pilot project for respite care services for the elderly and  		disabled. This project may contribute to our knowledge about the capacity of  		respite care services to help families avoid institutionalization for their  		frail elderly members.</p>
<p><b><i>Supply Factors</i></b></p>
<p>Further analysis of the relationship between supply factors and  		variations in the use of long-term care services may improve our understanding  		of the overall long-term care service network. Since many States are  		controlling the growth of the number of nursing home beds, it is important to  		ensure that adequate community or institutional services be made available to  		the growing elderly population. More research into the appropriate mix of  		institutional and community services is needed.</p>
<p><b><i>Prepaid Capitation Models</i></b></p>
<p>Now forms of long term care organizations have been proposed in which a  		single provider entity assumes responsibility for a full range of acute and  		long-term care services under a fixed, prospectively determined budget. Both  		health and social services are consolidated under central case management in  		one organized system. Examples are the On Lok program in San Francisco and the  		four Social Health Maintenance Organization demonstration sites. In such  		models, the provider entity has strong financial incentives to furnish the most  		cost-effective array of institutional and noninstitutional services. However,  		more research is necessary to prove the general viability of these approaches.  		With the passage of P.L. 99-5099, Section 94-12(b), the Secretary of Health and  		Human Services is authorized to grant waivers under Titles XVIII and IXX of the  		Social Security Act to a maximum of 10 community agencies who are recipients of  		Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grants in order to help these organizations to  		provide comprehensive health care services on a capitated basis to frail  		elderly participants at risk of institutionalization. These demonstration  		projects could provide valuable information about the cost-effectiveness of  		prepaid capitated approaches.</p>
<p><b><i>Preadmission Screening</i></b></p>
<p>The findings of the South Carolina project and some of the channeling  		results suggest that preadmission screening systems are promising approaches  		for identifying patients who are at high risk of institutionalization. An  		increasing number of states are incorporating preadmission screening in their  		Medicaid programs. However, the cost-neutral effects in South Carolina were due  		to a combination of factors: the targeting of at-risk individuals, low  		case-management and service costs, and the maximization of existing informal  		supports. Further study is necessary to determine whether the South Carolina  		demonstration results are consistent with the State's subsequent experience  		since the program was implemented statewide, and if they are generalizable to  		other States and populations.</p>
<p><b><i>Heavier Concentrations of Services</i></b></p>
<p>We do not know whether concentrating large amounts of services on the  		types of clients we have identified as at high risk of incurring high cost  		episodes of care, whether in nursing homes or other institutions, could be more  		effective in altering placement decisions. Obviously, for programs that offer  		greater concentrations of community services to be cost-effective, they must  		target at-risk groups with much greater precision, and/or focus on persons who  		are likely to incur very high cost episodes. Although there has been growing  		interest in "catastrophic case management" approaches recently, no such  		approaches have been tested.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER SUMMARY</h3>
<p>While existing community care programs do provide many necessary  		services to elderly persons who live in the community, little evidence is  		available to indicate that expanding community-care programs beyond what is  		currently provided would by itself reduce public expenditures for long-term  		care. Targeting case management and limited community services to the small  		group of elderly who have already taken action to seek nursing home care  		(especially those not currently eligible for Medicaid) may reduce the  		likelihood of nursing admissions while having a minimal impact on public  		expenditures. But the extremely small size (as a proportion of the total  		elderly population) of the group for whom such effects can be achieved suggests  		that expanding community case management and service programs beyond those  		available in the existing system must be targeted carefully and/or justified  		primarily by their impacts (in terms of the quality of life, satisfaction with  		services, and a reduction of unmet needs) on those in the community. There is  		no convincing evidence to suggest that replicating the programs demonstrated to  		date would reduce the public cost of providing long-term care to the impaired  		elderly population.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the results of demonstrations conducted to date leave a  		number of unanswered questions and leave open several potentially promising  		approaches to improving the long-term care system. While we have not yet been  		successful developing a set of objective criteria based on individual  		characteristics that can successfully identify persons who will enter a nursing  		home, it may be possible to identify such persons through the processes of the  		long-term care system, such as linking provision of community services to the  		preadmission screening process.</p>
<p>The similarity of the demonstrations in terms of their general  		approach--that is, providing modest amounts of extra community service to those  		in need, coordinated through a central case management system--leaves open the  		question of whether different organizational approaches to providing long-term  		services might produce better results. This report has suggested several  		promising approaches that should be studied further.</p>
<p>Aside from the objective of avoiding nursing home placement, it is also  		important that future long-term care policies be designed to help families with  		the problems of caring for their impaired elderly relatives. Resolving these  		issues requires value judgments: Who should pay for long term care, and who  		should bear the burden of caring for the long-term care population? Case  		management and community services have been shown to enhance satisfaction with  		services, but the cost of these programs suggests that alternative types of  		family support might be more cost-effective. If the primary concern is whether  		people have access to necessary care, then targeting low-income groups, as is  		done in many State Section 2176 waiver projects, may be a reasonable way to  		proceed with expanding the availability of funding for community services. As  		demonstration results to date indicate, however, the current state of the art  		does not permit precise targeting of any group for whom expanded community  		services can generate savings sufficient to cover program costs.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">Section</a> 2176 of the 1981 Omnibus Budget  			 Reconciliation Act (OBRA) attempted to remedy this situation. Under this act  			 many states have obtained waivers of Medicaid regulations so that Medicaid  			 funds could be used to purchase community services to help Medicaid recipients  			 remain in the community rather than be placed in a nursing home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">Rossman</a> (1977); Pinker (1980); Shapiro, Roos,  			 and Kavanaugh (1980).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">These</a> demonstrations include the following:  			 Massachusetts Worchester Home Care Project, Connecticut's Triage Project, New  			 York's Monroe County Access Program, Washington State's Community-Based Care  			 Project, Wisconsin's Community Care Organization, National Center for Health  			 Services Research's (NCHSR) 22 Six-Site Study, Georgia's Alternative Health  			 Services Project, the New York Home Care Project, Project Open in San  			 Francisco, the Long Term Care Project of North San Diego, California's  			 Multipurpose Senior Services Project (MSSP), Florida's Pentastar Project, New  			 York's Nursing Home Without Walls Project, and South Carolina's Community Care  			 Project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">There</a> are two noteworthy qualifications to the  			 study. First, the South Carolina study did not examine the cost of other public  			 programs, which would presumably be greater for the treatment group because  			 they spent more time in the community. Second, the control group was shown to  			 be somewhat more impaired at baseline. These differences at baseline were  			 controlled in regression analyses, but noncomparability of the control group in  			 spite of randomization and the differential effects of attrition could have led  			 to unobserved differences between treatment and control groups that may have  			 influenced the cost estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note16" id="note16">The</a> financial control model of channeling  			 offered skilled nursing (physical, speech occupational therapy), home health  			 aide, homemaker/personal care, housekeeping, transportation, home delivered  			 meals, chore, companion, respite care, housing assistance, and other  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note17" id="note17">The</a> channeling sample included only impaired  			 elderly persons who needed long-term care services; thus, the average sample  			 member is more impaired than the typical elderly person who lives in the  			 community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">The</a> conditions examined were anemia, high blood  			 pressure, heart disorder, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and nerve  			 disorder.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note31" id="note31">Because</a> several of the demonstrations (such as  			 Project Open and San Diego) also attempted to serve clients who were being  			 unnecessarily hospitalized, the entry criteria in those projects had to serve  			 dual purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note32" id="note32">The</a> multiple-characteristic subgroups were  			 defined with the help of the Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) computer  			 program, which was used to identify groups with differing rates of nursing home  			 use. Additional subgroups were defined by constructing a score that represents  			 the regression-predicted risk of nursing home placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note33" id="note33">This</a> finding from Channeling is consistent with  			 the results of Secord (1986).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note34" id="note34">Grannemann</a> and Grossman (1986c)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note35" id="note35">In</a> order to define the target groups and  			 stimulate impacts, the channeling sample was split. Half the sample was used to  			 develop a risk score formula representing the regression-predicted likelihood  			 of a reduction in nursing home use, a reduction in unmet needs, or cost  			 savings. For the other half, the preapplication characteristics of the elderly  			 individual were used to estimate program impacts for those who passed a  			 hypothetical program eligibility screen based on the risk score. This procedure  			 provides a test of whether multiple characteristics can in fact be used to  			 identify those for whom program impacts will be greatest.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note38" id="note38">If</a> these institutional clients are excluded,  			 the costs per client per month would have been $47.</p>
