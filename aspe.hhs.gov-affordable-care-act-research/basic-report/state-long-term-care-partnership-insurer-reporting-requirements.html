<p>The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), Public Law 109-171, allowed  		states to offer special Medicaid asset disregards to persons purchasing and  		using specially certified (Partnership) long term care insurance policies.  		Section 6021 (a)(1)(A) of the DRA also requires insurance carriers to report  		data to the Secretary related to the sale and use of Partnership Long Term Care  		Insurance policies in states with a Medicaid state plan amendment approved  		after May14, 1993. This document presents reporting requirements for insurance  		carriers selling such policies in such states.</p>
<p>The Deficit Reduction Act requires insurers participating in state Long  		Term Care Partnership Programs with a Medicaid state plan amendment approved  		after May14, 1993 to provide regular reports to the Secretary of the Department  		of Health and Human Services (HHS). Section 6021 of the Deficit Reduction Act  		contains the following requirement:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The issuer of the [Partnership] policy provides regular  		  reports to the Secretary, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that  		  include notification regarding when benefits provided under the policy have  		  been paid and the amount of such benefits paid, notification regarding when the  		  policy otherwise terminates, and such other information as the Secretary  		  determines may be appropriate to the administration of such  		  partnerships.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On December 18, 2008 the Secretary promulgated regulation 45 CFR Part  		144 Subchapter B enacting the following reporting requirements.</p>
<h2><a name="basic" id="basic">BASIC FILE STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p>The reporting requirements consist of four distinct file types. The  		following is an overview of each file and a corresponding set of criteria for  		determining what data belongs in each file. For all four file types, insurers  		are required to report on only those insureds, policyholders, and claimants who  		have active Partnership Qualified (PQ) policies or certificates. These  		requirements do not apply to insurance policies or certificates that are not  		Partnership Qualified (PQ).</p>
<p>A data supplier that administers Partnership programs for more than one  		carrier client can choose to collate all data together in a single file, using  		Field 1, Company Code to distinguish among clients; or they can submit one file  		for each of their clients rather than collating all data together in one file.  		All data fields for each carrier must be complete (i.e., the TPA cannot capture  		some fields and allow the carrier to send an additional file with data for the  		other fields).</p>
<h2><a name="file1" id="file1">FILE 1: REGISTRY FILE FOR INDIVIDUAL AND VOLUNTARY OR  		PARTIALLY VOLUNTARY GROUP COVERAGE</a></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This file will include data on each Partnership Qualified (PQ) policy or  		certificate sold under the Long Term Care Partnership Program for which the  		insurer has information on the individual insured (i.e. name, address, etc.).  		The file includes both PQ policies sold on either an individual or group basis,  		as long as individual-level data are available to the insurer.</p>
<h3>Criteria for Inclusion</h3>
<p>File 1 should include any insured individual who held an active PQ  		policy or certificate at some point during the reporting period, even if the  		policy or certificate was subsequently cancelled, lost PQ status, or otherwise  		terminated during the reporting period. Therefore, File 1 should also include  		individuals who were issued coverage for a PQ policy or certificate during the  		reporting period but who elected to not continue coverage. If the individual  		elected not to continue coverage before the end of the free-look period (known  		as Not Taken Out or NTO), the insurer should indicate NTO status on  		the Policy Status field (Field #47) on File 1. Persons in NTO status would then  		not be included on subsequent File 1 submissions.</p>
<p>File 1 should include all policies or certificates with active coverage  		during the reporting period regardless of whether they were included in  		previous File 1 submissions. Carriers should include policies that were in  		force prior to any reporting period as long as they were still in force for at  		least one day during the reporting period. The insurer should report the most  		current information about the insured (e.g. address) and about the terms of  		their coverage. These data will be compared with information provided in  		previous file submissions to determine if there have been any changes in  		coverage in the intervening period. However, once a policy or certificate has  		lapsed, lost PQ status, or been otherwise terminated, it should no longer be  		reported in the active file. Once again, only those policies or certificates  		which were active at some point during the designated reporting period need to  		be included in the File 1 submission.</p>
<p>Also, if an individual covered under a group plan reported on File 3  		ports or converts his or her coverage upon leaving the group, and by virtue of  		that change, the insurer obtains access to information about the individual  		insured, then that insured individual should then be reported on File 1 and,  		when relevant (e.g., when the insured is on claim), in File 2.</p>
<h3>Reporting Frequency</h3>
<p>Insurers are required to submit data for File One as outlined below:</p>
<table><tr><td scope="col"><font><b>  File  </b></font></td>
<td scope="col"><font><b>Period Covered</b></font></td>
<td scope="col"><font><b>  Submission  			 Deadlines  </b></font></td>

<td><font>January 1 - June  			 30  July 1 - December 31  </font></td>
<td><font>August 1 February  			 1</font></td>
</tr></table><h3>General Information/Field Specifications for File 1</h3>
<p><b>File Specifications</b>: all files are fixed width, ASCII. There is  		no sort-order requirement.</p>
<p><b>Field Type Key</b>: N = numeric; AN = alphanumeric; A = alpha.</p>
<p><b>Field Formatting Instructions</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Alpha and Alphanumeric Fields</b>: Includes A - Z (lower or  		  upper case), 0 - 9, spaces, and special characteristics. Left justified,  		  right space-filled. Unrecorded or missing values in character fields should  		  be space-filled.</p>
<p><b>Numeric Fields</b>: All numeric fields should be  		  right-justified and left zero-filled.</p>
<p><b>Special Notes</b>: Financial fields should not contain any  		  dollar signs, commas or decimals but may be signed when negative. Please pass  		  the negative sign using the most significant (or left-most) position. Round  		  dollars to the nearest whole dollar as follows, .50 and above round upward;  		  otherwise downward. Percentage Fields should have decimals; do not include  		  % symbol.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This file provides information on claimants reported in File 1 who are  		presently using long-term care benefits under PQ policies.</p>
<h3>Criteria for Inclusion</h3>
<p>File 2 will include information on all insured with PQ policies or  		certificates for which the insurer paid at least one claim during the reporting  		period. Thus, persons who may be eligible for insurance benefits but who had no  		claims paid during the reporting period will not be included. Please note that  		claimants reported in File 2 will also be reported in File 1, since they will  		have active PQ policies or certificates in force. It is possible that an  		insured began their PQ coverage after the File 1 report date but had a claim  		shortly after coverage taking effect, thus making them eligible to be reported  		in File 2 even though they have yet to be included in File 1. In such rare  		cases, the individual would be included in the subsequent File 1 reporting.</p>
<p>Also, an insureds benefit start date may fall within one of the  		File 2 reporting periods but the insurer is not yet aware of the claim or has  		not yet paid at least one claim during the reporting period. In that case, the  		insurer would report the claimant at the next File 2 reporting submission date  		and indicate the benefit start date, even if it falls prior to the period  		covered in the File 2 submission.</p>
<p>The insurer will report benefits paid prior to the start of the  		reporting period as long as those benefits were incurred after the policy  		became Partnership qualified. For example, if an individual exchanges a policy  		they previously had and from which they received benefits, to one that is now  		PQ, the only benefits eligible for asset disregard and thus the only benefits  		which should be reported are those which were incurred after the latter of  		either the PQ effective date of the exchanged policy or the effective date of  		the state's Partnership program.</p>
<p>Special note for policies that lose PQ status during the reporting  		period: If a policy loses PQ status during the reporting period for File 2, and  		a claim was paid for a service provided on a date during which the policy was  		still PQ, then that claim should be reported even if the insureds status  		changes to NQ at a later date during the reporting period. The critical  		operational date to consider in reporting is the date on which the claim was  		incurred (not the claim payment date); if the policy is PQ at that point in  		time, the claim is to be reported.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary">GLOSSARY AND DEFINITIONS</a></h2>
<p><b><i>Assisted Living Facility (ALF) Benefit Amount</i></b></p>
<p>The maximum amount which the policy or certificate will pay for care  		received in an assisted living facility. If the benefit is paid as weekly or  		monthly, the daily amount should be derived by whatever convention is most  		appropriate for the carrier to use. The data should be the current amount on  		the policy in order to account both for any voluntary increases in coverage the  		insured has elected or any automatic coverage increases as a result of  		inflation protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Assisted Living/Other Facility Benefits Paid During Reporting  		Period</i></b></p>
<p>The total dollar amount of benefits paid during the reporting period for  		care provided in an Assisted Living Facility or similar Alternate Care Facility  		other than a nursing home.</p>
<p><b><i>Automatic Inflation Protection Type</i></b></p>
<p>The type of Inflation Protection used in the policy. This includes  		automatic inflation protection on a compound, level-funded basis; or a simple  		increase and level-funded basis; a graded inflation protection feature where  		both the premium and the benefit amounts increase at a known and pre-set amount  		each year; step-rated inflation protection; level-funded increases based on the  		Consumer Price Index; level-funded increases based on the specific long-term  		care price index; level-funded inflation protection based on some other  		published index value; level-funded inflation protection based on an increase  		amount determined by the carrier which could change from year to year based on  		the changes in actual costs of care. All these types of inflation protection  		are provided annually and continue on claim (unless other predefined limits are  		reached first as specified below).</p>
<p><b><i>Benefit Start Date of Current Claim Period</i></b></p>
<p>The date on which benefit payments began during the reporting  		period.</p>
<p><b><i>Buy-up Option Available</i></b></p>
<p>Indicates that, in addition to an employer paid core plan, insureds can  		elect to purchase on their own additional coverage amounts and types, typically  		subject to some form of underwriting.</p>
<p><b><i>Certificate Issue State</i></b></p>
<p>The state in which a certificate under a group policy is delivered. This  		would be either the situs state for the group policy or, in the case of a state  		that claims extraterritorial jurisdiction over the group policy situs state, it  		would be the state of residence for the individual certificate-holder.</p>
<p><b><i>Chronically Ill</i></b></p>
<p>Means that You have been certified by a Licensed Health Care  		Practitioner as: being unable to perform, without Substantial Assistance from  		another person, at least two (2) Activities of Daily Living for a period that  		is expected to last at least ninety (90) consecutive days due to a loss of  		functional capacity; or requiring Substantial Supervision to protect Yourself  		from threats to health and safety due to a Severe Cognitive Impairment.</p>
<p><b><i>Claim Status</i></b></p>
<p>Indicates whether or not an insured with a Partnership policy is in  		claim status during the reporting period.</p>
<p><b><i>Core Plan</i></b></p>
<p>An employer-paid long term care insurance benefit provided typically on  		a guaranteed issue basis to all eligible actively at work employees as defined  		by the insurer and/or the employer in the group Policy. Wherever the term Core  		appears before another term (e.g., Core Nursing Home Daily Benefit Amount) it  		refers to the term as defined here specifically within the Core Plan).</p>
<p><b><i>Company Code</i></b></p>
<p>The 5-digit code assigned by the National Association of Insurance  		Commissioners to each insurance company. For self-funded plans or the Federal  		Employees Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP), a unique 5-digit  		code will be assigned for use in these Reporting Requirements.</p>
<p><b><i>Coverage Basis</i></b></p>
<p>Indicates whether the coverage is issued as a group or an individual  		policy. The coverage basis is determined by how the State Department of  		Insurance classifies the policy or certificate, not based on the basis by which  		the policy is marketed. For example, a worksite-based product which uses an  		individual policy form but is marketed to an employer group is an individual  		coverage basis.</p>
<p><b><i>Current Annual Premium</i></b></p>
<p>The amount of annual premium being paid for the coverage, including both  		the insureds portion and any portion paid by the employer, if applicable.  		This would reflect the current premium amount such that any voluntary changes  		in coverage that might have increased or decreased the premium from its  		original issue amount would be reflected in this figure.</p>
<p><b><i>Current Claimant</i></b></p>
<p>Refers to an insured who is in active claim status which means that they  		meet the definition of Chronically Ill and are receiving benefit payments in  		accordance with the coverage provisions and requirements of the policy or  		certificate.</p>
<p><b><i>Employer Name</i></b></p>
<p>The name of the Employer identified as the group Policyholder.</p>
<p><b><i>Employer Type</i></b></p>
<p>The category of the employer as expressed using standard industry  		codes.</p>
<p><b><i>Frequency of Future Purchase Option</i></b></p>
<p>Indicates whether the FPO is made on an annual basis, or on a frequency  		less often than that (e.g., every two or three years).</p>
<p><b><i>Future Purchase Option</i></b></p>
<p>The type of periodic benefit increase which allows the individual to  		purchase additional increments of coverage for additional premium amounts based  		on their attained age at the time they elect the increase. These coverage  		increases are available at set time periods (annually or otherwise) and are  		available to the insured who wishes to elect them without requiring evidence of  		insurability.</p>
<p><b><i>Home Health Care Benefit Amount</i></b></p>
<p>The maximum amount which the policy or certificate will pay for care  		received at home (or for home and other community care benefits). If the  		benefit is paid as weekly or monthly, the daily amount should be derived by  		whatever convention is most appropriate for the carrier to use. The data should  		be the current amount on the policy in order to account both for any voluntary  		increases in coverage the insured has elected or any automatic coverage  		increases as a result of inflation protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Home Health Care Benefits Paid During Reporting Period</i></b></p>
<p>The total amount of benefits paid during the reporting period for care  		at home or in a non-institutional covered care setting (e.g., adult day care)  		as defined as home or community-based care within the policy or  		certificate.</p>
<p><b><i>Inflation Protection Increase Amount or Index Value</i></b></p>
<p>The specific percentage increase applied to benefits each year designed  		to keep pace with inflation, if it is a set amount as previously defined. If  		the increase is based on an index, the specific increase amount expressed in  		terms of a percent of the prior years increase, that is applicable to the  		current reporting period.</p>
<p><b><i>Inflation Protection Duration: Attended Age of Insured</i></b></p>
<p>The type of inflation protection that ends when the insured reaches a  		specified age (e.g., age 80, or others).</p>
<p><b><i>Inflation Protection Duration Type: Attained Age of  		Policy/Certificate</i></b></p>
<p>The type of inflation protection that ends when the insured has received  		annual benefit increases for a predefined number of years (e.g., 10 or 20  		years).</p>
<p><b><i>Inflation Protection Duration: Life of  		Policy/Certificate</i></b></p>
<p>The type of inflation protection that continues through the life of the  		coverage, and continues even while the insured is in claim status (receiving  		benefits).</p>
<p><b><i>Inflation Protection Duration: When Benefit Has  		Doubted</i></b></p>
<p>The type of inflation protection that continues until the daily benefit  		amount for nursing home care has doubled from its original value at time of  		purchase.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Policy Maximum for ALF/Other Facility Care Benefits  		(Days)</i></b></p>
<p>If the coverage uses days of benefit received to calculate the policy  		maximum and has separate pools for the major covered services, this is where  		the number of days which represents the lifetime maximum paid for assisted  		living facility care would be specified.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Policy Maximum for Home Health Care Benefits  		(Days)</i></b></p>
<p>If the coverage uses days of benefit received to calculate the policy  		maximum and has separate pools for the major covered services, this is where  		the number of days which represents the lifetime maximum paid for home health  		care would be specified.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Policy Maximum for Nursing Home Benefits  		(Days)</i></b></p>
<p>If the coverage uses days of benefit received to calculate the policy  		maximum and has separate pools for the major covered services, this is where  		the number of days which represents the lifetime maximum paid for nursing home  		care (or facility care all levels combined) would be specified.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Policy Maximum for ALF/Other Facility Care  		(Dollars)</i></b></p>
<p>If the coverage uses a pool of dollars design and has separate pools for  		the major covered services, this is where the dollar amount which represents  		the lifetime maximum paid for assisted living facility care would be specified.  		If the policy combines nursing home and assisted living facility care into a  		single facility care lifetime maximum this entry would be indicated  		as not applicable.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Policy Maximum for Home Health Care (Dollars)</i></b></p>
<p>If the coverage uses a pool of dollars design and has separate pools for  		the major covered services, this is where the dollar amount which represents  		the lifetime maximum paid for home health care would be specified.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Policy Maximum for Nursing Home Coverage  		(Dollars)</i></b></p>
<p>If the coverage uses a pool of dollars design and has separate pools for  		the major covered services, this is where the dollar amount which represents  		the lifetime maximum paid for nursing home care (or facility care all levels  		combined) would be specified.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Maximum Structure (LMS)</i></b></p>
<p>Whether there is a single Lifetime Maximum for all services and benefits  		covered by the policy, or whether there are separate Lifetime Maximums for the  		major policy benefits such as nursing home care vs. home care. Limits that are  		specific to smaller benefits like respite care, caregiver training or medical  		devices and the like are not considered. LMS refers primarily to whether there  		is a single pool for either facility and home care benefits or  		whether there are separate pools for the major benefit categories  		of nursing home, assisted living, and home and community care. While the  		prevailing benefit structure today is a single Lifetime Maximum for all covered  		services, there are some policies being sold today which have separate Lifetime  		Maximums for these major covered services.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifetime Maximum Structure Detail</i></b></p>
<p>The basis on which total benefits paid under the policy are determined  		in terms of either days or dollars. This refers to whether the Policy or  		Certificate counts days on which benefits have been received or whether it  		counts dollars of benefits paid out in determining when the coverages  		lifetime maximum has been met. While the prevailing policy design today is a  		pool of dollars benefit approach, some policies being sold today  		still count days on which benefits are paid in determining the policys  		lifetime maximum.</p>
<p><b><i>Number of Insureds with Buy-Up PQ Coverage</i></b></p>
<p>The number of covered lives who have elected to purchase the voluntary  		buy-up coverage offered by the group plan, in addition to the Core Plan  		coverage already provided to them.</p>
<p><b><i>Number of Persons Insured with Core Coverage</i></b></p>
<p>Indicates the number of covered lives enrolled in the core plan coverage  		offered by the employer.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Benefit Amount</i></b></p>
<p>The maximum amount which the policy or certificate will pay for care  		received in a nursing home. If the benefit is paid as weekly or monthly, the  		daily amount should be derived by whatever convention is most appropriate for  		the carrier to use. The data should be the current amount on the policy in  		order to account both for any voluntary increases in coverage the insured has  		elected or any automatic coverage increases as a result of inflation  		protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Benefits Paid During Reporting Period</i></b></p>
<p>The total amount of benefits paid during the reporting period for care  		in a nursing home or in a similar covered care institutional setting as defined  		as nursing home or facility-based care within the  		policy or certificate.</p>
<p><b><i>Original Coverage Effective Date as Partnership Qualified (PQ)  		Policy</i></b></p>
<p>The date that coverage first became effective under the policy or  		certificate help by the insured.</p>
<p><b><i>Other Benefit Amounts Paid During Reporting Period</i></b></p>
<p>The total amount of any other benefits paid during this period (e.g.,  		caregiver training, medical devices, other ancillary benefits and services,  		etc.).</p>
<p><b><i>Partnership Status</i></b></p>
<p>Certain types of changes to ones policy or certificate may result  		in the loss of Partnership-qualified status. These are defined by the rules and  		regulations adopted by each state for the operation of its Partnership program.  		This variable simply indicates whether the policy or certificate continues to  		retain its Partnership qualified status or if a change in coverage of some sort  		has resulted in the policy no longer being Partnership Qualified.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy Benefit Type</i></b></p>
<p>Some policies are Comprehensive in that they pay for care in all long  		term care settings (nursing home, ALF, home care and others). Other policies  		pay just for facility-based care, and others pay for only care outside a  		facility. This variable indicates the type of policy with respect to the range  		of services it covers.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy/Certificate Age at which Inflation Protection  		Ends</i></b></p>
<p>The type of inflation protection that ends when the insured has received  		annual benefit increases for a predefined number of years. Value refers to the  		actual number of years which are specified in the coverage.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy Exchange to PQ</i></b></p>
<p>Some policies are Partnership-qualified because they were purchased  		after the effective date of the states Partnership program and meet all  		the requirements in that state for being a Partnership policy. Other policies  		may have been purchased prior to the effective date of that states  		Partnership program, but may have been granted Partnership qualified status as  		the result of being exchanged for a Partnership qualified policy. The exchange  		may be in the form of an amendment or rider or disclosure statement indicating  		that the coverage is now Partnership qualified. This variable indicates whether  		the policy is Partnership qualified as the result of an exchange rather than as  		a result of an original purchase.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy Issue State</i></b></p>
<p>The state in which the individual policy is issued. This would also be  		the state of residence of the insured to whom the individual policy is  		delivered.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy Number</i></b></p>
<p>The unique policy or certificate identification number assigned to each  		insureds coverage.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy Status at End of Reporting Period</i></b></p>
<p>Indicates whether the policy is still in force, whether the insured is  		in non-forfeiture benefits or whether the policy has terminated during the  		reporting period for any number of possible reasons. The policy may no longer  		be in force because the insured has exhausted all their benefits, because they  		have died, because they have voluntarily elected to lapse coverage, because  		coverage has been rescinded, or because the policy was Not Taken Out  		(NTO) as defined above.</p>
<p><b><i>Qualifying Condition</i></b></p>
<p>The specific conditions for which the individual qualifies as  		Chronically Ill. This could include dependency in the required number of  		Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Cognitive Impairment or both.</p>
