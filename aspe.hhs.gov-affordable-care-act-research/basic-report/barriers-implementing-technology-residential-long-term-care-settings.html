<p>Technology plays a vital role in the lives of older individuals. Indeed,  		for those in need of long-term care, it can potentially improve the efficiency  		of care delivery while increasing the quality of that care and individuals'  		quality of life. </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is threefold: (1) to describe a range of  		existing and emerging technological solutions for select care issues salient to  		residential care settings; (2) to identify, based on a review of the literature  		and discussions with experts in the field, barriers to the successful  		implementation of technology in residential care settings; and (3) to propose  		initial steps to address the barriers. </p>
<p>To identify technologies we conducted extensive literature and Internet  		searches, consulted long-term care buyer's guides, and spoke with technology  		manufacturers and vendors at various conferences. To identify barriers we  		conducted an extensive literature review and also spoke with 16 experts  		representing four distinct perspectives in long-term care: regulators,  		providers, technology manufacturers, and other experts about their experience  		implementing technology in long-term care settings. </p>
<p>Our approach revealed a complex set of circumstances contributing to the  		current situation. Five themes emerged as particularly salient in experts'  		discussion:</p>

<p>Technology plays a vital role in the lives of older individuals. Indeed,  		for those in need of long-term care, it can potentially improve the efficiency  		of care delivery while enhancing the quality of that care and improving  		individuals' quality of life. </p>
<p>Although the approximately 2 million older Americans living in nursing  		homes and other residential care settings<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> represent a minority of older persons, they  		constitute a group of interest for the development of technological  		applications for several reasons. First, nearly all persons in residential  		long-term care settings have physical or cognitive limitations that result in  		disability; thus, technologies targeted at residential long-term care can  		potentially reach large numbers of older people with the greatest needs.  		Second, the financial and societal costs associated with caring for this group  		are substantial and are projected to increase dramatically. In the year 2000,  		for example, nearly $100 billion was spent on nursing home care. Third, the  		number of older people in need of long-term care is expected to increase  		dramatically in the coming decades due to the aging of the baby boom  		generation. In particular, the number of older people with Alzheimer's disease,  		about half of whom are cared for in residential care settings, is projected to  		increase dramatically from about 4.5 million today to over 13 million by 2050.  		If designed and implemented appropriately, technology can potentially be an  		important instrument in attaining high quality cost-effective care for this  		population. </p>
<p>The residential long-term care industry is facing several inter-related  		challenges that heighten the need for attention to technological innovation.  		First, there is continued interest, by both providers and federal and state  		regulators to improve quality of care and quality of life for residents,  		particularly in the nursing home segment. Second, there is a nationwide  		shortage of nurses that is especially severe in long-term care. Third, there  		are financial constraints in the industry due in part to continued pressures on  		states to limit growth in Medicaid and also to the rising costs associated with  		risk management. </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is threefold: (1) to describe a range of  		existing and emerging technological solutions in residential care settings; (2)  		to identify, based on a review of the literature and discussions with experts  		in the field, barriers to the successful implementation of technology in  		residential care settings; and (3) to propose next steps to address the  		barriers. </p>
<p>To identify technologies we conducted extensive literature and Internet  		searches, consulted long-term care buyer's guides, and spoke with technology  		manufacturers and vendors at various conferences. To identify potential  		barriers we conducted an extensive literature review and also spoke with 16  		experts representing four distinct perspectives in long-term care: regulators,  		providers, technology manufacturers, and other experts about their experience  		with barriers to implementing technology in long-term care settings. </p>
<h3>Existing and Emerging Technologies in Residential  		Long-Term Care</h3>
<p>Assistive technologies are being developed to assist older adults in  		remaining more independent, safer, and connected to the rest of the world.  		Although these technologies are generally geared to helping individuals  		maintain or regain as much independence as possible in their homes, they also  		may be used in residential care settings. Examples of these kinds of products  		include architectural elements such as door opening/closing devices, lifts and  		elevators, ramps, safety equipment and accessible showers; communication  		devices (such as assistive listening device) sensory aids (such as hearing  		aids, assistive listening devices); computers and adaptive computing devices;  		environmental controls (including remotely controlled door openers, telephones,  		lights and televisions); aids to daily living and mobility; orthotics and  		prosthetics; and modified furniture and furnishings (such as seat-lifting  		chairs). </p>
<p>In addition, there are a small but growing number of technologies  		designed mainly to assist caregivers in residential care settings. These  		include:</p>
<ul><li>wander management systems and products; </li>
<li>fall prevention and management products; </li>
<li>incontinence products; </li>
<li>assistance call systems; </li>
<li>assisted cognition products for individuals with dementia (sometimes  		  called "cognitive orthotics"); </li>
<li>technologies to enhance interactions with families and friends; </li>
<li>medication management systems; and </li>
<li>software to manage information to support regulatory and business  		  needs (e.g., MDS software; electronic medical records and recording devices).  		  </li>
</ul><p>For the purposes of this report, five aspects of care in residential  		settings--wander management, fall prevention, incontinence care, assistance  		call, and bathing--were identified as key areas in which to investigate  		technological developments.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> These areas were selected with input from the  		project's Technical Advisory Group based on the prevalence and relative  		importance (in terms of quality of care and monetary and other societal costs)  		of the underlying clinical issue being addressed by the technology. In the area  		of <b><i>wander management</i></b>, both low and high-tech options are  		available. Low-technology options include visual deterrents that are placed on  		or across doorways and simple battery-operated door alarms that monitor a  		single door. Higher-tech options include complex alarm systems that monitor  		multiple doors and elevators; Infrared and radio frequency based elopement  		management systems that can monitor many doors, elevators, and outdoor areas;  		and tracking systems that enable caregivers and local authorities to locate  		residents who have left the facility. </p>
<p>Three distinct approaches to <b><i>fall management</i></b> include  		technologies aimed at reducing the risk of a fall, those that reduce the risk  		of injury given a fall, and those that notify caregivers when a resident has  		fallen. Technologies aimed at reducing the risk of a fall include products such  		as anti-slip footwear and matting that provide a non-slip surface, grab bars  		that provide support and stability in bathrooms and other areas, and wheelchair  		anti-rollback devices that prevent a wheelchair from rolling away when  		residents stand or lower themselves into the chair. Other technologies include  		chair, bed, and toilet alarms that signal a caregiver when a resident who is at  		risk for falling attempts to leave a bed, chair, wheelchair, or toilet  		unattended. In addition, rehabilitation equipment geared toward the restoration  		and maintenance of strength, endurance, range of motion, bone density, balance,  		and gait can help reduce the occurrence of falls and fall-related injuries in  		older adults. Technologies aimed at reducing the risk of injury when falls  		occur include hip protectors, bedside cushions, and technologies that notify  		caregivers when a resident has fallen (e.g., using accelerometer technologies,  		which sense a change in body position, body altitude, and the force of impact  		to determine when a fall has occurred, or mercury switches that present an  		audible alarm when the device is tilted from a vertical (upright) position to  		horizontal (fallen) position). </p>
<p><b><i>Incontinence technologies</i></b> have been developed that prevent  		the leakage of urine; assist with restorative incontinence programs such as  		habit training and bladder retraining; and alert caregivers to an incontinent  		episode. Products that prevent leakage include urethral inserts for women that  		block the flow of urine at the bladder neck and penile clamps for men that put  		pressure on the urethra in order to prevent urine loss. Products that assist  		with restorative training include voiding reminders that encourage residents to  		void in intervals or predetermined times throughout the day; biofeedback  		devices that provide visual and auditory reinforcement while performing  		exercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles; enuresis alarms that wake the  		wearer with a vibrating alert at the first sign of moisture in an effort to  		retrain the bladder; and bladder scanners, which are used to obtain precise  		readings of bladder volume. Products that alert caregivers to an incontinent  		episode include enuresis alarms, which can be used to alert caregivers at the  		first sign of moisture with an audible alert or flashing light. </p>
<p>There are three major categories of <b><i>assistance call  		systems</i></b>: wired, wireless, and telephone based. Newly developed  		assistance call systems provide two-way voice communications allowing staff to  		determine need before going to the room. Some of these systems go to a central  		nursing station, while others tie into a cell phone/pager carried by each  		staff. The latest development is the passive call system that incorporates  		strategically placed motion sensors and software with individually defined  		parameters. These passive call systems automatically alert caregivers when a  		resident is engaged in a behavior defined as outside their acceptable range  		(degree of movement, time spent in a bathroom without exiting, etc.). </p>
<p>Many high and low technology products are available to assist both the  		resident and the caregiver with accessing bathing facilities, as well as  		performing the actual task of <b><i>bathing</i></b>. Examples of products that  		enable residents to access showers and tubs more independently and safely  		include barrier free showers, bathtub and shower chairs, transfer benches,  		portable in-tub bath lifts, commode/shower chairs, grab bars, and anti-slip  		matting and materials. There are also products that enable residents to perform  		the actual tasks of washing more independently. For example, wash mitts offer a  		washing solution for those with decreased fine motor skills and an inability to  		handle a washcloth. Long handled brushes and sponges enable residents with  		limited reach to wash areas such as their back and feet. In addition,  		rinse-free bathing products enable residents to wash their body and hair  		without the need for water or transferring into a tub or shower. Other products  		are geared toward making bathing and shower tasks safer and more efficient for  		caregivers. For example, products that assist caregivers with the transfer of  		residents to showers and tubs include height adjustable bathtubs, easy entry  		bathtubs, showering cabinets, bath lifts, shower trolleys, and commode/shower  		chairs. </p>
<p>A number of emerging technologies may be of interest in residential  		long-term care. For the purposes of this report an emerging technology refers  		to new technologies currently in use in the community or acute care settings  		that have potential applications in residential care settings. We focus in this  		report on the areas of pervasive and proactive computing, cognitive orthotics,  		and navigation technologies to enhance mobility, which appear to be especially  		relevant. </p>
<h3>Barriers to Implementing Technology in Residential  		Long-Term Care</h3>
<p>Through our review of the literature and conversations with providers,  		regulators, manufacturers and other experts, the following five themes emerged  		as potential barriers to implementing technologies in long-term care settings.  		</p>
<p><b>Lack of information about technologies and the residential long-term  		care market</b>. A pervasive theme was key groups'--manufacturers, providers,  		and regulators alike--lack of knowledge about the application of technologies  		in the residential care sector. Providers we spoke with said that they lack  		information about: (a) where to find technologies, (b) how to evaluate their  		applicability to their setting, (c) how to evaluate the stability of the  		technology manufacturer, and (d) how to assess cost-effectiveness of  		technology. Manufacturers we spoke with said they lack knowledge about how the  		long-term care market views the importance of technology. Regulators we spoke  		with said they lack information about the benefits of technology and the  		process by which to evaluate them. </p>
<p><b>Perceived lack of financial resources to develop and purchase  		residential long-term care technologies</b>. A second major theme is the  		perceived lack of financial resources for manufacturers and researchers to  		develop useful products and to allow for providers to purchase them.  		Manufacturers expressed concerns about liability exposure in both the health  		care and the long-term care industry. Almost all of the experts identified cost  		of technology, limited provider resources particularly for technologies that  		require a large initial investment, and limited reimbursement from private and  		public insurance as substantial barriers to purchasing new technologies. There  		was also a notable lack of discussion about the potential cost-savings or  		improvements in quality of care or quality life life. </p>
<p><b>Failure of regulatory process to keep pace with technological  		advances</b>. A third major theme is that outdated regulations and the  		regulatory process hamper the implementation of new technologies and limit  		manufacturers' creativity in conceptualizing new products. Although newer  		standards and codes may be more inclusive of the latest technologies, many  		states do not update their regulations on a regular basis, and thus are  		enforcing codes that do not account for the latest technologies. The regulatory  		environment places great emphasis on documentation requirements as the primary  		means of assessing compliance with codes, as opposed to considering how  		technology can improve quality of care and quality of life. </p>
<p><b>Industry's lack of standards for technologies central to residential  		long-term care</b>. We found a pervasive frustration among providers,  		manufacturers, and regulators alike with the lack of standards to facilitate  		the integration of new technologies into residential care settings. Several  		providers emphasized that the technologies would be far more effective if they  		were integrated with one another and that standards may facilitate this  		integration. Several manufacturers explained that standards would help in their  		development of new products, which often face different codes from state to  		state. Regulators expressed the desire for standards to help facilitate their  		evaluation of new technologies and whether they meet the intent of codes. </p>
<p><b>Providers' lack of knowledge and experience with implementing and  		managing technological change</b>. A majority of informants pointed to a lack  		of clarity about the most effective way to go about the process of  		incorporating technologies into residential care facilities. Providers cited  		"motivational" problems ranging from a lack of time, to the absence of a local  		champion, to simply ceasing to use of the technology after external supports  		are removed. The pattern of responses suggested that resistance was greater for  		technologies whose purpose was seen by staff to replace or reduce staff members  		to decrease the "human touch", or to monitor the staff. Providers with more  		successful experiences viewed the purpose of the technology to address a need  		expressed by the staff. Moreover, the pattern of responses suggested that  		technology introduced from the top-down met with resistance whereas providers  		who utilized a more participatory approach were more likely to describe their  		technology implementation experience as successful. </p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Our review of the literature and conversations with experts revealed a  		complex set of circumstances contributing to the current situation. The  		methodology we employed uncovered five general themes, but in many cases  		further research will be needed to confirm the relative importance of each of  		these themes to the overall challenge. In light of these findings, we provide a  		series of educational and exploratory strategies to be considered. </p>

</ol><h2><a name="scope" id="scope">I. SCOPE OF ISSUE AND POLICY RELEVANCE</a></h2>
<p>Technology plays a vital role in the lives of older individuals. Indeed,  		for those in need of long-term care, it can potentially improve the efficiency  		of care delivery while increasing the quality of that care and individuals'  		quality of life. There are important reasons to focus on technologies that are  		specifically suited to residential long-term care settings. </p>
<p>Although the roughly 2 million older Americans living in nursing homes  		and other residential care settings represent a minority of older persons, they  		constitute a group of interest for the development of technological  		applications for several reasons. First, nearly all persons in residential  		long-term care settings have physical or cognitive limitations that result in  		disability; thus, technologies targeted at residential long-term care can  		potentially reach large numbers of older people with the greatest needs.  		Second, the financial and societal costs associated with caring for this group  		are substantial and are projected to increase dramatically. In the year 2002,  		for example, over $100 billion was spent on nursing home care (Levit et al.,  		2004). Third, the number of older people in need of long-term care is expected  		to increase dramatically in the coming decades due to the aging of the baby  		boom generation. In particular, the number of older people with Alzheimer's  		disease, about half of whom are cared for in residential care settings, is  		projected to increase dramatically from about 4.5 million today to over 13  		million by 2050 (Hebert, Scherr, Bienias, Bennett, &amp; Evans, 2003; National  		Institute on Aging, 2000-2001). If designed and implemented appropriately,  		technology can potentially be an important instrument in attaining high quality  		cost-effective care for this population. </p>
<p>To understand the scope of the issue, we provide background information  		in this report on four distinct but related topics. First, we describe the  		current residential long-term care market. Second, we describe current  		challenges in the residential long-term care market that set the backdrop for  		understanding technological innovations. A third section describes what we know  		about the residential long-term care technology industry. A final section  		describes existing financing mechanisms for developing and purchasing  		technologies in residential care settings. </p>
<h3>A. The Residential Long-Term Care Market</h3>
<p>The residential long-term market is a continuum of care and includes  		nursing homes, assisted living facilities, board and care facilities,  		continuing care retirement communities, and adult day care facilities. The  		overwhelming majority of people in residential long-term care settings are  		elderly (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2004); the majority has  		a physical disability and 70% have cognitive limitations, most often  		Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid  		Services, 2004). In contrast, "aging services" (Center for Aging Services  		Technology, 2003) encompasses these residential long-term care settings as well  		as a variety of home-based care services and consumer products aimed at keeping  		older individuals living independently in the community as long as possible.  		Although products and services developed under the rubric of aging services  		most often focus on keeping individuals functioning independently in the  		community, many of these products can be used in a residential long-term care  		setting. In addition, the products developed explicitly for the residential  		long-term care market often seek to support caregivers, particularly in  		situations where residents have dementia, or to facilitate organizational  		functions. </p>
<p>In 1999, there were 18,000 nursing homes in the United States serving  		1.6 million people. The majority of facilities (67%) are proprietary; 60% are  		affiliated with a chain; and 97% are certified by either Medicare or Medicaid.  		Nine out of ten nursing home residents in 1999 were age 65 years or older and  		nearly three-fourths were women. The severity of disability in this population  		has been increasing: In 1996, 82.9% of residents needed assistance with three  		or more activities of daily living (such as bathing, dressing, transferring,  		feeding, and toileting), compared to 71.8% in 1987 (Rhoades &amp; Krauss,  		1999). Annual expenses for nursing homes have been rising and a greater share  		is being paid by the government (Rhoades &amp; Sommers, 2001). From 1980 to  		2002, total expenditures for nursing homes increased from $18 billion to $103  		billion and, in 2002, $66 billion was paid from pubic sources, primarily  		Medicaid (Levit et al., 2004). </p>
<p>Less is known about the fast-growing segment of the residential care  		market known as "assisted living." Assisted living offers supportive living  		environments for persons who need assistance but who do not require the 24-hour  		skilled nursing care available in nursing homes. The definition and terminology  		varies by state; other names for these kinds of living arrangements include  		residential care, personal care, adult congregate care, boarding home, and  		domiciliary care. At a minimum, assisted living facilities offer 24-hour  		supervision and assistance and two to three meals per day in a common dining  		area. Other common support services include housekeeping and laundry services,  		medication reminders and/or help with medications, help with personal care  		activities including bathing, toileting, dressing, and eating, transportation,  		security, health monitoring, care management, and activities. In a national  		study of assisted living conducted in 1998, there were 11,500 facilities  		serving approximately half a million people with disabilities, with about  		one-fourth of residents receiving help with three or more activities of daily  		living and about one-third having moderate to severe cognitive impairment  		(Hawes, Rose, &amp; Phillips, 1999). Data for the year 2000 from the National  		Center for Assisted Living suggests the figure is approximately 33,000  		residences housing about 800,000 people (National Center for Assisted Living,  		2001b); a 2002 survey put the figure at 36,000 facilities serving 900,000  		residents (Mollica, 2002). Unlike nursing homes, assisted living is most often  		paid for privately by individuals and their families; however, states have been  		expanding the use of Medicaid and other federal and state sources to help pay  		for care in an assisted living setting. </p>
<p>Other parts of the residential long-term care market include continuing  		care retirement communities, board and care facilities, and adult day  		facilities. Continuing care retirement communities offer a full range of  		housing, residential services, and health care in order to serve their older  		residents as their needs change over time. A growing segment of the residential  		long-term care market, one relatively recent estimate suggests 350,000  		residents live in these communities. Group homes and board and care facilities  		offer a range of supported services, typically to younger adults with  		disabilities. Often these adults are diagnosed with mental retardation or  		developmental disability (MR/DD). In 2001, 387,000 individuals with MR/DD lived  		in 122,260 residential care settings. Adult day services are community-based  		daytime group programs designed to meet the needs of individuals with physical  		and cognitive impairments. Approximately 3,500 facilities serve on average 25  		clients per day; most facilities are private pay and public funding is  		generally limited (Pandya, 2004). </p>
<h3>B. Industry Challenges Pertinent to Technology</h3>
<p>The residential long-term care industry is facing several inter-related  		challenges that heighten the need for technological innovations. </p>
<p><i><b>Increased emphasis on improving quality of care and resident  		quality of life. </b></i></p>
<p>Concern about quality has come from within the residential care  		industry, particularly from nursing homes that are part of the growing movement  		referred to as "culture change" or "resident centered care." The aim of this  		movement is to change the organizational system of care provided in nursing  		homes so that it is more focused on the quality of the relationships between  		residents/families and staff and between staff members themselves at all levels  		(Ronch, 2003). Members of the industry involved in this movement have a dual  		focus. One is a focus on exploring how the structure and processes of care need  		to be modified on an organizational level to improve outcomes. While many  		organizational models can be found in the business literature, researchers in  		long-term care have begun pointing to the difficulties in applying these models  		in the long-term care arena (Eaton, 2000). The second focus of the culture  		change movement represents a shift in values from the simple completion of  		tasks to be done (e.g., feeding a resident) to a focus in how the completion of  		these tasks can be modified to serve other, less mechanistic, goals (e.g.,  		helping the resident be as independent as possible and feel respected and cared  		for while being assisted at meals). Although preliminary research suggests that  		programs such as the Wellspring model may reduce staff turnover and the number  		of deficiencies on surveys (Stone et al., 2002) more work is needed to  		determine what elements of these models might be most efficacious and how  		technology might be of service to facilities engaging in these innovative  		programs. </p>
<p>Federal and state regulators are also interested in improving quality of  		care for residents, particularly in the nursing home segment. Quality of care  		in nursing homes has been of interest to the Federal Government for many years.  		OBRA-87 and subsequent federal legislation established goals for quality care  		and patient quality of life in nursing homes, requirements for resident  		assessment and care planning, and a new prospective payment system.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> The regulations require that all  		certified nursing homes use a standardized comprehensive functional assessment  		tool (Minimum Data Set (MDS)) to assess all residents and assist in developing  		individualized care plans. In November 2002, CMS's Nursing Home Compare website  		(<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare">http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare</a>)  		began reporting quality measures based on MDS information for all certified  		nursing homes, with the aim of educating consumers and motivating nursing home  		facilities to improve care. These measures include, for example, assessing  		pain, pressure sores, and restraint use. </p>
<p>States are also applying increased pressure on facilities to improve  		their quality of care. Many states make state survey data available on publicly  		accessible websites. Again, these measures are intended to educate consumers  		and to motivate nursing home facilities to improve care. </p>
<p>Increased concerns about the quality of care in assisted living  		facilities have also been raised by federal agencies and others (U.S. General  		Accounting Office, 1999). In one study of four states, GAO investigators found  		one-fourth of the facilities they reviewed were cited by state licensing,  		ombudsman, or other agencies for five or more quality of life or consumer  		protection related deficiencies. State approaches vary widely but there has  		been a growing trend nationally toward regulating these environments and there  		is great variation in regulatory approach (Mollica, 2002). Still, assisted  		living facilities are generally subject to far fewer regulations than nursing  		homes. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing shortage in long-term care</i></b>. The nationwide  		shortage of nurses is especially severe in long-term care. Labor costs account  		for the largest share of nursing home expenses; approximately two-thirds of  		nursing home costs are related to labor (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid  		Services, 2003; Grabowski, Feng, Intrator, &amp; Mor, 2004). In 1999 there were  		approximately 1 million registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and  		nurses aides working in nursing homes (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001)  		providing care to roughly 1.6 million individuals. Other segments of the  		continuum are also experiencing shortages. </p>
<p>According to projections developed by ASPE, by 2050 the demand for  		direct care workers in long-term care settings will increase by over 200%.  		During the same time period, only a slight increase is expected in the supply  		of workers who have traditionally filled these jobs (Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, 2003). </p>
<p>In a recent report to Congress, the Department of Health and Human  		Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) identified a "comprehensive  		set of recommendations to address potential imbalances between the future  		demand for and supply of direct care workers in long-term care settings." One  		such recommendation involved enhanced use of technology to "explore use of new  		technology in recruitment, education and training, recordkeeping and patient  		care." </p>
<p><b><i>Financial pressures and change in Medicaid spending</i></b>.  		According to the most recently available Health Care Industry Market Update on  		Nursing Facilities from CMS (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services,  		2003), financial pressures in the industry continue due in part to continued  		pressures on states to limit growth in Medicaid. </p>
<p>Financed through a combination of federal and state funds, Medicaid  		continues to be the largest payer for nursing home care. Recent studies suggest  		that nursing home payment rates have thus far remained largely unaffected by  		state budget difficulties (Grabowski et al., 2004; U.S. General Accounting  		Office, 2003). The General Accounting Office report suggests that many states  		were able to avoid making significant changes to nursing home payment rates by  		relying on tobacco settlement funds and new taxes (including taxes on nursing  		homes), but payment reductions may be possible in the future. According to one  		study, in fiscal year 2004, 19 states cut or froze nursing home rates. In the  		future, the depletion of tobacco fund settlement, and phasing out of the  		intergovernmental transfers that have been used to increase federal Medicaid  		matching payments (Allen, 2004), may put additional pressure on states to limit  		Medicaid spending. At the same time, although the majority of Medicaid funds  		spent on long-term care continue to go to institutions, over the past decade or  		so, the Federal Government has provided states with options and tools to  		increase community-based long-term care options (Crisp, Eiken, Gerst, &amp;  		Justice, 2003).<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Risk management issues</i></b>. An additional source of financial  		pressure comes from the rising costs associated with risk management including  		litigation costs, liability insurance and costs associated with worker  		injuries. With respect to litigation, analysis of data provided by the  		long-term care industry suggests that the average number of claims per 1,000  		beds has tripled over the past 10 years to 14.5 in 2002 (Centers for Medicare  		&amp; Medicaid Services, 2003). A study of nursing home litigation attorneys  		found nursing home litigation to be substantial in terms of both the number of  		nursing home claims and the size of recoveries (Stevenson &amp; Studdert,  		2003). Dramatic increases in liability insurance and reduced access to such  		insurance also have been noted (Wright, 2003). With respect to worker's  		injuries, nursing homes and personal care homes continue to be a leading  		industry with respect to incidence of total nonfatal occupational injury and  		illness, with 187,000 work-related injuries or illnesses reported in 2002,  		representing an incidence rate of 12.6 per hundred workers (Bureau of Labor  		Statistics, 2003). In 2002, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  		(OSHA) began a National Emphasis Program to focus outreach efforts in nursing  		and personal care facilities with high injury and illness rates and in 2003  		OSHA issued new guidelines for resident handling and transferring, one of the  		largest causes of injury in the industry. </p>
<p><b><i>Challenges of caring for persons with dementia in residential  		settings</i></b>. According to the National Institute on Aging (2002), 4.5  		million people currently suffer from Alzheimer's Disease, and 377,000 new cases  		are diagnosed each year. These numbers are projected to increase to nearly one  		million new cases a year by 2050, as the proportion of people over 85 continues  		to increase (National Institute on Aging, 2002). Almost half of these  		individuals are cared for in various forms of shared residential care settings  		(National Institute on Aging, 2000-2001). </p>
<p>Research suggests the percentage of nursing home residents with dementia  		may be as high as 80-90% (Teresi, Morris, Mattis, Mattis, &amp; Reisberg,  		2000), although most researchers put the estimate closer to 70% (Maslow &amp;  		Ory, 2001). The percentages are lower but still substantial for assisted living  		settings; for example, a 1998 survey conducted by the Assisted Living  		Federation of America found that 47% of residents in assisted living facilities  		experienced cognitive impairment (Assisted Living Federation of America, 1999).  		In addition, many people in these settings are indigent, have few family  		supports, behavior problems associated with dementia, and many co-morbidities  		(Kane &amp; Kane, 2001). </p>
<p>Care responsibilities in residential care settings are different in many  		ways from those at home. Perhaps most important, the direct care worker in a  		residential long-term care setting is most often caring for multiple residents  		with dementia, each with individualized needs and preferences. Little attention  		has focused on the development of technologies to support caregivers in  		residential care settings. </p>
<h3>C. The Residential Long-Term Care Technology  		Industry</h3>
<p>There is little information available on the number and scope of  		technology firms who design, research, test, manufacture, and distribute  		products for use in long-term care residential settings. Some products have  		been designed to work across the continuum of aging services, working in  		multiple settings, such as home or hospital settings (e.g., traditional nurse  		call technology, grab bars; medication management systems). Other products are  		designed for and marketed to individuals with disabilities, irrespective of  		setting (e.g., mobility devices, communications devices). Finally, some  		technologies are created expressly for residential long-term care settings  		(e.g., call systems for residents with dementia; MDS systems). </p>
<p>There are important differences in emphasis between products designed  		for individuals with disabilities and those designed for use in residential  		long-term care. Generally speaking, the aim of assistive technologies for  		people with disabilities is to enhance independence and participation; in a  		residential care environment, enhancing the caregiver's ability to provide care  		is also important. Moreover, although assistive technologies have been  		developed to address cognitive limitations related to traumatic brain injuries,  		learning disabilities, and developmental disabilities, there are relatively  		fewer products that address progressive dementia. This represents another gap  		or opportunity (depending on one's perspective) since in residential care  		settings dementia is pervasive, affecting on average 70% of residents. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a great deal of overlap between the assistive  		technology industry and companies targeting residential long-term care  		providers. A recent report by the Department of Commerce (2003) suggests global  		sales by companies producing assistive technology products and services in the  		United States totaled $2.9 billion in 1999. The Department of Commerce also  		estimates approximately 1,600 firms make up the assistive technology industry  		(personal communication Margaret Cahill, U.S. Department of Commerce). Products  		are generally geared to helping individuals maintain or regain as much  		independence as possible and include:</p>
<ul><li>architectural elements such as door opening/closing devices, lifts  		  and elevators, ramps, safety equipment and accessible showers; </li>
<li>communication devices (such as augmentative communication devices);  		  </li>
<li>telecommunications devices (such as wireless and wireline telephones,  		  text telephones, amplified telephones, talking pagers); </li>
<li>sensory aids (such as hearing aids, assistive listening devices,  		  tactile aids for the deaf/blind, alerting devices, Braille note takers); </li>
<li>computers and adaptive computing devices; </li>
<li>environmental controls (including remotely controlled door openers,  		  telephones, lights and televisions); </li>
<li>aids to daily living (including aids for dressing, toileting,  		  washing, bathing, showering, dental care, skin care, housekeeping, handling and  		  manipulating products, and orientation); </li>
<li>mobility aids; </li>
<li>orthotics and prosthetics; </li>
<li>accessible items for recreation, leisure, and sports; and </li>
<li>and modified furniture and furnishings (such as seat-lifting chairs).  		  </li>
</ul><p>All of these categories of products could potentially be used by older  		adults in residential care settings; however, in practice sales of these  		products for use by residents in these settings is likely a very small portion  		of sales, for two reasons. First, only 2 million (4%) of the approximately 50  		million people ages 5 and older with a disability live in residential care  		settings. Second, a disproportionate share of people living in these  		residential care settings are poor: 60% of the nation's 1.6 million nursing  		home residents are covered by Medicaid (Jones, 2002) whereas only 16% of those  		living in the community with a disability are poor (Freedman, Schoeni, &amp;  		Martin, 2004). </p>
<p>In addition to the kinds of products listed above, the residential  		long-term care technology market includes products designed mainly to assist  		caregivers in providing care to residents. Additional categories include, for  		example:</p>
<ul><li>wander management systems and products; </li>
<li>fall prevention and management products; </li>
<li>incontinence products; </li>
<li>assistance call systems; </li>
<li>assisted cognition products for individuals with dementia; </li>
<li>products to enhance interactions with families and friends; </li>
<li>medication management systems; and </li>
<li>software to manage information to support regulatory and business  		  needs (e.g., MDS software; electronic medical records and recording devices).  		  </li>
</ul><p>There are no estimates of the size of the residential long-term care  		technology industry. As of January 2005, we have identified 270 manufacturers  		and distributors of products related to wander management, fall prevention,  		management incontinence, assistance call, and bathing (for a complete list see  		<a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a>). </p>
<p>No systematic information is available on the long-term care technology  		industry's research and development resources. However, the Department of  		Commerce (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2003) found that most assistive  		technology companies obtain funds for research and development from internal  		resources. Approximately $100 million (or 3.5% of revenues) was spent in 1999  		by assistive technology companies; half of this or $50 million was spent by the  		largest 11 companies all of whom relied on internal resources. External funding  		from outside entities such as banks, venture capitalists, or state and Federal  		Government grant programs was obtained exclusively by small firms and made up  		about $3.5 million or 10% of research and developments expenditures by small  		firms in 1999. The report suggests that there is a need by many assistive  		technology companies to access outside capital sources but that companies do  		not appear to be aware of or know how to go about obtaining private and public  		sector funding opportunities. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants  		are one resource available to this sector; yet only 14% of firms surveyed  		applied for these funds over a 3-year period.(U.S. Department of Commerce,  		2003) </p>
<h3>D. Sources of Funding for Technology in Residential Care  		Settings</h3>
<p>There is very little information available on sources of funding  		currently used to purchase technology in long-term care settings. Hence it is  		not clear who is paying for technologies (i.e., providers, family members,  		private donations, insurers). No data is available on private sources of  		funding. More is known about public sources, which are summarized below. </p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid</i></b>. Medicaid coverage of technology varies by state,  		with each state implementing its own system under the federal guidelines.  		Reimbursement is based upon broad categories of treatment rather than specific  		types of equipment. Medicaid is automatically available to recipients of SSI in  		39 states. Certain services are required under the federal guidelines, but each  		state can establish their own definitions of what services are covered and what  		are not covered. Durable medical equipment (DME), such as mobility aids,  		prostheses and orthoses, hearing and vision aids are typically funded.  		Medicaid's Inpatient Hospital Care Program and Community-Based Waiver program  		are another avenue to obtain reimbursement for equipment. In keeping with the  		Medicaid statute to cover all phases of equipment deemed medically necessary,  		Medicaid will cover the cost of the evaluation, the equipment itself, and any  		follow-up training (Gradel, 2002). However, Medicaid only funds medical devices  		for individuals, not for organizations that provide services to Medicaid  		recipients. </p>
<p><b><i>Medicare</i></b>. Medicare covers medically necessary assistive  		technology, including mobility aids, prostheses, and orthoses. Items that are  		not seen as being medical equipment, such as technology used in the bathroom  		and vehicle modifications, are not typically covered under the Medicare  		program. Medicare coverage is available to older persons (65+), persons who  		have a disability, those in renal failure, and persons who have received Social  		Security disability income for at least 24 months (Gradel, 2002). </p>
<p><b><i>Tech Act</i></b>. The Tech Act mandates states to implement  		programs to improve persons with disabilities access to assistive technology  		(AT) and home modifications. Another option is the Alternative Financing  		Program (AFP), funded under Title III of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998.  		The AFP makes assistive technology available to persons with disabilities  		through low-cost financing, when they might not be eligible otherwise for  		conventional financing opportunities. </p>
<p>Through the AFP program, $3.8 million in federal grants were made  		available for the first time in October 2000 to persons with disabilities in  		six states, with matching funds coming from the states, which included Kansas,  		Maryland, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia. The amount of loan money  		available, interest rate, and repayment terms vary from state to state. The  		grants made it possible for persons with disabilities to purchase assistive  		technology through low-cost loans that might not otherwise be available to them  		through conventional bank loans. In the first year of the program, 229 of the  		315 requests for loans (65%) were funded. Of $8.6 million available loan  		dollars in the first year of the program, $2.3 million in loans was disbursed,  		with a median loan of $5,000. By FY 2002, both the number of states with AT  		loan programs as well as the amount of available loan dollars had risen, with  		$30 million loan dollars available to continue the AT loan financing program in  		2002 (Wallace, 2003). </p>
<h3>E. Purpose of this Report</h3>
<p>Technology potentially offers to residential long-term care providers a  		means to improve quality of care and quality of life for residents while  		increasing organizational efficiencies. To the degree that technologies can  		facilitate the coordination of individualized care for multiple residents they  		may enhance the quality of care and quality of life of residents in these  		settings. To the extent that technologies can facilitate direct care worker's  		jobs, and enhance recruitment, education and training efforts, they may in part  		alleviate some of the ill effects of the impending shortage of long-term care  		professional and paraprofessional workers. To the degree that technologies can  		improve documentation and the flow of information, they may potentially improve  		the efficiency of care delivery. To the degree that technology can reduce  		worker injuries or lessen negative outcomes associated with resident wandering,  		egress, or falls, it is possible the costs of risk management in residential  		care facilities could be reduced. </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is threefold: (1) to describe a range of  		existing and emerging technological solutions for select care issues salient to  		residential care settings; (2) to identify, based on a review of the literature  		and discussions with experts in the field, barriers to the successful  		implementation of technology in residential care settings; and (3) to propose  		next steps to address the barriers. </p>
<p>We begin with a chapter that describes the methodology we used to gather  		information about existing technologies and barriers to their implementation.  		<a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#tech">Chapter 3</a> describes five key care issues of interest in  		long-term care settings and existing technological solutions.  		<a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#develop">Chapter 4</a> provides illustrations of emerging  		technologies that might be of use in long-term care settings.  		<a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#barrier">Chapter 5</a> provides a series of viewpoints on barriers  		and challenges to bringing technology into long-term care.

<h2><a name="define" id="define">II. DEFINITIONS, FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>Here we provide definitions of salient terms used in this report and  		propose a framework for thinking about the effectiveness of technologies in  		residential long-term care settings. We then describe the methodologies used to  		identify products and technologies, and barriers to implementation of assistive  		technologies in these settings. </p>
<h3>A. Definitions</h3>
<p><i>Technology</i> is defined in this report as specialized equipment or  		product systems that may be commercially acquired and used to improve the  		quality of care, quality of life, or efficiencies of care delivered in  		residential care settings. This definition of technology excludes mainstream  		technology (e.g., cell phones, remote controls), medical technologies (e.g.,  		pacemakers, defibrillators, feeding tubes) and universal design applications  		(e.g., lowered light switches), but potentially includes both high and low  		technology applications (e.g., sensor-based monitoring systems and anti-slip  		footwear), with preference given to highlighting technologies that are more  		sophisticated and more recently developed. </p>
<p>We focus here on technologies of use in <i>residential care  		settings</i>. Residential care settings include nursing homes, assisted living  		facilities, board and care facilities, day care facilities, and continuing care  		retirement communities. However, some products and issues may apply to  		community settings. </p>
<h3>B. Framework</h3>
<p><b><i>The purpose of technology in long-term care</i></b>. In order to  		understand the barriers to implementing technology in residential long-term  		care, it is useful to review the meaning and purpose of technology in this  		setting. There is no agreed upon single purpose for technology. Moreover, the  		value technology brings may differ depending on one's role in providing care.  		</p>
<p>In our conversations with long-term care providers, explicit goals that  		were mentioned related to uniformity, efficiency, and enhancing care delivery  		through the use of objective information. Providers also acknowledged  		technologies may serve several, at times competing, purposes. Another provider  		noted that technology can provide information to manage liability risks or to  		act upon to enhance the quality of care and quality of life of residents. </p>
<p>Implicit in many of these statements is the notion that technological  		solutions will replace staff judgment and supplant value that caregivers bring  		to the caregiving process. We did not speak with any direct care workers in  		preparing this report, so we do not have the direct voice of those who will  		participate in using the technologies on the front-line. However, a recent  		evaluation of the difficulties experienced during the implementation a call  		system in one facility suggests that direct care workers' goals and  		expectations for technologies also influence the process (Bower, Van Haitsma,  		&amp; Curyto, 2003). In their final report, the authors note: </p>
<blockquote><p>"It will be productive for developers of long-term care technologies  		  to learn the meaning its technology holds for users and to incorporate that  		  meaning into its conceptualization and implementation. Similarly, an important  		  step for long-term care facilities that are considering integrating a new  		  technology into its care routines will be to explore the "fit" between the  		  technology it wants to install and the needs, wants, and expectations of the  		  people--at all levels--who will be using it." </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Framework in this report</i></b>. In this report we conceive of  		technology as being potentially effective in three interrelated areas:  		enhancing the quality of care of residents; enhancing the quality of life of  		residents; and increasing efficiencies of care. </p>
<p>Improving <b>quality of care</b> is a primary goal of technological  		innovations. Quality of care in nursing homes has been a critical concern for  		many years. As highlighted in AHRQ's most recent report on the Quality of the  		Nation's HealthCare (Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality, U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services, 2003) although the use of restraints  		has been reduced from over 45% in the late 1980s to less than 10% today, other  		quality indicators have room for improvement. For example, about 15% of  		long-stay residents experience a loss in ability to perform at least one of  		four ADLs (bed mobility, transfers, toilet use, or eating) and 8.5% experience  		pressure sores. About 11% of long-stay residents experiencing pain are reported  		by staff to have moderate or excruciating pain in the last 7-day period. Many  		technologies exist to enhance quality of care in each of these areas. For  		example, technologies exist to enhance transfers and mobility (which are often  		painful events for the residents), to enhance functional competence in eating  		and toileting, to minimize incontinence (which may in turn reduce the  		development of pressure sores), and to enhance communication between resident  		and caregiver. </p>
<p>Resident <b>quality of life</b> also can be enhanced through  		technologies. Nursing homes have been characterized as places where older  		people are lonely, bored, and isolated. Quality of life domains have been  		developed by Rosalie Kane under contract by the Centers for Medicare and  		Medicaid Services (Kane &amp; Kane, 2001). Kane and colleagues have defined  		eleven components of quality of life: autonomy, dignity, individuality,  		privacy, functional competence, relationships, meaningful activity, enjoyment,  		safety/security, comfort, and spiritual well-being. </p>
<p>Technologies may be targeted at one or more quality of life domains. For  		example, mobility devices may enhance functional competence and meaningful  		activity, computer technologies may facilitate relationships and enjoyment,  		wandering technologies may enhance safety/security and autonomy. In general,  		one of the primary challenges in providing care for long-term care residents,  		particularly those with dementia, is how to balance the different domains of  		quality of life. For example, does the technology ensure safety/security  		without placing excessive restriction on individual autonomy? </p>
<p>Unlike the concepts of quality of care and quality of life, the domains  		associated with <b>organizational efficiencies</b> of care delivery in  		residential long-term care settings have not been identified conceptually or  		measured empirically. Yet one can imagine that technology may help minimize the  		time it takes to complete particular tasks, particularly with respect to  		communication, documentation, and other paperwork tasks. Or technology that  		prevents injury at work may minimize the number of employees one needs to  		recruit, hire, and train in the course of a year. Some new technologies rely on  		sensors to record information about resident behavior or location and transmit  		that information to mobile caregivers. New electronic medical records may  		facilitate and streamline documentation tasks. In other cases, equipment may  		help reduce worker injuries, for example, by facilitating ergonomically correct  		resident transfers. </p>
<p>Other technologies allow staff to shift the focus of their work from  		documentation or management activities to hands-on care. In fact, one provider  		envisioned the successful implementation of technology as shifting not the  		<i>number</i> of hours but the <i>type</i> of work carried out by the staff so  		that less time is spent on management activities and more on direct contact  		between caregiver and resident. </p>
<p>Note that enhancing functional independence through technologies could  		in some cases shift hands-on care to supervision of self-care, which could in  		some cases require <i>additional</i> labor hours. </p>
<p>Theoretically, implementation of technologies could either increase or  		decrease overall costs of care, depending on a number of factors. Potential  		cost-savings could occur, for example, if a technology reduced the occurrence  		of workers compensation claims, lowered staff turnover, reduced insurance,  		liability, and litigation costs, or reduced health care costs related to  		resident injury. On the other hand, costs of care could increase if a  		technology was not well-designed or not implemented appropriately </p>
<h3>C. Methodology</h3>
<p><b><i>Technology product identification</i></b>. To organize our search  		for existing technologies, we first selected key care delivery issues based  		upon several criteria, including:</p>
<ul><li>the prevalence and relative importance (in terms of monetary and  		  other societal costs) of the underlying clinical issue being addressed by the  		  technology; </li>
<li>the recommendations solicited from experts in the field of aging who  		  served on the project's technical advisory group; and </li>
<li>feedback from focus groups conducted with administrators and direct  		  care staff in long-term care facilities. </li>
</ul><p>From this process we initially identified four care issues to begin  		product searches: falls, wandering, incontinence, and assistance call. We later  		expanded the care issues to including bathing. All five care issues have been  		mounted on <a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a>.  		We expect two additional areas--medication management and transferring--to be  		mounted on the web site by September 2005.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>To identify existing products of use in long-term care settings, we  		conducted extensive literature and Internet searches, consulted long-term care  		buyer's guides, and spoke with technology manufacturers and vendors at various  		conferences. The search for new products was concluded after exhaustive  		Internet sweeps yielded no additional products following two hours of browsing  		by a professional librarian. Products were then classified into meaningful,  		exhaustive, and mutually exclusive product types by the team's Rehabilitation  		Technologist. </p>
<p>Emerging technologies being developed for long-term care settings or in  		use in other settings were identified in several ways. The majority of these  		technologies were identified through detailed Internet keyword searches. Many  		of these searches led to resources that listed related research projects and  		products under development. Some examples of these resources include the Center  		For Aging Service Technology (CAST) Clearinghouse website and the University of  		Washington Department of Computer Science website. Additional information and  		resources was gathered from experts in the field of aging as well as technology  		and aging conferences and symposiums. </p>
<p><b><i>Barrier identification</i></b>. We used a two-pronged strategy to  		gather information about barriers to the successful implementation of  		technology in residential care settings. </p>
<p>First, we conducted extensive internet and library searches. For each  		care issue, we searched for reports and publications related to barriers to  		implementing technology. We also searched state and federal codes to identify  		relevant legal barriers for specific types of technologies (e.g., requirements  		for hard wired or resident activated call systems; ADA specifications related  		to bathroom technologies; fire codes related to wandering technologies). We  		also gathered information on existing state technology outreach and financing  		programs available to long-term care settings. </p>
<p>Second, we spoke with 16 experts representing four distinct perspectives  		in long-term care: three regulators, six providers, four technology  		manufacturers, and three other experts about their experience with barriers to  		implementing technology in long-term care settings. (See <a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#appendA">Appendix A</a> for examples of the questions used.)<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> These experts were selected in  		part because of their experience with the first five care issues included in  		the <a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a> web site:  		fall management, wander management, incontinence, assistance call, and bathing.  		Our conversations were intended to elicit general themes that cross cut many  		types of technologies but also to glean specific examples related to these five  		classes of technologies.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Project Coordinator, Co-PI and Consultant participated in these  		conversations, which lasted on average 30-45 minutes. Interviews were tape  		recorded with permission and verbatim transcriptions of the interviews were  		made (without identifiers). These transcriptions served as the basis for the  		qualitative content analysis. Each transcript was reviewed by two project team  		members and sorted into content categories. In addition to the three  		pre-identified content categories of "social", "regulatory" and "financial",  		the qualitative analysis yielded two other important categories--the perceived  		need for technological standards and concerns related to managing and  		implementing change. </p>
<p>Within each of these five categories, different themes were identified.  		A theme is an important, meaningful principle that shapes experts' perceptions  		of barriers to implementing technology in long-term care settings. The themes  		discussed herein were salient for at least three of the 16 individuals who  		participated in these conversations. The reader is reminded that themes were  		identified based on conversations with a small number of people and generally  		should be interpreted as areas for further systematic exploration. </p>
<h2><a name="tech" id="tech">III. TECHNOLOGIES IN RESIDENTIAL LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>Technologies exist that compliment and enhance many areas of care  		provision and activities of long-term care residents including, but not limited  		to; assistance call, fall management, wander management, incontinence,  		mobility, lifting and transfers, communication, leisure, and medication  		distribution. We discuss five of those areas here.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>A. Fall Prevention and Management<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></h3>
<p><b><i>Scope of the issue</i></b>. One half of nursing home residents  		fall annually (Przybelski &amp; Shea, 2001), three times the rate for persons  		in the community (Rubenstein, Josephson, &amp; Osterweil, 1996). The average  		incidence of falls in nursing homes is 1.5 falls per bed per year (Rubenstein  		et al., 1996). One in five nursing home residents who fall sustain soft tissue  		damage or fracture (Hegland, 1993). Nearly one-third of all nursing home claims  		nationally involve a fall (Stevenson &amp; Studdert, 2003). </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, demands on long-term care staff increase significantly  		as a result of falls (Hill-Westmoreland, Soeken, &amp; Spellbring, 2002) When  		falls are recurrent, nursing homes are subject to costly liability suits and  		hefty increases in insurance premiums (Hegland, 1993). Since 1994, liability  		premiums for long-term care facilities have on average increased 200 to 600%  		(Hyatt, 2003). </p>
<p><b><i>Technologies</i></b>. Three distinct approaches to fall management  		include technologies aimed at reducing the risk of a fall, those that reduce  		the risk of injury given a fall, and those that notify caregivers when a  		resident has fallen. </p>
<p>Technologies aimed at reducing the risk of a fall include products such  		as anti-slip footwear and matting that provide a non-slip surface to stand on,  		grab bars that provide support and stability in bathrooms and other areas, and  		wheelchair anti-rollback devices that prevent a wheelchair from rolling away  		when residents stand or lower themselves into the chair. Other technologies  		include chair, bed, and toilet alarms that signal a caregiver when a resident  		who is at risk for falling attempts to leave a bed, chair, wheelchair, or  		toilet unattended. In addition, rehabilitation equipment geared toward the  		restoration and maintenance of strength, endurance, range of motion, bone  		density, balance, and gait can help reduce the occurrence of falls and fall  		related injuries in older adults. </p>
<p>Technologies aimed at reducing the risk of injury when falls occur  		include products such as hip protectors designed to protect the hip from injury  		in the event of a fall. In addition, bedside cushions are meant to reduce the  		impact of a fall if a resident rolls out of bed. </p>
<p>Technologies that notify caregivers when a resident has fallen include  		devices that use accelerometer technologies, which sense a change in body  		position, body altitude, and the force of impact to determine when a fall has  		occurred. Other more simple devices use mercury switches that present an  		audible alarm when the device is tilted from a vertical (upright) position to  		horizontal (fallen) position. </p>
<h3>B. Wander Management<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></h3>
<p><b><i>Scope of the issue</i></b>. Although wandering refers to a group  		of related behaviors (up to 18 different kinds of wandering have been  		identified--(dbS Productions)), it most often is characterized by walking  		around without apparent purpose or direction. This type of behavior may  		increase a resident's risk for falls (see earlier discussion). When the  		behavior results in leaving a location unnoticed or unattended, the  		consequences can be even more detrimental and may include fractures,  		dehydration, hypothermia/exposure or death. The term <i>egress</i> is used to  		describe a situation when a resident leaves a facility unattended. </p>
<p>Studies suggest that between 52% and 69% of individuals with dementia  		have at least one episode of walking out of their residence and getting lost  		(Calkins &amp; Namazi, 1991; Hope, Tilling, Gedling, Keene, &amp; Cooper, 1994;  		Teri, Larson, &amp; Reifler, 1988). Every year, there are over 125,000 searches  		for people with Alzheimer's disease who wander from the safety of their  		residences (homes and long-term care settings). It is estimated that 46%-50% of  		these people die if not located within 24 hours (Koester and Stooksbury, 1995).  		</p>
<p>Walking away/getting lost is often cited as one of the most troublesome  		behaviors to caregivers, both family and professional. It is also cited as a  		primary reason why families make the decision to move an individual with  		dementia into a long-term care setting (Young, Muir-Nash, &amp; Ninos, 1988).  		</p>
<p>One study suggests that 10% of all claims against health care facilities  		involve resident elopement (Foxwell, 1993-94). Insurance claims data reveals  		that 70% of elopement claims involve a resident death; 80% of elopements  		involve chronic (i.e., known) wanderers; and 45% of elopements occur within the  		first 48 hours after admission (Foxwell, 1993-94). </p>
<p>Technological solutions related to elopement often include some form of  		security system that either alarms and/or secures doors or elevators. Doors and  		elevators in health care facilities are regulated by states through fire codes.  		The codes vary from state to state, but the majority follows either National  		Fire Protection Association (NFPA) or International Fire Code (IFC). However,  		the version each state has adopted and chooses to enforce varies widely. Using  		the NFPA codes as an example, different states follow the 1985, 1991, 1994,  		1997, 2000 and 2003 versions. The latest version of NFPA requires secured doors  		to release within 15 (or in some cases 30) seconds upon application of force  		and there be a visible sign indicating the door can be opened by pushing,  		although this was not included in all of the earlier versions, which are still  		followed by some states. NFPA requires elevators to go to the first floor when  		the fire alarm is sounded (National Fire Protection Association, 2003). In  		order to be consistent with these codes, some of the high-tech wandering  		technologies described below require integration with existing fire alarm,  		security, and/or elevator systems. </p>
<p><b><i>Technologies</i></b>. Both low and high-tech options are available  		to assist with wandering. Low-technology options include visual deterrents that  		are placed on or across doorways and simple battery-operated door alarms that  		monitor a single door. Higher-tech options include complex alarm systems that  		monitor multiple doors and elevators; Infrared and radio frequency based  		elopement management systems that can monitor many doors, elevators, and  		outdoor areas; and tracking systems that enable caregivers and local  		authorities to locate residents who have left the facility. </p>
<p>Other technologies developed for other applications have the potential  		to provide assistance to cope with wandering behaviors as well. For example,  		technologies that utilize global positioning systems (GPS) can notify  		caregivers when a resident has left a predetermined area and help track down  		residents who are lost. These technologies are commonly used for navigation  		purposes and to track down stolen cars. However, some companies are marketing  		this technology to track lost people as well. One company, for example, offers  		a device that enables the wearer to be tracked using GPS technology, digital  		wireless networks, and the Internet. </p>
<h3>C. Urinary Incontinence<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></h3>
<p><b><i>Scope of the issue</i></b>. Incontinence is the second most common  		reason (after dementia) for nursing home admission (McCliment, 2002).  		Currently, 44-65% of nursing home residents are incontinent (Gabrel, 2000;  		Sayhoun, Pratt, Lentzner, Dey, &amp; Robinson, 2001). From 1987 to 1999, the  		prevelance of incontinence among nursing home residents ages 65-74 increased  		from 39-60% among men and from 45-59% among women (Sayhoun et al., 2001). The  		National Nursing Home Survey conducted in 1997 reported that 44% of nursing  		home residents are incontinent (Gabrel, 2000). In 1994, the cost per year of  		each institutionalized person with urinary incontinence was $3,687 compared  		with $552 for a community dwelling person with incontinence (Wilson, Brown,  		Shin, Luc, &amp; Subak, 2001). Wilson and colleagues estimate that in 1994 $5.2  		billion were incurred in nursing homes caring for residents with incontinence  		(Wilson et al., 2001). </p>
<p><b><i>Technologies</i></b>. Products have been developed that prevent  		the leakage of urine; assist with restorative incontinence programs such as  		habit training and bladder retraining; and alert caregivers to an incontinent  		episode. Examples of the first type of products include urethral inserts for  		women that block the flow of urine at the bladder neck and penile clamps for  		men that put pressure on the urethra in order to prevent urine loss. Products  		that assist with restorative training include voiding reminders that encourage  		residents to void in intervals or predetermined times throughout the day;  		biofeedback devices that provide visual and auditory reinforcement while  		performing exercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles; enuresis alarms that  		wake the wearer with a vibrating alert at the first sign of moisture in an  		effort to retrain the bladder; and bladder scanners, which are used to obtain  		precise readings of bladder volume.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> Products that alert caregivers to an  		incontinent episode include enuresis alarms, which can be used to alert  		caregivers at the first sign of moisture with an audible alert or flashing  		light. </p>
<h3>D. Assistance Call<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></h3>
<p><b><i>Scope of the issue</i></b>. Assistance call systems allow  		residents to contact staff from the bed/bedroom, bathrooms, tub rooms and other  		key areas. In the earliest facilities, call systems were not needed because  		residents tended to be in wards. Pre-electric systems tended to involve the  		resident throwing something such as a slipper out the bedroom doors (which is  		why early codes started requiring the nursing station to be able to visually  		see bedroom entrances). Early electric systems presented an audible alert at  		the nursing station, sometimes with a room indicator light above the door, and  		staff members were required to go to the resident's room to investigate the  		need. </p>
<p>Today, assistance call systems are required by almost all states;  		requirements for assisted living facilities vary by state. Most nursing home  		call system regulations are modeled after hospital settings and do not take  		into account the residential aspects of the nursing home. As shown in  		<a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#table1">Table 1</a>, over half of states have call system codes that  		require the system to be at the residents' bedside, be physically activated by  		the resident (most often either through a button or pull cord), ring at the  		nurses' station, and that the signal be visible (most often at the entrance to  		a resident's room, or in the corridor if there are multiple corridors). 48% of  		states have requirements that the system have an audible signal. </p>
<p>Although specific codes vary, many use variations in the language in  		older editions of AIA's Guidelines for construction and equipment of hospital  		and medical facilities. The latest version of these guidelines (2001) states  		(with newer provisions underscored): </p>
<blockquote><p>a nurses calling system shall be provided.Each bed  		  location <i>and/or resident</i> shall be provided with a call  		  device.Calls shall be initiated by a resident activating either a call  		  device attached to a resident's calling station, <i>or a portable device which  		  sends a call signal to the calling station and shall either: activate a visual  		  signal, or activate a pager worn by a staff member, identifying the specific  		  resident and/or room from which the call has been placed</i>.<i>Alternate  		  technologies can be considered for emergency or nurse call systems</i>.  		  (Facility Guidelines Institute, American Institute of Architects, 2001) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our review of call system codes, we found only four states (Kansas,  		New York, South Dakota, Washington) specifically mentioned alternative  		technologies. </p>

</tr></tbody></table><p><b><i>Technologies</i></b>. There are three major categories of  		assistance call systems: wired, wireless, and telephone based. Wired assistance  		call systems rely on wires for communication between the main components of the  		system. However, some wired systems allow for the addition of wireless features  		such as wireless call stations, wireless phones, pagers, and locator systems.  		</p>
<p>Wireless assistance call systems require no wiring for installation. All  		components of the system communicate wirelessly through radio waves. Wireless  		systems provide the flexibility to easily move or add components of the system  		at a later date without rewiring. They can also be installed in older/existing  		buildings, providing a less expensive alternative to rewiring an outdated a  		hard-wired system and offer less disruption to residents during the  		installation process. </p>
<p>Telephone based assistance call systems use telephone lines to alert  		caregivers to a resident need. When a resident is in need of assistance, they  		press a wireless transmitter that they wear (typically a pendant or wristband)  		or a wall mounted transmitter that sends a signal to dialing device. The  		dialing device automatically sends a signal to a central CPU that alerts staff  		to the resident need. </p>
<p>More recent assistance call systems provide two-way voice communications  		allowing staff to determine need before going to the room. Some of these  		systems still go to a central nursing station, while others tie into a cell  		phone/pager carried by each staff. The latest development is passive call  		systems that incorporate strategically placed motion sensors and software with  		individually defined parameters. These passive call systems automatically alert  		caregivers when a resident is engaged in a behavior defined as outside of their  		acceptable range (degree of movement, time spent in a bathroom without exiting,  		etc.). </p>
<p>An example of a more advanced communications technology, not yet used in  		long-term care settings, is wireless LAN communication technology. Responding  		to the challenge of communication among highly mobile medical staff, some  		hospitals have begun to install systems that combine wireless LAN technologies,  		speech recognition software, and locator technology to provide instant,  		hands-free communication among healthcare staff. These systems utilize  		battery-operated wearable badges that connect to a wireless server. The wearer  		presses a button and speaks a command in to the badge. The system uses speech  		recognition technology to identify the individual(s) being contacted and  		connects the call. The system can also be used to locate staff and equipment.  		Although primarily used in hospital settings, this technology appears to have  		great potential to be adapted for use in long-term care settings. It may  		provide efficient communication, not only among caregivers, but also between  		caregivers and residents who are in need of assistance. </p>
<h3>E. Bathing Technologies<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note14">14</a></font></sup></h3>
<p>In recent surveys, bathing has been shown to be one of the most common  		ADL tasks that require assistance of a caregiver in residential care  		facilities. The National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL), in their Assisted  		Living Resident Profile, reports that 72% of residents in assisted living  		facilities require at least some help with bathing tasks, while 30% are  		dependent upon caregivers for bathing (National Center for Assisted Living,  		2001a). In addition, the 1999 National Nursing Homes Survey found that 94% of  		nursing home residents received assistance with bathing tasks (Jones, 2002).  		</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nursing and personal care  		facilities consistently have one of the highest rates of injury and illness  		among industries for nationwide lost workday injury and illness in 2000 (Bureau  		of Labor Statistics, 2003). This high rate of injury was attributed largely to  		three tasks: manual lifting, transferring, and repositioning  		patients/residents--all of which are associated with bathing (although not  		exclusively). In response to this high rate of injury, the Occupational Health  		and Safety Administration (OSHA) issued an ergonomics guideline for the nursing  		home industry (OSHA, 2003).<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Technologies</i></b>. Many products are available to assist both  		the resident and the caregiver with accessing bathing facilities, as well as  		performing the actual task of bathing. Examples of products that enable  		residents to access showers and tubs more independently and safely include  		barrier free showers, bathtub and shower chairs, transfer benches, portable  		in-tub bath lifts, commode/shower chairs, grab bars, and anti-slip matting and  		materials. Barrier free showers offer accessible features such as low threshold  		heights for wheelchair access and easy step-in, increased clearances,  		accessible control locations, grab bars, and folding seats. All of these  		features can make entering and using shower facilities safer and easier for  		residents. Products such as tub chairs and shower benches provide residents  		with a surface to transfer in to the tub as well as a place to sit while  		showering. Portable in-tub bath lifts can be placed into a standard sized tub  		to offer a height adjustable surface for transfers and lowering the resident in  		to the tub. Commode/shower chairs can be pushed into barrier free and roll-in  		showers, providing a means of transporting the resident to the showering area  		(self propelled or pushed by caregiver) and providing seating during showers.  		In addition, anti-slip mats and materials can make the bathing safer by  		providing a slip resistant surface in wet areas. </p>
<p>In addition to products that increase access and safety to bathing  		areas, there are those products that enable residents to perform the actual  		tasks of washing more independently. For example, wash mitts offer a washing  		solution for those with decreased fine motor skills and an inability to handle  		a washcloth. Long handled brushes and sponges enable residents with limited  		reach to wash areas such as their back and feet. In addition, rinse-free  		bathing products enable residents to wash their body and hair without the need  		for water or transferring into a tub or shower. </p>
<p>Other products are geared toward making bathing and shower tasks safer  		and more efficient for caregivers. For example, products that assist caregivers  		with the transfer of residents to showers and tubs include height adjustable  		bathtubs, easy entry bathtubs, showering cabinets, bath lifts, shower trolleys,  		and commode/shower chairs. Shower trolleys and bath lifts can serve the dual  		purpose of transporting the resident to the bathing area and acting as a  		support surface during bathing. Trolleys are used for non-weight bearing  		residents who cannot sit up. They support the whole length of the body while  		the resident is in a lying position during showering. Bath lifts are available  		in both seated and recumbent (reclined) styles and can be used to lower the  		resident into bathtubs that are compatible with the lift. Easy-entry bathtubs  		have sides that open like a door, providing residents with easier entry and  		exit from the tub. Showering cabinets also present a side opening design in  		combination with a sliding seat to assist with transfers in and out of the  		shower. Commode/Shower chairs enable caregivers to roll residents in to showers  		and over toilets, minimizing the amount of transfers required. Lastly, products  		such as shampoo basins, rinse trays, inflatable bathtubs, and rinse free  		bathing products can assist caregivers with the task of washing residents who  		need a large amount of assistance. </p>
<h2><a name="develop" id="develop">IV. TECHNOLOGIES IN DEVELOPMENT: POTENTIAL  		APPLICATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>In an effort to meet the demands of care provision for a growing aging  		population, products are being researched and developed to assist older adults  		with remaining more independent, safer, connected to the rest of the world, and  		cope with a myriad of disabilities. This chapter focuses on several interesting  		areas that have potential for application in residential long-term care  		settings.<sup><font><a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>A. Pervasive and Proactive Computing</h3>
<p>Pervasive and proactive computing refers to equipping a person, multiple  		areas of their environment, and objects in their environment with sensors,  		which are linked to computers that interpret data and offer assistance. The  		goal of these systems, which are generally called SmartHomes, is to create  		intelligent environments that can support the older adult through unobtrusive  		pervasive technologies that remotely monitor health condition and vital signs,  		medications, nutrition, cognitive status and assistance, fall deterrence and  		detection, increase communications with caregivers and health professionals,  		provide home automation capabilities, and detect and respond to emergencies to  		name a few. At a basic level, these systems tend to include motion sensors  		and/or contact switches connected to a computer which track an individual's  		daily movement. More advanced systems may incorporate pressure sensitive pads,  		biosensors and special devices (such as medication dispensers). Typically,  		these signals are sent to a central computer, which reads and interprets the  		data, and may act on it. </p>
<p>There are several levels of responses the system may have. The more  		basic systems collect the data, format it, and send it to a website that a  		caregiver can remotely access to check up on the person. Virtually all systems  		can generate feedback reports, which may be useful to identify a steady decline  		in activity over time, yield early indicators of the onset or progression of a  		disease, and offer health care providers useful information to complement  		routine evaluations. Several systems will "learn" a person's normal routine, so  		that any deviation from normal activity (such as sudden inactivity occurred) is  		detected and automatically generates contact with a caregiver via Internet,  		cell phone, or other communications technology. The most complex systems will  		also provide cognitive assistance or reminders directly to the individual  		through visual or verbal cues. </p>
<p>For the most part, the language used to describe these projects seems to  		indicate that these technologies and systems are being developed with private  		residences in mind. However, they have great potential to be useful in  		long-term care settings as well. In his testimony to the U.S. Senate Special  		Committee on Aging (2004), Mr. Dishman states, </p>
<blockquote><p>"These technologies could also help improve the lives of long term  		  care providers by automating the Minimum Data Set (MDS) that almost every  		  skilled nursing facility must fill out on every resident they care for. Such  		  computer systems could automatically enter the amount of care provided by the  		  staff, thus improving accuracy of their reimbursement records and reducing the  		  stress of the nursing staff that is exhausted by so much data entry and  		  documentation." (Dishman, 2004) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few versions that are being developed specifically for  		shared residential settings. Some are quite similar to the ones described  		above, using primarily motion sensors to detect activities and alert caregivers  		when individuals deviate from their normal routine. Others are more  		comprehensive and use biosensors and other digital technologies, provide  		behavioral cues to match an individual's cognitive abilities, act as an  		assistance call system, provide IR/RF (infra-red/radio frequency) based  		tracking and locating of residents and caregivers, provide home automation  		technologies to open doors and control temperature, offer Internet and email  		access to residents, and provide database reports about resident activity and  		care provision. </p>
<h3>B. Cognitive Orthotics</h3>
<p>Cognitive aids, sometimes a component of the proactive computing systems  		mentioned above, are being developed and researched to assist those with memory  		impairments with a multitude of cognitive tasks. Termed "cognitive orthotics",  		these systems assist with orientation, appointment and medication reminders,  		and provide step-by-step instructions to perform activities of daily life such  		as hand washing and cooking. Cognitive orthotics use artificial intelligence to  		proactively monitor the execution of tasks, problem solve for an individual,  		and offer assistance through cues when necessary. </p>
<p>These systems differ from other simple reminders, such as alarm watches  		and personal digital assistants (PDAs), which offer reminders at specific  		predetermined times. Cognitive orthotics are "intelligent" and are able to  		reason about whether and when to spontaneously offer reminders in an  		unobtrusive manner. The goal of these systems is not to take over thinking for  		the individual, but to only offer assistance when absolutely necessary. Several  		interfaces have been explored for these systems including mobile robotic  		assistants, PDAs, smart mobile phones, television sets, and verbal prompting  		through personal computers. </p>
<h3>C. Mobility Technologies</h3>
<p>Innovative technologies are under development to increase safe mobility  		of older adults, which is an issue both in the community and in long-term care  		settings. These technologies fall into several categories of products. </p>
<p>Navigation systems are being developed for canes, walkers and  		wheelchairs that can assist individuals who have both decreased mobility and  		vision issues. These devices assist the user with avoiding obstacles in their  		path, detecting steps and other drop-offs, and navigating through tight spaces.  		They use different technologies to detect obstacles, including laser scanners,  		infrared (IR) sensors, sonar, vision sensors, and ultrasound technology. The  		technology typically uses these sensors to "read" the environment, the data is  		processed, and information is given back to the user immediately, either in the  		form of voice messages or physical steering assistance. </p>
<p>New wheelchairs have recently come on the market that enable the user to  		easily negotiate architectural barriers and terrain that were difficult or  		impossible before. Some employ gyroscope technology that allows the wheelchair  		to balance itself on two wheels, enabling the user to reach high items and hold  		conversations at eye-level. This technology also allows the wheelchair to  		negotiate curbs and climb stairs. Other products have the look and feel of a  		manual wheelchair, but provide just the right amount of power assisted "boost"  		as the wheelchair is propelled over difficult terrain and inclines. </p>
<p>Finally, manufacturers are also exploring a variety of sensor and shoe  		technologies, which can increase balance and detect changes in gait patterns.  		One such product uses sensor technology to measure an individual's weight,  		gait, stride, and average pace. This technology, meant to complement emergency  		response devices, can notify caregivers when a resident's gait pattern deviates  		from the norm, possibly indicating a change in health status or that a fall has  		occurred. Another is examining the effect of vibrating insoles on balance. The  		theory behind the research is that alternating vibrations provided by  		specialized insoles amplify balance-related signals between the feet and the  		brain that may become dulled with age or illness. By amplifying these signals,  		balance can be increased, thereby reducing the risk of falls. </p>
<h2><a name="barrier" id="barrier">V. BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGY IN RESIDENTIAL  		LONG-TERM CARE</a></h2>
<p>Through our review of the relevant literature and conversations with  		providers, regulators, manufacturers and other experts, the following five  		themes emerged as potential barriers to implementing technologies in long-term  		care settings.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Lack of information about technologies and the residential  			 long-term care market.</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Perceived lack of financial resources to develop and purchase  			 residential long-term care technologies.</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Need for regulations to keep pace with technological  			 advances.</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Industry's lack of standards for technologies central to  			 residential long-term care.</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Providers' lack of knowledge and experience with implementing and  			 managing technological change. </b></p>
</li>
</ul><p>We discuss each of these barriers in more detail below. </p>
<h3>A. Lack of Information about Technologies and the  		Residential Long-Term Care Market</h3>
<p>Each of the key groups--manufacturers, providers, and regulators--spoke  		of gaps in their (or others') information about technologies of use in  		residential long-term care settings. Designers (e.g., architects, builders)  		were also identified as an important group that could benefit from additional  		information on technologies. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Manufacturers' lack of understanding of the residential  		long-term care market. </b></i></p>
<p>Manufacturers indicated a general consensus that there was insufficient  		data about and understanding of the long-term care market. One manufacturer  		noted that there is a lack of information on the size of the market, how much  		they spend on technologies and for what purposes. He went on to suggest that  		technology companies would need the data to demonstrate that there is a large  		market opportunity. </p>
<p>Manufacturers, providers, and other experts also provided opinions  		suggesting that in place of market data were myths, stereotypes, and fears  		about the role of technology in long-term care. One expert observed that  		companies prefer to market to the younger market. A manufacturer suggested that  		technology companies have a bias against working on products related to aging.  		A provider noted misconceptions by his management about direct care workers  		having a fear of technology. He went on to explain that in his experience he  		had found that nursing assistants adapted quickly to new technologies. </p>
<p>Even without data, manufacturers and providers alike characterized the  		residential long-term care market as an unattractive market. One manufacturer  		noted that hospitals have more funding options available while another  		commented that independent living facilities (retirement communities)  		constituted a much larger market than nursing homes and assisted living  		facilities. A provider noted that vendors focus on hospitals because that is  		where the dollars are; another noted that manufacturers do not view the  		long-term care market as profitable because margins are too low. Another  		provider suggested the long-term care is a risky market for manufacturers  		because they need a large market share to survive, and there are too many  		independent facilities to make it financially feasible to get a large enough  		market share. </p>
<p>Very little data on the technological need and spending of this market  		is available. One health care market analysis suggests margins are about 2% for  		for-profit and half a percent for non-profit nursing homes (Centers for  		Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2003) and that the largest nursing homes  		account for only 15% of beds in the industry. However, less is known about  		other aspects of the market, such as continuing care retirement communities and  		assisted living, where margins are likely to be higher because of lower  		reliance on publicly funded programs. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Providers' lack of information about technology products.  		</b></i></p>
<p>Two overarching themes emerged regarding providers' lack of information  		about technology. Many of the people we spoke with noted the lack of accurate  		information about technologies and how they work. A second set of comments  		related to the need for a framework for evaluating the cost-effectiveness or  		return on investment of technology purchases. </p>
<p><b><i>Need for accurate information about technologies</i></b>. Although  		a few manufacturer-provided educational materials exist (for example, ARJO  		Hospital Equipment's <i>Guidebook for Architects and Planners</i>, 1996), there  		seems to be a lack of systematic, readily accessible, and accurate information  		about long-term care technologies. A provider pointed out the difficulty of  		finding out about what products are available; another provider suggested that  		there is a general lack of awareness on what technologies can achieve. A third  		provider expressed frustration with the lack of accurate information. He  		explained that the MDS systems he has purchased for facilities in the past did  		not provide information on what the system was actually supposed to do. One  		manufacturer explained that he had spent much time educating providers about  		his call system and how it worked. </p>
<p>The lack of information was linked to several misconceptions about  		technology. According to one manufacturer, providers and families believe  		technologies will invade residents' privacy, but in practice some systems use  		censors rather than cameras. At the same time, a provider admitted that they  		were not running a wireless system because his company had some security  		concerns about transmitting health information. </p>
<p>Another misconception mentioned several times was the misperception by  		staff that the introduction of technology reduces the human element of  		caregiving. Another provider asserted just the opposite, however. He argued  		that the purpose of technology was to give staff more time with the residents.  		</p>
<p><b><i>Need for framework to assess return on investment</i></b>. There  		is also clearly a desire by providers to have more information on the  		cost-effectiveness of technology so they can better assess the financial risks  		and returns on investment. Several people we spoke with pointed out challenges  		in assessing both the costs and benefits of technology. There were calls for  		more research to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of technologies specific to  		residential care settings. </p>
<p>On the cost side, providers mentioned not only the costs of purchasing  		technology but also the need for information on "hidden" costs associated with  		training, upgrading, initially doubling up systems, motivating staff to change  		their behaviors, and in some cases physical changes to the environment to  		accommodate the technology. </p>
<p>On the benefit side, providers had even less information on how to  		assess the financial and non-financial returns on their investment. For  		example, several providers mentioned that technology does not generate new  		revenues or directly reduce staffing costs. </p>
<p>Liability was mentioned as both a possible cost and a possible benefit.  		One provider noted that risk management is expensive and that technology could  		potentially provide significant mitigations of risk. Another provider noted  		that trying a new piece of technology could result in liability risks. A  		manufacturer suggested that such liability concerns might be holding providers  		back from trying new technologies. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Regulators' lack of information on technologies. </b></i></p>
<p>Several of the people we spoke with provided examples of regulators'  		misunderstanding either technology or the application of regulations pertaining  		to technology in residential care facilities. Although one regulator suggested  		that providers should approach regulators about new technologies to learn where  		they might conflict with codes, others suggested the lack of understanding and  		flexibility by regulators and/or surveyors posed a potential barrier. One  		provider, for example, described a situation in which they were surveyed during  		a transition toward electronic records. The surveyors found it troubling when  		some portion of the records handwritten and the rest computer-generated. </p>
<p>Another example we encountered relates to wireless call system  		technologies. A manufacturer suggested that in some states wireless systems are  		allowed only if the facility also installs a back-up hard-wired system. Yet, in  		our review of state regulations, we found only five states that require call  		systems to be "electronically operated" and only two states that require the  		system to have an emergency backup. In our conversations, we found the  		perception that some regulators have concerns about how wireless systems  		respond when there is a power outage, or if the computer fails, or the  		band-width the system uses potentially interfering with other equipment (e.g.  		pacemakers). </p>
<p><i><b>4. Designers' lack of information on how to implement technologies  		into the design of spaces. </b></i></p>
<p>Several individuals shared the opinion that often spaces in long-term  		care settings are not appropriately sized or laid out to support different  		technologies. Sometimes this is a result of older buildings built before a  		given technology was available (for example, smaller bathing rooms can make it  		difficult to use larger lift chairs and transfer devices). At other times,  		architects who design long-term care facilities appear to have gaps in their  		knowledge base. A manufacturer and regulator shared the view that some  		architects seem to have a lack of knowledge about the environments needed for  		specific types of equipment. Another regulator remarked that there is a lack of  		resources for architects to turn to for assistance. </p>
<h3>B. Perceived Lack of Financial Resources to Develop and  		Purchase Residential Long-Term Care Technologies</h3>
<p>A second major theme related to the perceived lack of financial  		resources to develop useful products, to protect manufacturers from liability,  		and to allow providers (and where applicable, individuals and their families)  		to purchase technologies. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Perceived lack of resources for manufacturers to develop useful  		products. </b></i></p>
<p>One expert we spoke with suggested that there are few opportunities to  		fund evaluations of technologies in these settings. He went on to suggest that  		there needs to be a rethinking of how the technology development efforts are  		funded. This was echoed by a manufacturer. </p>
<p>Part of the challenge, and cost, is creating technologies that meet the  		variations across states in codes and regulations. Another aspect relates to  		the cost of getting approval for a product, either through FDA or an  		independent testing lab such as Underwriters Lab. Several people noted that  		some manufacturers simply did not want to go through that process because of  		the time and effort and costs it involves. As one manufacturer said, referring  		to another company's reluctance to develop a medication management system,  		there is reluctance to get involved in FDA approval by non-healthcare  		companies. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Fear by manufacturers of exposure to liability. </b></i></p>
<p>Several individuals commented that health care in general, and possibly  		long-term care in particular, is a market segment where the perceived risks of  		liability are substantial. This fear of liability on the part of manufacturers  		was noted as a barrier by both manufacturers and regulators alike. </p>
<p>One manufacturer representative commented that he cannot convince his  		upper management to work on technologies for aging services because of  		liability concerns. A regulator agreed that they hear on a regular basis that  		technology companies are particularly fearful of the liabilities associated  		around health-related activities. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Perception of volatility among technology companies.  		</b></i></p>
<p>Opinions were expressed that the technology company market is also  		volatile. One provider explained that there are concerns about spending a large  		amount of money on a system and then having the manufacturer go out of  		business. One expert suggested that the industry may be volatile because it may  		be difficult for manufacturers to obtain a large market share (which keeps  		costs low); this in turn may be linked to the fact that the industry consists  		of a lot of small independent providers. </p>
<p>Nursing home industry data support this view, in that the top ten  		companies accounted for only 15% of beds in 2003, down from 18% a year earlier  		(Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2003). Assisted living data  		suggest the top ten assisted living facilities companies account for less than  		11% of units (Mollica, 2002; Mullen, 2003). Much less information is available  		about other aspects of the residential long-term care market. </p>
<p><i><b>4. Perceived lack of provider resources and high costs of  		purchasing technologies. </b></i></p>
<p>Every one of the providers and most of the manufacturers we spoke with  		perceived that providers lacked resources to purchase new technologies, which  		they described as costly. It is often not just the cost of the technology or  		equipment itself, but the associated costs. One manufacturer suggested it could  		take substantial investment ($35,000-$40,000) for a 100-bed nursing home to  		create a lift-free environment. </p>
<p>There are also the costs associated with finding and decision-making  		around new technology. Other costs mentioned include the costs of training,  		upgrading, and creating and sustaining momentum for change. For some  		technologies, such as wireless nurse call systems, additional costs have come  		from the fact that regulators have required both wired and wireless systems to  		be installed. In sum, as one provider put it you need a "critical mass" of  		resources to implement a new technology. </p>
<p>Notably absent from these discussions were remarks about the potential  		return on investment from technology--either in terms of costs saved by  		facilities or in terms of improvements in quality of care or quality of life of  		residents. </p>
<p><i><b>5. Lack of reimbursement. </b></i></p>
<p>Several providers and one manufacturer mentioned limits on insurance  		reimbursement as a barrier. More than one provider suggested that the  		reimbursement system does not provide incentives to improve quality of care  		through technological innovations. </p>
<p>A manufacturer noted that there were differences in reimbursement for  		community and nursing home-based residents. He explained that there is no  		reimbursement for bathing equipment in either environment and no reimbursement  		for nursing homes for lifts to transfer residents. But there is limited  		Medicaid reimbursement (a capped rental rate) for lifts for patients residing  		in the community. There are also some states (Michigan, Oklahoma, Florida) that  		have Medicaid waivers where they will pay for lifts if they are deemed  		medically necessary. </p>
<h3>C. Failure of Regulatory Process to Keep Pace with  		Technological Advances</h3>
<p>Opinions about the role of regulations in developing and introducing new  		technologies into long term care were quite mixed. Some provided examples of  		how regulations clearly lagged behind technologies; in other cases the  		regulations were not outdated but regulators and surveyors did not appear to  		have an adequate understanding of how the existing regulations apply to new  		technologies. Other expressed opinions that the regulatory environment in  		residential long-term care was itself a barrier to innovation. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Regulations lagging behind the technology. </b></i></p>
<p>There were a number of comments about regulations not keeping up with  		technology. Two regulators we spoke with suggested that technology changes too  		quickly for the codes to keep pace. Several examples follow:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>Nurse call systems</i></b>. Regulations with respect to nurse  			 call systems lag behind the technology in two respects: requirement of visual  			 signals and calls and of physical activation by residents. </p>
<ul><li><b><i>Requirement of visual signals and calls to nurses'  				stations</i></b>. Thirty-one states have explicit requirements that nurse call  				systems provide a visual signal, typically outside the bedroom of a resident  				and, less often, at corridor intersections. The intent of the visual signal  				requirement outside the bedroom entrance is to alert caregivers in the  				immediate vicinity of the desire for assistance. Twenty-seven states require  				the call system to call a nurses' station. These types of requirements are  				compatible with a medical model of care, but are less conducive to creating a  				more residential-style care setting, for several reasons. First, the call  				system to a nursing station assumes there is a staff person sitting at the  				station, which is not the way many long-term care settings currently operate.  				If there is not a person there, staff may have to travel back to the nursing  				station in order to determine who has requested assistance, then go to that  				person. While the visible signal at the door is designed to overcome this  				inefficiency, having alert call light outside every bedroom entrance does not  				reflect a residential style of architecture (it looks like a hospital), and the  				audible alarm signal contributes auditory stimulation, which can be disturbing  				to people with dementia. There are alternative systems that avoid these  				negative features. Some assistance call systems can be set up to send calls on  				a cell phone or pager to a single nursing assistant, to multiple nursing  				assistants and/or to the nurse simultaneously or as roll-overs if the call is  				not responded to in a timely manner. These newer systems are designed to reduce  				negative auditory stimulation, enhance the residential appearance of the  				setting by minimizing visible hospital-style equipment (signal lights at  				bedroom entrance) and enhance staff accountability in responding to calls.</li>
<li><b><i>Physical activation by residents</i></b>. In 28 states  				codes are written in such a way that calls must be physically activated by  				residents (typically either through a call button or pull cord). The  				traditional call system, found in hospitals, requires the person to know and be  				able to push the button to call for assistance. Systems have been developed  				that use sensors to automatically detect motion and movement, incontinence, and  				even falls, and which can be programmed to send an alert to staff without  				physical action by residents. We found only three states that made mention of  				wireless technology (Kansas, South Dakota, and Washington). In addition, New  				York considers such systems on a case-by-case basis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Egress systems</i></b>. The <i>National Fire Protection  			 Association's Life Safety Code Handbook</i> and the International Fire Code  			 both call for egress systems with a delayed release system. That is, under  			 normal circumstances (not emergency situations when the doors must release), if  			 someone approaches a secured door and presses on the door opening/release  			 device (also called a panic bar), the door sounds an alarm and will  			 automatically unlock after 15 seconds (sometimes up to 30 seconds is allowed).  			 Facilities are also required to put signage adjacent to the door that states  			 that the door will unlock in 15 seconds after pressing the opening/release  			 device. Providers expressed concerns over this system because it allows  			 residents with Alzheimer's disease to leave a facility if they push on the door  			 continuously for 15 or 30 seconds. Several providers suggested that such a  			 regulation made the implementation of alternative egress control technologies  			 far more challenging. There are a number of alternative systems. Some use  			 transponder tags that the resident wears, which sends a signal to lock the door  			 as the person approaches or sends an audible alarm (at the door, to a remote  			 site such as a nurses station, or to pagers/cell phones carried by the staff).  			 Simpler systems secure the doors with electromagnetic locks, usually with a  			 coded keypad to allow staff and visitor passage. In this case, the door is  			 always locked for the residents (again, except in an emergency), unless they go  			 through with a staff or family member. Without the 30 second delay and required  			 signage, residents generally do not spend as much time at the doors trying to  			 get out. The regulatory issue is whether this type of system creates a "locked"  			 unit, which in some states requires the individuals to be deemed incompetent  			 and committed by family or the courts to that unit. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>2. Regulations that appear to be misunderstood. </b></i></p>
<p>Two examples of regulations that appear to be misunderstood were  		mentioned in our conversations, one related to the Americans with Disabilities  		Act (ADA) and the other to regulations around electronic signatures.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>Transfer technologies and the ADA</i></b>. The ADAAG  			 (Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines) specifies that  			 toilets be 18 inches from the wall and that grab-bars be placed on the wall  			 adjacent to and behind the toilet. This is based on the assumption of a  			 side-to-side transfer, which is how individuals who are paraplegic transfer  			 onto a toilet. But research consistently suggests that grab bar and toilet  			 locations that comply with ADAAG specifications are among the most difficult  			 for older adults who use a wheelchair to use (Sanford 2001). These individuals  			 typically use a stand-and-pivot transfer technique (i.e., they bring their  			 chair to the front of the toilet, stand, turn, disrobe and sit). Often,  			 independent transfer is not possible, and one or two staff are needed to  			 provide assistance standing, turning, disrobing, and sitting. Bathrooms that  			 follow the ADAAG, placing the toilet 18 inches from the wall make it difficult  			 for staff to position themselves between the toilet and the well, increasing  			 the risk for injury. The problem is compounded when facilities are trying to  			 use transfer equipment. In this case the code is not "outdated". Rather, the  			 code does not take into account how older people typically transfer to the  			 toilet, and the space needs for caregivers and equipment that might be needed  			 to assist this process. New products, such as fold-down or swing away grab  			 bars, allow toilets to be placed in different locations/positions and  			 accommodate transfers in which people stand and turn, but still have an  			 appropriate distance to the grab bar (optimally mounted at 14-16 inches from  			 both sides of the toilet). These products are also helpful for people who  			 prefer a side-to-side transfer. While there is an equivalency clause in ADAAG,  			 it is often hard to get alternative designs approved. As one manufacturer said:  			 "I think there are still a lot of places where the code officials believe that  			 for rooms to meet ADA requirements, you have to keep the toilet 18 inches from  			 the wall and there are others whounderstand that a toilet that's further  			 away from the wallmeets that equivalency standard. But the challenge is  			 getting to those regulators who don't yet understand that." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Electronic signatures</i></b>. One regulator noted what she  			 perceived as a troubling conflict between state and federal regulations. She  			 explained that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not allow for  			 electronic signatures in nursing facilities, but her state did. A provider we  			 spoke with was under the impression that his state was slowly moving toward  			 fewer paper requirements but that medications still required a written and  			 signed order. It is unclear whether these are true barriers, or a  			 misunderstanding on the part of regulators and/or providers. Since the time  			 when these interviews were conducted, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  			 Services has issued a Notice of Clarification on Electronic Signature Guidance.  			 This Guidance Statement notes the existence of conflicting language related to  			 electronic signatures within the State Operations Manual (as the regulator we  			 spoke with mentioned). However, the decision put forth by this memo is that,  			 effective October 15, 2004 "nursing homes may use electronic signatures in a  			 clinical record, including the MDS when permitted to do so by state and local  			 law and when this is authorized by the long-term care facility's policy  			 (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2004b). The language in this  			 Guidance Statement does not specifically refer to electronic signatures related  			 to medication orders. The only remaining barrier relates to state regulations  			 that might prohibit the use of electronic signatures, which would supersede the  			 federal standard. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>3. The influence of the regulatory environment. </b></i></p>
<p>Several people also expressed the opinion that it is not the regulations  		per se but the regulatory environment that is problematic. They noted that the  		current regulatory climate introduces incentives that do not promote  		development or adoption of new technologies. One provider expressed the opinion  		that the technology industry was largely designing products to respond to  		regulatory changes, rather than undertaking strategic efforts to design  		beneficial products. </p>
<p>A similar theme appears in the gerontology literature. Schnelle and  		colleagues (Schnelle, Ouslander, &amp; Cruise, 1997) argue that the regulatory  		environment is a barrier to implementation technologies--those that provide  		information about the process of improving the quality of care. The authors  		argue that providers react to the regulatory environment, which emphasizes  		paper compliance, by emphasizing documentation rather than changes in the  		provision of care. In two case studies of information technology  		implementation--one relating to incontinence program implementation and the  		other to restraint reduction--they found effective protocols were not sustained  		once research teams ceased their involvement. The authors concluded in both  		instances that the regulatory emphasis on documentation created a barrier to  		technologies that provide information to improve the process of providing care.  		The accurate data provided by the technology suggested additional care needed  		to be provided which conflicted with the (perfectly charted but inaccurate)  		documentation. </p>
<h3>D. Industry's Lack of Standards for Technologies Central  		to Residential Long-Term Care</h3>
<p>A lack of standards to facilitate the compatibility and integration of  		technology was cited as a barrier by providers, manufacturers, and regulators  		alike. Providers expressed frustration about the inefficiencies of having  		separate systems that could not talk to each other. From the manufacturer's  		perspective, a lack of standards adds to their manufacturing expenses. One  		manufacturer explained that it is expensive to write a new standard and have it  		tested. Another commented that there is no uniform plumbing code across states,  		which makes it difficult to build and adapt products that will meet needs  		across the country. A lack of standards is also time-consuming for regulators.  		</p>
<p>Regulators contacted for this report indicated there was a general lack  		of standards for evaluating new technologies. Sometimes regulators will require  		a new product to undergo and be certified by Underwriters Laboratories or a  		similar, third party testing organization. One of the three regulators we spoke  		with explained that they had conducted evaluations of wireless technologies  		themselves. They described a process in which they allowed several facilities  		to install the technology, then they evaluated the technology and amended the  		regulations to allow for it. The process, called "substantial compliance,"  		allows the provider or builder to explain how the technology meets the intent  		of the regulation. It is unclear how many states have the resources to use the  		substantial compliance process to make regulations more compatible with new  		technologies. </p>
<p>In our review of the literature and in the course of our conversations  		we learned of several efforts underway to promote standards for technologies  		that are in use in residential long-term care settings. For example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The Center for Aging Services Technology (CAST), a program of the  			 American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging that focuses on the  			 application of technology and the policy issues that impact how technology will  			 be used successfully and priced effectively to provide aging services, has  			 created an Electronic Health and Wellness task group that participates in  			 national data standards activities such as Health Level 7 (HL-7). CAST is also  			 in the process of creating other work groups devoted to the development and  			 promotion of standards to integrate aging service technologies such as data,  			 communication, and hardware systems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials  			 (IAPMO), the organization that maintains the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) and  			 Uniform Mechanical Code (UMC), develops standards for plumbing and mechanical  			 heating and cooling systems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The American Institute of Architects publishes hospital and health  			 care facility design guidelines. The latest edition (2001) includes a chapter  			 on nursing facilities that provides guidelines for the number, placement, and  			 type of call devices, as well the methods in which caregivers should be  			 contacted. Within these guidelines are specific mention of wireless radio  			 frequency call systems and issues of electromagnetic compatibility of internal  			 and external sources. (Facility Guidelines Institute, American Institute of  			 Architects, 2001) </p>
</li>
</ul><p>A particularly illustrative example of a committee working on standards  		for assistance call systems in nursing home settings is The Healthcare  		Communications and Emergency Call Systems Group of the National Electrical  		Manufacturers Association (NEMA). This group is currently working with  		Underwriters Laboratories to modify UL1069 to include wireless functions.  		UL1069 provides safety requirements that cover the individual units employed to  		form a nurse call system intended to provide audible and visual communication  		between patients and care personnel as well as other signaling equipment  		employed in hospitals and care facilities. NEMA's work in this area includes  		defining the scope of the various types of wireless signaling that would be  		covered under UL1069 including call in signaling (Emergency or Normal call, bed  		exit call, monitor alarms, etc.) and wireless two way communication (voice and  		display). Also under consideration are more ancillary applications for  		hospitals, like television audio to bedside, as well as wireless personnel and  		asset tracking systems. The goal of this effort is to match up potential  		requirements within the scope of the current UL1069--that is, how wireless  		systems would be evaluated as elements of a nurse call system. </p>
<p>This NEMA group is also working on a project to define and create UL  		standards for emergency call (wired or wireless) systems used in less monitored  		environments, such as assisted living. This project has grown out of a concern  		that no assistance call standards exist specifically for assisted living  		environments, which may have different emergency call applications than nursing  		homes. The goals here are to identify how the applications differ and develop  		standards that suit systems for these less monitored environments. </p>
<p>Note that the lack of standards per se does not prevent systems from  		being tested by Underwriter's Lab (UL). UL can use existing standards from  		other related products to evaluate new technologies. One person we spoke with  		pointed out that to evaluate a wireless system, UL could use a system with much  		higher criteria, such as a wireless fire alarm system. But he also shared that  		in his experience, manufacturers sometimes did not want their products to be  		tested, in part because of the cost. </p>
<h3>E. Providers' Lack of Knowledge and Experience with  		Implementing and Managing Technological Change</h3>
<p>Although not specified a priori as a theme of interest, a notable number  		of comments were made by providers, manufacturers, and other experts about the  		challenges associated with the process of implementing technologies in  		long-term care settings. This theme consisted of two main areas of discussion:  		(1) issues around staffing, with respect to skill level, training, time  		resources, and turnover; and (2) issues around the process of change involving  		technology. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Staffing issues and logistics. </b></i></p>
<p>Providers and manufacturers alike cited a number of related issues  		regarding skill level of nursing staff, the challenges of training, the limited  		amount of time available, and the difficulties associated with turnover. </p>
<p>One provider explained that staff members need to be convinced to use  		the technology. He also described a situation where staff perceived that they  		did not have time to use the technology. </p>
<p>A manufacturer described a related challenge: high staff turnover in  		facilities. He explained that local "champions" have to continually train new  		staff to use the technology. </p>
<p>Other providers expressed the notion that staff seemed to resent  		technologies in which they felt monitored or which were intended to supervise  		their work. In contrast, tools to help them accomplish their tasks appeared to  		be welcomed by management and direct care workers alike. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Managing the process of change. </b></i></p>
<p>Nine of the 16 people we spoke with mentioned the challenges of  		introducing change into a long-term care setting. Opinions related to the  		importance leadership and the difficulty overcoming resistance to change by  		staff. Providers and manufacturers alike expressed the opinion that leadership  		was critical in bringing about a technological change in a residential care  		setting. Words used to describe the kind of leaders needed included "dedicated"  		and "champion." </p>
<p>Our conversations highlighted a few examples where technologies that  		were introduced externally--by top level management, as part of strategic  		plans, or by researchers--faced significant challenges during the  		implementation process and were difficult to sustain. For example, we learned  		it took approximately 2 years for staff to be compliant with a new call system  		introduced by top-level management. Another provider remarked that he had spent  		1½ years in 'pilot' mode with a palm-held system. One provider, whose  		company's strategic plan involved implementation of technology, reported that  		he found technology universally difficult to implement. Similarly, Schnelle and  		colleagues' (Schnelle et al., 1997) report two case studies of information  		technologies designed to improve the quality of care delivered in nursing  		homes. In both cases, the researchers developed and validated the technology,  		created an assessment procedure, and implemented the program in several nursing  		homes. Once the researchers left, however, the interventions ceased in nearly  		all the facilities, despite their demonstrated value. </p>
<p>In other cases, particularly those in which technologies were offered to  		direct care staff in response to a request from those staff, appeared to be  		much more easily integrated. One example illustrates a relatively smooth  		implementation of a palm device for direct care workers. The provider explained  		that they first queried a few locations about their information needs and then  		they developed an application on the palm. Their goal for the pilot was to get  		some feedback in a few locations, redesign the technology, and then roll it out  		on a more widespread basis. When they came to the end of the pilot test, the  		pilot sites had come to rely on the technology and were unwilling to give up  		the application, even in its preliminary state. A second example involved  		implementation of an elopement management system. The provider described a  		situation in which health care staff from an Alzheimers' unit approached him  		with concerns about elopement. The company responded by putting out an request  		for proposal, and then identifying and installing a system. In a follow-up  		conversation after installing the system, the provider confirmed that the staff  		was very appreciative of it and the main implementation challenges related to  		coordination with the fire alarm and elevator systems. </p>
<p>These limited conversations suggest that there may be a relationship  		between the way in which a technology is introduced and the success of the  		implementation. Investigation of this relationship warrants attention in future  		studies. </p>
<h2><a name="next" id="next">VI. NEXT STEPS</a></h2>
<p>To the extent that technological solutions can improve quality of care,  		quality of life of residents, and potentially enhance efficiencies in  		residential long-term care settings, it is of interest to undertake steps to  		remove barriers to their implementation in this setting. To that end, we have  		in this report tried to identify barriers that exist to incorporating  		technology into residential long-term care settings. </p>
<p>Our review of the literature and conversations with a relatively small  		number of providers, manufacturers, regulators, and other experts revealed a  		complex set of circumstances contributing to the current situation. The  		methodology we employed uncovered five general themes, but in many cases  		further research will be needed to confirm the relative importance of each of  		these themes to the overall challenge. </p>
<p>In light of these findings, our recommendations for next steps involve a  		series of educational and exploratory strategies around five areas designed  		to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Remedy existing gaps in knowledge about technologies in residential  			 long-term care settings. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore ways to encourage development and implementation of  			 cost-effective technological innovations in residential long-term care  			 settings. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore how best to provide guidance to regulatory agencies.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage development of industry standards for residential care  			 technologies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate providers about implementing and managing technological  			 change. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each of these areas of recommendation is discussed in more detail below.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Recommendation 1: Remedy existing gaps in knowledge about  		technologies in residential long-term care settings. </b></i></p>
<p>A pervasive theme was the lack of knowledge by key  		groups--manufacturers, providers, and regulators alike--about the application  		of technologies in the residential care sector.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Providers we spoke with suggested that lack of information about  			 where to find technologies, how to evaluate their applicability to their  			 setting, how to evaluate the stability of the technology manufacturer, and the  			 lack of a framework for assessing cost effectiveness of technology were all  			 significant barriers to decision making about purchasing and implementing a  			 technology. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manufacturers we spoke with expressed a lack of knowledge about how  			 the long-term care market views the importance of technology. How much money  			 are long-term care providers and residents (and their families) who live in  			 these settings actually spending on new technologies? What types of  			 technologies are being integrated? What technologies do facilities wish were in  			 existence, but do not yet exist? Providers suggested that manufacturers did not  			 fully understand the market. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulators we spoke with expressed a lack of information about the  			 benefits of technology and the process by which to evaluate them. Others  			 expressed a concern about misunderstanding by regulators of codes related to  			 technologies or benefits of technologies. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In light of these gaps in basic knowledge, we recommend the following  		steps be considered:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Conduct a study describing the residential long-term care market,  			 with an aim toward describing the current and future technology needs and  			 expenditures across the entire residential long-term care continuum. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and test a framework for assessing the costs and benefits of  			 different types of technology in residential long-term care settings. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage further development of easily accessible resources  			 designed to provide information to providers and other key groups about  			 available technologies. In this regard, ASPE has already provided initial  			 funding for <a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a>,  			 a web site created by Polisher Research Institute and IDEAS describing products  			 available for residential long-term care settings and key issues to consider.  			 The site could be expanded to include additional care issues as well as  			 technologies relevant to recruiting, retaining and training the long-term care  			 workforce. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage development of educational resources specifically designed  			 to address technology/design interface issues in residential long-term care  			 settings. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide surveyors and other regulators with a forum to receive  			 regular training on new technologies for residential care settings. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Recommendation 2. Explore ways to encourage development and  		implementation of cost-effective technological innovations in residential  		long-term care settings. </b></i></p>
<p>A second major theme related to the lack of financial resources to  		develop useful products, to protect manufacturers from liability, and to allow  		providers to purchase technologies. Providers, manufacturers, and regulators  		raised the following issues:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Manufacturers suggested there was a lack of resources for them to  			 develop products for the residential long-term care industry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost all of the people we spoke with identified costs of the  			 technologies and limited resources of providers as barriers. Large initial  			 investments for some technologies were viewed as a substantial challenge. Yet  			 providers and insurers have very little information about the  			 "cost-effectiveness" of technologies. Hence, the potential cost-savings and  			 improvements in terms of quality of care and quality of life often remain  			 unknown. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manufacturers expressed concerns about liability in both the health  			 care and the long-term care industry. Providers to a lesser extent raised  			 issues around liability associated with new technologies. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>We therefore recommend as next steps:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Undertake efforts to educate large and small companies and the  			 research community about existing mechanisms to support the development of  			 residential long-term care technologies. Include education around private  			 sources (e.g., how to raise venture capital) as well as federal mechanisms  			 (e.g., SBIRs, Center grants, and traditional R01 and P01 mechanisms). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and test a framework to assess the costs and benefits of  			 technologies in residential long-term care settings. Such analyses would help  			 providers make informed decisions about investments and may also provide  			 guidance to private and public insurers interested in covering such  			 technologies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore how existing programs can be used to encourage  			 implementation of cost-effective technologies in residential long-term care  			 settings. For example, the Alternative Financing Program (AFP), funded under  			 Title III of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, makes assistive technology  			 available to persons with disabilities through low-cost financing, when they  			 might not be eligible otherwise for conventional financing opportunities. This  			 program might serve as a useful vehicle for low cost loans for residential care  			 facilities to purchase technologies that would benefit multiple low-income  			 residents. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a better understanding of nursing home and health care  			 liability issues, including the issue of liability for companies creating new  			 technologies in this setting. The aim here would be to first determine whether  			 this is a fear or a real barrier for manufacturers and providers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Recommendation 3: Provide guidance to regulatory agencies.  		</b></i></p>
<p>Third, we found regulations can hamper the implementation of new  		technologies, and limit manufacturers' creativity in conceptualizing new  		products.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Although newer standards and codes may be more inclusive of the  			 latest technologies, many states do not update their regulations, and thus are  			 enforcing codes that do not account for, and thus do not allow, the latest  			 technologies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current regulatory environment places great emphasis on existing  			 documentation requirements as the primary means of assessing compliance with  			 codes, as opposed to considering how technology-generated information  			 (particularly automated versions) could replace existing systems. This limits  			 what providers are willing to consider (for fear of bad surveys), and thus what  			 manufacturers perceive as being desired by the marketplace. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Based on these findings we recommend.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Encourage states to consider adopting updated codes on a regular  			 basis (e.g., no more than 2 years after they are adopted by the relevant  			 national or international body). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage the appropriate national agencies, such as the American  			 Institute of Architects and the International Code Council, to provide for  			 interim interpretations of their codes that specifically respond to new and  			 emerging technologies. This might include a national conference between  			 regulators, providers, designers and manufacturers to proactively identify the  			 areas of most critical need for new technologies, and how regulations might  			 need to be modified to allow for their incorporation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a process or committee that can help provide guidance, in a  			 timely manner, whether new technologies meet the intent (not just the specific  			 language) of the relevant code. This could include an on-going funding stream  			 for research related to determining whether new technologies are supportive of  			 resident-centered care principles, which are embodied in OBRA '87 and the  			 Nursing Home Reform Act. To the extent that all states choose to follow the  			 same codes/guidelines, the results of these tests could be applied nationally.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Recommendation 4: Encourage development of industry standards for  		technology. </b></i></p>
<p>We found a pervasive frustration by providers, manufacturers, and  		regulators alike about the lack of standards to facilitate the integration of  		new technologies into residential care settings.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Several providers indicated that the technologies would be far more  			 effective if they were integrated with one another and that standards may  			 facilitate this integration. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several manufacturers explained that standards would help in their  			 development of new products, which often face different codes from state to  			 state. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulators expressed the desire for standards to help facilitate  			 their evaluation of new technologies and whether they meet the intent of codes.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several efforts to develop standards are underway that could have  			 implications for residential care technologies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We recommend that the government explore the best way to encourage  			 and support these voluntary standard development efforts by industry. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Recommendation 5: Educate providers about implementation and  		change management issues as they related to technology. </b></i></p>
<p>In talking with informants we observed that there is a lack of clarity  		about the most effective way to go about the process of incorporating  		technologies into residential care facilities. Several themes emerged:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Providers cited "motivational" problems ranging from a lack of time,  			 to a lack of a local champion, to simply stopping the use of the technology  			 after external supports are removed. These "motivational issues" clearly have  			 cost implications for the organization as well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pattern of responses suggested that these providers were more  			 likely to have introduced the technology from the top-down, whereas providers  			 who utilized a more bottom-up approach were more likely to describe their  			 technology implementation experience as successful. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several informants hint that some of the "motivational" issues might  			 be related to the perceived purpose of the technology (e.g., to replace or  			 reduce staff numbers, to decrease the "human touch", or to monitor the behavior  			 of the staff in general). Providers with more successful experiences tended to  			 view the purpose of the technology to fulfill an expressed need of the staff  			 care providers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Clearly, there is a need to better understand what methods of technology  		implementation produce desirable and sustainable outcomes for residents, staff  		and the organization. We therefore recommend:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Additional study of the relationship between the origin of the  			 introduction of the technology and the successful adoption and sustainability  			 of the technology over time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmenting the training (initial coursework or continuing education)  			 of persons in key leadership roles within residential care, typically the  			 nursing home administrator and/or director of nursing. These individuals may  			 benefit from curriculum topics such as what technologies are available or being  			 developed and change-management techniques. </p>

<h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A: TALKING POINTS USED TO SOLICIT INPUT  		ABOUT BARRIERS</a></h2>
<p>As detailed in <a href="barriers-implementing-technology-residential-long-term-care-settings.html#define">Chapter 2</a>, we conducted  		conversations with 16 experts representing a variety of viewpoints. Here we  		provide a sample of talking points we drew upon to guide our conversations with  		technology manufacturers, long-term care providers, and regulators. These  		examples are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive: </p>
<p><i><b>Technology manufacturers:</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Tell us a little about the market your company sells to. What  		  proportion is long-term care or a broader market? Is the broader market similar  		  to long-term care in any way? </li>
<li>Tell me about the process you went through in developing and  		  marketing [this product]? </li>
<li>How was the idea for the product generated? </li>
<li>How easy was it to gain support in your company? </li>
<li>Did you face any regulatory hurdles to bringing your product to  		  market? Did the product require FDA or similar approval, and what was this  		  process like? </li>
<li>Does this product generate a profit? </li>
<li>How many years did it take for the product to turn a profit? </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Long-term care providers:</b></i></p>
<ul><li>What is most difficult, for you and for others, about bringing in or  		  incorporating new technology in long-term care? What is easy? </li>
<li>If the facility is using a specific technology identified for  		  inclusion in the lexicon: What was the most difficult part about making the  		  decision to incorporate this technology? What was the easiest part? </li>
<li>What new technology would you like to see that would make your life  		  easier or make life better for the residents? </li>
<li>When a new technology is introduced at your facility, tell me how it  		  usually gets introduced, and then how you think it <i>should</i> get  		  introduced. This can include making the decision about getting it and about  		  getting people to use it. </li>
<li>Are companies marketing to you? </li>
<li>Are there new technologies that you are not accepting? That you would  		  like to integrate but cannot? What are the challenges? </li>
<li>Are there strategies that would make new technology easier or more  		  acceptable to people-strategies that aren't being used now? </li>
<li>Is there a technology you're using that you don't like--that you'd  		  like to get rid of and go back to the old way of doing something? Describe the  		  technology and why the old way is better. </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Regulators:</b></i></p>
<ul><li>When a long-term care project wants to incorporate a new technology,  		  what process do you use to determine whether it's both appropriate and  		  allowable? </li>
<li>Are there certain criteria you use in evaluating it? What are these  		  criteria? </li>
<li>Are there times when you think a technology should be allowed but the  		  codes, as written or interpreted, won't allow it? Can you give some examples?  		  </li>
<li>Is/are there a technology(ies) people have desired to include in a  		  project that you couldn't or wouldn't approve? What was it (were they) and why  		  wasn't it approved? </li>
<li>If regulations restrict you from approving certain technologies, are  		  there ways the codes or code review process could be altered to make it easier  		  to allow new technologies in long-term care projects? </li>

</ul><h2><a name="notes" id="notes">NOTES</a></h2>
<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">In</a> this report, we define residential long-term  			 care settings as a continuum of care that includes nursing homes, assisted  			 living facilities, board and care facilities, continuing care retirement  			 communities, and adult day care facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Detailed</a> product information for these five  			 areas is currently available on <a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a>, Two additional  			 product areas, medication management and transferring, will be added by  			 September 2005. The web site was initially funded by the Office of the  			 Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) for the purposes of  			 educating professionals about technologies available in long-term care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">Section</a> 4432(a) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA)  			 of 1997 modified how payment is made for Medicare skilled nursing facility  			 (SNF) services. Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after  			 July 1, 1998, SNFs are no longer paid on a reasonable cost basis or through low  			 volume prospectively determined rates, but rather on the basis of a prospective  			 payment system (PPS). The PPS payment rates is adjusted for case mix and  			 geographic variation in wages and covers all costs of furnishing covered SNF  			 services (routine, ancillary, and capital-related costs). See  			 <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/providers/snfpps">http://www.cms.hhs.gov/providers/snfpps</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">For</a> example, beginning in 1994 services under  			 the Home and Community-Based Waiver services expanded steadily with the easing  			 of state documentation requirements. In 2001, HHS announced the Real Choice  			 Systems Change grant program to facilitate state compliance with the Supreme  			 Court's1999 Olmstead decision. According to the Senate Special Committee on  			 Aging (Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, 2002), states have responded by  			 creating new coalitions of aging and disability advocates and by shifting  			 resources to expand the array of community-based long-term care services  			 available. More recently, the President's 2004 budget included a program to  			 encourage states to transition individuals from nursing home and other  			 long-term care institutions to the community. The "Money Follows the Person  			 Rebalancing Initiative" provides incentives for states to design and implement  			 strategies to re-balance their long-term care systems so that they no longer  			 disproportionately allot Medicaid long-term care resources to institutional  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Other</a> issues that are under consideration to be  			 added include mobility, transferring, medication management, and information  			 systems. These issues are beyond the initial scope of  			 <a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a> and are  			 therefore not included in this report except where mentioned during our  			 conversations with experts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">The</a> interview process did not suggest that we  			 left out any critical groups. However, direct care worker views on barriers  			 will be important to obtain (Bower et al., 2003) as are opinions of families  			 and third party payers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">The</a> experts we selected also had experience with  			 other broader classes of technology found in nursing homes and assisted living  			 facilities; for example in the course of our conversations we learned about  			 issues related to computing and internet access for residents; automated  			 medical records; and pervasive computing. Examples related to these kinds of  			 technologies are also included where relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">The</a> first four care issues are available on  			 <a href="http://www.TechforLTC.org">http://www.TechforLTC.org</a>. Bathing is  			 scheduled to be added to the site in September 2004.</p>
