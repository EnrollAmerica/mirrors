<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>More than 300 practitioners, regulators, payers, and other interested  		parties attended the National Conference on Home Care Quality: Issues and  		Accountability, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,  		on June 1 and 2, 1988, at the Madison Hotel in Washington, D.C. Volume I of the  		conference report presents the keynote address by Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of  		the Department of Health and Human Services, summaries of the opening and  		closing general sessions, and summaries of the breakout sessions. The  		conference agenda and participant list are included as appendices. Volume II  		presents a research agenda for home care quality. Prepared by Pamela Doty,  		Ph.D., Senior Analyst in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evauation, the research agenda highlights issues and themes raised by  		conference attendees as well as speakers and includes feedback received from  		participants following the conference. Volume II also cites recently published  		and ongoing projects related to the issues discussed at the conference.</p>
<p>Robert B. Helms, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, called  		on conference participants to help set the Federal government's home care  		quality research agenda for the next few years. New initiatives in home care  		fielded by Federal and State governments have led to growth in formal home care  		services.</p>
<p>Several other factors are also fueling the expansion of home care.  		Earlier hospital discharges under Medicare's Prospective Payment System have  		had a significant impact on the demand for post-hospital home health care. An  		increase in the number of the elderly, especially those "oldest old" whose long  		term care needs are greatest, and a desire by the public to find alternatives  		to institutional care have increased demand for less medically oriented types  		of home care as well.</p>
<p>Between 1966 and 1987, home health agencies certified by Medicare  		increased by almost 400 percent--from 1,275 to 5,794. The number of proprietary  		or for-profit agencies has increased the most, largely in response to the 1980  		Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that removed the ban on Medicare  		certification of for-profit agencies in those States without licensing laws.  		Previously, State licensure, and often certificate-of-need approval, had been  		required of for-profit agencies. Although accreditation programs exist for  		homemaker chore services, Medicare/Medicaid certification is limited to  		agencies offering nursing and other health-related services. Moreover,  		registries of independent providers are not eligible for certification or  		accreditation. It is estimated, therefore, that only half of the approximately  		12,000 organizations delivering home care are certified or accredited.</p>
<p>Conference sessions dealt with many of the major issues of the  		burgeoning home care industry. The opening session presentations set the tone  		dealing with such issues as the definition of "quality" in home care,  		difficulties in measuring quality, adequacy of the home care work force, and  		the appropriate regulatory roles of the Federal and State governments.</p>
<p>The need for more effective quality assurance mechanisms was a theme  		throughout the conference. The strengths and weaknesses of quality assurance  		efforts through government regulation and voluntary self-policing of the  		industry were debated vigorously. The strong influence of the Medicare  		certification process in setting standards was stressed. State and local  		government representatives discussed how they go about assuring the quality of  		social services funded via Title XX, the Older Americans Act, or State  		programs.</p>
<p>Private standard-setting bodies, such as the Joint Commission on  		Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the National League for Nursing, and  		the National Home Caring Council, emphasized their commitment to maintaining  		high quality accreditation programs. They also stressed the advantages of  		voluntary accreditation.</p>
<p>The recent role of Congress in mandating more stringent Federal  		regulations in response to quality concerns was outlined. The effectiveness of  		State regulatory requirements was examined as well. Strategies were also  		proposed to empower consumers of publicly funded home care services.</p>
<p>The role of research in identifying measurable quality assurance  		findings was a central conference topic. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,  		the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology  		Assessment, and the Health Care Financing Administration pledged their support  		for more and better research. Methods of developing reliable information by  		focusing on outcomes were detailed. Methods were also delineated that take into  		account the distinctive nature of home care in contrast to institutional care.  		Ethical issues involving, for example, the rights of clients were discussed.  		The needs of special groups of home care clients, such as AIDS patients and  		children, were also reviewed. Presentations in the closing session reflected  		the new interest in home care as conference participants were urged to develop  		innovative and dynamic research proposals.</p>
<h2><a name="keynote" id="keynote">HOME HEALTH CARE QUALITY</a></h2>
<h3>Keynote Address By:Otis R. Bowen, M.D.Secretary,  		Department of Health and Human Services</h3>
<p>I am happy to have this opportunity to speak to this conference on home  		care quality. The issue you are addressing is among the priorities that I have  		listed in what I call "The Bowen Agenda." The Department of Health and Human  		Services is sponsoring this conference to bring together three groups of people  		who need to talk with one another if we are to improve the quality of home  		care: researchers, regulators, and, of course, the hands-on practitioners who  		deliver home care.</p>
<p>We need to talk about home care quality for several reasons, not the  		least of which is the rapid growth of home care services. It has been nothing  		short of phenomenal. From 1974 to 1985, Medicare outlays for home health  		services grew by an average of more than 31 percent a year. And in the fiscal  		years from 1985 to 1986, Medicaid outlays for this purpose grew by nearly 30  		percent. Growth in more recent years has slowed somewhat, but most see this as  		only temporary. The underlying truth of the matter is that we are spending more  		and more public money on home care, yet we are not really sure that we are  		getting true value for it.</p>
<p>We do know for certain that home care meets with the enthusiastic  		approval of people. Receiving care in your own home is an immensely popular  		idea. If you are an older person, it means you may get to leave the hospital  		sooner. Better still, it may mean postponing or avoiding altogether the need to  		go into a nursing home for there is, indeed, "no place like home." But the very  		fact that home care services are delivered in the person's own home poses  		something of a problem for us--and it is this very problem that brings us here  		today. Part of the problem stems from the fact that home care takes place  		outside of an organizational setting where care can be observed, measured, and  		evaluated. Also, we know something about how to measure quality in a hospital  		because we have been at it for some time now.</p>
<p>A second aspect of the problem is how to establish accountability. The  		fragmentation of the home care service system and the mechanisms that fund it  		can make it difficult to decide just who is responsible for what. This makes it  		doubly important that you address the whole range of home care services from  		the medically intensive ones to those that are primarily social services.  		Difficulties notwithstanding, it is important that we assume a strong Federal  		role in ensuring quality home care services. First of all, we have a  		responsibility under Medicare to be prudent buyers of care. But it is also in  		keeping with this administration's strategy to make health care more  		competitive. If we are to create a medical marketplace, we must ensure  		alternative settings for delivering care.</p>
<p>Putting "the right patient in the right setting of care at the right  		time" does not just make sense medically. It also makes sense economically. It  		is absolutely vital to the establishment of a working medical marketplace that  		the most appropriate care be delivered at the lowest feasible cost. Medicare's  		Prospective Payment System has created an economic incentive for hospitals to  		discharge older patients as soon as they are well enough to go home. But this  		very incentive to discharge means that there have to be sound alternatives to  		care for those who are still in the convalescent stage of their illness. This  		makes it imperative that home care services not only be available, but of good  		quality as well.</p>
<p>Beyond all these considerations, I have a few personal observations to  		make as one who was once a family physician. Back when I was practicing  		medicine, the family physician had the major responsibility for ensuring that  		his patients received quality care. This responsibility was deeply impressed on  		us when we were in medical school. We felt it was a vital part of that  		unwritten compact that we called "the doctor-patient relationship." And we  		believed it would be an abrogation of that compact if government or a  		third-party insurance payer were to take over this responsibility.</p>
<p>But times have changed. Back then, medicine was as much an art as a  		science. So little was known or developed then that ensuring quality care was a  		fairly simple obligation for the doctor. Those days are gone. Today's health  		care has reached a level of technological and organizational complexity that  		goes beyond the scope of the family doctor.</p>
<p>Today many specialized personnel other than the family doctor are  		involved in delivering care. Indeed, much of the post-acute and long term care  		that today's patients receive is outside the direct supervision and control of  		the patient's personal physician. So it simply is not feasible nowadays to hold  		the family doctor personally accountable for this care.</p>
<p>The family physician, however, can prescribe medically centered home  		health care, such as the services of a registered nurse or therapist, and  		should learn more about the home care options available and the coverage rules  		for public programs. But usually these providers of home care do not work for  		or report directly to the patient's physician. So it is highly unlikely that  		the physician will be aware of the quality of home care provided, unless the  		patient complains about it or the condition worsens because it is so bad.</p>
<p>There is an even greater distance between the family doctor and those  		who provide home support services of a nonmedical nature. These social services  		do not even require a physician's prescription. Yet many patients living at  		home need meals prepared for them, housekeeping services, or someone just to  		look in on them from time to time if they live alone. Indeed, at times, the  		availability and quality of these support services can mean the difference  		between staying in a hospital or nursing facility and going back home. Frankly,  		as a doctor, I do not know how one can measure the therapeutic value of being  		at home. But I have often observed that it makes all the difference in the  		world to a patient's sense of well-being, and probably to the recovery.</p>
<p>I am the first to declare that government has a solemn responsibility in  		these times of public deficits to ensure that the taxpayers' money is wisely  		spent. Medicare must indeed be a prudent shopper for health care services. But  		this does not absolve us from constantly seeking that optimal mix of high  		quality service and reasonable cost. And as we seek that ideal mix, we must be  		ever mindful that sometimes better is cheaper. This is precisely the area in  		which you at this conference must apply your know-how and share your insights  		because the task of ensuring quality is far from getting any easier and is in  		fact getting harder.</p>
<p>There are several other factors as well. Firstly, new categories of home  		care patients have emerged: persons with AIDS, ventilator-dependent children,  		the growing number of elderly with Alzheimer's, and the increase in working  		adults who now survive head injuries and other once-fatal conditions. All of  		these home care patients are going to place unprecedented pressures on the  		skills and resources of those who provide home care services.</p>
<p>Secondly, the elderly, who are the biggest users of home care services,  		keep increasing in number. From 1967 to 1984, their number went up from 19.5 to  		27.7 million. Sometime early in the next century that number will grow to over  		50 million. More of them will live to age 85 and beyond, and 25 percent of  		Medicare home health services are used by the elderly in this latter age  		group.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are new developments in portable medical technology.  		These make it possible for some patients to receive certain high-tech services  		at home that were once available only in hospitals. As high-tech medicine is  		infused into home care, the job of ensuring quality is going to get more  		complicated, not less.</p>
<p>All of these emerging factors are affecting a home care industry that is  		still far from solving its quality assurance problem.</p>
<p>Last year, the Office of the Inspector General published an eye-opening  		report on the current state of Medicare services performed by home health  		aides. It found that, while these aides performed most of their personal care  		tasks well enough, they were doing only half of what they should be doing in  		areas that represent an extension of nursing and rehabilitation care. For  		example, aides often failed to give catheter care, foot soaks, or special skin  		care, and failed to assist with dialysis or to record the intake and output of  		fluids. They would neglect to take temperatures, pulse, and respiration, to  		supervise exercises or to record the patients' progress in achieving daily  		living needs. This study laid the blame for these shortcomings on a lack of  		attention in training and on-site supervision by registered nurses. This needs  		looking into. It seems to me it is something that can be remedied.</p>
<p>Another problem that needs attention s the training and pay of home care  		workers. Some say it is not always equal to the responsibilities we expect them  		to handle. But if that is so, then we face an issue that may not be easy to  		resolve: Just how far can we go in establishing training standards for home  		care workers without over-professionalizing the service and pricing home care  		out of the market? I hope you will give this rather sensitive issue your  		careful attention.</p>
<p>I also hope you will take a good look at how we should go about  		measuring the quality of home care. We already do this in several ways, one  		being the setting of "conditions of participation" for home health providers.  		We monitor all this through a system of surveys and certification, operated in  		conjunction with each State. We also fund peer review organizations. Recently  		they have been given a mandate to review post-acute care, including home health  		care. Under the Medicare home- and community-based long term care waivers,  		States operate their own quality assurance programs. They must, however,  		provide us with assurances that appropriate quality safeguards are in place.  		Experiments are underway to apply the ombudsman program of the Older Americans  		Act to home care as well as nursing home care to give consumers an independent  		outlet for voicing their complaints. So we have these quality review mechanisms  		in place.</p>
<p>The trouble is that they often do not relate to one another in a  		coherent way. And medicine has not come very far in creating a coherent and  		useful structure for measuring quality. But recent times have seen the  		development of a unifying concept of quality assurance that holds forth some  		promise.</p>
<p>Quality is viewed from three perspectives. The first emphasizes  		structure. The adequacy of the physical structures and organizations that  		provide care and the professional qualifications of those who give it are  		examined. The second involves process. It is a measure of how well specific  		procedures are carried out and whether those procedures meet the criteria of  		reasonableness for a particular patient with a particular condition. The third  		is a bottom-line measure of quality called outcome. Or, put another way, what  		happened to the patient? Did he or she live or die, or get better or worse, as  		a consequence of the care?</p>
<p>Right now, quality assurance is strong on measuring structure, but not  		so good at measuring process or outcome. We appear not yet ready to fully  		measure all three as a kind of cross-check on the others. That is what we ought  		to be shooting for. From your perspective at this conference, making use of  		this structure, process, and outcome concept might offer you some useful points  		of departure when you start to talk about measuring the quality of home care  		services. I am far from suggesting that this conference go it alone. Your value  		here will be to lay the groundwork and set directions. out of your dialogues  		here should come issues to which researchers can begin seeking answers.</p>
<p>Particular attention needs to be devoted to developing outcome, input,  		and process measures of home care quality; determining the training and  		supervision needs of home care workers; and coming up with guidelines that will  		tell us when home care is appropriate and, if so, at what level of medical  		intensity. You might also want to provide some guidance in how we should go  		about forecasting the labor pool for home care workers and how we can better  		understand what motivates people to enter the field and stay in it. Finally,  		you might help shed light on how we can do a better job of telling consumers  		how to judge the quality of home care they receive or how to pick a home care  		agency that will best meet their need.</p>
<p>In closing I have only this to add: The work you do here can be seen in  		its narrowest sense--as merely a job of defining the problem to be accomplished  		with the perspectives and expertise you bring to this conference--but I would  		suggest to you that if you see your mission only in these terms, you may very  		well fail your purpose here. To succeed requires in each of us a capacity to  		care about those your work here is meant to help.</p>
<p>I take leave of you now filled with the cheerful conviction that I am  		talking to just such a group of people. You would not be here were it  		otherwise. It is my own heartfelt wish that you succeed in your efforts because  		there can be not the slightest doubt that you are indeed performing important  		work here that will ease the plight of many people. I pray that you proceed in  		that hope and spirit and I thank you for being so attentive.</p>

</tr></table><p>Speakers at this opening general session put forward key issues in home  		care quality that were discussed more fully in the following two days of  		breakout sessions. Major topics included the need for improvement in training  		and supervision of home health aides and other unlicensed home care workers,  		strategies for empowerment of clients, and the expanding regulatory role of the  		Federal and State governments. The nature of the quality assurance  		responsibility of home care agencies was also discussed.</p>
<p>Great stress was placed on the need for research in two broad areas.  		Research is needed to find out exactly what kind of quality problems exist.  		There is anecdotal evidence but little information available resulting from  		rigorous, generalizable reporting systems. Research is also needed to develop  		ways of measuring quality that speak to the distinctive features of home health  		care. The important differences between home care and institutional care should  		be addressed in developing quality assurance procedures.</p>
<p>The six speakers expanded on these topics. Elma Holders  		presentation centered on an example of how one elderly client named Violet  		suffered from inept care. Her experience served to spotlight flaws in the  		selection and training of home health aides as well as in the administrative  		procedures of agencies. Although most of the aides who cared for this  		80-year-old woman were indeed caring, only some were well trained, and several  		admitted they had no training at all. Absenteeism was not unusual. There were  		attempts at theft and check forgery. When complaints were registered, the  		agency did not take effective action and the client even experienced  		retaliation. There was never a home visit by a supervisor.</p>
<p>Violet was not able to die at home because of a failure of the system.  		Toward the end, she suffered through a night of extreme pain, receiving  		extremely poor care from an aide who had never before attended a dying person.  		In the morning, the day shift aide did not show up and the agency could not  		send one until noon. Violet had to be transported to a hospital where officials  		insisted on painful tests. She died there three days later.</p>
<p>The irony of this particular client's experience was that she happened  		to be a politically active advocate for a national home health care program.  		She was characterized as one who, had she recovered, would still be promoting a  		national program despite her personal experience. According to her friend and  		informal caregiver Elma Holder, Violet would be highlighting the need for  		better training for the aides and better monitoring of the system.</p>
<p>A portrait of home care aides also emerged from the session. They  		generally have little formal education. They are untrained initially and  		receive very little orientation into the home setting. They are paid very low  		wages with no benefits or guaranteed working hours. Generally, the pay scale  		begins at the minimum wage of $3.35 per hour depending on the agency and labor  		supply. It was alleged that many potential home care workers join the fast food  		industry instead because they can obtain higher wages and better benefits and  		hours at McDonald's or Burger King.</p>
<p>In a study, 15 aides were asked to rank their needs. Behind better  		salary and benefits, they cited the need for respect. It was emphasized that  		they are not unskilled workers, that the work requires a good measure of skill.  		But motivation is lacking because of the insufficient training and  		compensation. There is no career ladder in the field. In one example, the aides  		were given a raise of 10-15 cents across the board instead of raises tied to  		level of skill or seniority.</p>
<p>The three components of skill, motivation, and supervision were cited as  		essential to improving the quality of aide services. Recommendations included  		that training for aides must be paid by the employer, continuing education must  		be provided and perhaps linked to certification, decent wages must be provided,  		a career ladder must be established, and timely supervision must be guaranteed.  		One suggestion was that Medicare could reimburse based on the level of skill  		required of the aide.</p>
<p>The concept of client empowerment was viewed as a way to enhance a basic  		advantage of home care, that the home environment can be a positive factor in  		outcomes. A well-publicized and well-accepted statement of client rights would  		strengthen the role of the client in influencing his or her quality of care.  		Rights statements would include provisions like these in the Code of Ethics of  		the National Association of Home Care:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The patient is fully informed of all his rights and  			 responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to appropriate and professional care  			 relating to physician orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to choice among care providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to receive information necessary to give  			 informed consent prior to the start of any procedure or treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to refuse treatment within the confines of  			 the law and to be informed of the consequences of his action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to receive a timely response from the  			 agency to his request for service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A patient will be admitted for service only if the agency has the  			 ability to provide safe professional care at the level of intensity needed. The  			 patient has the right to reasonable continuity of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to be informed within reasonable time of  			 anticipated termination of service or plans for transfer to another  			 agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to voice grievances and suggest changes in  			 service or staff without fear of restraint or discrimination. A fair hearing  			 shall be available to any individual to whom service has been denied, reduced,  			 or terminated or who is otherwise aggrieved by agency action. The fair hearing  			 procedure shall be set forth by each agency as appropriate to the unique  			 patient situation (e.g., funding source, level of care, diagnosis).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has the right to be fully informed of agency policies  			 and charges for services, including eligibility for third party  			 reimbursements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A patient denied service solely on his inability to pay shall have  			 the right of referral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient and the public have the right to honest, accurate,  			 forthright information regarding the home care industry in general and the  			 chosen agency in particular (e.g., cost/visit and employee  			 qualifications).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Charles Sabatino noted that the Commission on the Legal Problems of the  		Elderly of the American Bar Association is studying client rights statements in  		various States and will propose the elements that should be included in an  		effective one.</p>
<p>Several other ideas for enhancing the client's influence were discussed.  		There should be accountability from the inception of the service. The care plan  		should incorporate the client's perceptions of needs; too many times the client  		is just given a plan. Clients should not be allowed to control the situation  		but their perceptions and preferences should be considered. One example was  		given in which a client's home was infested with cockroaches and the care  		worker set about finding him another place to live. All the client wanted was  		someone to call the exterminator, but that was not in anyone's job  		description.</p>
<p>There shouldalso be a system of accountability for services that could  		be as simple as a checklist with questions for the client: Did your worker show  		up today? Were you given your pill? Were you given a bath? How did you get  		those bruises on your arm?</p>
<p>There is a need for effective grievance mechanisms. Models might be the  		State ombudsman programs mandated by the Older Americans Act for long term care  		and a hotline program mandated by other Federal legislation.</p>
<p>There is also a need for consumer input in home care program policy and  		development. Consumers should sit on panels at the community, State, and  		Federal levels.</p>
<p>Another aspect of client empowerment is the teaching that should be part  		of the job for a well-trained home care aide. The client and family will become  		more comfortable and secure as they learn from the aide about care techniques  		and equipment.</p>
<p>The role of the Federal and State governments was discussed, especially  		in the context of the present level of quality of home health care. Val  		Halamandaris expressed the industry's view that the quality of care is  		extremely high now and has been historically high, especially compared to  		nursing home care. He expressed concern that pressures generated by Federal and  		State policies may reduce quality.</p>
<p>The Medicare Prospective Payment System, using diagnosis-related group  		classifications, has resulted in the discharging of patients from the hospital  		sooner. This has increased the use of Medicare home health care by 38  		percent.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the industry is concerned because  		reimbursement has gone down and denials for payment have increased. Also, the  		three percent denial rate went up 12 percent on the average; in some States it  		went up 33 percent. In addition, the average number of visits a client on  		Medicare could expect decreased from 27 to 12. All in all, it is alleged, fewer  		people qualify for fewer benefits because of rule changes.</p>
<p>In addition, industry representatives complain that the amount of  		paperwork has increased by 50 percent over the last three years and nurses who  		normally work in the field providing care have to be brought into the office to  		do this paperwork. These nurses are worried about malpractice because they know  		they cannot provide decent care with just 12 visits so they are beginning to  		leave the home health field.</p>
<p>Another problem, as the industry sees it, is that States are trying to  		cut costs by contracting directly with individuals and bypassing agencies.  		Still another problem is the increase of unregulated fly-by-night  		operations.</p>
<p>Representing the congressional staff perspective, Nancy Smith responded  		that there are quality concerns in the home health industry and this is the  		reason Congress is moving to beef up regulatory standards. However, she  		stressed that Congress is not on a "witch hunt". Recently, Congress passed  		legislation to require that States set up toll-free hotlines and investigative  		units for home health care. Also, funding for peer review organizations was  		doubled so they could begin to move more aggressively into such areas as home  		care, nursing home care, and physicians' offices. She also pointed out that  		Congress and the States will probably be dealing with non-health related home  		care in the future.</p>
<p>Kathryn Schulke spoke from her experience as a nurse who has worked for  		both nonprofit and proprietary home health agencies. In her view, some home  		care agencies let quality slip by not training and motivating aides because  		they are overly concerned with profits. She suggested that the Federal and  		State governments establish policies that provide positive financial incentives  		to promote quality and discourage promoting profit-making at the expense of  		quality.</p>
<p>Peter Shaughnessy identified a need for more research on the definition  		of quality including quality measures covering the usual range of structural,  		process, and outcome considerations as well as a suggested paradigm of global,  		focused, and broad measures of quality.</p>
<p>Global measures were defined as those that pertain to all clients in a  		given agency, such as mortality rates and staff mix. Focused measures were  		defined as those that pertain to specific types of patients, such as diabetic  		patients and congestive heart failure patients. Broad measures were defined as  		those that would come somewhere between global and focused measures.</p>
<p>Peter Shaughnessy suggested that several points should be considered in  		conducting research on ways of measuring quality of care that take into account  		the unique aspects of home care. The positive value of the home environment in  		contrast to the institutional environment can have a big impact on quality of  		care as well as cost.</p>
<p>In addition, there is less control over care in the home than in an  		institution because the provider is a quest. A new dimension is the knowledge  		that both the client and family gain from the aide in learning about  		self-care.</p>
<p>Finally, all agreed that compliance with quality standards cannot be  		measured as easily at home as it can in an institution. Nevertheless, providers  		should still be held accountable for effective service.</p>

</tr></table><p>Topics addressed in this session included the quality assurance program  		of a small home health agency in Georgia, an analysis of how to tailor outcomes  		research to the distinctive nature of home care, a project to develop outcome  		measurement scales for home care, and procedures used in certification surveys  		of Medicare-certified home care agencies.</p>
<p>Karen Barger described the quality assurance program of the Visiting  		Nurse Association of Coastal Georgia in Savannah, a nonprofit agency that  		provided 23,000 visits last year, which has internal and external components.  		The internal component is defined as procedures developed by the agency itself  		and the external component is defined as related to oversight by outside  		parties such as Federal and State licensure reviews.</p>
<p>The internal component consists of staff selection processes,  		orientation, ongoing in-service training for professional and nonprofessional  		staff, supervision, standardized nursing plans based on nursing diagnosis, and  		a self-audit of the professional disciplines.</p>
<p>An auditing process identifies problems that are corrected through the  		training of practitioners on an individual or group basis. The charts with  		problems are then re-audited eight weeks later to measure improvement.</p>
<p>There is also a Utilization Review Committee composed of two nurses, a  		pharmacist, a nutritionist, and a physical therapist, all volunteers not  		employed by the agency. The committee meets quarterly and each member reviews  		4-6 charts. Committee members are requested to ask these five questions: Was  		the assessment right that directed the client to a home health agency? Were the  		services right for the client? Were the client's total health needs met? Was  		there consideration of other community agencies that might have been needed in  		addition? Were services coordinated for an integrated plan of care?</p>
<p>Twenty percent of all visits are reviewed on a yearly basis. Revised  		versions of an already established patient satisfaction questionnaire and a  		physician evaluation of services will be introduced in the near future. The  		development of a peer review process is 18 months away but could be linked to  		client satisfaction or outcome criteria.</p>
<p>In their discussion of outcomes research at the session, both Peter  		Shaughnessy and Bernadette Lalonde emphasized outcomes related to changes in  		patient status rather than utilization outcomes (e.g., hospitalization use,  		emergency room use). Peter Shaughnessy discussed using two "time points" to  		judge whether or not a transition from one stage to another was successful. The  		patient's mobility status could be measured this way. This approach also  		emphasized tracking the stability of this change: Did the patient progress  		steadily during the time period? Or was there some regression and then  		progression, some back and forth, that eventually resulted in the final  		positive result?</p>
<p>In one example, patient outcomes were compared in home care and nursing  		home care. It was stressed that the comparisons will be deceiving if the  		analysis does not adjust for case mix. In the instance of catheterization,  		nursing home care may outshine home care because it is a difficult procedure to  		carry out as well in the home environment. This would bring up an issue of  		patient placement. However, when the outcomes data in this example were  		adjusted for case mix, the results did not show much difference in general  		between home care and nursing home care.</p>
<p>It was also strongly suggested that the community health nursing model  		should be used in developing outcome measures rather than the medical model  		because home care is predominantly nursing care provided by a variety of  		caregivers--the registered nurse, practical/technical nurse, and the  		homemaker/home health aide.</p>
<p>Emphasis was placed on the need to relate outcome measures to goals that  		the nurse and patient develop together. Additionally, the definition of  		clinical indicators that are the most predictive of care quality should be  		developed by the nurses themselves.</p>
<p>That approach was incorporated into one aspect of Bernadette Lalonde's  		project in Washington State. This ongoing federally funded project to develop  		outcome scales for home care was described in detail. The input of staff  		members from the Washington Home Care Association was utilized.</p>
<p>Five scales have been developed and two more are completing the  		development process. The scales are broad-based rather than diagnosis-specific  		so they can potentially be used for all clients. They measure outcomes on an  		intermediate basis rather than a long term basis and they measure client  		centered outcomes rather than service utilization outcomes.</p>
<p>The scales were tested in pilot programs over a six week period. They  		take 5-15 minutes to administer. They were designed to be much more sensitive  		to changes than other scales. For instance, a distinction is made between upper  		body dressing and lower body dressing instead of just dressing in general. A  		client's progress is charted in specific increments.</p>
<p>One agency used the scale to reform its approach to easing pain reported  		by clients. After the need for pain relief was stressed by a set of clients  		filling out the questionnaire, a new procedure was started to alleviate the  		problem. At specified intervals, there was consultation with the physician on  		modifying pain medication. As a result, the responses on the follow-up survey  		showed the agency had reduced the number of clients complaining of pain.</p>
<p>Widespread use of these scales by the home care industry could  		facilitate case management, improve the quality of care, test outcome practice  		measures, and allow aggregate data collection across agencies.</p>
<p>June Gray reviewed procedures for carrying out certification surveys of  		Medicare/Medicaid participating home health agencies. The survey consists of  		ten conditions of participation. it covers compliance with local, State, and  		Federal regulations; the agency's organization, services, and administration;  		and other quality assurance requirements.</p>
<p>June Gray presented figures to show the categories with the highest  		number of deficiencies for the 5,984 Medicare-certified agencies at the  		beginning of 1987. They were Policies (18 percent), Plan of Treatment (13  		percent), Compliance with Physician Orders (12.7 percent), Clinical Record  		Review (12.6 percent), and Coordination of Patient Care (9.7 percent). Wide  		variations were found within regions of the country.</p>
<p>Although surveyors do make some home visits, much of the data collection  		and analysis is done by reviewing agency records. Some agencies simply modify  		their paperwork after the fact to look better. Since a new Federal law requires  		an assessment of the client at the beginning of service, this allows comparison  		of the client's original condition to his or her present condition. June Gray  		recommended that administrative law support the surveyor in judging the  		client's change in condition by seeing the client rather than by just studying  		records.</p>
<p>The benefits to the Federal government would be to identify outcomes  		appropriate for measuring home care quality, provide data for interagency  		comparisons, and provide data on client centered outcomes to facilitate process  		outcome studies.</p>
<p>Samuel Kidder and Thomas Hoyer briefly outlined the new survey and  		certification requirements mandated by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  		1987 and the Health Care Financing Administration's plans to write regulations  		implementing these new statutory provisions.</p>

</tr></table><p>The panel confronted a broad range of topics: How is client involvement  		ensured in quality assurance of home health care? How is client satisfaction  		measured? Are clients satisfied with the home care currently being  		provided?</p>
<p>Regulatory agencies can help empower home care beneficiaries through  		home visits. Ellen Reap noted that, as of 1985, home visits were added to the  		inspection process of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for  		Medicare certification. The home visit verifies that patient needs are being  		met and all appropriate treatments are being provided. Specific policies govern  		home visits. The agencies contact the beneficiary and gain written consent for  		the visit which the beneficiary can cancel at any time.</p>
<p>HCFA also administers a complaint process. All complaints are evaluated  		at the State level to determine if they should be referred to the Federal  		authorities. Serious allegations are investigated within two working days. The  		States make unannounced visits to providers in investigating consumer  		complaints. The number of complaints by home care beneficiaries is often low  		for several reasons. Many beneficiaries live alone or with family where their  		care is largely unobserved. They often do not understand the process of filing  		a complaint with the proper government agencies. Many fear loss of benefits if  		they do complain.</p>
<p>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987 will have a major  		effect on quality standards for home health services. The law formalized  		patient rights and compelled the States to establish complaint hotlines and to  		create units to investigate consumer complaints.</p>
<p>Carm Striano reported that peer review organizations (PROs) have  		recently been directed to undertake consumer outreach. Through a review of  		sample cases, PROs assure that the quality of care meets professional  		standards. The Keystone Peer Review Organization, Inc. (KeyPro) of Pennsylvania  		has prepared a pamphlet explaining the right of patients to appeal decisions  		and the right to a review of their case. KeyPro has established a beneficiary  		hotline and responds to all complaints. In responding to a complaint, the  		organization reviews the case to determine the quality of care. KeyPro has also  		developed a speakers' group to educate senior citizens on these issues.</p>
<p>Patricia Murphy explained how ombudsman programs can facilitate consumer  		empowerment. Ombudsman programs serve both the independent but disabled client  		and the dependent client, for whom the ombudsman program is most important.  		Consumers should be able to define their needs and understand their plan of  		care. On a community level, consumer empowerment can be accomplished through  		consumer advocacy groups, which are often able to push State regulatory  		agencies into action. According to Patricia Murphy, consumers should be  		involved in developing government regulations but should not supervise home  		care or assess the technical quality of care.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Mullen of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)  		stressed that the home care industry must be held accountable to those it  		serves. There needs to be a sufficient number of providers who can offer a full  		range of affordable and high quality services. Providers have certain  		responsibilities:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Delivery of high quality care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive needs assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care plans developed with the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services appropriately documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and training consistent with the needs of the scope of  			 service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees supervised by professional personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care that reflects standards of practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client Bill of Rights with a clearly defined grievance  			 procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality assurance programs include consumer input.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Pressure on providers often lowers the quality of care. Cost containment  		and quality assurance can be seen as conflicting issues. A shortage of  		providers means that they sometimes engage in questionable hiring practices. A  		fragmented provider system is a hindrance to coordinated care. The regulatory  		framework sets only minimal, not normative, reimbursement standards. There are  		insufficient licensure requirements. Recommendations for government action  		included requiring licensure of all home care workers, developing a standard  		definition of home care services, and mandating certification training and  		continuing education of paraprofessionals.</p>
<p>Recent legislation strengthened the conditions for participation in  		Medicare by including a client Bill of Rights, homemaker/home health aide  		training, and improved surveys.</p>
<p>AARP educates the public on home care and how it can be accessed. AARP  		is currently doing a study on the role of volunteers in home care. Another  		study is being done on the value of case management.</p>
<p>On behalf of AARP, Elizabeth Mullen offered the following  		recommendations to the Department of Health and Human Services:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Develop a systematic method of collecting information from  			 patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of OBRA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study whether quality is increased by paraprofessional  			 training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine whether ombudsman and hotline programs improve access to  			 and quality of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine the role of physicians in home care.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>According to Tony Young who is active as a consumer advocate for the  		younger disabled populations, the key to quality assurance for long term  		personal assistance service lies in helping the client to monitor the quality.  		The provider and client must be full partners in the needs assessment and  		service design process. The client should be involved in training and managing  		those who will come into his or her home. Another helpful procedure would be an  		independent grievance procedure with a third-party mediator. The consumer  		should be able to terminate an unsatisfactory situation without the fear of  		losing service altogether. Emergency services should be improved, as should  		recruiting and referral services.</p>

</tr></table><p>There is a lack of definitive data on the Prospective Payment System  		(PPS), but the rate of growth in Medicare outlays has dropped sharply to the  		lowest level ever. Some of the effects of PPS discussed by the panelists  		included placement of patients in home care after hospitalization, strong  		pressure to discharge patients faster, and to discharge patients who are too  		sick for family care. Shelah Leader noted that the American Association of  		Retired Persons (AARP) has received 2.2 million requests for its pamphlet "Know  		Your Rights," indicating the extent of unmet needs for home health care. The  		RAND Corporation is conducting a study on home care as a substitute for  		traditional institutional health care. However, data are not available on  		readmission rates for discharged hospital patients. The research agenda should  		include studies on the role of fiscal intermediaries. These studies should  		result in the production of data on the clinical condition of discharged  		hospital patients. AARP conducted a panel on patients who had been hospitalized  		that provided the first solid data on PPS beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Korbin Liu reported on the study he and Kenneth Manton conducted on  		utilization patterns of post-acute care by functionally disabled Medicare  		beneficiaries. Special attention was given to hospital readmissions and  		mortality. The results indicated a decline in the average hospital length of  		stay and an increase in post-hospital home health episodes of care. Mortality  		declined following the use of PPS and home health utilization increased. No  		adverse effects of PPS on Medicare beneficiaries were uncovered.</p>
<p>Barbara Phillips described Mathematica Policy Research's survey in  		progress of post-acute care for frail elderly Medicare recipients, particularly  		those over 85. The study is looking at quality challenges and patterns of  		combining services among hospitals, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, and  		home care agencies as they relate to outcome measures. Two key questions are  		what factors account for the type of post-acute care chosen and why. Factors  		include patient, discharge, and hospital elements. The survey, which is funded  		by the Heinz Foundation, will also study the caregiver burden to develop a  		better view of home care challenges, including rehabilitation, case management,  		education, personal care, quality of family care, and quality of service needs  		assessment.</p>
<p>Rosalie Kane reported on a related study concerned with access to  		post-hospital care and denial of services in conjunction with PPS. The major  		question being addressed is whether Medicare beneficiaries are getting adequate  		care. The goals of this study are to identify and validate guidelines for  		defining minimally adequate care and to develop a risk classification system  		identifying outcomes, using data to determine a broad range of measures.  		Potential applications include the extension of this study to other areas, such  		as process measures and adverse outcomes, and its use by researchers and  		consumer groups in care planning.</p>

</tr></table><p>A major topic of this session was the need for methods to ensure quality  		of care. The development of new methods is important because close supervision  		of home care workers is difficult. Some examples include a consumer checklist,  		a supervisory checklist for the home health agency to complete each month,  		random home visits, and such support programs as a recognition lunch for  		workers.</p>
<p>Low salary for home care aides is a major problem. They are usually  		poorly educated, poorly trained, and poorly paid. Additionally, more research  		is needed on the best methods to help the aides improve the quality of  		care.</p>
<p>Jo Eleanor Elliott reviewed the Public Health Service Division of  		Nursing activities related to issues in recruitment, retention, and supervision  		of home health care workers. Recently, the Division held a conference on home  		health care. The Division also provides leadership in response to legislative  		initiatives through Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. It currently  		funds demonstration projects to improve care and access to care, continuing  		education of nurses, and advanced nurse education in home care. A sample survey  		of nurses will give an indication of how many nurses work in the home care  		field. The Division has also developed criteria for home care nursing.</p>
<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration will be funding  		demonstration grants for home care service. Much-needed research on the  		outcomes of care is eligible for funding from the National Institutes of  		Health. The American Nurses Association has issued standards for home care  		practices for registered nurses.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Gordon focused on the lack of well-defined job descriptions  		for home health personnel. The scope of practice for registered nurses is well  		defined from State to State. However, the scope of practice for licensed  		practical nurses (LPNs) and licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) is less  		well-defined. As the home care worker shortage becomes more acute, there is  		more use of LPNs and LVNs. Training requirements for paraprofessionals vary  		widely among the States. The length of training required varies from 16 to 120  		hours. The titles used in different States also vary widely.</p>
<p>There is no central registry or board for home care workers. Regulation  		by such boards would allow the competency of the individuals to be assessed  		more easily. In States with mandatory ongoing continuing education there is no  		follow-up procedure to make sure the education is completed. It was recommended  		that national regulations should be established that define the scope of  		practice of LPNs and LVNs and that the minimum training should be  		standardized.</p>
<p>Jeff Barnes described three studies New York State is carrying out  		regarding the home care labor force. New York's Long Term Care Policy  		Coordinating Council (LTCPCC) advises the Governor on health care policy.  		LTCPCC is studying recruitment, retention, and motivation of home care workers.  		High turnover and falling recruitment are becoming problems in New York.  		LTCPCCs research includes a survey to every agency in the State, a labor  		market study, and a survey of current and former home care workers.</p>
<p>These studies have two broad goals: (1) providing baseline data to  		document the extent of the problem in the State; and (2) helping the New York  		Legislature develop policy. One of the issues that will be studied is  		compensation of home care workers. Wages can run as low as $3.45 per hour and  		the average range is $4-$5 per hour. The study will concentrate on compensation  		package, rate reimbursement, wage security, and wage increase strategies. The  		rate of retention of home care workers is difficult to document because of  		reporting problems. Some data indicate that home care is a labor market entry  		mechanism. One possible method of attracting other potential home care workers  		is by offering day-care services. There also needs to be more support of home  		care workers to prevent burnout. Many times workers infer that they constitute  		a temporary work force because of the way the work is assigned. A new aspect of  		the study will concentrate on recruitment.</p>
<p>Rebecca Donovan reported the preliminary findings from her study of New  		York City's home care workers. Publicity regarding these findings provided the  		impetus for a recent campaign to improve wages and benefits. In New York City  		there are an estimated 60,000-70,000 home care workers. The survey was done of  		404 home care workers. The workers in the study were exclusively minority women  		and 54 percent were born in the United States. The foreign born came from 26  		countries with a large contingent from the Caribbean. The average age was 47  		years old. Some 86 percent had children and 75 percent were the sole wage  		earners for their household.</p>
<p>The Medicaid office controls the terms of employment so there is little  		leeway for the vendor agencies in their employment practices. The most common  		salary for the previous 12 months was $5,000. Annual income is low because the  		worker is treated like a temporary and the work tends to be intermittent. Some  		80 percent reported that they were unable to acquire adequate housing.  		Eighty-five percent reported that they did not earn enough money as home care  		aides to buy food for themselves or their families. Negative aspects indicated  		were isolation, lack of training, lack of supervision, and marginalization of  		their position. Fifty-two percent reported suffering from psychological stress  		symptoms. However, most of the workers felt that they were doing important and  		valuable work. Fifty-two percent reported that they were somewhat satisfied  		with their jobs. In New York City home care workers have begun to unionize.  		Through the unions workers have gained benefits and wage increases.</p>
<p>John Mullin described how the Clackamas County Social Services Program  		in Oregon and the Medicaid State-funded Oregon Project Independence Program  		addresses recruitment, training, and supervision of home care workers. Both  		programs recognize the importance of flexible hours, vacation time, and  		training requirements.</p>
<p>The Client Employee Program of Oregon's Project Independence Program was  		able to obtain unemployment coverage for home care workers. It developed a  		clearinghouse project to screen, check references, and provide a minimum amount  		of training. A registered nurse was added to the staff to help employees  		working with clients requiring special assistance. The program provided  		respite, hospice, and chore services; a Seniors Resource Guide to encourage  		people to be smart consumers; and a case management system called risk  		intervention.</p>
<p>In Oregon, adult foster care is an important issue. Recruiting in the  		rural areas of Oregon is a problem and wages remain low. Adequately trained  		employees are in short supply.</p>

<p>The lead speaker, James Focht, described a study, funded by the U. S.  		Department of Health and Human Services, being carried out by Macro Systems  		that focuses on State activities in home care quality assurance. The challenge  		is the difficulty in obtaining an overview, given variation among the 19 States  		in the study. The report will include profiles of each State covering a  		generalizable picture of program organization and history of home care  		services, the degree of fragmentation, service delivery mechanisms, resources,  		demographics, availability of providers, and community involvement as well as  		regulatory standards and methods.</p>
<p>The basic question is whether there is a tendency to be less critical  		when care is given in the home and whether standards are compromised as a  		result. Issues include standard definitions, outcome measures, licensing of  		providers, case management, and risk management.</p>
<p>Nancy Mumma's presentation described efforts to contain home care costs  		in Oklahoma by coordinating various State agency funding and organizing a local  		voluntary effort by non-professionals to provide home care. Contributing f  		actors were Federal cutbacks, loss of revenue sharing, and methods to improve  		accountability. Agency coordination prevented duplication of services for  		proposals, contracting, monitoring, and evaluation. A survey of referrals was  		recommended as a good mechanism f or measuring quality.</p>
<p>Results included services more responsive to client needs, better  		coordination of State and local services, cost reduction, ability to serve more  		clients, collection of aggregate data, and services provided at 50 percent less  		than Medicare. Recommendations included Federal and State coordination of  		reimbursement; more research on process, outcomes, cost, and quality of care;  		more flexibility of service needs for chronic and long term care; and  		client-centered approaches to quality assurance.</p>
<p>Maryann Nardone described quality assurance under Pennsylvanias  		Long Term Care Assessment and Management Program. Local agencies perform  		assessments and offer alternatives to a long term care facility. Supplemental  		services are available to the individual and all services are pre-approved. The  		population is well-defined and a standard assessment tool is used. All staff  		receive standard training. The client caseload is identified. Direct providers  		are not allowed to perform assessments and onsite monitoring is done. Maryann  		Nardone recommended that the research agenda include service protocols on  		client care and family care.</p>
<p>William Foley of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute presented a  		systems engineering view of the home care delivery system. The systems  		definition of quality is delivering the right services to the right people at  		the right time. Issues in focusing on the right people include the opportunity  		for home placement, discharge planning, and screening those who will benefit  		most from the kind of assistance home care is best suited to provide. Issues  		related to the right time include identification of problems, resources  		available to solve the problems, specification of goals for these services, and  		availability and accessibility of services when required.</p>
<p>A decision-making tool was devised that achieved economy of home care  		resources in reviewing prospective clients for home care placement. A client  		classification system to match clients to home care programs and a uniform  		client assessment for care planning were devised.</p>
<p>Innovative delivery and payment systems, productivity improvements, and  		introduction of technology are needed in dealing with the "right time" issue.  		Since demand cannot be anticipated, accessibility is the greatest  		challenge.</p>
<p>Darrel Balmer presented an overview of Illinois' quality assurance  		approach. Structure, process, and outcome measures are incorporated into  		contract reviews of vendor performance. This process determines the  		continuation of contracts for the agencies. Technical assistants are used for  		the compliance review. The threat of corrective action is an incentive to  		improve quality. A thorough review is conducted following corrective action.  		The results showed that compliance reviews were strengthened and plan of care  		reviews were more appropriate.</p>

<p>Mike Goldman of the Health Care Financing Administration highlighted the  		following new requirements mandated by OBRA:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Each patient must be informed of his or her rights in advance,  			 including the right to express grievances, to confidentiality, and to  			 information on services provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home health agencies will have to notify State survey agencies of  			 all changes in ownership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A home health aide training program will be developed. A regular  			 performance review must be conducted, and after January 1, 1990, no home health  			 agency may use an untrained person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training standards will be developed for personnel using durable  			 medical equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual plan of care for each patient is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home health agencies are subject to an outcome-oriented survey  			 process, based on home visits, to ensure that services promote the highest  			 functional capability of the patient receiving medical, nursing, and  			 rehabilitation care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior notification of a survey visit is subject to a fine.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>A toll-free hotline will be established for client complaints,  			 monitored by an investigative unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer review organizations (PROs) will review specific complaints of  			 beneficiaries.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Charlene Harrington discussed her study in progress of the quality of  		home care in California and Missouri. This study looks at the quality of care,  		the extent of State regulations, and changes that have occurred. Statistical  		data were obtained from key providers, State regulators, consumer  		organizations, PROs, home care agencies, and State legislators. Preliminary  		results indicate that the number of regulations are decreasing because of  		budgetary restrictions. The study is also measuring the extent of State  		licensing, which is decreasing, as well as Medicare/Medicaid certification  		surveys. Because of resource constraints, there is a lack of surveyors, and  		fewer than half of the home health care agencies are surveyed annually.</p>
<p>Questions were asked about State priorities for certification and the  		kind of enforcement actions taken if there is a lack of compliance. Enforcement  		is limited, but there is some decertification action. It was suggested that  		State authorities hear few complaints because consumers do not know which  		agency is responsible for regulation. Also, the States do not have the  		resources to respond. Half of all complaints are about unlicensed agencies.  		There is a funding problem if regulations are expanded, and one political  		barrier to expansion is the influence of interest groups.</p>
<p>Quality problems were found in personnel policies, supervision, clinical  		records review, administration, and coordination of patient services.  		Coordination among the various agencies is also problematic, and there are few  		resources to focus on outcome measures.</p>
<p>Changes in the Federal survey and certification process have occurred  		because of the increase in the number of proprietary agencies, the use of  		diagnosis-related groups in the Prospective Payment System of Medicare, and the  		growth of the elderly (over 75) population.</p>
<p>Marly Auerbach presented the view of a home health agency director whose  		agency is subject to Medicare/Medicaid regulatory standards. She criticized  		Medicare/Medicaid quality requirements for not being integrated with  		reimbursement and expressed the opinion that increased scrutiny has not  		improved care. Home care agencies did not have sufficient input into the  		development of Medicare Form 485 (for filing reimbursement claims);  		consequently, this form is difficult to relate to the plan of care. This  		results in less time for clients and more time on paperwork, increasing the  		cost to the agency of compliance. Surveyors who determine noncompliance do not  		have a home health care background; therefore the need for inter-rater  		reliability is crucial.</p>
<p>Marly Auerbach's recommendations for improving survey and certification  		standards and processes included the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Distinguish between long term and short term acute care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen standards jointly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate reimbursement policy and survey development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult health care leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with providers on reimbursement policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the cost of compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase certification criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not require as much paperwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with home health care providers, not against them.</p>
</li>

</tr></table><p>This panel focused on the accreditation programs of three national  		professional groups and an accreditation commission established in New Jersey  		to assist the State Medicaid program. The issue of private accreditation  		programs qualifying to grant agencies "deemed status" under Medicare was  		debated. If an accreditation program is assigned the authority to grant deemed  		status by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) , the agencies  		accredited by it are eligible for participation in Medicare just as if they had  		qualified through the Medicare certification process.</p>
<p>According to Carol Kurland, the Commission on Accreditation for Home  		Care in New Jersey was developed to address the problem of the rapid growth of  		home care agencies since the early 1970s. The number of homemaker/home health  		aide agencies grew from 25 in 1975 to 225 in 1984. In 1984 the State developed  		the option of personal care assistance services. Administrators of the Medicaid  		program realized they could no longer rely on only Medicare-certified agencies  		for service to the increasing number of eligible clients, so they turned to the  		largely unregulated homemaker/home health aide segment of the industry.</p>
<p>However, they were concerned about the unregulated nature explored using  		this segment. They used existing accreditation organizations, the National Home  		Caring Council and the New Jersey Home Care Council. There was no difficulty  		with the national organization but the certified agencies argued that a private  		provider industry organization with an accreditation program was not  		appropriate. Consequently, New Jersey developed the commission, a separate,  		legally incorporated entity. They sought input from many organizations. All  		interested parties are represented on the commission's board.</p>
<p>This State commission and the national council submit accreditation  		recommendations on agencies to the Medicaid program which makes the final  		decision. One advantage cited was running such a commission without the  		taxpayer's money. Seventy-four percent of the commission's $94,000 budget comes  		from fees and the rest comes from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, based in  		New Jersey.</p>
<p>The commission has established a task force to study the shortage of  		home health aides. It also facilitates periodic meetings of home health  		agencies with the Medicaid director to discuss issues.</p>
<p>This model of State-sponsored accreditation was described as promoting a  		very good private industry/government working relationship. It was also seen as  		the first step in an evolving quality care program for the New Jersey's  		Medicaid program.</p>
<p>According to Anne Rooney, the new Home Care Accreditation Program of the  		Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)  		represents a national industry consensus on standards. The program was two  		years in the making and had just begun implementation the day before the  		conference.</p>
<p>In the development process, four versions of draft standards were  		reviewed by some 7,000 health care professionals, professional and trade  		associations, and consumers. The standards were also discussed at regional  		conferences and JCAHO staff members made some 60 presentations at national  		meetings. The standards focus on the interaction between the care worker and  		the client.</p>
<p>Pilot surveys were conducted at home health agencies around the country.  		The agencies were asked not to prepare f or an accreditation survey because the  		intent was not to accredit but to find out if the proposed standards were  		realistic as ways to improve the quality of care. Seventeen organizations  		participated and the standards were modified according to the results.</p>
<p>Representatives from 18 professional and trade associations make up a  		Home Care Advisory Committee that is involved in the new accreditation process.  		The accreditation program not only includes home health agencies but also  		equipment management firms and personal care and support services  		organizations.</p>
<p>The survey process includes a minimum of f our home visits for each  		organization. Some 70 peer reviewers will be trained by this fall. They will be  		nurses with clinical and administrative experience in the field, equipment  		managers who have owned or managed an equipment company, and pharmacists.</p>
<p>Maria Mitchell characterized the Community Health Accreditation Process  		(CHAP) of the National League for Nursing (NLN) as setting a standard of  		excellence rather than going along with the more common minimum safety  		standards. The NLN has been accrediting home health agencies for 25 years. CHAP  		is a subsidiary of NLN with its own board of directors.</p>
<p>The standards and criteria were broken down into the five key areas of  		planning, organization and management, finance, human resources, and operations  		and service delivery. A major emphasis is placed on management and finance.</p>
<p>The NLN has done quite a bit of work in the area of outcomes in home  		care and the standards focus on outcome measures.</p>
<p>The accreditation process includes an agency self-appraisal, a site  		visit, and home visits. In general, two site visitors stay for four days. They  		typically include a professional with experience in a service delivery area and  		one with experience in the management and finance area. Site visitors undergo  		rigorous training. A consultation approach with the agency is stressed. The  		agency is left with a clear view of any problems and a good idea of how to  		build on the strengths. A board of review composed of 12 home care managers  		then makes a decision based on the site visitors' report.</p>
<p>According to Nola Aalberts, the National Home Caring Council  		Accreditation Program is geared to the homemaker/home health aide component of  		the industry. The council was founded at the request of eight government  		agencies and 26 national organizations for the express purpose of developing  		standards.</p>
<p>Standards are set for training at the beginning of employment,  		in-service training, and specialized training. Emphasis is placed on case  		supervision (i.e., monitoring specific tasks done for the client) and  		administrative supervision (i.e., monitoring payroll and personnel records).  		The standards also require an annual evaluation of services, a periodic  		in-depth self-evaluation, and consumer input. Community agencies that fund the  		agency's programs or that refer clients are surveyed.</p>
<p>Board members and staff members on all levels are interviewed during  		site visits. Case records are reviewed. Hiring procedures, reference checking,  		and performance evaluations are studied.</p>
<p>Debate on deemed status centered on whether or not the JCAHO and NLN  		would be able to abide by Federal rules and regulations if their accreditation  		programs were given the authority to assign such status. In the view of Ellen  		Yung-Fatah, the two organizations could not meet the standards and should not  		be empowered to grant deemed status. Representatives of both organizations  		responded vigorously that they would be able to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>HCFA announced last year that it had decided to give authority to the  		two organizations to grant deemed status, but the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  		Act of 1987 stipulated that such a decision could not take effect until new  		Federal rules on the conditions of participation in the Medicare program were  		released. That was not expected until the last few months of 1988.</p>
<p>One of Ellen Yung-Fatah's concerns about the ability of the two  		organizations to meet the requirements was the contrast between the three year  		review cycle of the accrediting organizations and the required one year survey  		and certification review cycle. Another of her concerns was the problem of how  		special compliance reviews will be funded because private accrediting bodies  		generally bill the client agency for reviews. Will the accrediting bodies pay  		for follow-up reviews when problems are discovered if the agencies are  		unwilling to do so?</p>
<p>Her third concern was that the organizations' approach of stressing  		consultation and education in motivating agencies to comply voluntarily with  		regulations might be at odds with their role in enforcing standards. Similarly,  		Ellen Yung-Fatah asked whether accrediting bodies could move fast enough to  		satisfy timeliness requirements in compliance investigations. She also  		questioned whether they could carry out the required home visits.</p>
<p>Finally, Ellen Yung-Fatah expressed doubts about whether the accrediting  		bodies could protect the individual client's rights under the Freedom of  		Information Act. Conversely, she asked, would the accrediting bodies agree to  		release information on abuses by agencies to the government, given their  		policies of protecting the confidentiality of their surveys?</p>
<p>In rebuttal, the representatives of accrediting bodies stressed that  		their organizations do conduct special follow-up surveys and pay for these  		themselves. The consultation approach was defended as not being inconsistent  		with the regulations. It was emphasized that the accrediting bodies could move  		in a timely fashion to carry out compliance reviews and satisfy the specific  		requirements regarding home visits.</p>
<p>The ability to protect client's rights was also asserted as a key  		strength of both home health accrediting organizations. The organizations'  		representatives also stressed that the results of their investigations would be  		sent to the Federal government and in this way could become public record even  		though disclosure procedures have not been finalized.</p>

</tr></table><p>The AIDS population was discussed first. Peggy Beckman stated that home  		health care agencies will be dealing with more AIDS patients in the future  		because their number is increasing and the best way to provide care is at home.  		The United States has 42,000 reported AIDS cases as well as 1-3 million people  		infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of whom 60 percent are expected  		to develop AIDS.</p>
<p>What are the needs of the AIDS patient? Confidentiality must be closely  		protected and the AIDS patient's right to medical care must be upheld.  		Reimbursement for health care is needed because many AIDS patients lack private  		insurance. Data should be collected on the costs of AIDS care.</p>
<p>Because many AIDS patients are homosexuals or intravenous drug abusers,  		there are differences in culture and values that the health care system should  		understand. A comprehensive home care program would have these essential  		components:</p>
<ul><li>good quality assurance criteria and standards; </li>
<li>knowledge of local epidemiology; </li>
<li>a strong system of case management; </li>
<li>a multi-disciplinary approach; </li>
<li>staff education on the management of symptoms and psychosocial  		  issues;</li>
<li>staff support mechanisms; </li>
<li>ongoing evaluation and monitoring of care; and</li>
<li>better data collection.</li>
</ul><p>When dealing with AIDS patients, the worker generally confronts a very  		complex nontraditional family structure. There are also issues involving the  		care of terminally ill patients. Statistics show that AIDS patients will die  		within 2-3 years following diagnosis.</p>
<p>Another issue is the shortage of nursing home beds for AIDS patients.  		Those with AIDs are reluctant to seek hospice care because they are usually  		young and vital. There is also a problem of recruiting people to work with AIDS  		patients.</p>
<p>Children make up a second population frequently served by home care  		workers. Linda Maurano described the Pediatric Home Health Care Services of  		Children's Hospital National Medical Center. Home care returns as much  		responsibility for care as possible back to the family. Family values and  		participation play a central role in home care for children. The package of  		services should be designed to serve children on a wellness-illness continuum.  		There is an increased need for home care for children for several reasons. The  		number of children disabled by chronic illness has doubled over the past 25  		years. The technology that was once available only in the hospital has been  		miniaturized and is available in the home setting. Children can be cared for at  		one-fifth of the cost at home.</p>
<p>There are some significant differences between pediatric care and adult  		care. The focus of teaching is on the caregiver (parent, etc.) not the care  		receiver, and extra emphasis is placed on family unit. Children often do not  		meet the criterion for adult home care of being homebound so another more  		accurate standard needs to be developed. Children get sick quicker and their  		condition is more fragile.</p>
<p>Staff members caring for a child should have pediatric experience. They  		must be taught that they are to care for the child, but not replace the parent.  		Administrative costs for pediatric home care are much higher. Usually the  		social and psychological factors in a family situation make caring for the  		child difficult so health care workers need support to prevent burnout.</p>
<p>Ann Hallock described New York State's personal care program which has  		70,000 clients and deals with several different client groups. One client group  		in particular, the adult disabled under age 65, want self-directed care. The  		Medicaid personal care program provides three levels of assistance of nutrition  		and environmental support, personal hygiene, and health related tasks. The  		personal care program only permits the third level for self-directing patients  		with a stable medical condition who are chronically but not acutely ill. Even  		though the program is State supervised, it is administered at the local  		level.</p>
<p>Many of the clients have been the self-directing physically disabled. In  		New York City an agency, Concepts for Independence, was established to be run  		directly by disabled people. The board of directors includes one representative  		from each of the disability-related organizations in the city. This  		organization was set up as a home attendant vendor. In this arrangement, the  		disabled client actually does the hiring and firing, and some training of the  		home care worker. Concepts for Independence acts as a fiscal intermediary and  		keeps employment information, prepares paychecks, and provides a registry of  		potential emergency workers. It also provides peer support in managing home  		care workers.</p>
<p>Connie Zuckerman addressed ethical issues posed by in-home care from a  		legal perspective. The United Hospital Fund of New York recently completed a  		study of home care in New York City that documented the change from a system of  		care dominated by nursing homes to one in which a growing number of elderly  		clients receive services in their home. Despite large numbers of clients  		receiving home care, very little is known about the quality of the care.  		Medicare had certified about 5,000 home care agencies by 1984. From a medical  		and consumer law perspective, home care agencies are businesses that are  		isolated from the operation, scrutiny, values, and peer review involved in more  		conventional medical care. As of yet, there has been little focus in the area  		of bio-ethics on issues raised by home care. Recent literature on legal issues  		in home care reflects a defensive risk management approach. Home care has not  		been subjected to the intense regulatory scrutiny of hospital and nursing home  		care. It is not susceptible to the peer review that occurs in congregate  		settings. Many elderly clients cannot be self-directing in terms of their care  		and comfort needs because they have diminished mental capacity. Who will  		monitor these interactions in the private home? Elderly home care clients live  		in a netherworld without official or self-appointed advocates. These issues  		raise a series of questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Who makes decisions for the elderly with regard to the determination  			 and provision of appropriate levels of' home health care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are some of the elderly too readily transferred from home care to  			 institutions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What role is played by agency policies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any social or ethical consensus about the appropriate  			 family responsibility in the home care setting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we be encouraging or demanding family responsibility in home  			 care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are the wishes of clients with diminished mental capacities  			 respected?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The courts have ruled that patients capable of making decisions have the  		right to decide on proposed medical care even if the consequence of refusal is  		serious injury or death. What is the responsibility of home health care  		providers on this issue?</p>
<p>Ethical issues and values often lie hidden by financial and regulatory  		imperatives. It is difficult to disentangle issues of' client rights, autonomy,  		quality, and ethical concerns from the issues of cost control, payment, and  		reimbursement. It is imperative to recognize the primary role of clients.</p>

</tr></table><p>The contributions to home care research of three major research funding  		sources were outlined in this concluding session. Representatives of the  		National Center for Health Sciences Research and Health Care Technology  		Assessment (NCHSR), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and Robert  		Wood Johnson Foundation also discussed their organizations' future research  		agendas.</p>
<p>Jerry Weston highlighted three of the two dozen or so past projects on  		home care funded by NCHSR. The first was a study of comprehensive home care  		programs for the elderly. Conducted by Susan Hughes at Northwestern University,  		it evaluated a collaborative home care program involving five voluntary  		hospitals on the north side of Chicago.</p>
<p>The program differed from that of most Medicare-reimbursed home health  		care in that services were not restricted to patients requiring skilled nursing  		visits and no limits were placed on the number of visits. It also bridged the  		gap between nursing and medically oriented visiting nurse services and social  		service homemaker services.</p>
<p>The evaluation used a quasi-experimental design with a nonequivalent  		control group and pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization measures of two  		groups of homebound individuals over the age of 60. The findings included a  		significant reduction in the rate of institutionalization for those receiving  		comprehensive care and a reduction in their unmet needs. These positive  		findings were accompanied by a decline in functional status. The researchers  		suggested that the subjects might have reported greater prevailing disability  		in order to retain compensated support for their daily activities.</p>
<p>The second study was a randomized trial of a new approach to home care.  		It evaluated the impact of a nurse practitioner/social worker team approach to  		home care for patients with chronic or terminal illness who wished to be  		treated at home rather than in an institution. The project was conducted by the  		University of Rochester Medical Center and the Visiting Nurse Association of  		Monroe County. Ann Marie Groth-Juncker at the University of Rochester was the  		principal investigator. The program included a 24 hour telephone service by  		team members and home visits by physicians as necessary. It emphasized  		supportive care by family and friends. The findings showed that this team  		approach was very well received by patients and their families. The patients  		were institutionalized for fewer hospital days (38 percent less  		institutionalization) and fewer nursing home days (59 percent less  		institutionalization) than nonteam-care patients. Costs were ten percent lower  		for team-care patients.</p>
<p>The third study, entitled The Effects of an Emergency Alarm System for  		the Aged, was done by Sylvia Sherwood at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for  		the Aged in Boston. It resulted in one of the first technologies approved by  		Medicaid for reimbursement for use in home care.</p>
<p>The Lifeline system was the focus of the study. It automatically dials  		for help if a disabled or high-risk person living alone does not respond to a  		telephone call at a preset time.</p>
<p>Factors considered in the research were health status, quality of life,  		institutionalization, cost of formal and informal health services, and time of  		death. The findings indicated that Lifeline users felt more comfortable living  		alone. They also showed that nonusers required 13 days in a nursing home for  		every one day required by users. Cost of care savings were also shown.</p>
<p>Three ongoing projects were described as well. The first, entitled the  		Impact of Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) on Public Home Health Nursing  		services, is being conducted by Elaine Kornblatt Phillips of the University of  		Virginia School of Nursing. The major component of the project is a study of  		resource use before and after DRGs. The sample is 20 percent of the recipients  		of home nursing visits made by agencies in Virginia. Agencies are especially  		eager to participate in the study because it involves analyzing patient records  		to get a handle on some of the nonreimbursable costs such as telephone  		consultations and paperwork. The second is a study by InterStudy of Excelsior,  		Minnesota on the delivery of home health services by health maintenance  		organizations (HMOs). It is based on a supplement to a survey of HMOs conducted  		for the Federal government each year. The research includes studies of  		innovative agencies and statistics on the HMOs providing home care, types of  		eligible enrollees, the scope and types of services, and quality assurance  		provisions.</p>
<p>The third project, conducted by researchers at the University of  		Maryland, examines the impact of home care on the family of an infant being  		monitored for apnea.</p>
<p>For the future, NCHSR is particularly interested in considering process  		and outcome studies for funding. Several examples of methodologies that need  		refinement include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Construction of a valid and reliable system for classifying home  			 visits in terms of the presenting problems that are potentially amenable to  			 health care provider interventions. This "reason-for-visit" taxonomy would  			 group patients in an organized and retrievable fashion, which would facilitate  			 evaluations of interventions and patient education efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development and testing of measures of case mix and severity of  			 illness as a basis for the intensity of care required in a home visit or  			 episode of care. These measures can be used to describe the practice of home  			 care providers. Coupled with a reason-for-visit taxonomy, these measures would  			 provide a basis for the development of DRGs for home health practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development and adaptation of methods for assessing the quality of  			 home care. They should accommodate a wide variety of acute and chronic  			 problems. Methods for measuring patient outcomes should be developed and  			 tested. There is a particular need to examine relationships among patient  			 assessment, care plans, and patient and family outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of a uniform needs assessment instrument. This  			 instrument should evaluate the functional capacity, nursing and other care  			 requirements, and social and familial resources of an individual.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Linda Hamm described studies funded by HCFA that have involved the  		history, payment approaches, and quality of home care. She noted, in  		particular, a project to develop outcome scales for home care being carried out  		by Bernadette Lalonde in Seattle, Washington, whose preliminary findings had  		been reported earlier in the conference. Five scales have been developed and  		two more are in final stages of development. They measure client-centered  		outcomes rather than service utilization outcomes. A study on the impact of the  		Prospective Payment System (PPS) on nursing home care and home health agencies  		is being conducted by Peter Shaughnessy at the University of Colorado. He also  		had reported preliminary findings earlier in the conference.</p>
<p>HCFA is also sponsoring a related project to compare the quality and  		cost of care provided by capitated (HMO-type) and non-capitated (fee for  		service) organizations at the University of Colorado. The project is comparing  		the care for Medicare patients receiving home health services immediately after  		hospitalization with those who do not start home care until at least 30 days  		after hospitalization. The emphasis is on process and outcome quality  		measures.</p>
<p>A recent contract was awarded to the Georgetown University School of  		Nursing to collect and analyze data about home care patient characteristics,  		resource use, and outcomes. The goal is to develop a classification system that  		predicts resource use and outcomes.</p>
<p>A pilot study is being conducted by System Sciences on the impact of  		Medicare's PPS on post-hospital care. Researchers have developed medical  		condition guidelines for high-risk patients that examine process and outcome  		measures. There are plans to award a contract next year to apply this  		methodology to a nationwide sample of patients.</p>
<p>A four year study to develop outcome-based quality measures for home  		health services is scheduled to be awarded this fiscal year. The results might  		potentially be used by HCFA in the future in a variety of ways. For example,  		the measures could be incorporated into the HCFA survey and/or peer review  		process. New quality assurance systems could be established, possibly using  		incentives or sanctions. Or the measures could be used to assure quality under  		alternative payment systems for home health agencies. Additionally, HCFA is  		developing a national demonstration project to test the quality and  		effectiveness of home care services for Medicare-covered Alzheimer's patients  		and their families.</p>
<p>Andrea Kabcenell reported that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has  		embarked on a reordering of priorities this spring, and quality of care in home  		care fits in very well with the new priorities. Examples of subjects the  		foundation would like to address are developing sound techniques to measure and  		assure quality of care and altering financing, training, and delivery of care  		to improve the outcomes of care.</p>
<p>There are three projects underway currently. A multi-State study on  		support services for the elderly is designed to show that there is a private  		market f or such services. It is run mainly out of visiting nurse home health  		agencies. Peter Shaughnessy is conducting a project to develop ways of  		identifying indicators of quality of care in home care. The Community Council  		of Greater New York was awarded a grant to test an ombudsman program for  		low-income, frail elderly receiving home attendant services, which was  		described earlier in the conference. </p>
<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is interested in entertaining other  		bold new approaches to home care quality assurance.</p>
