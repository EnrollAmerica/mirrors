<p>Advances in medical care and technology have blurred the boundaries  		between life-and-death and have challenged our expectations about how Americans  		should experience the end of life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Chronic illnesses, including cancer, organ  		system failure (primarily heart, lung, liver and kidney failure), dementia, and  		stroke are now the leading causes of death for Americans and few die  		suddenly. Rather, most will live long, but with increasing  		disability.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note2">2</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note3">3</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> However, health care, legal and social  		policy and practice have yet to catch up with this reality. Studies indicate  		that the end of life is associated with a substantial burden of suffering among  		dying individuals,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note5">5</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note6">6</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note7">7</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> and that negative health and financial  		consequences extend to family members and society.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note9">9</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note10">10</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note11">11</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note12">12</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note13">13</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most deaths (80%) occur in hospitals or nursing homes, often in the  		context of aggressive high-technology treatment, even though most people, when  		asked, would prefer to die at home.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note15">15</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note16">16</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> This transition in the venue of death has  		been fueled by the development of technology that is capable of sustaining life  		in very compromised states and, in the view of some, of extending the dying  		process. For example, just 30 years ago, the development of the percutaneous  		endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was a revolutionary advance aimed at  		establishing long-term enteral feeding in infants. The PEG tube has evolved  		into a common medical procedure for both children and adults, especially older  		adults suffering from various forms of dementia,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note18">18</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> an application  		quite different from its original intent. This and other interventions delay or  		slow dying in the United States, although they do not necessarily improve the  		dying process.</p>
<p>Advance directives (ADs) or advance health care directives were  		developed to provide a practical process for ensuring patient autonomy at the  		end of life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note21">21</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> Ideally,  		addressing end-of-life issues with the aid of ones physician will enhance  		the quality of end-of-life care by helping the patient, family, and provider to  		converge on a unified plan that gives voice to the patients  		preferences for medical care within the spectrum of reasonable clinical  		options. The decision maker appointed to implement the agreed-upon wishes (and  		perhaps the preferences themselves) can then be recorded in an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> The vision of ADs is that  		patient autonomy can be translated into treatment decisions made by physicians  		and families on behalf of the incapable patient, which reflect the decisions  		that the patient would have made for himself or herself.</p>
<p>ADs began as simple requests to avoid medial treatment that would  		prolong life in undesirable conditions. However, they have evolved, becoming  		increasingly detailed and specific, often containing patient preferences for a  		variety of medical treatments in hypothetical medical scenarios.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> The activities leading up to the completion  		of an AD -- discussion of clinical circumstances and prognosis, understanding a  		patients goals in this clinical context, and outlining plans for future  		care to approximate those goals -- constitute the process of advance care  		planning (ACP), which is central to end-of-life decision making and AD  		completion. ACP, in its most advanced form, is a comprehensive, ongoing, and  		holistic communication pattern between a physician and his or her patient (or  		the patients designated proxy) about values, treatment preferences, and  		goals of care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note25">25</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> ACP broadens the framework of ADs by  		emphasizing not only decisions about whether to use a treatment but also by  		making practical arrangements (e.g., anticipating treatment modalities to have  		them in place). Additionally, ACP helps to identify what course serves the  		patient best and then outlines specific steps to make that course more likely.  		Thus, ADs are not an end in themselves; rather, these documents are most  		effective when incorporated into a comprehensive ACP process<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note27">27</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> and  		the patients goals are incorporated into the care provided by the health  		care system to the patient.</p>
<p>This report examines the empirical evidence about the degree to which  		ADs and ACP have met their intended goals. We explore what the medical  		literature reports concerning the use of ADs and ACP, disparities among groups  		in their use, and interventions to enhance the use and value of ADs and  		ACP.</p>
<h2><a name="term" id="term">II. TERMINOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>There is some variation in the use of terminology concerning ADs, ACP  		and end-of-life care, and this variation is at times a source of  		misunderstanding. Some of these differences relate to words having specialized  		meanings in the context of end-of-life care as well as due to geographic  		variation. Each state regulates the use of ADs differently; statutes enacted at  		the state level often conflict in the definition of terms. Relying largely on  		the terminology of the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (the 1993 federal  		legislation that encouraged making and enforcement of advance health care  		directives and provided a means for making health care decisions for those who  		have failed to do so)<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note29">29</a></font></sup>  		and the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA),<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> we will use the following definitions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Advance health care directive or advance directive</b>: A written  			 instructional health care directive and/or appointment of an agent, or a  			 written refusal to appoint an agent or execute a directive. Although the  			 Presidents Council on Bioethics defines an AD as including verbal  			 instructions,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note31">31</a></font></sup> we do  			 not include verbal instructions in the definition because this has not been the  			 common use of the term in the medical literature and it is inconsistent with  			 some states AD laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Agent</b>: An individual designated in a legal document know as a  			 power of attorney for health care to make a health care decision for the  			 individual granting the power; also referred to in statute as durable power of  			 attorney for health care, attorney in fact, or health care  			 representative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Individual instruction</b>: An individual's direction concerning  			 a health care decision. This may be written or verbal describing goals for  			 health care, treatment preferences, or willingness to tolerate future health  			 states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Instructional health care directive</b>: Also referred to as a  			 living will; a written directive describing preferences or goals  			 for health care, or treatment preferences or willingness to tolerate health  			 states, aimed at guiding future health care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Advance care planning</b>: The process of discussing, determining  			 and/or executing treatment directives and appointing a proxy decision  			 maker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Proxy</b>: Substitute decision maker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Surrogate</b>: Proxy by default; a person who, by default,  			 becomes the proxy decision maker for an individual who has no appointed  			 agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Guardian</b>: A judicially appointed guardian or conservator  			 having authority to make a health care decision for an individual.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Many see the appointment of an agent as more important than creating an  		instructional health care directive because the latter cannot address all the  		changing aspects of a health care situation whereas an agent can make decisions  		based on the latest available information. In addition, the wording of  		instructional directives is often problematic and it is difficult to address  		every possible circumstance that could arise in some future medical state. All  		50 states and the District of Columbia recognize the appointment of an agent  		for health care decisions; however, three states do not have laws authorizing  		instructional health care directives (Massachusetts, Michigan, and New  		York).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
<p>ADs are employed to extend patient autonomy into the period in which the  		patient has lost the ability to make decisions for him or herself. This is  		important because many of the decisions toward the end of life are value-laden;  		meaning that they depend on an individuals view of the value of specific  		health states and how treatments meet their personal goals. ADs are implemented  		most often toward the end of life when decisions about life-sustaining  		treatments must be made. Decisions often include which treatments to employ or  		remove. A special set of terms is often used, which are defined here modified  		from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> the National Hospice and Palliative Care  		Organization<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> and  		other sources:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Artificial nutrition and hydration</b>: Artificial nutrition and  			 hydration (or tube feeding) supplements or replaces ordinary eating and  			 drinking by giving nutrients and fluids through a tube placed directly into the  			 stomach (gastrostomy tube or G-tube), the upper intestine, or a vein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Capacity</b>: An individual's ability to understand the  			 significant benefits, risks, and alternatives to proposed health care and to  			 make and communicate a health care decision. The term is frequently used  			 interchangeably with competency but is not the same. Competency is a legal  			 status imposed by the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</b>: A group of treatments used  			 when someones heart and/or breathing stops. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation  			 (CPR) is used in an attempt to restart the heart and breathing. It usually  			 consists of mouth-to-mouth breathing and pressing on the chest to cause blood  			 to circulate. Electric shock and drugs also are used to restart or control the  			 rhythm of the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do not resuscitate order</b>: A physicians order written in  			 a patients medical record indicating that health care providers should  			 not to attempt CPR in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. In some  			 regions, this order may be transferable between medical venues. Also called a  			 <b>DNR</b> (do not resuscitate) order, a <b>No CPR</b> order, a <b>DNAR</b> (do  			 not attempt resuscitation) order, and an <b>AND</b> (allow natural death)  			 order. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Intubation</b>: Refers to "endotracheal intubation" the insertion  			 of a tube through the mouth or nose into the trachea (windpipe) to create and  			 maintain an open airway to assist breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Life-sustaining treatment</b>: Medical procedures that replace or  			 support an essential bodily function. Life-sustaining treatments include CPR,  			 mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, dialysis, and  			 certain other treatments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mechanical ventilation</b>: Treatment in which a mechanical  			 ventilator supports or replaces the function of the lungs. The ventilator is  			 attached to a tube inserted in the nose or mouth and down into the windpipe (or  			 trachea). Mechanical ventilation often is used to assist a person through a  			 short-term problem or for prolonged periods in which irreversible respiratory  			 failure exists due to injuries to the upper spinal cord or a progressive  			 neurological disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Minimally conscious state</b>: A neurological state characterized  			 by inconsistent but clearly discernible behavioral evidence of consciousness  			 and distinguishable from coma and a vegetative state by documenting the  			 presence of specific behavioral features not found in either of these  			 conditions. Patients may evolve to the minimally conscious state from coma or a  			 vegetative state after acute brain injury, or it may result from degenerative  			 or congenital nervous system disorders. This condition is often transient but  			 may exist as a permanent outcome.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note34">34</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Palliative care</b>: Also called comfort care, a  			 comprehensive approach to treating serious illness that focuses on the  			 physical, psychological, and spiritual needs of the patient. Its goal is to  			 achieve the best quality of life available to the patient by relieving  			 suffering, controlling pain and symptoms, and enabling the patient to achieve  			 maximum functional capacity. Respect for the patient's culture, beliefs, and  			 values is an essential component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Patient Self-Determination Act</b>: An amendment to the Omnibus  			 Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, the law became effective December 1991  			 requiring most United States hospitals, nursing homes, hospice programs, home  			 health agencies, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) to provide to  			 adult individuals, at the time of inpatient admission or enrollment,  			 information about their rights under state laws governing ADs, including: (1)  			 the right to participate in and direct their own health care decisions; (2) the  			 right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment; (3) the right to  			 prepare an AD; and (4) information on the providers policies that govern  			 the utilization of these rights. The act prohibits institutions from  			 discriminating against a patient who does not have an AD. The PSDA further  			 requires institutions to document patient information and provide ongoing  			 community education on ADs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Permanent vegetative state</b>: A vegetative state is a clinical  			 condition of complete unawareness of the self and the environment accompanied  			 by sleep-wake cycles with either complete or partial preservation of  			 hypothalamic and brainstem autonomic functions. The persistent vegetative state  			 is a vegetative state present at one month after acute traumatic or  			 nontraumatic brain injury, and present for at least one month in  			 degenerative/metabolic disorders or developmental malformations. A permanent  			 vegetative state (PVS) can be diagnosed on clinical grounds with a high degree  			 of medical certainty in most adult and pediatric patients after careful,  			 repeated neurologic examinations by a physician competent in neurologic  			 function assessment and diagnosis. A PVS patient becomes permanently vegetative  			 when the diagnosis of irreversibility can be established with a high degree of  			 clinical certainty (i.e., when the chance of regaining consciousness is  			 exceedingly rare).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Withholding or withdrawing treatment</b>: Forgoing or  			 discontinuing life-sustaining measures.</p>

<p>End-of-life issues have long been the focus of intense societal debate  		as providers, medical ethicists, policy makers, legislators, and the public  		have considered essential questions concerning patient autonomy, quality of  		life at the end of life, and withdrawal of life-sustaining  		treatments.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> As far back  		as 1914, case law established the requirement to obtain a patients  		consent for invasive medical procedures, based on the right of  		self-determination.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a></font></sup>  		Traditionally, health care ethics have largely been based on professional  		authority and beneficence. Physicians made most patient care decisions and  		focused primarily on cure or comfort. As medical technology advanced (e.g., CPR  		and mechanical ventilators), the focus of care shifted to the more technically  		feasible pursuit of sustaining life. </p>
<p>By the 1960s, patient and consumer rights movements, as well as hospice  		care advocates, sought to free terminally ill patients from aggressive and  		ultimately futile life-sustaining treatment through legal measures with the  		development of the earliest form of AD, the living will. Living  		wills were designed to maintain the patients voice in medical  		decision making and empower individuals to dictate the terms of their own  		medical care at the end of life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note22">22</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note36">36</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note38">38</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note39">39</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note40">40</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note41">41</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Initially, it was the states, rather than the Federal Government, that  		moved to give legal support to living wills. In 1976, California passed the  		Natural Death Act, the first law to give legal force to living wills; soon  		thereafter states passed legislation authorizing proxy directives. In 1990,  		Congress enacted the PSDA,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> requiring most health care facilities to ask  		patients whether they had an AD; to provide written information on rights to  		make treatment decisions to adult patients on admission or enrollment to a  		health care facility; and to make AD forms available to patients who did not  		have one.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note21">21</a></font></sup> The PSDA  		was designed to acknowledge a patients right to either refuse or accept  		medical treatment, empowering patients by safeguarding their autonomy and  		preserving self-determination, protecting patients against maltreatment,  		fostering communication between patients and their physicians, and protecting  		physicians from litigation in end-of-life decision making.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Case law has generally upheld patient wishes as the main standard of  		appropriate care. Interestingly, ground-breaking cases have, for the most part,  		involved young women. For example, a pivotal case from 1975 involved Karen Ann  		Quinlan, a 21 year old woman who, after cardiac arrest, was resuscitated but  		remained in a persistent vegetative state. In 1976, the New Jersey Supreme  		Court granted her parents the right to withdraw life-support, holding that an  		individuals constitutional right to privacy outweighed the states  		interest in preserving life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note39">39</a></font></sup> When the ventilator was removed, Karen Ann  		Quinlan continued to breathe on her own and, sustained by tube feedings, lived  		until 1985.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> Ethicists  		and many in the medical profession interpreted the courts decision as  		broad enough to encompass a patients decision to decline medical  		treatment under certain circumstances.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A case that further clarified legal authority in end-of-life decision  		making involved Nancy Cruzan, age 32, who in 1983 was involved in an automobile  		accident that left her in a persistent vegetative state. Years later,  		Cruzans parents concluded that their daughter would never recover and  		that she would not have wanted to be kept alive in her current state. The  		hospital refused to discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration without a  		court order. A trial court issued the order but the Missouri Supreme Court  		reversed the trial court decision on the basis that Ms. Cruzans parents  		were not entitled to terminate her medical treatment in the absence of  		clear and convincing evidence that this choice reflected her  		wishes. A seven-year court battle reached the Supreme Court,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note46">46</a></font></sup> which ruled that, while Cruzan  		had the right to refuse tube feedings, the state could demand clear and  		convincing evidence that this was her expressed desire on the basis that a  		state may constitutionally set high barriers for decisions to withdraw food and  		water from incompetent patients when the patients have not spoken clearly  		themselves. </p>
<p>Today, ACP and ADs, which are recognized in some form throughout the  		United States, are widely accepted not only as a way to identify preferences  		for life-sustaining care for use when patients have lost decision making  		ability but also as a general framework for decision making near the end of  		life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note22">22</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note47">47</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note48">48</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note49">49</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="ethic" id="ethic">IV. ETHICAL ISSUES IN ADVANCE DIRECTIVES AND ADVANCE  		CARE PLANNING</a></h2>
<p>Patient autonomy and individual choice are core values in Western  		bioethics and important components of end-of-life decision making.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note50">50</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note51">51</a></font></sup> As  		such, ensuring the centrality of the patients and the familys voice  		in medical decision making and honoring patient preferences for end-of-life  		care are key goals in patient and family-centered care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note10">10</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note12">12</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note13">13</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note14">14</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note52">52</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note53">53</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note54">54</a></font></sup> Most ethicists agree that the principle  		of patient autonomy can be translated into the actions of protecting and  		promoting patients ability to make informed decisions resulting, ideally,  		from capable and uninfluenced deliberation. In this context, medical procedures  		should be provided to patients only if the procedures are reasonably likely to  		achieve the patients goals.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note55">55</a></font></sup> In situations where aggressive therapeutic  		interventions will not or have ceased to be effective to reach the goals of the  		patient, care should shift to other interventions including palliative care.  		These goals should include consideration of the psychosocial and spiritual  		interests of the patient.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note53">53</a></font></sup></p>
<p>ADs are a tool to implement patient autonomy -- nearly always toward the  		end of life -- for patients who have lost the capacity to make decisions for  		themselves. The AD may derive from the process of ACP in which patients (and  		their families) receive information about a patients clinical condition  		and consider the patients values and goals in order to guide clinicians  		in their duty to act in the patients best interest. This interactive  		process is revisited at critical junctures in the patients care, when  		prognosis changes and when desired by patients and proxies. Essential to this  		process is communication between patient/family and clinician. The content of  		information, the way in which the information is provided, and continuity are  		critical to the ACP process. In its optimal form, ACP is a series of  		interactions in which patients come to expect that they will be fully informed  		of their clinical status and have direct input into significant decisions,  		families -- to the extent desired by patients -- are aware of patient decisions  		and the values on which they are based, and providers become well versed in  		patients values and how they connect to treatment preferences and  		decisions. In this context, providers can analyze clinical circumstances in the  		context of patients goals and communicate to patients recommendations  		about care decisions that patients and families can accept or reject.</p>
<p>An obstacle to decision making toward the end of life arises when  		families (or rarely patients) desire care of greater aggressiveness then is  		deemed warranted by providers. This often occurs in the setting of mistrust or  		disagreement over prognosis. Other times, conflict centers on families desiring  		life-sustaining treatment in compromised health states (e.g., PVS) for which  		providers find such treatment to be inappropriate. These situations are most  		commonly the result of poor early patient-provider communication and  		ACP.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note56">56</a></font></sup> Rarely, these  		conflicts are the result of philosophical or religious differences that result  		in providers implementing what they perceive to be futile care.  		Providers may respond to this situation by attempting to reduce the influence  		of patient/family preferences on care decisions. Under these circumstances, the  		lack of socially-held values on the overall goals of medicine and what is  		futile care, may hamper ACP. </p>
<p>A number of mechanisms to facilitate ACP have been suggested. These  		include detailed elicitation of patient preferences for medical treatments  		under a variety of conditions,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note57">57</a></font></sup> exploration of patient values in  		construction of approaches to care,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note58">58</a></font></sup> and mechanisms to facilitate discussion and  		specification of a proxy.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note59">59</a></font></sup> These issues are discussed more fully in  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#sectionVI.B">Section VI.B</a>. These mechanisms include the following  		steps, each of which is necessary if an AD is to have an impact on medical  		care:<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note21">21</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note47">47</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note50">50</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note60">60</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note61">61</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The patient, informed by ACP conversations with ones provider,  			 considers proxy specification and goals of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimally, the proxy participates in the ACP conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AD is completed with proxy specification and a description of  			 goals or desired treatments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AD is <i>available</i> to clinicians and proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patients preferences or goals, as reflected in the AD, are  			 accurately interpreted and applied to the clinical situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proxy and provider <i>honor</i> the patients choices in  			 fashioning and implementing the care plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Still, a number of practical limitations to the use of ADs and ACP have  		been identified,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note31">31</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note47">47</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note50">50</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note55">55</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note61">61</a></font></sup> including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Patients have difficulty predicting their future treatment  			 preferences.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AD documents provide guidance for only a limited set of future  			 medical possibilities.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proxy decision makers may have difficulty converting patients  			 documented treatment preferences into clinical decisions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note23">23</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note63">63</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferences for life-sustaining treatment appear to depend on the  			 context in which they are made.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note64">64</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some patients have limited desire to exert specific control over  			 end-of-life medical decision making and would prefer instead to leave future  			 specific decisions to their families or physicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note65">65</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expressed preferences may be subjugated to physician influence  			 concerning the clinical appropriateness of life-sustaining treatment.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note66">66</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note67">67</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note68">68</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The ethical framework that underpins ADs and proxy decision making is a  		hierarchy in which the patients own choices dominate, and, if these are  		not known, the proxys application of the patients values to reach a  		decision guides care. This substituted judgment is based on  		knowledge of the patients goals, on the patients prior behavior, or  		on discussions with the patient about preferences. A major goal of ACP is to  		help proxies understand this. Too commonly, the proxy is unable to render a  		substituted judgment and must make a best-interest decision on the  		patients behalf. Thus, the proxys primary role is to support  		patient autonomy by attempting to work with clinicians to have medical care  		achieve the goals of the patient, if these are possible given the clinical  		circumstances. Because <i>expressed preferences</i> often do not match clinical  		circumstances, <i>goals of care</i> are often more malleable in directing  		medical care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note69">69</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Empirical studies suggest that the patient-proxy relationship exists on  		a contractual to covenantal continuum: disease trajectory, clarity of  		prognosis, and the clarity and type of patient instructions affect whether  		proxies are to simply heed patient wishes or need to participate actively in  		decision making.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note70">70</a></font></sup>  		Several studies have shown that some patients prefer that proxies make  		decisions based on what they think is best rather than based on what the  		patients would have wanted at the end of life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note71">71</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Using ADs to extend patient autonomy requires that clinicians know when  		patients lose capacity (or decision making ability) in order to invoke the AD.  		This skill must be coupled with the realization that capacity may wax and wane  		and variable levels of capacity may be required for different decisions. In  		practice, decision making capacity is often assessed informally or  		inconsistently<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note72">72</a></font></sup> and  		there are many misconceptions about capacity in a clinical context.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note73">73</a></font></sup> There is little consensus or  		clinically relevant empirical data about how to assess a persons level of  		understanding of specific treatment decisions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note74">74</a></font></sup> Furthermore, there is a need to explore how  		and in what ways elements of ADs and treatment choices need to be modified to  		allow greater participation of cognitively impaired patients.</p>
<p>Despite the plethora of practical obstacles, from an ethical  		perspective, it is imperative that ACP be carried out to the best abilities of  		providers, patients and families. Without knowledge of the patients goals  		to guide care, default medical care often ends up being "everything that can be  		done" or not as much as might usefully be done, neither of which serves the  		patient well.</p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">V. METHODS</a></h2>
<p>In preparation for a National Institutes of Health State of the Science  		Conference on "Improving End of Life Care" in December 2004, RAND conducted a  		systematic review of the evidence published between 1990 and 2004 regarding the  		effectiveness of interventions, including ADs and ACP, for improving  		end-of-life outcomes.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup>  		The 2004 review was conducted for the National Institute for Nursing Research  		(NINR) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). In this  		report, we update the systematic review to include the period 2004-2007 and  		incorporate new topic areas for the period 2000-2007 not included in the  		original review.</p>
<p>We address the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What does the literature say about the utility, feasibility, ethical  			 issues, and success of implementation of ADs and ACP for a diverse array of  			 patient populations and across health care settings?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the salient considerations necessary to more widely apply  			 ADs in vulnerable populations, such as the cognitively or physically disabled,  			 and in determining what will be a wise course for policy development? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the salient legal considerations regarding the wider  			 promotion of ADs/ACP? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the potential methods that can be used to promote and  			 document ADs more widely (including the role of health information technology  			 (HIT) and social marketing)?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>RAND searched the traditional health literature databases (e.g.,  		MEDLINE, LOCATORplus, Lexus Nexus, CINAHL, EconLit, PsychInfo, and Wilson  		Select Plus) for relevant publications. These articles involved human subjects,  		but did not include individual case reports. To update the original systematic  		review, we conducted a literature search of articles published in peer-reviewed  		journals in the United States between 2004 and 2007. We used the literature,  		search criteria, search terms, protocols, evaluation methods, and materials  		developed for the original NINR/AHRQ review. </p>
<p>We conducted a separate search of the literature from 2000 to 2007 to  		identify systematic reviews, randomized or clinical controlled trials,  		epidemiologic studies, and qualitative studies related to additional topics not  		addressed in the original review, including legal/policy issues in ADs/ACP; HIT  		and ADs/ACP; intellectual/physical disabilities and ADs/ACP; and social  		marketing/public engagement and ADs/ACP.</p>
<p>Our main search strategy, described in detail in <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>, included a list of terms intended to identify  		all research publications, within the time period specified, associated with  		ADs/ACP and with the following topics:</p>

<p>ADs were instituted in response to the perception that care toward the  		end of life needed to better reflect patient wishes. ACP and ADs were intended  		to translate the fundamental values of biomedical ethics into bedside care,  		which was dramatically transformed by the technological breakthroughs of the  		1960s though 1980s. The variety of efforts to promote ADs and ACP has been  		extensively evaluated. Despite two decades of legislation and advocacy, studies  		show that AD completion rates are low<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note22">22</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note38">38</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note48">48</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note76">76</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note77">77</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note78">78</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note79">79</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note80">80</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note81">81</a></font></sup> and that these documents often do not drive  		care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note82">82</a></font></sup> A variety of  		interventions have been undertaken, most of which have not been successful in  		altering care. Certain groups of individuals and venues of care have been  		particularly resistant to the penetration of ACP and ADs. However, some  		regional efforts have demonstrated social change, including changes in  		expectations, and integration of ACP and ADs into care across venues, improving  		the match of technological care with patient goals. This section summarizes the  		data concerning AD and ACP use and its effect on care, interventions to  		increase ACP and AD use, ACP and AD use among disabled persons, and potential  		mechanisms of improving ACP and AD use.</p>
<h3>A. Use of Advance Directives and Advance Care  		Planning</h3>
<p>1. <b>Overview</b>. Despite the institutionalization of ADs in state and  		federal law and widespread public support for ACP from healthy and ill  		populations as well as the medical community, the accumulated evidence shows  		that adoption of ADs is low. Most of the literature suggests that between 18%  		and 30% of Americans have completed an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note22">22</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note38">38</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note48">48</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note76">76</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note77">77</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note78">78</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note79">79</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note80">80</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note81">81</a></font></sup> Acutely ill individuals, a group for  		which ADs are particularly relevant, complete ADs at rates only slightly higher  		than the healthy population.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note83">83</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note84">84</a></font></sup> At most only one in three chronically ill  		individuals in the community have completed ADs (e.g., 35% in dialysis  		patients; 32% in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  		patients).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note85">85</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note86">86</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Patient factors associated with desire for end-of-life planning  		information and completion of an AD include older age, greater disease burden,  		White race; higher socio-economic status; knowledge about ADs or end-of-life  		treatment options; a positive attitude toward end-of-life discussions; a  		long-standing relationship with a primary care physician; and whether the  		patients physician has an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note87">87</a></font></sup> The evidence is  		mixed regarding the relationship of patient health status and AD completion or  		end-of-life planning discussion.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note88">88</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note89">89</a></font></sup> Care planning differs by clinical  		environment (e.g., intensive care unit (ICU) versus outpatient settings),  		medical condition (e.g., cancer versus heart failure) and acuity of  		illness.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note90">90</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note91">91</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note92">92</a></font></sup></p>
<p>2. <b>Venue of care</b>. ADs and ACP, by design, should have their  		greatest impact in the hospital and ICU settings. However, the literature  		suggests that the effect in high-technology medical settings has been modest. A  		structured literature review of the use of ADs<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note82">82</a></font></sup> found that less than 50% of severely or  		terminally ill patients had an AD in their medical record. Additionally,  		between 65% and 76% of physicians whose patients had an AD were unaware of its  		existence. Having an instructional health care directive did not increase  		documentation of preferences in the medical record and ADs often were not  		considered applicable until the patient was incapacitated or absolutely,  		hopelessly ill. Most providers and families waited until the patient was  		actively dying before preferences were invoked to direct withholding or  		withdrawing of life-sustaining treatments. The report also found that proxies  		often were not present or too overwrought to make decisions and that providers  		tended to predict patient preferences that reflected under-treatment relative  		to patient wishes. On the contrary, proxies tended to predict treatment  		preferences that were <i>more </i>aggressive then patients would have wanted.  		In a separate study that included medical record evaluation after patient  		death, the authors found that 55% of patients with cancer have ADs but only  		14-24% of severely or terminally ill persons without cancer had an  		AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<p>It is in the ICU, where most aggressive care is provided, that ADs and  		ACP appear to have a particularly weak effect. The majority of deaths in the  		ICU involve resuscitation or withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining  		treatment.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note93">93</a></font></sup> The  		condition of patients receiving care in the ICU and the complexity of care  		patterns often makes it difficult to determine patients preferences and  		values. Enthusiasm for technology and cure by patients, families and providers  		often overshadows consideration of patients wishes, quality of life, and  		assessment of treatment burden versus treatment benefit.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note94">94</a></font></sup></p>

Use of ADs varied by the residents  		race and cognitive and physical function. Another study found that AD use was  		greater in urban then rural nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note122">122</a></font></sup> AD use has been associated with various  		nursing home organizational characteristics; nursing homes with more full-time  		equivalent nursing staff per resident demonstrated greater AD completion rates  		while for-profit status and higher Medicaid census were associated with lower  		completion rates.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note123">123</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Concerning patient factors, Lambert et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note124">124</a></font></sup> found that older persons in long-term care  		tended to base AD decisions on information gathered from personal experiences  		with death and illness and obtained little information from professionals or  		the media. Instead, elders relied on spiritual, emotional and social  		considerations. Rurup et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note125">125</a></font></sup> found that differences in religious  		beliefs and the providers perspective of the nursing home resident  		resulted in different attitudes about end-of-life care decisions.  		White<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note126">126</a></font></sup> found that  		the stress of moving to a nursing home, the health status of the resident,  		concern for others, age, and residents understanding of ADs all  		influenced AD completion on admission to a nursing home. Dobalian<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note127">127</a></font></sup> found that the percentage of  		nursing home residents who had AD care plans varied substantially by  		residents age, ethnicity and income.

<p>Travis et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note128">128</a></font></sup> examined patterns of care during the last  		year of life for a group of nursing home residents and found that while most  		residents died receiving palliative care, their progression toward a palliative  		care plan was often slowed by indecision or inaction on the part of key  		decision makers and sometimes interrupted by aggressive acute care until the  		last few days of life.

There has been  		considerable attention to knowledge and attitudes about and completion of ADs  		and ACP among racial or ethnic minority groups in the United States. Studies  		tend to find that some race/ethnicity groups, such as African-Americans, are  		less likely to engage in ACP or complete ADs, but results across studies are  		mixed. While most studies have found that African-Americans and Hispanics are  		less likely then Whites to complete ADs and are less likely to specify that  		life-sustaining treatments be withheld or withdrawn in these  		documents,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note79">79</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note135">135</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note136">136</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note137">137</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note138">138</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note139">139</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note140">140</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note141">141</a></font></sup> other research suggests that  		African-American and Hispanic adults are just as likely as Whites to have an  		AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note142">142</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note143">143</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note144">144</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Morrison and Meier<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note145">145</a></font></sup> surveyed 700 adults 60 years or older from  		34 randomly selected senior centers in New York to determine AD use and  		willingness to engage in ACP among healthy and ill White, African-American and  		Hispanic populations. More than 80% of respondents reported being comfortable  		talking to their physician about ACP and said that they would like to have a  		conversation about end-of-life care. There were no significant differences in  		completion rates across the three racial/ethnic groups. Thirty-five percent of  		participants had completed a health care proxy, comparable to completion rates  		in White populations found in other studies. However, Hispanic respondents,  		compared to Whites and African-Americans, were more likely to want their  		physician or family member to initiate these discussions; were more likely to  		value collective decision making rather than individual family decision making;  		and were more likely to worry that they would not be treated as  		well as others or that physicians might prematurely discontinue  		life-support if they made decisions for less aggressive care. Perkins et  		al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note136">136</a></font></sup> interviewed  		European, African, and Mexican-American community-dwelling adults and found  		that while all groups agreed with the idea of end-of-life planning,  		Mexican-Americans and African-Americans were less receptive to the need for an  		AD. Blackhall et al.,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note146">146</a></font></sup> in a study of 800 older White,  		African-American, Mexican-American, and Korean-American adults found that  		ethnicity was strongly related to preferences for life-sustaining technology in  		terminal illness, but the relationship between ethnicity and preferences was  		complex. Whites were the least likely to want life-support, whereas  		Mexican-Americans were more likely to want it. Korean-Americans were more  		positive about the use of life-sustaining treatment than Whites but did not  		want such technology used personally. African-Americans generally felt it was  		acceptable to withhold and withdraw life-support, but were the most likely to  		want to be kept alive on such treatment.</p>
<p>Kwak and Haley<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note147">147</a></font></sup> reviewed 33 empirical studies  		investigating racial/ethnic variation in end-of-life decision making and found  		that non-White groups had less knowledge about ADs and were less likely than  		Whites to support the use of ADs. There were various reasons for these views:  		African-Americans were found to more often prefer the use of life-support;  		Asians and Hispanics were more likely to desire family-centered decision making  		(rather then an autonomy-based model); and Hispanics were less likely to  		believe their actions could change the future and were more concerned that  		life-sustaining treatments would be withdrawn prematurely. Similar results were  		found in a qualitative study by Shrank et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note139">139</a></font></sup> In the nursing home, African-Americans  		were found to be about one-third as likely to have an AD as Whites, even after  		controlling for health and other demographic factors.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note148">148</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note149">149</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Limited uptake of ADs in the African-American population has been  		attributed to distrust of the medical care system and the unfavorable reaction  		to the concept of ADs. Some researchers argue that cultural differences in AD  		completion rates are not grounded in racial/ethnic differences, but are based  		in economics and that failure to execute an AD is based on a differing set of  		beliefs relative to the dying process.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note150">150</a></font></sup> This perspective views race and ethnicity  		as surrogates for economic and educational differences in access to health  		care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note151">151</a></font></sup> Yet, other  		research has shown that when socio-economic factors are taken into  		consideration, minority groups still tend to express different preferences than  		Whites for end-of-life care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note146">146</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Differences in minority compared to non-minority views on ADs have been  		found to include spiritual concerns, cultural concerns, and individualization  		-- that is, each person should be considered unique, and therefore, the  		circumstances of their death are unique and their wishes and needs should not  		be stereotyped based on culture.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note152">152</a></font></sup> Johnson et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note153">153</a></font></sup> reviewed literature published  		between 1966 and 2003 to explore spiritual beliefs that may influence the  		treatment preferences of African-Americans. They found two commonly overlapping  		themes: the belief that only God has the power to decide life-and-death and a  		belief in divine intervention or miracles. Consistent with studies noted above,  		African-Americans were more likely than Whites to favor life-sustaining  		treatments regardless of illness severity and less likely to complete an AD.  		Similarly, True et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note154">154</a></font></sup> examined differences between  		African-American and White patients with cancer regarding spirituality and  		found that African-Americans were more likely to report using their  		spirituality to cope with their cancer as compared to their White counterparts,  		and patients who reported a belief in divine intervention were less likely to  		have a living will.</p>
<p>Some research suggests that ADs, as currently constituted, are not  		compatible with the cultural traditions of some patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note146">146</a></font></sup>  		Searight et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note138">138</a></font></sup>  		identified three basic dimensions of end-of-life care that vary culturally:  		communication of bad news, locus of decision making, and attitudes  		towards ADs and end-of-life care. Some evidence suggests that Hispanic, Asian,  		Chinese, Pakistani, and Native-American communities prefer to avoid the  		emotional and physical stress caused by addressing end-of-life issues, and  		family members actively protect the terminally ill from knowledge of their  		condition. In terms of decision making, relative to persons of African-American  		or European decent, Korean and Mexican-Americans appear more likely to consider  		family members, rather than the patient alone, as holding the decision making  		power regarding life-support. In Asian cultures, family-based medical decisions  		are a function of an orientation towards the extended family, rather than the  		patients self-interest.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note155">155</a></font></sup> Illness is considered a family  		event rather than an individual occurrence.</p>
<p>An additional factor associated with less AD use among persons in  		minority groups may include poor communication between White health care  		providers and racial/ethnic minority patients for whom English is a second  		language.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note151">151</a></font></sup> However,  		there is little evidence of racial/ethnic differences in satisfaction with or  		expectations about ACP.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note21">21</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note156">156</a></font></sup></p>
<p>4. <b>Role of patient/provider communication in advance directive  		use</b>. Many see ADs as a mechanism to help physicians and patients begin to  		talk about end-of-life care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note10">10</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note157">157</a></font></sup> However, discussion about ADs requires  		an emphasis on anticipatory planning and communication research reveals that  		physicians typically spend little time (less than one minute out of a 20 minute  		visit) discussing treatment and planning.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note158">158</a></font></sup> Although initiation of ACP is viewed as  		the responsibility of the physician, conveying prognosis and treatment  		information is widely regarded as a difficult task for health care providers.  		Breaking bad news is difficult for many physicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note159">159</a></font></sup></p>
<p>How clinicians talk with patients about end-of-life care does matter.  		Fried et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note160">160</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note161">161</a></font></sup> identified three major informational  		influences on patient decision making concerning treatment preferences:  		treatment burden, treatment outcome, and the likelihood of the outcome  		(recognizing that patients valuations of outcomes may change over time).  		For some patients, treatment burden would be bearable if the treatment outcome  		was desirable, but patients were less willing to endure perceived burden for  		marginal outcomes. Certain outcomes were so unacceptable that they determined  		preferences regardless of burden. However, some participants responses  		revealed that their willingness to tolerate adverse outcomes may increase as  		their illness progresses. A number of studies have found that older patients  		are more interested in discussing the outcomes of serious illnesses  		(specifically how various illness and treatments might affect their valued life  		activities) than specifying desired medical interventions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note162">162</a></font></sup> These findings suggest that  		patient-centered approaches to end-of-life planning should incorporate  		consideration of both treatment burdens and treatment outcomes, including the  		likelihood of these outcomes.</p>
<p>Barriers to physician-initiated AD discussions and referral to  		palliative or hospice care include clinicians reluctance to discuss these  		matters because they are uncomfortable or lack familiarity with suitable  		alternatives to aggressive treatment, lack of time for these discussions,  		belief that patients and families do not want such discussions, association of  		palliative care or hospice with death, and the belief that ADs and ACP  		discussions are not needed.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note16">16</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note163">163</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note164">164</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note165">165</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note166">166</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note167">167</a></font></sup></p>

<p>Moreover, as noted above in <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#sectionVI.A.3">Section VI.A.3</a>,  		not all patients want to entertain ACP discussions.

They found disparate views among respondents  		about the optimal timing, substance, and context for these discussions.  		Patients and families identified five elements as essential for these  		discussions: </p>

<li>
<p>Negotiating who should be present during the discussion.</p>

In addition, patients and families recall only a  		fraction of the information physicians transmit, and the evidence suggests that  		some patients do not desire detailed information.<sup><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note187">187</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note188">188</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note189">189</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note190">190</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note191">191</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note192">192</a></sup></p>
<p>5. <b>Stability of and proxy understanding of patient preferences</b>.  		In order for ADs to direct medical care according to patients desires,  		the preferences contained in these documents must reflect patients  		wishes. Because ADs are static documents, the stability of patient preferences  		concerning end-of-life care is important. Several studies have demonstrated  		modest stability in preferences over periods of up to two years.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note23">23</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note183">183</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note193">193</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note194">194</a></font></sup> Other studies found that patients  		preferences changed enough during the progression of an illness that ongoing  		discussion and updating of preferences was needed.<sup><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note195">195</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note196">196</a></sup> The manner in which  		treatment information is presented can influence patient decision making, so  		discussion factors may affect the stability of preferences.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note197">197</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note198">198</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note199">199</a></font></sup> Moreover, research suggests that  		changes in patient preferences are associated with specific illness events,  		disease progression, and patient characteristics as well as end-of-life  		discussions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note23">23</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note88">88</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note200">200</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note201">201</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note202">202</a></font></sup></p>
<p>McParland et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note195">195</a></font></sup> examined stability of patient preferences  		over time for nursing home residents and found that preferences regarding CPR  		and parenteral and enteral nutrition changed over both 12 and 24 month  		follow-up, but only degree of change in cognitive status proved to be  		predictive of these changes. Ditto et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note64">64</a></font></sup> longitudinally examined stability of patient  		preferences for life-sustaining treatments in a sample of hospitalized elders  		and found that treatment preferences showed a significant hospitalization  		dip. Respondents reported less desire to receive life-sustaining  		treatments at the recovery interview than they did at the annual interview  		conducted before hospitalization. However, the desire for life-sustaining  		treatment returned to near pre-hospitalization levels at the annual interview  		conducted several months after hospitalization. This dip was more pronounced in  		preferences for CPR and artificial nutrition and hydration than in preferences  		for less invasive treatments, suggesting that preferences for life-sustaining  		treatment are dependent on the context in which they are made -- individuals  		may express different treatment preferences when they are healthy than when  		they are ill.</p>
<p>The accuracy with which proxy decision makers can predict patient  		end-of-life treatment preferences has been shown to vary  		considerably.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note44">44</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note63">63</a></font></sup> However, much of this research has used  		hypothetical scenarios of future health care decision making versus rigorous  		investigations of actual practice.</p>
<p>Although ADs do not necessarily depend on a proxys ability to know  		patient preferences, part of the goal of ADs and ACP in general is for  		surrogates to better understand how patient goals and preferences would guide  		medical decision making toward the end of life. However, observational studies  		suggest that families rarely reliably know enough about illnesses and  		treatments to make informed decisions, and find it hard to  		imagine ahead to anticipate how patient preferences might change  		over time. Shalowitz et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note203">203</a></font></sup> reviewed 16 studies examining  		patient/proxy correspondence in terminally ill patients, hospital outpatients,  		and community-dwelling chronically ill elders. They found that  		patient-designated proxies and next-of-kin surrogates correctly predicted  		patients end-of-life treatment preferences in two-thirds of cases (68%  		accuracy). Proxies were most accurate in predicting preferences in the context  		of the patients current health (versus hypothetical scenarios);  		predictions were least accurate for patients with dementia or stroke. When  		proxies erred in predicting patients preferences, they tended to provide  		interventions that the patient did not want,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note204">204</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note205">205</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note206">206</a></font></sup> although this was not consistent across  		all studies.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note207">207</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note208">208</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note209">209</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note210">210</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note211">211</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note212">212</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note213">213</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note214">214</a></font></sup> There was no difference in accuracy in  		studies comparing patient-designated proxies with legally-assigned proxies.  		Four studies found that proxies predict patients preferences more  		accurately than do physicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note206">206</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note207">207</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note211">211</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note212">212</a></font></sup> Two studies assessed whether discussion of  		patients treatment preferences improved proxy accuracy and found  		conflicting results.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note63">63</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note215">215</a></font></sup></p>
<p>6. <b>Barriers to advance directive completion</b>. Although older  		adults and those with serious illnesses seem willing to participate in  		end-of-life planning,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note166">166</a></font></sup> a significant proportion of patients do  		not fully understand their options concerning end-of-life care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note216">216</a></font></sup> Knowledge of ADs alone does  		not increase their use, and a majority of patients who are aware of ADs do not  		complete a document.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note217">217</a></font></sup> A wide variety of obstacles impede ACP  		and AD completion,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note85">85</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note218">218</a></font></sup> including the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Inadequate knowledge about ADs and how to complete one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perception that ADs are difficult to execute.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note219">219</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perception that even if completed, AD statements will not be  			 followed by clinicians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reluctance to broach the issue of death and end-of-life  			 planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View that an AD is unnecessary because ones family or provider  			 will know what to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perception that ADs are important for others, but not for  			 themselves.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>An additional barrier to AD completion appears to be the inflexibility  		of the documents. While many patients would welcome discussions about  		end-of-life planning with their clinicians, they would prefer to delegate  		decision making authority to proxies rather than make rigid decisions now for  		complex decision making in the future.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note65">65</a></font></sup> Others are willing to state a preference in  		an AD, but are willing to let a proxy overrule that decision at a future  		time.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionVI.B" id="sectionVI.B">B. Interventions to Increase  		Advance Directives and Advance Care Planning</a></h3>
<p>Efforts to increase AD completion have primarily been patient and/or  		provider educational interventions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> Early consumer education interventions  		included studies assessing how AD completion was affected by providing written  		AD materials alone, written AD materials with single educational sessions, or  		AD materials and/or educational sessions with limited provider guidance or  		follow-up. Lorenz et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup> conducted a systematic review of the  		literature (1990-2004) to assess the evidence concerning interventions to  		improve palliative and end-of-life care, including AD interventions. Simple,  		single-component consumer education interventions designed to increase  		knowledge of, or completion of, ADs were mostly unsuccessful, or were only  		modestly successful. Single-component interventions tended to result in low AD  		completion rates, especially for interventions without an educational component  		or for mailed forms alone.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note77">77</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note220">220</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note221">221</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note222">222</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note223">223</a></font></sup> Furthermore,  		few of these educational interventions were shown to decrease the use of  		life-sustaining treatments. Studies of more structured and/or  		facilitated end-of-life planning interventions with healthy,  		chronically ill, and seriously ill ambulatory geriatric patients and their  		caregivers demonstrated more promising, though modest, results.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note224">224</a></font></sup>  		Interventions were more successful when severely ill patients were targeted and  		when multi-component, longitudinal approaches were used -- that is,  		interventions using educational materials combined with repeated treatment  		preference discussions during clinical encounters over time and with enhanced  		accessibility of the documentation of patient wishes, when needed. Only  		multi-faceted interventions (e.g., education in combination with reminders and  		performance feedback) increased the frequency of physician-initiated AD  		discussions with patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note225">225</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Guo and Harstall<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note226">226</a></font></sup> conducted a systematic review of the  		literature (1994-2001) on AD consumer education interventions and found similar  		results: modest increases in completed ADs using simple interventions (e.g.,  		written materials alone, materials with educational videotapes, and  		physician-initiated discussions) while more comprehensive interventions (e.g.,  		an education session plus telephone reminder or an interactive seminar) yielded  		higher AD completion rates of 30-40%. A comprehensive and complex education  		intervention, the <i>Let Me Decide</i> program that incorporated a  		multi-faceted educational approach, increased completion rates by 45%. In this  		intervention, hospital and nursing home staff and nursing home residents and  		their families were educated about ADs, and documents were offered in the  		context of a specific intervention designed to elicit preferences. </p>
<p>Interventions to improve provider communication skills have had mixed  		results. Some show little effect, while other interventions have increased  		participants knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to end-of-life  		care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note227">227</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note228">228</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note229">229</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note230">230</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note231">231</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note232">232</a></font></sup> One study of fellows completing a  		geriatric medicine rotation focused on end-of-life care found increased  		physician-reported preparation for care for dying patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note233">233</a></font></sup> Song<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note234">234</a></font></sup> and Walsh et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note235">235</a></font></sup> reviewed the literature on breaking  		bad news and AD discussion delivery methods with healthy and ill elderly,  		including the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and  		Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT), and found that end-of-life discussions  		contributed to increased patient satisfaction with patient/provider  		communication. They found no evidence of negative psychological adjustment or  		affective outcomes from these discussions. A controlled trial of preference  		elicitation and AD completion with patients awaiting cardiac surgery did not  		find increased anxiety among patients or family members but did find increased  		congruence between patients and their families concerning  		preferences.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note236">236</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In the nursing home setting, several interventions to improve care at  		the end of life have used trained facilitators (e.g., non-physicians, nurses,  		or social workers) and structured AD discussion guides to improve concordance  		between nursing home residents stated preferences and the care received.  		More detailed and meaningful ADs in nursing homes were achieved with more and  		focused discussion.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note103">103</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note109">109</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note237">237</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note238">238</a></font></sup> In a randomized controlled trial conducted  		in six nursing homes from 1994-1998, 1,292 residents were evaluated for  		utilization and satisfaction with health care over 18 months. Forty-nine  		percent of residents in intervention nursing homes and 78% of families of  		incompetent residents completed ADs. Satisfaction was not significantly  		different in intervention and control nursing homes, but intervention nursing  		homes reported fewer hospitalizations per resident (mean, 0.27 vs. 0.48;  		p=0.001) and less resource use (average total cost per patient) than control  		nursing homes. Mortality was similar between intervention and control nursing  		homes (24% vs. 28%, p=0.20).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note239">239</a></font></sup></p>

</ul><p>An interesting AD intervention tested the use of five educational  		booklets designed to improve end-of-life knowledge, attitudes, and practices in  		a multi-ethnic sample of family caregivers of well, homebound, and  		institutionalized elders.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note249">249</a></font></sup> At the three-month follow-up, there were  		small improvements in AD completion rates and significant increases in  		proportions of caregivers with funeral or burial plans and willingness to  		consider hospice. Schwartz et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note224">224</a></font></sup> evaluated the Respecting Choices AD  		program, in which nurses and social workers facilitated AD discussions with  		patients and caregivers. They found greater congruence in caregivers  		understanding of patients preferences, less willingness to undergo  		life-sustaining treatment for a new serious medical problem, but more  		willingness to receive such treatments for an incurable progressive disease in  		the intervention groups relative to the control groups. Shorr et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note222">222</a></font></sup> evaluated whether  		administrative prompts or mandatory educational interventions increased  		documentation of physician-initiated end-of-life discussions with seriously ill  		patients. They found no difference between baseline and three-year follow-up in  		ACP discussions (35% at baseline and 34% at follow-up) or DNR orders (29%  		baseline vs. 27% follow-up). Overall, the research indicates that  		multi-component, longitudinal educational interventions modestly increase AD  		completion rate and moderately increase medical record documentation, but more  		sophisticated techniques are needed to motivate physicians and patients to  		initiate ACP discussions and to induce patients to complete an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<p>More intensive and community-wide interventions that involve  		collaborative ACP mechanisms have demonstrated more positive results.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note63">63</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note166">166</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note242">242</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note250">250</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note251">251</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note252">252</a></font></sup> For example,  		Hammes and Rooney<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note242">242</a></font></sup>  		conducted a retrospective study of all adult decedents residing in a defined  		geographic area who died while under the care of health care organizations  		participating in a comprehensive, systematic community-wide AD education  		program (<i>Respecting Your Choices</i>). They found that the prevalence of ADs  		increased from 15% to 85% during the intervention and that the median time  		between AD documentation and death was 1.2 years. Almost all ADs requested that  		treatment be forgone as death neared, and treatment followed these instructions  		in nearly all cases (see also <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#sectionVI.D.2.b">Section VI.D.2.b</a>).  		A modified version of this model was pilot tested on a small sample of  		chronically ill adults (congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and  		preoperative open-heart surgery patients) and their caregivers using quality  		improvement techniques. The intervention significantly increased congruence in  		decision making between patients and caregivers for future medical  		treatment.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note250">250</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note251">251</a></font></sup> In addition, the intervention group  		demonstrated greater satisfaction with the decision making process and less  		conflict about decisions.</p>
<p>Other palliative care-related interventions incorporating end-of-life  		planning have shown that home-based ACP for chronically ill patients was able  		to decrease aggressive treatment and that more patients died at home.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note253">253</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note254">254</a></font></sup>  		For example, Stuart et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note254">254</a></font></sup> implemented the CHOICES ACP and palliative  		care program and demonstrated that intervention patients had increased hospice  		length of stay, spent less time in a hospital, and more often died at home. In  		an implementation of structured models of decision making (e.g.,  		Physicians Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)) designed to  		travel across treatment settings to ensure continuity of care, orders regarding  		CPR in nursing homes were universally followed and were honored across  		settings. Residents with a POLST received more comfort care and were rarely  		transferred to a hospital for life-sustaining treatments (see also  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#sectionVI.D.3.a">Section VI.D.3.a</a>).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note132">132</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note255">255</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note256">256</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note257">257</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>C. Advance Directives and Advance Care Planning Among  		Disabled Persons</h3>
<p>ACP is founded on the ideals of self-determination, respect for  		individuals, and attention to compassion and palliation, so one might expect  		that ADs and ACP would be embraced by the disability rights community. Indeed,  		the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities  		(formally the American Association on Mental Retardation) in its Position  		Statement on Caring at the End of Life, lists dignity, autonomy, life, and  		equality as among its core principles.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note258">258</a></font></sup> This position statement endorses ACP and  		use of ADs. However, there has been considerable friction between the  		disability community and those advocating for improved end-of-life care and  		policies. </p>
<p>Disability advocates have tended to feel disenfranchised from  		development of ACP policy. There is a strong undercurrent of opposition to  		policies promulgated by end-of-life care advocates.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note66">66</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note259">259</a></font></sup>  		Asch suggests that this conflict arises because the disability community has  		focused on different sorts of cases then have end-of-life activists and because  		health care providers and those who champion ACP have different views from  		disabled individuals concerning how illness and disability affect quality of  		life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Disability rights activists have raised concerns that ADs and withdrawal  		of life-sustaining care, when combined with biased and inaccurate views of  		patients quality of life, encourage less aggressive care and withdrawal  		of life-sustaining treatment, permitting persons with disability to die earlier  		then warranted.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note258">258</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note260">260</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note261">261</a></font></sup> Many  		factors contribute to these concerns, including the history of social and  		economic persecution of persons with disability,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note262">262</a></font></sup> lack of attention to improving the  		conditions or accommodating persons with disabilities so that they can maximize  		their quality of life<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note263">263</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note264">264</a></font></sup> and explicit and implicit coercion of  		disabled individuals.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note263">263</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note265">265</a></font></sup> Then there is the paradox that many  		people in the general population view the situations in which some disabled  		persons routinely live as states worse then death that they would  		not use life-sustaining treatment to achieve or preserve.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note266">266</a></font></sup> Some in the disability  		community view as unacceptable certain diagnoses given to extremely compromised  		health states (e.g. the persistent vegetative state and the minimally conscious  		state) and find it unacceptable for clinicians to withhold or withdraw  		life-sustaining treatment from persons in such states.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note258">258</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note267">267</a></font></sup> Others argue  		that the legal mechanisms of decision making inadequately account for the views  		of disabled persons.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note268">268</a></font></sup> The disability community also raises the  		issue of whether biases concerning quality of life translate into reduced  		clinician effort to maximize patients quality of life, which in a  		self-fulfilling manner yields patients accepting less aggressive  		care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There is no uniform definition of disability. According to the Americans  		with Disabilities Act (ADA), a person with a disability has a physical or  		mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,  		has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an  		impairment. Major life activities include seeing, hearing, speaking,  		walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, learning, caring for oneself, or  		working. Examples of disability so defined include individuals with epilepsy,  		paralysis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, substantial hearing or  		visual impairment, mental retardation, or a specific learning  		disability.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note269">269</a></font></sup> Based  		on this definition, one in every five persons in the United States -- more than  		50 million people -- has a disabling condition that interferes with life  		activities. About 19% of non-institutionalized United States civilians have a  		disability, and almost half of these people have a severe disability.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note270">270</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The ADA definition is broad. However, the focus of disability advocacy  		has been patients with developmental disabilities -- both intellectual and  		physical -- as well as psychiatric disabilities and acquired disability not due  		to aging-related illness. Older patients with chronic disease who have  		compromised physical and mental function have received less emphasis from the  		disability community. Thus, concerns about the failings of ACP and ADs among  		disabled persons have little relevance to treatment of older patients,  		particularly those with age-related cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>In this section, we summarize the peer-reviewed literature relevant to  		patients with developmental and early-acquired intellectual, physical, and  		psychiatric disabilities. Our purpose is to understand: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The views of disabled patients regarding ACP and ADs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preferences of disabled persons for treatments in current and  			 future adverse health states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disabled persons use of ACP and ADs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ways in which decisions are made for disabled persons toward the  			 end of life.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As we will discuss below, there is little research about ACP and AD  		among disabled persons. Where research does exist, it is often restricted to  		individuals who have <i>intellectual (usually developmental) disabilities</i>,  		individuals with <i>psychiatric disability</i>, and those with <i>physical  		disability</i>; studies of this last group often include cognitively impaired  		persons toward the end of life. We organize our discussion around these  		groups.</p>
<p>1. <b>Advance care planning and advance directive completion among  		disabled persons</b>.</p>
<p>a. <i>Intellectually disabled persons.</i> Overall, individuals with  		intellectual disabilities die at an earlier age than their counterparts in the  		general population. However, many live as long as their peers, and disabled  		individuals and the general population die of a similar spectrum of causes,  		namely cardiovascular, respiratory and neoplastic diseases.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note271">271</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note272">272</a></font></sup>  		The need for ADs and ACP among intellectually disabled adults has been  		recognized for over a decade.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note273">273</a></font></sup> However, we found only two empirical  		studies of ACP or AD use by persons with intellectual disability. In a  		residential center caring for 850 persons with severe developmental  		disabilities, two (0.2%) had completed an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note274">274</a></font></sup> This study did not report whether any ACP  		discussion had occurred with residents or their families. In a second study,  		physicians caring for institutionalized intellectually disabled persons in the  		Netherlands found that among the 67 patients for whom an end-of-life decision  		was made in 1995, the end-of-life decision was discussed with only two of  		them.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note275">275</a></font></sup> This study  		did not report whether any patient had completed an AD. A review of end-of-life  		care for people with intellectual disabilities suggested that issues about  		end-of-life care were raised infrequently and that there were substantial  		obstacles to integrating discussions about end-of-life care with other  		services.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note276">276</a></font></sup></p>
<p>For some intellectually disabled persons, a substituted judgment is  		impossible because they were never able to form or express preferences.  		However, for most of these individuals, there is an untapped potential to make  		end-of-life decisions. A diagnosis of cognitive impairment does not necessarily  		mean that a person is unable to participate in treatment decisions. A study of  		90 adults that included 30 with mild intellectual disabilities and 30 with  		moderate intellectual disabilities formally evaluated capability to make an  		informed medical decision.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note277">277</a></font></sup> Most adults with no or mild disability and  		almost half of the adults with moderate disability were able to make and  		justify treatment choices and at least partially understand treatment  		information. Most adults without intellectual disability, 50% with mild, and  		18% with moderate disability were able to partially appreciate relevance of  		treatment choice to their situation and to weigh treatment risks and benefits.  		Performance in all groups decreased with increasing complexity of decision  		making.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note278">278</a></font></sup> Another  		small study that focused on older patients with dementia suggests that  		individuals who had cognitive impairment and were incapable of completing ADs  		were significantly more likely to opt for life-sustaining  		interventions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note279">279</a></font></sup></p>
<p>b. <i>Psychiatrically disabled persons</i>. Whether patients with mental  		illness have the ability to complete ADs is of concern to patients, families  		and providers. Measurement tools exist to formally evaluate capacity to  		complete an AD, although it is not suggested by experts that these tools be  		used routinely.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note280">280</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note281">281</a></font></sup> Several studies of persons with serious  		mental illness suggest that a substantial number of these individuals are  		capable of completing ADs.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note282">282</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note283">283</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note284">284</a></font></sup> One study  		shows that facilitated discussion increased the ability of persons with  		psychiatric illness who have borderline capacity to complete an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note285">285</a></font></sup></p>
<p>We identified three studies of ACP and ADs for medical care in patients  		with chronic psychiatric disease affecting function. These studies found that  		such patients are generally predisposed to complete ADs and that many are able  		to do so. A structured interview study of 142 persons in a community  		convenience sample who met state criteria for serious and persistent mental  		illness found that 72% believed a proxy should be designated and 62% were able  		to choose a proxy to make decisions;<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note286">286</a></font></sup> for 23% of the patients, their proxy would  		be a health care worker, which would pose difficulty for completing a durable  		power attorney for health care. Eighteen percent of respondents in this study  		had selected another person to be their proxy, but it was not reported how many  		codified this decision in an AD. Twenty-seven percent of persons had existing  		preferences concerning medical treatment, 5% had discussed these with a  		physician, and 2% had written them down. Most patients were comfortable with  		the ACP interview, and interviewers rated nearly all patients as able to  		understand the topic.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note286">286</a></font></sup> An evaluation of 18 male veterans on a  		chronic care psychiatric inpatient unit found that 83% had the capacity to  		complete an AD (measured by an informal psychiatric assessment); of the 15  		patients with capacity, 80% had completed an AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note284">284</a></font></sup> An evaluation of 161 inpatients at a state  		psychiatric facility found that 44% had full guardians and were ineligible to  		complete ADs. Of the remaining 90 patients, only 16 (10% of the full  		population) were deemed sufficiently competent to execute a health care proxy  		and had done so.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note287">287</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Analogous to ADs for medical care, ADs for psychiatric care aim to  		identify preferences concerning psychiatric care and delineate a proxy to make  		such decisions. There has been more study of these documents than of medical  		ADs among psychiatric patients, but the evaluations show similar findings: few  		persons with psychiatric disease have them, but most would like to complete  		one. A survey study of 1,011 psychiatric outpatients in five United States  		cities found that more than 13% had completed a psychiatric AD; however, 77%  		wanted to complete one if given assistance.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note283">283</a></font></sup> A study of 303 adults with serious  		persistent mental illnesses who were receiving community mental health services  		found that 53% expressed interest in completing a psychiatric AD.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note288">288</a></font></sup> An intervention study that  		facilitated completion of psychiatric ADs for 106 community-dwelling mental  		health center outpatients found that most of the preferences had clinical  		utility and 46% appointed a surrogate decision maker.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note289">289</a></font></sup> A randomized clinical trial of 469  		patients with severe mental illness found that a semi-structured interview and  		guided discussion commonly led to completion of a psychiatric AD (61% vs. 3% in  		the control group).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note290">290</a></font></sup>  		Evaluation of the outcome of psychiatric ADs suggests little effect on care  		received.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note291">291</a></font></sup></p>
<p>c. <i>Physically disabled persons</i>. Many studies have described ACP  		and AD use among patients with a variety of physically disabling conditions.  		However, all of the studies focused on patients with acquired disabilities, and  		most had chronic conditions, many toward the end of life. There are important  		distinctions between those who acquire disability early in life relative to  		those who acquire disability as a result of the aging process. The studies that  		address disability acquired late in life are described primarily in other  		sections of this review. For many areas of physical disabilities, such as  		hearing and vision impairment, there is recognition of need for attention to  		ACP and ADs,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note292">292</a></font></sup> but we  		could find no data on use of these modalities or preferences for care among  		these patients.</p>
<p>2. <b>Preferences among persons with disabilities</b>.</p>
<p>a. <i>Intellectually disabled persons</i>. We were unable to find any  		studies of the preferences of individuals with intellectual disabilities  		regarding their end-of-life care. One study of 60 individuals with severe  		mental retardation and complex medical problems, age 2-32 years, in a pediatric  		nursing facility in Massachusetts evaluated an intervention implemented in 1991  		to involve <i>families</i> in making resuscitation decisions for these  		individuals. After an institutional policy change whereby all parents and/or  		guardians were requested to specify formally in writing whether they wished CPR  		for their children in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest, families were  		informed of the policy change and provided information about CPR, informed that  		CPR would be initiated by default in the absence of a DNR order, instructed  		that they had the right to refuse treatment, including CPR. Additional  		information on life-sustaining treatment was included as well as the  		opportunity to discuss the issue with clinicians. No patient was capable of  		participating. From a baseline of 18% of patients with DNR orders before the  		intervention, 43% had DNR orders after the intervention.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note293">293</a></font></sup></p>
<p>b. <i>Psychiatrically disabled persons</i>. The interview evaluation of  		142 persons in a community convenience sample who met state criteria for  		serious and persistent mental illness also asked about preferences for  		end-of-life care by presenting two scenarios: (1) if the person had incurable  		metastatic cancer with pain, would s/he want increased pain medication even if  		it resulted in confusion or inability to communicate? (2) if the person had  		total paralysis with irreparable brain damage, would s/he desire continuation  		of life-sustaining treatment?<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note286">286</a></font></sup> Twenty percent of participants reacted  		negatively to at least some component of the interview, although none seriously  		and 4% did not complete it. In response to the first scenario, 66% said they  		would want a physician to administer as much analgesic as needed even if it  		meant cognitive suppression. Concerning the second scenario, 28% felt that  		life-sustaining treatment should be stopped immediately, 43% indicated that it  		should be stopped within a defined period of time (7-30 days), and 28% felt  		that it should be continued indefinitely. Many respondents in the latter two  		categories indicated hope for a miracle.</p>
<p>Analogous to the concern that psychiatrically disabled persons are  		incapable of completing ADs, there is also concern that patients with mood  		disorders might make life-sustaining treatment choices that they might not make  		if unaffected by psychiatric disease. One study of this issue in 43 older  		patients suffering from major depression interviewed them on admission to a  		psychiatric inpatient unit and at discharge about their desire for specific  		medical therapies in their current state of health and in two hypothetical  		scenarios of medical illness. Twenty-four of the individuals were in remission  		from depression at the time of discharge. In the majority of patients,  		remission of depression did not result in an increase in desire for  		life-sustaining treatment. However, a clinically evident increase in desire for  		life-sustaining treatment followed treatment of depression in the 26% of  		subjects who had been initially rated as more severely depressed, more  		hopeless, and more likely to overestimate the risks and to underestimate the  		benefits of treatment. The authors concluded that in major depression of mild  		to moderate severity, a patient's desire to forgo life-sustaining treatment is  		unlikely to be altered by depression treatment. But severely depressed patients  		who are hopeless overestimate the risks of treatment, or underestimate the  		benefits of treatment and should be encouraged to defer specifying preferences  		concerning life-sustaining treatment until after treatment of their  		depression.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note294">294</a></font></sup></p>
<p>c. <i>Physically disabled persons. </i>As noted above, a large number of  		studies have evaluated preferences among persons with physical disabilities,  		mostly related to late-life acquired disability. Most of these studies  		characterize the views of persons progressive chronic diseases most often  		associated with aging, such as cardiopulmonary disease, HIV, cancer and renal  		failure. We were unable to find any quantitative evaluation of preferences  		among patients with developmental physical disabilities or younger patients  		with disabling conditions. However, two small qualitative studies -- both  		focused mainly on physician assisted suicide -- evaluated the views of  		convenience samples of physically disabled individuals about end-of-life care.  		The first was an interview evaluation of 45 individuals that found that concern  		for autonomy and self-determination was a central theme for these  		individuals.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note295">295</a></font></sup> The  		qualitative analysis revealed many study participants stressed the  		importance of autonomy in end-of-life decisions, stating that life-and-death  		decisions should not be in the hands of doctors, family members, HMOs and other  		bureaucratic bodies. Many shared the experiences of friends and loved ones who  		they said "suffered needlessly" -- whether disabled or not -- when aggressive  		treatments for a terminal illness had prolonged pain and suffering. These  		participants were also concerned that disabled persons were devalued in society  		and there was widespread worry, for example, that doctors, HMOs, and  		others may hasten death because the lives of people with disabilities are not  		considered worthy or valuable. The second study was a qualitative  		evaluation of the responses of 55 physically disabled individuals to an on-line  		open-ended question about vulnerability to coercion and ability to make their  		own decisions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note266">266</a></font></sup>  		There were a variety of views with most respondents believing that they could  		make voluntary decisions and wanted the uncontested ability to do so. Yet, the  		potential to be influenced by social pressures came through in many of the  		responses, for example: I feel there is potential for the most vulnerable  		to feel less worthy. This is a function of a society that values beauty and  		health not wheelchairs and deformities.</p>
<p>The lack of adequate valuation of disabled persons by health care  		providers and a major chasm between how clinicians and disabled persons see the  		world was also a major theme of the findings from a qualitative evaluation of  		13 parents of children with mixed developmental disabilities, nine adults with  		physical disabilities and eight family members.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note296">296</a></font></sup> This analysis -- which did not consider  		end-of-life care -- suggested that health care must attempt to understand  		health perceptions from the vantage of the disabled person including obstacles  		and goals in order to optimally provide care.</p>
<p>3. <b>End-of-life care for persons with disabilities</b>. This section  		considers care for patients with intellectual, physical and psychiatric  		disabilities, but it does not summarize care toward the end of life for  		patients with conditions typically associated with aging, including  		dementia.</p>
<p>a. <i>Intellectually disabled persons</i>. We were able to identify only  		two studies that evaluated the care provided to intellectually disabled persons  		at the end of life. In the above noted residential care facility caring for 850  		persons with severe developmental disability, there were 38 deaths during the  		2½ year study. For ten of these decedents (26%), an explicit end-of-life  		decision was made. During that same study period, the institution made 16  		end-of-life decisions: 12 were decisions that the resident should not be  		resuscitated and four were decisions that the resident should continue to  		receive full medical treatment. In 11 of these cases, the referral for an  		end-of-life decision was made by the persons parent or other relative.  		Among the 12 patients for whom a DNR decision was made, seven died within one  		week and two more within the year.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note274">274</a></font></sup> In the survey of physicians in the  		Netherlands, 89 doctors reported 222 deaths for 1995. An end-of-life decision  		was made in 97 cases (44%).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note275">275</a></font></sup></p>
<p>b. <i>Psychiatrically disabled persons</i>. A retrospective medical  		record evaluation of 191 geriatric psychiatric inpatients with major depressive  		disorder or bipolar disorder found that 48% had orders to forgo resuscitation  		and 12% wanted CPR only (no ventilation). Patients with suicidal ideation were  		significantly less likely to choose CPR. Patients with bipolar disorder and  		patients under age 70 were more likely to choose CPR.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note297">297</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>D. Interventions to Improve Advance Directive  		Completion/Advance Care Planning: Health Information Technology, Social  		Marketing, and Legislation/Policy</h3>
<p>As noted above, ADs are completed by only a fraction of the adult  		population; completed ADs may be unavailable when needed clinically; and even  		when available, ADs may not be followed by providers. Increasing the use and  		effectiveness of ADs -- both with the public and with providers -- requires  		widespread behavioral change that motivates both communities to act. In this  		section, we discuss three different mechanisms of inducing behavioral change.  		The topics addressed here include the use of HIT to increase the completion of  		ADs as well as their application in a patients care, the role of social  		marketing to increase the perceived importance of and execution of ADs, and the  		role that legal intervention and policy change may have in improving AD  		completion implementation.</p>
<p>1. <b>Health information technology</b>. Although health care providers  		are thought to be the best catalyst to promote the completion of ADs,  		clinicians do not routinely bring up the discussion during the course of a  		routine visit or even during an acute event. Even when completed, ADs do not  		always have the anticipated clinical impact. According to a study conducted by  		Morrison and colleagues,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note298">298</a></font></sup> among those who had previously executed  		ADs, only 26% had their directives recognized when they were hospitalized.</p>
<p>Information technology is widely used in many industries to create  		efficiencies and produce better quality products. HIT holds promise to improve  		the quality of care and the efficiency with which it is provided.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note299">299</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note300">300</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note301">301</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note302">302</a></font></sup> HIT could  		facilitate completion and implementation of ADs. In this section, we briefly  		define the types of HIT and describe where and how it is currently being used.  		We then present available evidence on the efficacy of HIT in facilitating ACP  		and the completion/implementation of ADs.</p>
<p>a. <i>What is health information technology and how is it used? </i>HIT  		has been mostly confined to administrative information technology systems such  		as billing, scheduling, and inventory management.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note303">303</a></font></sup> Clinical HIT is less common. When we think  		of HIT, we mostly think of the electronic medical record (EMR). EMRs are  		generally commercially developed (although some notable EMR systems have been  		developed internally to the organization) and are implemented in a single  		provider entity (e.g., hospital, physicians office, clinic, etc.). An  		electronic health record (EHR) incorporates many different types of HIT and  		characterizes all of a patients care, not just that from a specific  		provider.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note304">304</a></font></sup> Chaudry  		and colleagues<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note299">299</a></font></sup>  		recently reviewed the literature evaluating the impact of HIT on quality,  		efficiency and costs of medical care. <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#table1">Table 1</a> lists the  		most commonly cited types of HIT examined in the literature and provides a  		brief description.</p>
<p>HIT investment in the United States is still relatively low, especially  		as compared to other countries, particularly Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway  		and the United Kingdom. The United States invests less than 50¢ per capita  		on HIT; the investment in these other countries ranges from almost $5 to about  		$192 per capita.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note309">309</a></font></sup> A  		2004 survey of United States provider organizations (both inpatient and  		ambulatory care) found that approximately 26% of hospitals and 13% of  		ambulatory providers have installed a basic EMR. Among hospitals, 10% have  		installed Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) and 28% installed Picture  		Archiving Communications Systems (PACS). Only about 5% of all hospitals have  		adopted a more comprehensive system that includes all three components  		(EMR+CPOE+PACS). HIT adoption is greater among hospitals or provider groups  		affiliated with an HMO or a preferred provider organization; approximately 38%  		of HMO-affiliated hospitals adopted a basic EMR as compared to 29% of hospitals  		without managed care affiliations or investments.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note303">303</a></font></sup> These numbers may overstate HIT uptake due  		to a bias in the survey sampling toward larger hospitals.</p>
<p>Notable HIT users are the Veterans Health Administration, Kaiser  		Permanente, Regenstrief, Brigham and Womens Hospital, LDS  		Hospital/Intermountain Health Care, and Partners Health Care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note299">299</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note300">300</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note302">302</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note308">308</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note310">310</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note311">311</a></font></sup> In most cases,  		HIT systems are integrated across ambulatory and inpatient settings. HIT is  		stimulated by a variety of factors, including governmental initiatives such as  		the HHS Health Information Technology Initiative.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note312">312</a></font></sup> Although current use of HIT is relatively  		low, HIT uptake has increased rapidly starting in 2001. It is not clear whether  		the accelerating trend will continue, but this trend does suggest that many  		more providers will come on-line with at least some elements of HIT in the  		coming years.</p>
<p>One of the challenges in developing an EHR is agreeing on and  		integrating the specific elements of the HIT systems of multiple providers. The  		ability to share information across providers with a uniform instrument  		reflecting ADs are two care components important to the appropriate and timely  		execution of an AD. As described earlier, even when ADs are completed, they are  		often not available during an acute care situation, where they may be most  		relevant. In many cases, they do not transfer with the patient or are difficult  		to find in the medical record. This is certainly true with paper medical  		records but it is also a concern in the context of HIT. Without standards for  		system development, information sharing across providers and settings is  		challenging.</p>

</tr></table><p>Several standards have been suggested to facilitate integrating HIT  		across providers and settings. These standards include those created by Health  		Level Seven (HL7), an American National Standards Institute-accredited  		standards developing organization. HL7 is relevant to this discussion because  		its specifications include a messaging standard that can allow for the exchange  		of key sets of clinical and administrative data. The model standards put forth  		by HL7 have received support from the industry and user communities and moves  		the United States closer to establishing nationwide guidelines for EHRs. </p>
<p>b. <i>Health information technology and health care outcomes.  		</i>Hundreds of studies have examined aspects of HIT. We identified a  		systematic review evaluating 257 studies published between 1995 and 2004 that  		describes how HIT affects quality of care, efficiency outcomes, and health care  		costs.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note299">299</a></font></sup> In addition,  		a recent study presents data to estimate the potential costs of adoption,  		safety benefits, and other potential health benefits of widespread HIT  		adoption.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note300">300</a></font></sup> We  		summarize these studies here. </p>
<p>Hillestad and colleagues<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note300">300</a></font></sup> developed a series of simulation models to  		estimate the potential costs of widespread HIT adoption as well as the  		potential cost savings assuming that interoperable and integrated EMR systems  		are widespread. Given this assumption, the study authors found that the  		cumulative cost for 90% of all hospitals to adopt an EMR system would be $98  		billion, assuming that 20% of hospitals currently have such a system (average  		yearly costs: $6.5 billion). The cost for physicians to reach 90% adoption was  		estimated to be $17.2 billion, equally split between one-time costs and  		maintenance costs (average yearly costs: $1.1 billion). Additionally, at 90%  		adoption, the potential HIT-related efficiency savings in both the inpatient  		and outpatient settings could average over $77 billion per year combined. The  		largest efficiency savings were estimated to come from reduced hospital lengths  		of stay, nurse administrative time, drug use in the hospital setting, and  		drug/radiology use in the outpatient setting.</p>
<p>The systematic review conducted by Chaudry and colleagues<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note299">299</a></font></sup> reports evidence of quality improvement  		due to increased adherence to guideline-based care, improvements in preventive  		care, and reductions in complications of inpatient care using computerized  		surveillance to identify high risk patients and trigger physician alerts.  		Medication errors were reduced through the introduction of CPOE. Notably absent  		in this review is any end-of-life application of EHR systems.</p>
<p>c. <i>Health information technology and advance directives/advance care  		planning. </i>For an AD to be useful in guiding a patients care, it must  		be easily accessible to health care providers. As noted above, HIT is capable  		of improving health care across a number of domains. The most successful  		interventions were those that involved physician reminders or CDSSs integrated  		into an EMR. HIT may also help to support the completion of ADs, improve the  		understanding of patient preferences across multiple providers, and increase  		the likelihood that they will be available when needed. Still, the evidence to  		support these benefits of HIT for ADs is very limited. In this section, we  		describe the existing research and then provide some discussion of what  		questions remain unanswered. </p>
<p>Two studies were identified that used computer-generated reminders to  		physicians to encourage them to discuss AD completion with their  		patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note220">220</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note313">313</a></font></sup> Dexter and colleagues<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note220">220</a></font></sup> tested the use of  		computer-generated reminders to physicians in the outpatient general medicine  		practice of a teaching hospital. In this study, physicians were randomized to:  		(1) receive reminders for instruction directives, which allow patients to  		indicate whether they want or do not want any of eight types of care (e.g.,  		CPR, mechanical ventilation, etc.); (2) receive reminders for proxy directives;  		(3) receive both reminders; or (4) receive no reminders. Physicians who  		received a reminder were provided a menu of response options: discussed  		today, next visit, not applicable, patient too ill, patient refuses to discuss,  		I agree with advance directives. An intention-to-treat analysis for 1,009  		patients who met study criteria and did not previously complete an AD found  		that 137 patients reported having a discussion with their provider during the  		study period. Approximately 24% of patients whose physician received both  		reminders had a discussion with their physician about ADs as compared to 4% of  		the patients whose physician received no reminders (p&lt;0.001). This equates  		to a nearly eight-fold increase in the odds of having an AD discussion. When  		discussions occurred, physicians initiated conversations about ADs 86% of the  		time when receiving both types of reminders, 77% of the time when receiving  		instruction directive reminders only, 43% of the time when receiving proxy  		directive reminders only, and 38% of the time when no reminders were provided.  		Approximately 15% of patients whose physician received both reminders completed  		an AD as compared to 7% (instruction directive reminder only), 3% (proxy  		directive reminder only), and 4% (no reminder). Overall, 45% of AD discussions  		were associated with a patient completing an AD.</p>
<p>A study by Pearlman and colleagues<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note313">313</a></font></sup> took place in Veterans Health  		Administration outpatient clinics among several provider specialties. The study  		involved a multi-faceted intervention that included, as one component, an  		appointment flag to remind the provider to discuss ACP during that appointment  		with the patient. The other components of the intervention included a booklet  		on ADs sent to the patient in advance of the patients next appointment  		with their provider, a postcard sent a week prior to their appointment  		reminding them to review the booklet, and a 30-minute appointment with a social  		worker immediately before their provider visit to answer questions about the  		booklet and/or complete the AD. Among the 248 patients enrolled in the study,  		intervention patients reported more ACP discussions with their providers than  		did control patients (64% vs. 38%, p&lt;0.001). ACP notes were found in 47% of  		the intervention patients charts as compared to 24% of the control group  		patients charts (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, living wills were verified in  		the medical record for 48% of the intervention patients and 23% of the control  		group patients (p&lt;0.001). In this study, it was not possible to determine  		how much provider cueing contributed to the success of the intervention.  		Neither of these studies evaluated clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition to the studies that involve computer-generated reminders to  		discuss ADs and ACP, one study was identified that examined the role that a  		computer-based system of reporting ADs played in improving the communication of  		a procedure-specific DNR order form.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note314">314</a></font></sup> This study, which took place in the ICU of  		a tertiary care hospital, compared concordance of understanding of  		patients DNR status among the attending physician, nurses, and/or  		residents across three study phases. In the first phase, DNR orders were  		reported on unstructured physician order sheets; in the second phase, DNR  		orders were reported on structured, procedure-specific DNR order forms; in the  		third phase, DNR orders were presented in a computer-based system that  		generated a DNR communication sheet. A total of 147 patients were enrolled in  		the study (40 in phase 1, 36 in phase 2, and 71 in phase 3). Concordance  		between the attending physician and residents averaged across three  		questionnaire items reflecting components of the DNR order was 44% in phase 1,  		70% in phase 2, and 81% in phase 3 (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, concordance between  		the attending physician and nurses was 40% in phase 1, 58% in phase 2, and 73%  		in phase 3 (p&lt;0.001). In addition to improved concordance, physicians were  		better able to detect errors in order entry using the computer-based system and  		subsequently correct them. </p>
<p>This intervention suggests that computer-based systems can improve the  		understanding across health care providers about DNR orders, which can increase  		the likelihood that care will be carried out in concordance with patient wishes  		and physician orders. However, this study is dependent on a computer-based  		form; more needs to be done to understand how the specific structure of the  		form used in this study influenced the study findings.</p>
<p>These studies demonstrate that HIT can increase the incidence of  		provider-initiated discussions of ADs through computer-generated reminders as  		well as have an effect on the completion and documentation of ADs in the  		electronic record. Computer-based systems may also improve cross-provider  		understanding of patient preferences. Still, there are many unanswered  		questions about how HIT influences ADs/ACP and where HIT investments should be  		made to improve ACP. Among the questions that remain unanswered is whether  		having an EHR/EMR improves accessibility of an AD (e.g., during an acute  		episode). AD accessibility is contingent on the type of HIT system developed  		and how well it is integrated across providers and settings. We also do not  		know if there is an optimal organization to the EHR/EMR that improves the  		identification of the directive in the record. It is also unclear whether  		having an AD in the EMR will influence clinical outcomes differently than  		current AD use. Finally, we have not identified any literature that addresses  		patient attitudes about having electronically-stored ADs and whether storage  		might serves as an impediment to AD completion. The growing number of AD  		electronic repositories (e.g., Choices Bank) suggests that some individuals are  		comfortable with having their ADs available in electronic format. However, we  		do not know if the prospect of having their AD stored electronically would be a  		barrier for those who have not completed an AD.</p>
<p>2. <b>The role of social marketing in advance directive/advance care  		planning promotion</b>. There are many ways to effect broad behavioral change.  		One might envision a continuum of responses to be applied depending on how  		resistant the target of the behavior change is to that change. These include  		providing education (for those more likely to behave as desired); changing  		practices by changing the environment, which includes improving technology; and  		implementing new laws/policies that induce behavior change (for those most  		resistant).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note315">315</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note316">316</a></font></sup> Many of the interventions to improve AD  		completion have focused on providing education to patients and/or providers.  		However, they have had limited effectiveness in part because these types of  		efforts are difficult to sustain long enough to see permanent behavioral change  		or because the population to whom they are targeted are particularly resistant  		to change.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup> As described in the previous section,  		improvements in technology may increase AD completion and implementation.  		Legislative and policy efforts (see <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#sectionVI.D.3">Section  		VI.D.3</a>) also can increase AD use and implementation by removing barriers to  		access and facilitating implementation. Social marketing intervenes at a  		different level.</p>
<p>a. <i>What is social marketing?</i> Social marketing is a less  		well-studied approach to AD promotion that has been proven successful in  		achieving widespread behavioral change with respect to other health issues.  		Social marketing rests somewhere between education and legislative/policy  		action along the continuum described above. In this section, we define social  		marketing and its components and present examples of its use to effect behavior  		change in health care and specifically to promote ADs.</p>
<p>A basic definition of social marketing is: the planning and  		implementation of programs designed to bring about social change using concepts  		from commercial marketing.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note317">317</a></font></sup> Important to this concept is that social  		marketing applies these concepts to influence the <i>voluntary</i> behavior of  		target audiences.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note318">318</a></font></sup>  		Behavior change may involve accepting a new behavior, rejecting a potential  		behavior, modifying a current behavior, or abandoning an old behavior. Drawing  		an example from efforts to reduce the incidence of birth defects, several  		different types of marketing messages might be promoted depending on the type  		of behavior change desired.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note315">315</a></font></sup> Birth defects or other poor birth outcomes  		may be the result of poor maternal nutrition, or drinking alcohol or smoking  		while pregnant. These are examples of behaviors that the mother may currently  		exhibit, might consider doing, or have never done.</p>
<p>The social marketing message would target a woman depending on her  		current behavior and encourage a different behavior, if necessary. For example,  		encouraging women to take a multi-vitamin with the recommended amount of folic  		acid is an example of a message that attempts to get pregnant women who have  		not been taking the recommended multi-vitamin to accept a new behavior.  		Refraining from drinking alcohol among women who currently do not drink  		(rejecting a potential behavior), drinking at least eight glasses of water a  		day (modifying a current behavior), and stopping smoking among women who  		currently smoke (abandoning an old behavior) are additional examples of  		different messages depending on the behavior change desired.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note315">315</a></font></sup> This example also  		demonstrates that many different social marketing messages may be introduced to  		produce behavior change that influences the same outcome (in this case,  		prevention of birth defects or other poor birth outcomes). Of course, how one  		develops the message and where it is placed will be dependent on the stated  		goals of a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>The key elements of any marketing effort are the 4Ps:  		product, price, place, and promotion.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note315">315</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note317">317</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note318">318</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note319">319</a></font></sup> To be  		successful, a marketing campaign must create a product or package  		of benefits that accrue to those who change their behavior. The  		price or costs of behavior change must be minimized. In other  		words, the target audience must perceive that the benefits of changing the  		behavior are larger than the associated costs. The exchange of the product for  		the price must be made available in a place that can reach the  		right target audience. Finally, an effective social marketing campaign  		promotes or creates awareness about the product, its price, and the  		places in which it can be found.</p>
<p>A successful social marketing campaign recognizes the target audience  		and tailors the 4Ps to its characteristics. Target audiences may be  		diverse and may not respond equally to a single social marketing campaign. In  		social marketing campaigns, target populations may be segmented by population  		characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, physical condition), geographic  		region, and behavioral characteristics such as readiness for change.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note315">315</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note319">319</a></font></sup>  		Thus, there may be multiple audience segments in the overall target audience  		for a single behavioral change. </p>
<p>Limited resources may make it impossible to reach all of the target  		audience. Decisions have to be made about where the biggest return on  		investment might be found among the segments of the target audience. For  		example, the University of Wisconsin wanted to find ways to reduce or prevent  		binge drinking among its student population.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note319">319</a></font></sup> Evaluation revealed that about a third of  		the study population did not currently binge drink; however, for some students,  		binge drinking started in high school while others started binge drinking as  		freshman. Based on this knowledge, the social marketing campaign developers  		segmented the student population into those who may be more likely to behave as  		desired (e.g., those who did not binge drink in high school and currently were  		not binge drinking) and those who might be more resistant to change (e.g.,  		those who started binge drinking in high school and continued to do so in  		college). Those most likely to behave as desired, for whom the intervention  		aimed at prevention, might respond to simple educational messages and require  		little investment to maintain their existing behavior. Those most resistant to  		change might respond only to a legal intervention. Those who did not binge  		drink in high school but started to in college were considered the primary  		target group. These individuals were perceived to be most amenable to change,  		and the marketing team focused its efforts on designing social marketing  		efforts that were tailored to this group.</p>
<p><a name="sectionVI.D.2.b" id="sectionVI.D.2.b">b. <i>Advance directives and social marketing.  		</i></a>An inherent challenge to social marketing efforts for AD promotion is  		that some barriers to AD completion and ACP are quite substantial, and current  		efforts to overcome them (e.g., educational interventions) have not been as  		effective as would be desired. Particularly when the efforts are targeted to  		broad target audiences, the marketing campaigns have failed to produce a  		product where the benefits have outweighed costs for all involved.</p>
<p>Many efforts to promote ADs are broad and do not necessarily attempt to  		define specific market segments to which messages can be targeted. In some key  		examples (e.g., Kokua Mau and the La Crosse Respecting Choices  		campaign), the entire community is the target population.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note242">242</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note320">320</a></font></sup>  		In this section, we highlight some of the largest and most well-known programs  		to influence consumer thinking around ADs/ACP and end-of-life care more  		generally and discuss their relative merits for effecting behavior change  		around these issues.</p>
<p>Last Acts was a national communications campaign involving a coalition  		of over 1,000 national health and consumer groups. The primary goals of the  		Last Acts campaign were: (1) to improve communication and decision making for  		consumers; (2) to change the culture in health care institutions; and (3) to  		change American culture and attitudes around death and dying.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note321">321</a></font></sup> Task forces were established  		to develop plans, and communications agencies were hired to manage processes of  		the task forces and work with the public and policy audiences. Among the  		successes of the Last Acts campaign was developing the first-ever  		state-by-state report card that rated each state on eight key indices of the  		availability and quality of end-of-life care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note322">322</a></font></sup> The campaign also made some important  		progress in raising professional awareness of end-of-life care issues.  		Coalition members viewed Last Acts as an important information resource on  		related issues and benefited from the campaign by feeling part of a larger  		community and receiving important support to do their work on the local level.  		</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Last Acts faced several challenges. An evaluation found  		that the campaign did not have a visible public presence and was perceived to  		benefit primarily the coalition partners, being somewhat distanced from the  		public, the primary target audience.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note321">321</a></font></sup> In addition, there was no specific  		evaluation of how Last Acts affected AD/ACP behavior. The campaign had been  		funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in 1995, but that funding ended in  		2005, before the campaign could address these critiques fully.</p>
<p>The Missoula Demonstration Project was established in 1996 as an effort  		to better understand the experience of dying and to demonstrate the value of a  		community-based approach to medical and psychosocial support to improve the  		quality of life for dying patients. This project took a social marketing  		perspective in planning and pursuing community change with respect to ADs/ACP  		and end-of-life care more generally. It began with a series of studies to get a  		better sense of the needs of the community, both patients and providers. This  		community profile characterized, among others, how people die in  		Missoula, how they view death and dying, how people experience medical and  		social care at the end of life, and how people in Missoula care for and support  		one another during dying and grief.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note323">323</a></font></sup> The project convened a number of task  		forces comprised of providers and lay community members to determine the types  		of interventions to be implemented, guided by the community profile. In  		addition to other data collection efforts by the task forces, the profile  		enabled a segmented and targeted approach to behavior change around ADs, ACP,  		and end-of-life care more generally. The effect of this project awaits formal  		evaluation.</p>
<p>An example of a statewide social marketing campaign to improve  		end-of-life care is Kokua Mau (Hawaiian for continuous  		care).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note320">320</a></font></sup> This  		was a community-state partnership funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,  		other foundations, the State of Hawaii, health care provider organizations, and  		insurance companies. The behavior change approach of Kokua Mau involved  		numerous tactics targeted to different populations: health care providers,  		faith communities, policy makers, and the general public. Included in these  		efforts were policy analysis and communication of policy recommendations to key  		policy makers, developing new courses for health care professionals and  		providing training in various settings of care, offering training in faith  		communities and supporting churches to expand outreach programs, maintaining a  		speakers bureau, and producing informational materials to be disseminated  		widely across the state. An evaluation published in 2005 (Braun et al. 2005)  		found that dissemination of campaign efforts stimulated growth of community  		coalitions to serve different communities and target populations. The campaign  		reached over 17,000 people through direct education efforts and almost 850,000  		through print, radio, television, and electronic public service announcements  		and stories. Between 1998 and 2000, AD completion rates increased modestly  		(from 29% to 32%). In addition, hospice admissions increased substantially (by  		20% between 1999 and 2001), but the proportion of the population dying in a  		hospital did not change. </p>
<p>A third social marketing example focused specifically on AD education is  		the Respecting Choices program, which was first implemented  		community-wide in La Crosse, Wisconsin and has since been implemented in other  		populations, including the chronically ill community-dwelling  		elderly.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note242">242</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note250">250</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note251">251</a></font></sup> Several  		approaches were taken to effect change that have been integrated as the routine  		standard of care across the community in La Crosse: training and continuing  		education for local AD educators; placement of AD educators at all health care  		organizations; standard policies and practices for documenting, maintaining,  		and using ADs; and community-wide education through wide dissemination of  		educational materials. All of the patient education materials developed for  		Respecting Choices were developed locally, with input from the target  		audiences.</p>
<p>An evaluation conducted two years after the implementation of Respecting  		Choices found that 85% of eligible patients had completed an AD and treatment  		matched the patients wishes as stated in the AD for 98% of all  		deaths.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note242">242</a></font></sup> A baseline  		community-wide survey revealed that about 15% of the population had a completed  		AD prior to the implementation of Respecting Choices. Although the populations  		are not directly comparable, the findings from the formal evaluation suggest  		that this program had an important influence on improving AD completion and  		implementation.</p>
<p>c. <i>Conceptual framework for approaching behavior change. </i>As  		described above, there are several possible approaches to effecting behavior  		change, including education, social marketing, and legal intervention. These  		interventions fall along a continuum of behavior change approaches targeting  		groups from least to most resistant to change. Rothschild<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note316">316</a></font></sup> offers a conceptual framework  		that can serve as a guide for considering the most appropriate approach  		depending on the following characteristics of the target population:  		motivation, opportunity, and ability (see <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#table2">Table 2</a>).</p>

</tr></table><p>Based on the principal that we are self-interested beings, individuals  		will be motivated to change their behavior when they perceive that they will  		personally benefit from that change. In the context of AD completion, people  		with serious illness may be more motivated to complete an AD than those who are  		not. Using marketing principles to appeal to self-interest or to remove  		barriers might increase motivation to act voluntarily. In this framework, legal  		intervention would only be appropriate when individuals cannot be motivated to  		act voluntarily.</p>
<p>A lack of opportunity might occur when an individual is motivated to  		change behavior but faces environmental barriers to change. Referring back to  		the binge drinking example provided earlier, students living in small towns  		might argue that there is nothing else to do but to binge drink on the  		weekends. In order to reduce binge drinking in this example, university staff  		might need to create alternative activities that are equally appealing, or more  		appealing, than binge drinking so that students have the opportunity to avoid  		the negative behavior. Creating opportunity may not happen simply by providing  		education although it can create awareness of existing opportunities; rather,  		opportunity is created through marketing efforts or legal intervention.</p>
<p>The ability to behave differently is the third element of the conceptual  		framework. One who has the skills or proficiencies to change may be more likely  		to change behavior. However, many things might compete with ones ability  		to behave differently. Again in the context of binge drinking, peer pressure is  		an example of something that might compete with ones ability to change  		behavior. Education might be effective in providing the skills to behave  		differently, but marketing efforts can reinforce education by providing some  		benefit for changing behavior. Legislative or policy intervention may help  		someone who does not otherwise have the ability to change to make better  		choices. </p>
<p>The table presented in this section (<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#table2">Table 2</a>)  		summarizes the description of this model, offering instruction on what might be  		the most successful approaches to behavior change depending on the  		characteristics of the target population. For this conceptual framework to be  		useful, one must be able to reasonably segment the target population, based on  		behavioral characteristics and an understanding of the environment in which the  		population lives. </p>
<p><a name="sectionVI.D.3" id="sectionVI.D.3">3. <b>The role of legislation and policy for  		advance directive/advance care planning use</b></a>. One mechanism for  		increasing AD use and ACP is to legislate changes or develop policies to  		encourage or guide these processes. Several efforts in this regard have been  		undertaken, most prominently the 1991 PSDA. State legislation has created ADs  		in every state. In addition, state legislation has aimed at improving  		portability of ADs, making it easier for emergency personnel to follow ACP  		decisions and providing mechanisms to make documents available. The scientific  		literature contains evaluation of many of these legislative and policy  		interventions.</p>
<p>The first AD legislation was at the state level: in 1976 California  		passed the Natural Death Act, which gave legal force to living wills. The  		following year, Arkansas passed legislation authorizing ADs. Fourteen years  		later, with the recognition that use of ADs and ACP remained uncommon, Congress  		enacted the PSDA<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note30">30</a></font></sup>  		requiring all medical facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds to  		provide written information to all admitted or enrolled patients concerning  		their rights under state law to refuse or accept treatment and to complete ADs.  		As described earlier, the PSDA was designed to preserve self-determination in  		end-of-life care, protect patients from overly aggressive care at the end of  		life, foster communication between patients and their physicians, and protect  		physicians from litigation in end-of-life decision making. </p>
<p>Several studies have evaluated the effect of the PSDA on AD use and  		end-of-life care. The SUPPORT trial instituted its intervention at about the  		time that the PSDA went into force and thus was able to measure the effect of  		the PSDA as a natural experiment. Before the PSDA, 21% of patients had an AD,  		of which 6% were noted in the medical record. After the passage of the PSDA,  		the proportion of patients in the SUPPORT trial with an AD was no different  		(24%), but 35% of these were documented in the medical record (p&lt;0.001). In  		the post-PSDA period, patients who had an AD, compared to patients without an  		AD, were only slightly more likely to have medical record documentation of  		discussions about resuscitation (38% with an AD vs. 33% without an AD) although  		more patients with ADs reported discussing resuscitation preferences with  		physicians (43% vs. 30%), DNR orders among those who wanted to forgo  		resuscitation (58% vs. 54%) or resuscitation attempts at death (9% vs.  		17%).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note324">324</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A study that evaluated patients just before and after the PDSA  		implementation showed that ACP increased (61% pre vs. 73% post, p=0.01);  		however, there was no significant increase in the proportion of patients who  		had an AD (20% vs. 26%, p=0.11). Implementation of the PSDA was not associated  		with a significant increase in patients discussing ACP or end-of-life issues  		with their physicians (14% vs. 17%, p=0.25) or detailed discussions with  		proxies (34% vs. 33%).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note325">325</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A third study used a time series design to evaluate DNR orders among  		Medicare patients hospitalized with six serious condition in 29 hospitals in  		Ohio before and after the PSDA. Risk-adjusted rates of early DNR orders  		increased by 34% between 1991 and 1992 for four of the six conditions and then  		remained flat or declined slightly between 1992 and 1997. Use of late DNR  		orders declined by 29-53% for four of the six conditions between 1991 and 1997.  		Risk-adjusted mortality during the 30 days after a DNR order was written did  		not change between 1991 and 1997 for five conditions, but increased for stroke  		patients.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note326">326</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A study that compared two academic medical centers on AD completion  		among electively admitted patients found that providing the AD information by  		mail before admission was associated with more AD completion.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note327">327</a></font></sup> In summarizing the data, one  		review suggested that the PSDA generally failed to foster a significant  		increase in AD use or to increase the involvement of clinicians.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<p>However, in the nursing home, the PSDA appeared to induce higher AD  		completion rates.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note116">116</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note117">117</a></font></sup> Oliver et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note328">328</a></font></sup> conducted a systematic review of  		end-of-life care in nursing homes and found that after the PSDA the number of  		nursing home residents with discussions of treatment wishes increased. An  		evaluation of nursing home residents in 268 facilities in 1990 and 1993 using  		Minimum Data Set information showed that ADs increased from 7% to 16%  		(p&lt;0.05) as did DNR orders (32% pre vs. 51% post, p&lt;0.05) and  		do-not-hospitalize orders (2% vs. 4%, p&lt;0.05).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note123">123</a></font></sup> Teno and colleagues found that there was  		considerable variation in the number of DNR and do-not-hospitalize orders by  		state.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note329">329</a></font></sup> A study in  		eight rural nursing homes found that residents with ADs were more likely to  		have been admitted to the nursing home after the enactment of the PSDA (25%  		before vs. 38% after, p&lt;0.001). There was substantial variation among  		facilities.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note330">330</a></font></sup> Bradley  		and Rizzo<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note331">331</a></font></sup> also  		found an increase in ADs after the PSDA (from 5% to 35%, p&lt;0.01).</p>
<p>Evaluation of state AD laws performed since the PSDA have demonstrated  		substantial heterogeneity<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note332">332</a></font></sup> as well as deficits in these statutes. One  		evaluation found that state AD laws were too restrictive and suggested relaxing  		requirements for witnessing or notarizing ADs completed during a physician  		visit, permitting oral specification of health care proxies and encouraging  		discussions.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note49">49</a></font></sup> Another  		evaluation found that ADs did not empower health care proxies or guide their  		decision making.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note333">333</a></font></sup>  		The author suggested specific improvements in ADs:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>State AD laws should permit the creation of immediately effective  			 proxy appointments. The proxies would function as an advisor to and advocate of  			 the patient while the patient retains capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State AD laws should require health care providers to record the  			 identity of a patient's appointed proxy as early as practicable for a patient  			 suffering from a condition that could lead to death. With patient approval, the  			 provider should invite the proxy to participate in treatment decisions and care  			 planning before the patient loses decision making capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State law should require health care providers to make available  			 written information and counseling resources to proxies in order to explain the  			 nature and process of health care decision making and the role of  			 proxies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State law should define a process of informed consent that  			 emphasizes the physician-proxy discussion process and the opportunity to weigh  			 relevant factors in that process, including determining the wishes and/or  			 best-interests of the patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State AD laws should recognize the authority and discretion of  			 appointed proxies over the authority of ADs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Regional groups and professional societies<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note334">334</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note335">335</a></font></sup> have developed  		policies and states<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note336">336</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note337">337</a></font></sup> have passed a laws to help determine  		whether aggressive care toward the end of life is beneficial and should be  		continued. These methods usually advocate for ACP to guide care but set limits  		on the goals for which medical intervention may be permitted. To date, these  		efforts appear to have had little effect on the use of aggressive  		care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note338">338</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a name="sectionVI.D.3.a" id="sectionVI.D.3.a">a. <i>State programs to improve portability of  		preferences and advance directives.</i></a> A significant obstacle to  		implementing ADs is that they may not move with the patient to across care  		venues. This is despite the fact that most states have laws permitting  		out-of-hospital DNR orders (42 as of 1999).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note339">339</a></font></sup> For ADs to be effective, clinicians caring  		for the patient need to be aware of their content. This shortcoming contributes  		to statewide initiatives that have been undertaken to create mechanisms for ACP  		to transition with patients as they move within the health care system. The  		POLST program is a mechanism to elicit preferences for care from patients and  		then ensure that these wishes are honored wherever the patient receives care.  		Using a one-page form, the POLST captures patient preferences concerning CPR,  		transfer, antibiotic use, and tube feeding. Authority to follow the stated  		preferences is ensured by state law and health care facilities have  		incorporated use of the POLST form into standard operating procedure. </p>
<p>A prospective analysis of 180 nursing home patients with a POLST  		containing a DNR order and a desire for transfer only if comfort measures  		failed showed that over one year no patient received CPR, ICU care, or  		ventilator support, and only 2% were hospitalized to extend life. Of the 38  		subjects who died during the study year, 63% had an order for narcotics, and  		only two died in a hospital.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note132">132</a></font></sup> Similarly, among 58 decedents in a Program  		of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly in Oregon who had a POLST document, use  		of CPR, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and feeding tubes nearly always  		matched specified preferences.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note257">257</a></font></sup> A survey of 146 nursing homes in Oregon in  		2002 revealed that 71% were using the POLST for at least half of their  		residents;<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note340">340</a></font></sup> a survey  		of emergency medical technicians found that most were aware of the form and  		found it useful.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note341">341</a></font></sup>  		This mechanism of eliciting preferences and protecting them during care  		transitions is now used or planned to be used in more then a dozen states.</p>
<p>b. <i>Programs to improve emergency medical response to patients at the  		end of life</i>. Another strategy for matching patient desires and care  		received just before death is to enable emergency medical services personnel to  		withhold CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for patients with a terminal  		illness who would not have wanted resuscitation. In a natural experiment, 16 of  		35 local emergency medical services agencies in Washington volunteered to  		implement guidelines to withhold CPR if the patient had a terminal condition  		and if the patient, family, or caregivers indicated, in writing or verbally,  		that no CPR was desired. Personnel implementing the new guidelines withheld  		resuscitation in 12% of patients having cardiac arrests, compared with an  		average of 5% of patients in historical and contemporary control groups. This  		increase was primarily due to honoring verbal requests.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note342">342</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>E. Outcomes of Advance Directives and Advance Care  		Planning</h3>
<p>ADs have been promoted as a method of ensuring patient autonomy. How  		well they serve this function has been investigated extensively, such as  		comparisons of end-of-life treatment with care requested or refused in an AD;  		comparisons of desired decision making models with care received; and the  		relationship of patient preferences and clinical circumstances with  		resuscitation and life-sustaining care, place of death, degree of aggressive  		care at the end of life and resource use. Generally, the research suggests that  		even when ADs are executed, physicians are frequently unaware of them, ADs are  		not easily available to surrogates when needed, ADs are too general and/or are  		inapplicable to clinical circumstances, and/or they are invoked late in the  		dying process or are at times overridden by providers and families.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note50">50</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note93">93</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note97">97</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note110">110</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note220">220</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note221">221</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note343">343</a></font></sup> Only in the  		context of a comprehensive community effort do ADs and ACP appear to  		substantially change care at the end of life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note242">242</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note323">323</a></font></sup> Despite the  		weakness of ADs as an individual intervention, research points to promising  		interventions.</p>
<p>Medical care tends to be driven first and foremost by a patients  		clinical circumstances. Patient perceived quality of life and the wishes of  		family affect clinical decisions at the end of life along with preferences  		expressed in ADs. ADs alone have been shown to be ineffective in reducing  		unwanted aggressive medical treatments or costs at the end of life.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note43">43</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note50">50</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note120">120</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note329">329</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note344">344</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note345">345</a></font></sup> A review of  		interventions to improve end-of-life care concluded that ADs have been  		construed too narrowly to ensure preference-driven care.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A main concern in the early days of ACP was whether discussions about  		end-of-life care and ADs would have a negative impact on patients. The evidence  		suggests that ACP is not distressing to patients and that intensive educational  		interventions are acceptable to patients, families and physicians (e.g.,  		intensive ethics consults, facilitated family/provider conferences, palliative  		care consult teams, etc.). Repeated discussions of patient preferences as well  		as accessible documentation of these preferences are necessary to ensure that  		care is consistent with the patients current situation and  		wishes.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note78">78</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note93">93</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note95">95</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note132">132</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note166">166</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note170">170</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note200">200</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note225">225</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note236">236</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note250">250</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note251">251</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note252">252</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note253">253</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note254">254</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note313">313</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note346">346</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note347">347</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note348">348</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note349">349</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note350">350</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Research examining whether AD interventions (e.g., scenario-based ADs,  		value-based ADs, decision making with and without discussions between patient  		and surrogate) improved the accuracy of surrogate substituted judgment found  		that none of the interventions was effective.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note23">23</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note63">63</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note166">166</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note351">351</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note352">352</a></font></sup> For  		example, Hines et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note252">252</a></font></sup> found that conversations between patients  		and their surrogates were associated with the surrogates believing they had a  		better understanding of the patients wishes. However, these conversations  		were either weakly related or unrelated to a surrogates actual knowledge  		of specific patient preferences. Surrogates wanted written and oral  		instructions more often than patients wanted to provide them and knowing the  		patients wish to stop treatment in the present condition was more  		important to most surrogates than the physicians recommendation to stop  		treatment. Engelberg et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note353">353</a></font></sup> found that surrogates displayed greater  		accuracy in understanding patient preferences if they had had discussions about  		patient preferences, with family members able to predict patient preferences  		accurately about half the time. However, other research suggests that even when  		a patient and the chosen surrogate have conversations about preferences and an  		AD is completed, the surrogate and the patient do not make similar hypothetical  		medical choices.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note23">23</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note63">63</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The largest ACP intervention to date, the SUPPORT trial, did not improve  		communication and prognostication, nor did the intervention facilitate  		completion of ADs. Patients in the intervention group did not spend fewer days  		in ICUs, have better concordance between preferences and life-sustaining  		treatments, or receive resuscitation more appropriately.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Studies of interventions that simply aim for completion of ADs fail to  		improve patient/provider communication, end-of-life decision making, or the  		concordance of life-sustaining treatments with patient goals.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Some of the reasons that ADs and related interventions do not change  		care are described by Hawkins et al.,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note37">37</a></font></sup> who explored 337 patients and  		surrogates attitudes about using ADs in the context of a two year  		intervention (the ADVANCE Project: Advance Directives, Values, Assessment and  		Communication Enhancement Project). The study revealed that patients did not  		want many to participate in many of the activities that are central to ACP. Few  		individuals wished to document specific medical treatment preferences and  		mandate that they be followed. Most desired to express more general  		preferences, such as values and goals for care in addition to (or instead of)  		specific treatment preferences. Patients in this study valued cognitive  		functioning, independence, and dying with dignity, but the priority that each  		patient assigned to these values varied substantially, suggesting that patients  		would translate their unique set of personal values and goals into various  		life-sustaining treatment decisions. In addition, the study showed that  		patients who documented their preferences in ADs may not have wanted them  		strictly followed near death; 91% desired that proxies have at least some  		leeway to override their written directives.</p>
<p>Several more recent studies have suggested links between ADs and  		clinical processes and outcomes of importance. Kish Wallace et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note354">354</a></font></sup> found that patients with an  		AD at admission to an ICU more often had DNR orders within the first 72 hours,  		had shorter ICU stays, and had lower charges than patients without an AD;  		however having an AD did not appear to affect decisions about using  		life-supports. Lilly et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note93">93</a></font></sup> found that intensive communication sessions  		among providers, patients, and families within 72 hours of ICU admission  		decreased length of stay in the ICU from four days to three days, decreased ICU  		mortality, and resulted in fewer therapeutic interventions. </p>
<p>a. <i>Advance care planning interventions in intensive care units.</i>  		Post-SUPPORT interventions that incorporate ACP (and to a small degree AD  		completion) into intensive end-of-life interventions in the ICU, such as  		prospective ethics consults, intensive communication interventions and  		counseling sessions, and AD discussions with trained facilitators have  		demonstrated reductions in ICU and hospital length of stay, reductions in  		treatment decision conflicts, better alignment of therapeutic interventions  		with goals, decreased mortality within the ICU, increased access to palliative  		care, and lower charges.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note93">93</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note95">95</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note170">170</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note173">173</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note200">200</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note346">346</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note347">347</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note348">348</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note349">349</a></font></sup> These  		outcomes, which were not consistent across all studies, suggest that  		patient-provider discussions focusing on acceptable health states, the goals of  		critical care, and valued life activities more effectively guide end-of-life  		care than decisions focusing on specific medical interventions.</p>
<p>b. <i>Advance directives and advance care planning in nursing homes.</i>  		There is substantial evidence that ADs affect decision making in nursing homes.  		AD completion is associated with increases in discussions about end-of-life  		care and documentation of patient preferences, moderate increases in hospice  		enrollment, and feeding tube use more consistent with patient goals.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note328">328</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note355">355</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note356">356</a></font></sup> Three studies evaluated the effect of  		ACP interventions on nursing home residents resource utilization.  		Morrison et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note238">238</a></font></sup>  		educated nursing home social workers in ACP and then performed structured  		interviews with residents to ascertain treatment preferences. Patients in this  		intervention were less likely to undergo treatments that were discordant with  		their stated preferences. Casarett et al.,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note237">237</a></font></sup> using a clinical trial design, created a  		structured interview process to improve hospice enrollment among nursing home  		patients. Intervention patients had decreased acute care admissions, increased  		hospice enrollment, and increased family satisfaction, but not decreased  		resource utilization. Molloy et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note239">239</a></font></sup> implemented a nurse-led educational  		program in nursing homes to increase use of ADs that demonstrated a significant  		reduction in resource use and hospitalizations among intervention nursing homes  		without a change in patient or family satisfaction.</p>
<p>Happ et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note134">134</a></font></sup>  		conducted a case review of 43 deceased nursing home residents transferred to a  		hospital. They found that although ADs were part of the nursing home admission  		process, these discussions focused primarily on CPR preference, and treatment  		preferences were reviewed only after the crisis of acute illness and  		hospitalization. AD forms specifying preferences or limitations of  		life-sustaining treatment contained inconsistent language and vague conditions  		for implementation. Engel et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note104">104</a></font></sup> conducted a survey of caregivers to  		nursing home residents with dementia regarding the caregivers  		satisfaction with care. They found that the most significant factor in  		caregivers satisfaction was having a longer than 15-minute discussion  		about ACP with a health care provider at the time a patient was admitted.</p>
<p>c. <i>Advance directives and site of death.</i> A key wish toward the  		end of life that can be included in an AD concerns venue of death. However, the  		evidence linking patient preferences for place of death and ADs is weak. Gomes  		and Higginson<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note357">357</a></font></sup>  		conducted a systematic review of the literature (1972-2004) on the relative  		influence of different factors on place of death for cancer patients. They  		found that patients low functional status, the intensity of patient  		preferences for home care, living with relatives, and extended family support  		were significantly associated with home death, with social support the  		strongest factor. Pekmezaris et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note358">358</a></font></sup> and Degenholtz et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note359">359</a></font></sup> evaluated whether having an  		AD affected place of death and found that significantly higher proportions of  		patients dying in nursing homes had living wills and had specified preferences  		for treatment limitations (e.g., DNR) versus those dying in the hospital. Levy  		et al.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note360">360</a></font></sup> examined  		factors predicting site of death (hospital vs. nursing home) and found that  		rural, hospital-based, and government-owned nursing homes had the lowest  		in-hospital death rates. Absence of a DNR order, non-White ethnicity, greater  		functional independence, and higher cognitive status were associated with  		in-hospital death.</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>Although ADs can be an important tool to assist those facing the end of  		life, the accumulated evidence suggests that end-of-life decision making in the  		United States is often poorly implemented with patients receiving care  		inconsistent with preferences toward the end of life, a poor match of  		aggressive care with prognosis, undue suffering, and wasted resources. The  		research summarized above shows that most people do not complete an AD and that  		when they are completed, these documents often do not affect care because they  		are narrow and legalistic. The focus on preferences concerning life-sustaining  		treatments commonly proves to be too simplistic and vague instructions (e.g.,  		weigh the burdens and benefits) are difficult to apply, often adding little to  		the way that family and clinicians would approach decisions. Preferences stated  		within ADs (or poorly orchestrated ACP) often do not apply to clinical  		circumstances or can even impede effective decision making (e.g., a statement  		to do everything). In short, ADs and ACP have been  		ineffective.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note60">60</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note361">361</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Instead of encouraging substantive communication about clinical  		circumstances and medical possibilities and how the patients values would  		dictate choices given the medical realities, ADs have tended to be considered  		ends in themselves. But, as numerous studies teach us, there is little  		connection between the completion of an AD and subsequent appropriate outcomes  		of care such as improved communication between patient and provider or  		caregiver, greater concordance between patient preferences and proxy reports of  		patient preferences, reductions in aggressive care, appropriate palliation, or  		preferred place of death. </p>
<p>Much of the research has focused on whether these documents were  		completed or documented in the medical record. It is no surprise that these  		efforts have rarely had an impact on care. More sophisticated approaches such  		as time limited trials with objective end points do not emerge from  		cookie-cutter documents or simplistic decisions about CPR. In  		addition, ACP is a process rather then an isolated event or a series of  		unrelated episodes. Simplistic mechanisms for complex decisions lead to  		perceptions that clinicians do not follow AD preferences,<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note71">71</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note186">186</a></font></sup>  		suggesting that remedies to change clinician behavior are needed, whereas some  		evidence suggests that it may be the AD instrument and its application that  		needs improvement.</p>
<p>Some groups of patients are less inclined to complete ADs or engage in  		ACP. These tend to be individuals who have been disenfranchised or those with  		less trust in the medical care system. Studies show that for many racial/ethnic  		groups, autonomy is not always empowering, information about bad news may not  		be invited, and AD-appointed decision makers may be an unacceptable decision  		making mechanism.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note138">138</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note146">146</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note150">150</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note155">155</a></font></sup> Not considering the needs of these groups  		has contributed to development of end-of-life decision making mechanisms that  		often do not suit the needs of the most vulnerable in American society.  		Concerning persons with disabilities, the dearth of literature about  		preferences, decision making mechanisms and capabilities, and end-of-life care  		hampers the development of appropriate models for decision making. Not a single  		study representative of any disabled population was found concerning ACP, ADs  		or end-of-life care. It is unclear whether the pronouncements of disability  		rights activists concerning the unacceptability of ACP mechanisms reflect the  		views of the broader community of persons with disabilities. Yet, it is clear  		that there is widespread distrust that quality of life judgments of clinicians  		and others will reflect those of the disabled individuals and that the medical  		care and social systems will work as hard to maximize patients quality of  		life as they will to withhold or withdraw care. Even in the context of these  		views, qualitative studies show that many disabled individuals desire to invoke  		autonomous preferences in making end-of-life decisions. This suggests that  		opening up the discussion about end-of-life care and how decisions should be  		made in order to create transparent and acceptable methods would improve care  		for groups now poorly served.</p>
<p>The research summarized above as well as a review of measures  		demonstrates a lack of well-developed and meaningful metrics of  		successful ACP and patient and family-centered care (e.g.,  		emotional distress, satisfaction with end-of-life communication, appropriate  		values clarification, etc.).<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note362">362</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note363">363</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note364">364</a></font></sup> Far beyond  		the mere completion of an AD, the goals of ACP should aim to show that goals of  		care are informed by a patients present condition; that decisions were  		prospectively mapped out so that comfort and resource use could be maximized  		and anxiety minimized; that access to pain and symptom management was ensured;  		that patients and families were prepared for what to expect; that emotional,  		spiritual and practical support were available; and that the goal of care was a  		sense of completion in life and relationship resolution, treating the patient  		as a whole person.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note10">10</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note12">12</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note13">13</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note14">14</a>,  		<a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note32">32</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note52">52</a>, <a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note54">54</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Interventions that have attempted to take a broader view of ACP have  		demonstrated some directions for further research. Social marketing models that  		attempt to change societal expectations for end-of-life care show that  		improvement is possible. Structured ACP at the community level can induce the  		expectation that health care providers will elicit and attend to patient  		preferences in a timely manner.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note166">166</a></font></sup> A care transition mechanism that is used  		widely to protect patients preferences in a variety of settings can  		create an expectation at the health care institutional level that these  		institutions will ensure continuity of preferences and dedicate resources to  		this process.<sup><font><a href="literature-review-advance-directives.html#note340">340</a></font></sup></p>
<p>This literature review demonstrates great need for improved end-of-life  		care and past inadequate attempts to implement improvements, but also indicates  		directions for renewed interventions. It maps out the need for additional  		research as well as policy implications. First and foremost, the field needs to  		understand why ACP works when it does and why it often fails. Second, future  		research needs to learn from past work demonstrating that end-of-life care is a  		complex process that defies easy solutions, so that understanding solutions may  		require parsing out differences by condition, patient characteristics, provider  		type and venue. Third, models of ACP cannot permit clinicians to abandon their  		responsibility to render professional judgments based on clinical knowledge and  		make recommendations that are informed by knowledge of the patient. </p>
<p>Furthermore, efforts to date suggest that ACP holds great promise and  		future efforts should be based on the most successful models. These should  		integrate change at the community level with structures and mechanisms at the  		state level to facilitate decision making and continuity of care. More flexible  		legal instruments and ACP educational tools will aim the process toward the  		clinician-patient relationship where it belongs and can best inform care in a  		clinically relevant way. </p>
