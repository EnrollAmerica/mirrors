<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid account for a  		disproportionate share of expenditures under both programs. In Medicare, dual  		eligibles account for 16% of beneficiaries and 25% of total expenditures,  		incurring nearly twice the expenditures of Medicare-only  		beneficiaries.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Under  		Medicaid, dual eligibles account for 18% of beneficiaries and 46% of total  		Medicaid spending.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because dual eligibles receive health care and long-term services  		benefits under two entirely different public insurance programs and through two  		largely different care systems, it has long been recognized that services for  		dual eligibles are fragmented and inefficient. Consequently, increased  		attention is being placed on the development of care management models that can  		potentially manage the full spectrum of Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual  		eligibiles in a manner that both improves consumer outcomes and reduces public  		costs.</p>
<p>The authorization of Medicare Special Needs Plans (SNPs) under the  		Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 was  		a significant development that recognized the importance of dual eligibles to  		both programs.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> Medicare  		SNPs are targeted Medicare Advantage (MA) plans that are allowed to limit  		enrollment to specific subsets of Medicare beneficiaries, including dual  		eligibles. Since the enactment of the MMA, the number of Dual Eligible SNPs has  		grown rapidly. By September 2009, there were 407 Dual Eligible SNPs operating  		nationwide, with total enrollment of 951,590.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Initially, SNPs were encouraged by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS) to coordinate Medicare-covered services with whatever Medicaid  		benefits their members were also eligible to receive, but no formal  		coordination requirements existed. This changed under the Medicare Improvements  		for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008, in which Congress required dual  		eligible SNPs to have contracts with their state Medicaid programs that  		formally address coordination of Medicare and Medicaid benefits for their  		members. </p>
<p>This paper is the third in a series sponsored by the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  		and Evaluation on SNPs and their relationship to Medicaid. In the second paper  		of the series, we identified all states which had some kind of contractual  		relationship with SNPs prior to MIPPA, and classified those relationships into  		broad categories.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> The  		purpose of this third paper is to examine in greater detail a select group of  		state contracts with SNPs to determine how states use contracts to achieve  		Medicaid policy goals and advance care integration for dually eligible  		beneficiaries. As the link between state Medicaid programs and Medicare SNPs  		evolves further under the requirements of MIPPA, states may benefit from an  		analysis of existing contracting practices.</p>
<p><b><i>Approach and Scope</i></b></p>
<p>The previous paper in this series identified a wide range of agreements  		reflecting the unique purchasing strategies of state Medicaid programs. From  		the earlier analysis, five program contracts were selected for more in-depth  		analysis to identify how particular aspects of dual eligibility and managed  		long-term services are addressed across a diverse set of state programs. The  		five programs from which contracts were selected are summarized in  		<a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table1">Table 1</a>. By design, the programs represent a broad range  		of state initiatives, from Minnesotas highly integrated Senior Health  		Options (MSHO) program to a new cost-sharing program in Texas, with three other  		programs falling in between. </p>
<p>It should be noted that three states included in this analysis have more  		than one type of SNP-based program operating. Minnesota, New York and Texas all  		have other types of contracts that relate to other distinct program initiatives  		in those states. We have chosen to feature one contract from each of those  		states because it represents a point in a national continuum of SNP-state  		contracts.</p>
<p><b><i>Contract Analysis by Topic</i></b></p>
<p>The five contracts were analyzed by major topics of interest:</p>
<ul><li>Program Purpose</li>
<li>Enrollment and Marketing</li>
<li>Medicaid Services Included</li>
<li>Care Coordination</li>
<li>Access/Network Adequacy</li>
<li>Data Reporting</li>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Financial Incentives</li>
</ul><p>For each topic, we offer a summary of the range of content identified in  		contracts, illustrated with actual contract language. We added underscoring to  		highlight key phrases and excised passages to keep selections short, but  		otherwise the contract language is as it appears in actual SNP-state  		contracts.</p>
<h2>Purpose of Contract</h2>
<p>The purpose statement contained in each SNP-state contract provides a  		good indicator of how far the rest of the contract will go in specifying  		Medicaid services, their integration with Medicare services, care coordination,  		quality provisions, reporting requirements and a host of other items. As one  		would expect, states seeking full integration of Medicare and Medicaid services  		enter into the most comprehensive and specific contracts, and states seeking  		cost-sharing-only agreements the least. </p>
<p>In the middle are states that have as their primary goal more effective  		delivery of Medicaid long-term services, and which enter into contracts with  		SNPs to allow for Medicare integration as a secondary benefit.  		<a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table2">Table 2</a> offers examples of the range of purpose  		statements found in SNP-state contracts.</p>
<p>The Minnesota contract seeks a fully integrated, alternative delivery  		system for dual eligibles, a goal that manifests in a nearly 200 page contract  		plus appendices. The relatively modest goal of capitating cost-sharing in Texas  		requires much less oversight and is governed by a 20 page contract. </p>
<p>Minnesota and New Mexico both mention long-term services in their  		purpose statements, and each contract goes on to include long-term services in  		its Medicaid capitation. In contrast, the Texas contract is not designed to  		address long-term services, and does not mention them. </p>
<p>Minnesota and New Mexico differ in their primary objective. The MSHO  		programs reason for being is to integrate Medicare and Medicaid services.  		The Coordinated Long-Term Services (CoLTS) program seeks first and foremost to  		deliver long-term services more effectively. By requiring its contractors to be  		SNPs, New Mexico is encouraging contractors to integrate Medicare and Medicaid  		when possible, as a secondary benefit of the program.</p>
<h2>Enrollment and Marketing</h2>
<p>Under federal policy, MA enrollment is always voluntary, and dual  		eligibles may leave or change plans on a month-to-month basis. Medicaid policy,  		on the other hand, allows mandatory enrollment with appropriate waivers, and  		permits lock-in periods. This creates a range of Medicare-Medicaid enrollment  		dynamics, depending on the enrollment policy decisions made by state  		officials.<sup><font><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table3">Table 3</a> illustrates the range of policy options  		available to a state and how they play out. New Yorks Medicaid Advantage  		Plus (MAP) contract includes two key enrollment policy decisions. First, the  		state opted to mirror Medicare enrollment policy. Enrollment is voluntary for  		both Medicare and Medicaid, with no lock-in period. Secondly, New York made an  		additional policy decision to underscore that the unique benefit of this  		program is Medicare-Medicaid integration. The state will only enroll a  		beneficiary for Medicaid services if the beneficiary has opted to enroll with  		the SNP for Medicare. </p>
<p>In contrast, the New Mexico CoLTS contract establishes a mandatory  		Medicaid program with a 12-month lock-in period (with one switch allowed in the  		first 90 days). In CoLTS, Medicaid enrollment policy takes precedence, and  		because Medicare enrollment can never be mandatory, integrated care is  		available to a subset of members who choose to enroll for Medicare as well. In  		the New York contract, 100% of Medicaid members will be dually enrolled for  		Medicare as well, but the overall enrollment is likely to be relatively low. In  		New Mexico, the state achieves high Medicaid enrollment, but limited  		penetration of dual enrollment into both Medicaid and Medicare.</p>
<p>Finally, the Minnesota contract offers a hybrid that reflects the  		states overall Medicaid managed care strategy. In Minnesota, the default  		option for older persons is the mandatory Senior Care Services program, a  		Medicaid-only program. MSHO is structured as a fully voluntary option for those  		who choose integrated care, and the state mirrors Medicare enrollment policy in  		that program. Those who do not choose MSHO are enrolled in the mandatory Senior  		Care Services program. </p>
<p>Contracts also address a more technical enrollment issue. Two separate  		processes must take place to achieve dual Medicare and Medicaid enrollment.  		Beneficiaries must be enrolled into CMS MA system for Medicare, and into  		a states enrollment system for Medicaid. Alignment of enrollment dates is  		important for creating a seamless beneficiary experience and for paying plans  		appropriately.</p>
<p><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table4">Table 4</a> shows how Minnesota and New York address  		coordination of Medicare and Medicaid enrollment. In MA, enrollment is  		effective on the first day of the month following approval of the  		beneficiarys enrollment. The Minnesota contract language mirrors the  		Medicare effective date for MSHO only. For those enrolled in the non-integrated  		Senior Care Services program, enrollment is effective on the first day of the  		<i>second</i> month following approval. But for purposes of achieving seamless,  		dual integration for MSHO members, the state opted to adapt its standard  		Medicaid enrollment policy to align it with Medicare policy. </p>
<p>New Yorks language is slightly different, containing a two-part  		test. To be enrolled for Medicaid, a beneficiary must appear on the state  		enrollment roster <i>and</i> must be enrolled for Medicare. The language may or  		may not result in a unified Medicaid and Medicare enrollment date, since  		getting on the state enrollment roster generally takes longer than enrollment  		in Medicare, depending on when during the month the beneficiary has opted to  		enroll. It does ensure, however, that no one can be enrolled in MAP unless the  		person has enrolled for Medicare. This reinforces the states policy  		(illustrated in <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table3">Table 3</a>) that it will not enroll Medicaid  		beneficiaries unless they have also selected the plans Medicare product.  		</p>
<p>Marketing is an important aspect of enrollment. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table5">Table  		5</a> shows a range of contract approaches.</p>
<p>Minnesota uses the contract to assert state review of all materials,  		including Medicare materials. The Idaho contract, on the other hand, limits the  		state role to reviewing Medicaid material, and defers to CMS on review of  		Medicare material. The Texas contract takes a different approach altogether by  		creating an incentive for plans to submit material to the state. Plans that  		submit comparison charts for state approval then have the advantage of having  		their product summarized on material provided by the state to dual  		eligibles.</p>
<p>SNP-state contracts give states opportunity to regulate what materials  		are presented to dually eligible beneficiaries and reduce confusion in their  		markets. The opportunity for plans is to obtain endorsement and assistance from  		states in marketing to dually eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<h2>Medicaid Services Included</h2>
<p>A broad range of Medicaid services are provided through SNPs under  		capitation. They are generally listed in contract appendices too long to  		reproduce here. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table6">Table 6</a> provides a summary.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Texas contract capitates cost-sharing only, since  		that is the purpose of the contract. On the other end of the spectrum,  		Minnesota includes virtually all Medicaid services in its capitation to SNPs,  		reflecting its policy goal of a fully integrated product. New Mexico also  		includes an extensive package of services in its capitation, with the exception  		of behavioral health services. That exclusion stems from the states  		earlier decision to deliver behavioral health services through a statewide  		behavioral health services organization. Idahos Benchmark program was  		designed with the states relatively healthy dual eligibles in mind, and  		therefore does not include long-term services.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether services are included in a capitation or continue  		to be paid on a fee-for-service basis, most of the contracts recognize the  		overlap in Medicare and Medicaid benefits and define certain Medicaid benefits  		in relationship to Medicare. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table7">Table 7</a> offers examples.  		</p>
<p>As long as Medicare and Medicaid funding continue to be accounted for  		separately (as they must be under current federal authority), the possibility  		of cost shifting exists, even in highly integrated programs like  		Minnesotas. The examples in <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table7">Table 7</a> all seek to get  		expenditures allocated to the appropriate ledger. Even in the context of fully  		capitated payments, how an encounter is recorded will impact cost reporting,  		potentially affecting future rate setting. </p>
<p>Of particular concern in several contracts is coordination of drug  		benefits, as the examples in <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table8">Table 8</a> illustrate. This  		area has many coordination pitfalls, including: (1) most state Medicaid  		programs cover prescription drugs not covered by Medicare Part D; (2) Part D  		plans and state Medicaid programs have different drug formularies; and (3) Part  		D plans and state Medicaid programs have different pharmacy dispensing  		networks, and different dispensing fee arrangements with their networks. </p>
<p>States also seek added value for dually eligible beneficiaries by  		creating contractual obligations for the plans to provide benefits that would  		not otherwise be provided by Medicaid. Minnesota specifically obtained  		elimination of Medicaid co-payments. New Mexico created a generic expectation,  		to be made specific by the contractor. </p>
<h2>Care Coordination</h2>
<p>All of the contracts included in this analysis include care coordination  		expectations. The way care coordination is described varies with the program  		model, as the examples in <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table10">Table 10</a> illustrate.</p>
<p>In MSHO, where virtually all Medicare and Medicaid services are the  		responsibility of the SNP, care coordination is defined very broadly to include  		all Medicare and Medicaid services. In the MSHO model, these are all within the  		control of the contractor, which receives comprehensive capitated payments for  		Medicare and Medicaid, including Medicaid long-term services.</p>
<p>In contrast, Idahos Benchmark program includes few Medicaid  		services in its capitation to the SNP. Long-term services remain  		fee-for-service, and there is no payment to the plan for waiver services or  		other Medicaid-funded care coordination. The contract instead provides funding  		for primary care case management (PCCM), and makes the primary care providers  		responsible for coordination of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. This approach  		reflects the states expectation that few, if any, Benchmark Plan members  		use long-term services. </p>
<p>Finally, the language contained in the Texas Cost-Sharing contract  		anticipates that coordination will be needed between the SNPs Medicare  		services and separately managed long-term services. (This contract capitates  		cost-sharing only, so long-term services, when needed, will be accessed on a  		fee-for-service basis or through Star+Plus plans, depending on the region.)  		Texas does not include any payment for care coordination in this contract, but  		creates a clear expectation that the SNP will provide it as needed to  		coordinate with Medicaid.</p>
<p>Consumer participation in care planning is an important concept that has  		been emphasized increasingly in Medicaid home and community-based waiver and  		other long-term services programs. This emphasis is evident to varying degrees  		in SNP-state contracts that include long-term services, as shown in  		<a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table11">Table 11</a>.</p>
<p>Arguably, the New Mexico language goes the farthest to assert consumer  		control, and this may be related to the program design. The New Mexico program  		was designed as a mandatory Medicaid long-term services program, with Medicare  		integration as a secondary goal. The program includes younger persons with  		disabilities, who, in most states, advocate more forcefully for consumer  		control than older persons. </p>
<h2>Access/Network Adequacy</h2>
<p>SNP-state contracts have requirements related to the adequacy of SNP  		provider networks that go beyond federal MA requirements. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table12">Table 12</a> shows how this is approached in contracts with  		capitated Medicaid services (Minnesota and New York), and how Texas approaches  		the issue in its cost-sharing contract.</p>
<p>By referencing all Covered Services and all of the benefits  		in Appendix K-1 and K-2, Minnesota and New York create broad  		adequacy expectations that apply to all of the Medicare and Medicaid services  		provided through those SNPs. </p>
<p>In the Texas Cost-Sharing contract, the goal is better coordination  		between the SNPs Medicare services and Medicaid services that will be  		provided out-of-network. Rather than focusing on the network, the state has  		created a standard around notification. The SNP must have and notify its  		members and providers about Medicaid providers in the region. </p>
<p>In addition to general adequacy standards, SNP-State contracts have  		provisions specific to long-term services. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table13">Table 13</a>  		shows a range of approaches to ensuring access to long-term services.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, very specific types of long-term services are defined and  		workforce qualifications are specified. (In addition to the personal care  		assistant [PCA] example shown here, the contract defines, for example, Home  		Health Aide, Specialized Medical Supplies and Equipment, Adult Companion  		Services, Adult Day Care, Respite Care and Homemaker services.) </p>
<p>New Mexico requires SNPs to train their network providers regarding the  		CoLTS program. Texas, which does not include long-term services in its  		cost-sharing contracts with SNPs, requires the SNPs to provide training to  		their Medicare network providers regarding Medicaid long-term services, making  		it more likely that the Medicare providers will know how and where to make  		long-term service referrals.</p>
<p>Many traditional Medicaid long-term services are informal relative to  		Medicare services, and are not necessarily familiar to MA plans. Some long-term  		services advocates fear that the process of Medicaid-Medicare service  		integration will formalize and medicalize long-term services.  		Having specific contract provisions that describe long-term services and the  		qualifications of those who deliver them, and requiring training of the  		SNPs network providers, are ways of addressing these concerns.</p>
<h2>Data Reporting</h2>
<p>Most SNP-state contracts require submission of encounter data to the  		state, although the scope of encounters varies. Minnesota and New York both  		require all Medicare and Medicaid encounters to be submitted, while New Mexico  		requires only Medicaid encounters. This probably reflects the fact that New  		Mexico CoLTS is primarily a Medicaid long-term services programs, with only a  		small minority of members also enrolled in the SNPs Medicare products.  		The Texas Cost-Sharing contract calls for submission of Medicare encounters to  		the state, presumably so the state can assess the appropriateness of its  		cost-sharing capitation amount from year to year.</p>
<p>Some states require SNPs to submit copies of information provided to CMS  		as part of the MA bid and cost reporting processes. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table14">Table  		14</a> provides examples. In Minnesota, Medicare bid information is provided  		directly to the states actuaries. </p>
<p>Some states also require functional data to be submitted, as shown in  		<a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table15">Table 15</a>. Although none of these states presently use  		this functional data to adjust payments for risk, they may be using the  		information to compare their SNP-based programs with other programs, including  		fee-for-service. They may also be using the data to develop and test risk  		adjustment methods for future application.</p>
<p>States also require SNPs to submit a range of performance data. These  		are addressed in the next section.</p>
<h2>Quality Provisions</h2>
<p>State contracts tend to build on the Medicare quality requirements that  		SNPs are already required to follow. Typically, the state contract calls for  		SNPs to submit copies of whatever quality data they are providing to CMS, which  		often includes Medicare Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)  		data, Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data  		and the Health Outcome Survey (HOS). <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table16">Table 16</a> offers  		examples.</p>
<p>States appear to be balancing a desire to integrate and streamline  		quality reporting with a need to collect data that is specifically relevant to  		dual eligibles. Minnesota, for instance, allows SNPs to use Medicare  		Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs) to meet Medicaid requirements, but only  		if the PIPs are approved by the state as being applicable to its population.  		New Mexico specifies that the states Medicaid version of CAHPS must be  		used, and duals must be included in the survey. </p>
<p>States also supplement Medicare quality requirements with provisions  		addressing care coordination and long-term services. <a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table17">Table  		17</a> offers examples.</p>
<p><a href="medicaid-contracts-medicare-special-needs-plans-reflect-diverse-state-approaches-dually-eligible-beneficiaries.html#table18">Table 18</a> illustrates how the primary orientation  		of a program influences contract language on grievances and appeals. The  		Minnesota contract, with its emphasis on dual eligibility, recognizes both  		Medicare and Medicaid processes in its SNP contract, making clear that  		beneficiaries have access to either or both. New Mexico specifies a Medicaid  		grievance system without mention of Medicare, again reflecting that the CoLTS  		program is primarily a mandatory Medicaid managed care program with a minority  		of members dually enrolled for Medicare. </p>
<h2>Financial Incentives</h2>
<p>At least two of the contracts contain provisions for special financial  		incentives. The Minnesota contract specifies two areas, dental access and  		geriatric evaluation, where plans are required to participate by passing on  		special incentive payments to providers. The New Mexico contract allows the  		state to provide incentives for exceptional performance, but does not target  		particular areas.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>SNPs were initially authorized by Congress as specialty MA plans with a  		focus on improving care for vulnerable subsets of Medicare beneficiaries,  		including persons dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. In the early years  		of the program, Dual Eligible SNPs proliferated, yet only a small minority had  		formal contracts with state Medicaid programs. In amending the program to  		require SNP-state contracts, Congress expressed clearly an expectation that  		Dual Eligible SNPs actively coordinate Medicare and Medicaid services. Although  		the requirement currently applies only to new SNPs and expanding SNPs, Congress  		seems poised to raise the bar for all SNPs. At least one health reform bill  		(Senate Bill 1796) would require all Dual Eligible SNPs to hold both Medicare  		<i>and</i> Medicaid contracts for their members by January 1, 2013. </p>
<p>Congress and CMS continue to refine the policy objectives of the SNP  		program, largely from the perspective of the nationally uniform Medicare  		program. (SNPs are, first and foremost, MA plans.) The contracts in this  		analysis, however, demonstrate that states engage with SNPs to achieve a broad  		range of Medicaid policy goals. As Congress continues to work on improving the  		SNP program, its challenge is to set standards while allowing sufficient  		flexibility to make Dual Eligible SNPs effective partners in meeting a broad  		range of state Medicaid program goals.</p>
