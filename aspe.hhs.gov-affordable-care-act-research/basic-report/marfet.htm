<hr /><p>Striking changes have occurred in marriage and family behavior during  		the past several decades. These include large increases in delayed marriage and  		divorce, in adolescent and premarital sexual activity, in the incidence of  		abortion, and in non-marital childbearing. As large as these changes have been,  		other waves of change have come and gone over the years, and it is possible  		that many of the changes that we have seen are part of such an ebb and flow  		(Vinovskis, 1988). On the other hand, the magnitude of some of the changes is  		so great that it is possible that they represent real secular changes in  		behavior.</p>
<p>Whether the changes are transitory or permanent has important  		implications for policy. For example, if policies are developed and implemented  		which lack support among youth, then it will be difficult to effect change just  		by changing law or policy. The reverse is also the case. If policies are being  		considered that have considerable underlying support, then their likelihood of  		success if implemented is much greater. In addition, if the data suggest that  		current trends are likely to continue, rather than abate or reverse, then it is  		necessary to plan for the future with this expectation in mind.</p>
<p>One way to gauge whether recent changes are likely to hold at least over  		the next decade or two is to examine whether the trends in behavior are at odds  		with the attitudes and values of youth currently coming of age in the United  		States. A second kind of evidence comes from examining whether the trends are  		in opposition to or in keeping with trends in technology. That is, are  		technological advances likely to support the recent trends? Another type of  		evidence is provided by an assessment of whether the short-term changes are in  		keeping with truly long-term changes, that is changes over the last 100 or 200  		years. In addition, comparisons with comparable modern industrialized  		democracies can also contribute to an understanding of the permanence of  		current patterns. In the current paper, however, we will consider primarily the  		first kind of evidence, that is, the extent to which current patterns are  		supported by the attitudes and values of contemporary young people.</p>
<p>Evidence regarding current trends in sexual, fertility and marital  		behavior will first be highlighted and then evidence regarding their permanence  		will be presented and discussed.</p>
<h2>TRENDS</h2>
<p>Detailed data on sexual, marital, and fertility behavior are presented  		in <b>U.S. Children and Their Families: Current Conditions and Recent Trends,  		1989</b>. Summaries of the relevant information are presented in Figures 1  		through 4.</p>
<h3>Sexual Activity Among Teenagers</h3>
<p><a href="marfet.htm#figure1A">Figure 1-A</a> depicts levels of sexual activity  		among female adolescents aged 15 and aged 18 between 1971 and 1988.  		Unfortunately, data are not yet available that can provide a clear time trend.  		Thus data for the time period 1971-1982 cover a different sample than the data  		for 1982 and 1988. Comparing the two 1982 estimates, however, shows that  		adding-in married teens elevates estimates of sexual activity only  		slightly.</p>
<p>A clear age trend is evident in the data. Older youth are two to three  		times as likely to be sexually experienced.</p>
<p>A secular increase in levels of sexual activity is also readily apparent  		for white females. However, after rising during the early seventies, the  		percentage has gone down slightly during the eighties for black females,  		especially for the younger group. From these data, it appears that sexual  		activity among black females is no longer increasing, though the proportion  		sexually experienced has plateaued at a high level, with a substantial majority  		initiating sex before the end of their high school years.</p>
<p>For white females, on the other hand, sexual activity was still on the  		increase through 1988; consequently, where young black women were once far more  		likely to have had intercourse than their white peers, the two groups are now  		about equal. In 1988, two out of three females age 18 were experienced, and one  		out of four of those age 15.</p>
<p>Among teen males, the story has been somewhat different.  		<a href="marfet.htm#figure1B">Figure 1-B</a> depicts levels of sexual activity among male  		adolescents aged 17 and aged 19 between 1979 and 1988. By age 17, a majority of  		males are sexually experienced -- two in three non-blacks and nine in ten  		blacks. By age 19, 85% of non-blacks and nearly all blacks have had sex. These  		proportions represent substantial increases over the proportions recorded in  		1979 for both race groups. While the percentage who are experienced has gone up  		for non-black youth, it has risen even more quickly for the black youth, to the  		point where slightly more black 17-year-olds have had intercourse than  		non-black 19-year-olds. ("Non-black" includes not only "whites" but also  		hispanics and other minorities.)</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1A" id="figure1A"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/67931/marffg1A.jpg" /></a></div>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1B" id="figure1B"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/67931/marffg1B.JPG" /></a></div>
<p>In summary, levels of sexual activity have increased substantially for  		males, both black and white, and for white females. A substantial majority of  		youth in all race and sex groups were sexually experienced by the end of their  		high school years.</p>
<h3>Pregnancy, Abortion, and Childbearing Trends</h3>
<p><a href="marfet.htm#figure2">Figure 2</a> presents trend data on the incidence of  		pregnancy, childbearing, and abortion, among teens aged 15 to 19 during the  		years 1973 through 1985. (1985 is the most recent year for which abortion data  		are available. Since data on abortion are essential for the estimation of  		pregnancy, more recent trends cannot be estimated.)</p>
<p>During the seventies, the incidence of pregnancy rose moderately as the  		birth rate declined. This disparity is explained by the rising abortion rate at  		the time. From 1979 to 1985, the pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates held  		steady at around 11%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. In other words, more than one  		in ten females age 15-19 becomes pregnant annually; nearly half terminate their  		pregnancies in abortion; and no improvement has been charted in over a  		decade.</p>
<h3>Non-Marital Childbearing Among Teens</h3>
<p><a href="marfet.htm#figure3">Figure 3</a> illustrates the increasing proportion of  		births to adolescents that have occurred outside of marriage. Despite the  		legalization of abortion, striking increases have occurred in the proportion of  		non-marital births that are carried to term outside of marriage.</p>
<p>Among mothers younger than age 20, the percentage of births that  		occurred outside marriage went up 7 to 11 points every five years from 1960 to  		1985. As of 1987, nearly two-thirds of teen births were non-marital; moreover,  		the proportion has risen every single year since 1960. This dramatic increase  		should be taken not as an illustration of rising rates of teen pregnancy but,  		rather, as an indication of the shrinking proportion of teen mothers who are  		married when they give birth.</p>
<p>Striking changes have also occurred in the number of births occurring to  		teens within and outside of marriage. There has been a decline in the number of  		births to teens since 1970, reflecting primarily a decline in the number of  		teens, and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the teenage birth rate. Despite  		fewer births, the number of non-marital births to teens has risen, from 199,900  		in 1970 to 302,541 in 1987. Correspondingly, the number of marital births to  		teens has declined from 456,560 in 1970 to 170,082 in 1987. Clearly, the  		propensity to marry has fallen precipitously among teens who are parents.</p>

<h3>Marriage and Divorce</h3>
<p><a href="marfet.htm#figure4A">Figure 4-A</a> and <a href="marfet.htm#figure4B">Figure  		4-B</a> illustrate several aspects of American's changing marriage-related  		choices. First, the increasing age at which half of all young people marry is  		shown separately for males and females. Second, the partial substitution of  		cohabitation for marriage is depicted.</p>
<p><a href="marfet.htm#figure4A">Figure 4-A</a> shows that after rising only  		minimally during the sixties and early seventies, the median age at first  		marriage rose by approximately two years of age for males and females alike  		between 1975 and 1985. As of 1988, this number was roughly 26 years of age for  		males and 24 for females. (The difference in age by gender has remained  		relatively constant.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, "never-married" does not necessarily mean "never  		lived in a union." As shown in <a href="marfet.htm#figure4B">Figure 4-B</a>, in 1985,  		only 14 percent of youth had married by age 20, but an additional 9 percent had  		cohabited, resulting in 23 percent having been in a union before age 20. While  		the proportion of youth who have married by age 20 displayed more than a  		50-percent decrease between 1970 and 1985 -- from 27 percent to 14 percent --  		the proportion who have always lived a single lifestyle rose by less than 10  		percent (see <a href="marfet.htm#figure4B">Figure 4-B</a>.) This disparity is explained  		by the increase in cohabitation by age 20, which jumped from 2 percent in 1970  		to 9 percent in 1985.</p>
<p>The remarkable rise in the incidence of divorce in the United States is  		summarized in <a href="marfet.htm#figure5">Figure 5</a>. The rate per 1,000 married women  		shot up from roughly 9 in 1960 to 23 in 1979. While the divorce rate has  		leveled off during the eighties, it has levelled off at a plateau twice as high  		as the divorce rate in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Clearly the changes in American family life have been substantial. Are  		they likely to be lasting?</p>
<p>In 1987, Wave 3 of the National Survey of Children was conducted. At the  		time of this third wave, youth in the survey were aged 18 to 22. In this  		survey, respondents were asked a number of attitudinal questions on topics  		ranging from welfare policy to housework. A variety of questions also dealt  		with the issues of early sexual activity, abortion, out-of-wedlock  		childbearing, marriage, and divorce. The answers given by youth to these  		questions are discussed in the next section as they pertain to each of the  		changing behaviors of youth just described.</p>

<h2>ATTITUDES REGARDING SEXUAL ACTIVITY</h2>
<p>Respondents were asked whether they felt "It is wrong for someone who is  		16 to 17 years old to have sex before marriage" and whether "It is wrong for  		someone who is 14-15 years old to have sex before marriage." The question  		concerning adolescents aged 16-17 was asked first. The responses of the youth  		to these questions are presented in <a href="marfet.htm#table1">Table 1</a>. Responses  		are presented separately by race and by gender, because behavior varies  		substantially across these sub-groups.</p>
<p>The young women and men aged 18 to 22 in the sample make a clear and  		strong distinction between what they feel is appropriate for adolescents aged  		14 and 15 and those slightly older. Eighty to ninety percent of the youth feel  		that sex is wrong at the younger ages (87 percent of the total sample). on the  		other hand, between 43 and 63 percent feel that sex is wrong at ages 15 and 16  		(52 percent of the total sample). In addition, between a quarter and a half of  		young adults don't just agree but strongly agree that sex is wrong for younger  		adolescents. At ages 16-17, however, only a minority of youth feel strongly  		that sex is wrong.</p>
<p>In each case, non-black females hold the most conservative attitudes  		about early--sexual activity. Black females are similar to black males in the  		proportion who accept early sex; but among those who disapprove, black females  		are considerably more likely to feel strongly that sex is wrong. Non-black  		males, most of whom are white, are the least likely to agree that early sex is  		wrong. Even among this sub-group, however, 84% feel that sex is wrong at ages  		14-15 and nearly half feel sex is wrong at ages 16-17.</p>
<p>It would appear from these data that quite a substantial proportion of  		young adults oppose early entry into sexual activity. While one inevitably  		suspects that youth interviewed by adults may be providing somewhat more  		conservative attitudes than the attitudes they project in the locker room or at  		the shopping mall, the question to which they are responding is a strong one,  		requiring a moral judgment. Another question on whether early sex is risky,  		dumb, a mistake, etc., might be even more likely to elicit disapproving  		responses. On the other hand, peer pressure to engage in sex provides a "push"  		in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>According to data from the Gallup Study of American Youth, 1977-1988, a  		quarter of teens aged 13 to 17 interviewed by telephone in 1988 reported that  		they had experienced either a great deal or some pressure from their peers to  		have sexual relations.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="marfet.htm#table2">Table 2</a> presents responses to a similar question  		in the 1987 wave of the National Survey of Children from respondents aged 18 to  		22, separately by race and sex. Respondents were asked to "think about your  		teen years" and were asked a series of questions about that time, including  		whether, "My friends encouraged me to have sex." Only about one in ten  		non-black females agreed, but one in four black females felt their friends  		encouraged sex, as did one in three white males and one in two black males.  		Although the proportion of females who felt such pressure is fairly small, more  		substantial proportions of males felt pressured by their friends. Given the  		sensitivity of teenagers to the opinions of their peers (Anderson, 1989), one  		can imagine that such encouragement is felt keenly.</p>
<p>We also explored the other side of the coin -- whether pressure to  		postpone sex was experienced. When asked whether, "My mother discouraged me  		from having sex," strong sex differences emerged, but minimal race differences  		are evident (see <a href="marfet.htm#table3">Table 3</a>). Approximately six in ten  		females feel they received discouragement from their mothers about sex. A  		little more than a third of males received such discouragement. Thus, females  		are the recipients of less pressure to have sex and more pressure to avoid sex  		than are males.</p>
<p>When the reasons of virgins for remaining virgin are explored (see  		<a href="marfet.htm#table4">Table 4</a>), it is clear that values are important to those  		youth who have postponed sex to their late teens and early twenties. The  		relevant values are those of the youth, of family members, and religious  		values. It is the case, though, that early sex is avoided for reasons of values  		primarily by white youth. Relatively few black males or females give such a  		reason for remaining a virgin. For example, 85% of non-black females but only  		30% of black females state that "I want to wait until I'm married." Similarly,  		53% of male non-black virgins prefer to wait until marriage, compared with 26%  		of comparable blacks. Also, white virgins are significantly more likely to feel  		that premarital sex is "against my religion." Fear of their family finding out  		is not a major concern of youth aged 18-22, except for non-black females, among  		whom 29% cite this factor as a reason for postponing sexual activity. It should  		be noted, though, that practical, non-moral reasons also motivate youth to  		postpone sex. Concern about pregnancy and catching a disease are important  		reasons for avoiding sex, as are more opportunistic factors, such as not having  		found the right person or not having found an opportunity. Hence, while one can  		cite strong evidence of disapproval with regard to early, premarital sex, by  		the late teens and early twenties, even among youth remaining virgin practical  		and opportunistic factors are as important as moral reasons for delaying sexual  		activity. Non-black female virgins share a near consensus on the importance of  		waiting for marriage; while personal and family values seem to be considerably  		less important reasons for postponing sex among black youth.</p>

</tr></table><p>Given the strong and very general disapproval of youth aged 18-22 for  		sexual activity at ages 14-15, the incidence of sexual activity at these ages  		is surprisingly high. For example, 92% of white females disapprove of sex among  		14-15 year-olds, yet preliminary data from the National Survey of Family Growth  		(London, 1989) indicate that 18% of 15-year-olds had had sex in 1982 and 29%  		had had sex in 1988.</p>
<p>Other analyses of the NSC (Moore, Nord and Peterson, 1989) indicate that  		a substantial proportion of early sexual activity is non-voluntary. This factor  		undoubtedly accounts for some of the discrepancy between personal attitudes and  		behavior. In addition, it may be that teens aged 14-15 are less disapproving  		and that it is only with the wisdom of "age" that young adults come to feel sex  		is wrong during the early teen years. On the other hand, it seems likely that  		there is considerable cultural support for delaying sexual activity into the  		middle and later teen years. The sanctioned delay is rather brief, however.  		With nearly half the sample of youth accepting of sexual activity at ages  		16-17, it is clear that social support for chastity wanes rather rapidly during  		the teen years.</p>
<h2>ATTITUDES CONCERNING PREGNANCY</h2>
<p>Beyond their feelings about the appropriateness and morality of sexual  		activity <b>per se</b>, the opinions of youth about pregnancy, abortion and  		early childbearing also weigh in, at least theoretically, as factors affecting  		their sexual and fertility behavior. Data from the National Survey of Children  		indicate clearly that youth initiating sex wish to avoid pregnancy (see  		<a href="marfet.htm#table5">Table 5</a>). Almost no youth of either gender, race, or  		age-at-first-sex group wanted a pregnancy to occur when they started having  		sex. Non-trivial proportions of youth who were 17 or younger when they first  		had sex reported that they "didn't think about it [pregnancy]," and teens who  		were younger when they initiated sex are significantly less resolved to avoid  		pregnancy than are older teens, but it is clear that early parenthood was not  		the goal of those initiating sex. In fact, youth are highly negative in their  		assessment of adolescent parenthood.</p>
<p><a href="marfet.htm#table6">Table 6</a> and <a href="marfet.htm#table7">Table 7</a> depict  		the responses of youth to two rather strongly-worded questions: "Becoming an  		unmarried mother is one of the worst things that could happen to a 16-year-old  		girl" and its counterpart for males, "Becoming an unmarried father is one of  		the worst things that could happen to a 16-year-old boy." These opinion  		questions were placed at the beginning of the NSC interview, before respondents  		had received the lengthy interview modules on fertility behavior, parenthood,  		employment and schooling, so these issues were not made salient to the  		respondent by the interview itself. Nevertheless, a substantial majority of  		youth agree that teenage parenthood is one of the worst things that could  		happen to a 16-year-old.</p>

</tr></table><p>Given the greater effect of parenthood on teenage girls relative to  		boys, it may seem surprising how little responses are affected by gender. Male  		and female respondents differ only slightly in their assessment of early  		parenthood. In addition, teenage fatherhood is assessed almost as negatively as  		teenage motherhood. Youth are more likely to "strongly agree" that motherhood  		is a disaster for a girl than for a boy; but the proportions who disagree or  		feel "it depends" do not differ. On the other hand, females differ by race.  		Black females are almost twice as likely to disagree that young unmarried  		parenthood is one of the worst things that could happen to a teen as are  		non-black females. This could mean simply that they can think of worse things  		that could happen; more likely it represents a sub-group who hold less negative  		attitudes. This interpretation receives some support in <a href="marfet.htm#table8">Table  		8</a>.</p>
<h2>ATTITUDES ABOUT NON-MARITAL CHILDBEARING</h2>
<p>The proportions expressing various degrees of disapproval of non-marital  		motherhood are depicted in <a href="marfet.htm#table8">Table 8</a> by gender and race.  		The most striking aspect of the table is the overall lack of disapproval. Less  		than one in twenty youth strongly agree that "single women should not have  		children, even if they want to. Even when those who agree are combined with  		those who agree strongly, only about one in five youth feel that single women  		should not be mothers. Whites are more likely to disapprove of single  		motherhood, while blacks are somewhat more likely to be accepting; but the  		general lack of disapproval is the more notable overall result.</p>
<h2>ABORTION ATTITUDES</h2>
<p>Despite their acceptance of out-of-wedlock childbearing in general,  		young women personally confronted with pregnancy are very likely to obtain  		abortions. Among teens who become pregnant, 46% of those under age 15, 43% of  		those aged 15-17, and 41% of those 18-19 obtain abortions (Henshaw and Van  		Vort, 1989). In keeping with this high level of resort to abortion, data from  		youth in the NSC show considerable tolerance for abortion.</p>
<p>As found in other studies (Smith, 1987), NSC youth are more accepting of  		a "hard" reason for abortion -- rape -- than they are for "social" reasons  		--being unmarried, young, or unable to raise the child (see <a href="marfet.htm#table9">Table 9</a>). Youth are the least accepting of abortions  		obtained by women who have already had an abortion. In every race/gender  		sub-group, this reason received the lowest acceptance; yet four in ten white  		males and about one in four youth in the other groups stated that they feel  		it's all right to have an abortion even if a woman has already had one  		abortion.</p>

</tr></table><p>Across the several gender/race groups, blacks are less accepting of  		abortion than whites in every comparison. With the exception of rape, where  		young women are as accepting of abortion as are young men, NSC males tend to be  		more accepting of abortion for a variety of reasons. Thus black females tend to  		be the least accepting of abortion, despite the fact that black female teens  		have an abortion rate that is twice that of white teens (Henshaw and Van Vort,  		1989). This would suggest that there is considerable readiness for a lowering  		of the very high pregnancy rate among blacks that accounts for their very high  		abortion rate.</p>
<p>Clearly youth differentiate among the reasons that women have for  		obtaining abortions, being more accepting of those "hard" reasons that actually  		account for only a small minority of abortions (Torres and Forrest, 1988).  		Nevertheless, nearly half accept abortion for social and economic reasons. The  		other side of this, of course, is that half do not accept abortion despite  		poverty, young age, and non-marriage. This suggests two conclusions.</p>
<p>First, a quite substantial proportion of these youth, who have  		essentially grown up while abortion has been legal, accept abortion for a  		variety of circumstances. These youth seem unlikely to accept a legal  		re-definition of abortion as an illegal act. On the other hand, youth,  		particularly females, make strong distinctions between abortions sought for  		"hard" versus social reasons; and many youth are not accepting of abortion for  		any reason but particularly for social reasons. This seems to suggest that  		efforts to reduce the incidence of abortion, other than efforts to make  		abortion illegal, should meet with considerable receptivity among youth. The  		group with the highest teen abortion rate, black females, are the least  		accepting of abortion. Hence there is a climate of receptivity to not only  		avoiding early parenthood but to avoiding abortion.</p>
<h2>ATTITUDES ABOUT MARRIAGE AND COHABITATION</h2>
<p>The strong secular trend toward delayed marriage is clearly supported by  		attitude data from the National Survey of Children (see <a href="marfet.htm#table10">Table 10</a>). Only a handful of respondents cited 17 or  		younger as "the best age" for them to have gotten married. Similarly, only a  		few respondents selected ages 18-19 as the best age for them to marry or to  		have married. About a quarter of the females feel that the best age to marry is  		before age 22, with white females being considerably more likely to prefer  		early marriage. About half of the NSC white females would prefer to be married  		by age 24, which accords very well with data on the median age at first  		marriage shown in <a href="marfet.htm#figure4A">Figure 4-A</a>. Black females prefer to  		delay marriage even more than white females, with about half preferring to  		marry by ages 24-25. Similarly, slightly more than half of NSC males prefer to  		marry before age 26, a proportion very much in line with the data for males  		shown in <a href="marfet.htm#figure4A">Figure 4-A</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p>Hence, it would appear that the rising age at first marriage that has  		occurred in the U.S. during the past several decades is in accord with the  		preferences of marriage-age youth and does not (solely) reflect economic or  		occupational forces. In addition, the data do not suggest a rejection of  		marriage; most youth plan to marry at some time during their twenties.</p>
<p>The one group with reservations about marriage is that of black males.  		Nearly one in six stated a preference not to ever marry. In addition, one in  		eight black males prefer to be 30 or older when they do marry.</p>
<p>In line with their reservations about marrying, black youth, are  		particularly likely to agree with the statement that "It's hard for most women  		to find a man who has a good job and wants to be married." Two-thirds of black  		males and three-quarters of black females agree with this statement (see  		<a href="marfet.htm#table11">Table 11</a>). Somewhat more surprising, half of non-black  		youth also agree with this statement. Nevertheless, the race difference in the  		proportion agreeing is large and highly significant.</p>
<p>Part of the delay in marriage has been linked to increasing cohabitation  		among youth (Bumpass, Sweet and Cherlin, 1989; see <a href="marfet.htm#figure4B">Figure  		4-B</a>). Data displayed in <a href="marfet.htm#table12">Table 12</a> indicate that,  		except for black males, more than half of NSC youth endorse living together  		before marriage as making "a lot of sense." (The reservations of black males  		may be linked to the preference of some to avoid marriage altogether.) While  		minorities feel strongly opposed to cohabitation, it would seem that most youth  		are fairly, if not strongly, supportive of the growing trend toward "living  		together."</p>
<h2>ATTITUDES ABOUT DIVORCE</h2>
<p>In accord with the acceptance youth state for cohabitation, the  		overwhelming majority feel that a couple should not get married "unless they  		are prepared to stay together for life" (see <a href="marfet.htm#table13">Table 13</a>).  		In fact, their negative feelings about divorce are sufficiently strong that one  		suspects that their acceptance of cohabitation and non-marital childbearing may  		reflect a desire to avoid entering a marriage that might eventually end in  		divorce. Black youth are, again, less certain about marriage, with one in four  		feeling marriage is all right even if a couple is not prepared to stay together  		for life, compared to about one in seven white youth. Among whites, about 84%  		agree that a couple should not marry unless they plan to remain together all  		their lives.</p>

</tr></table><p>Data in <a href="marfet.htm#table14">Table 14</a> demonstrate similar reservations  		about divorce in that about half of the sample do not feel that divorce should  		be easy, even for unhappy couples. White females are the most opposed to  		divorce. Of course, it might be stated, from an opposite perspective, that  		about half of youth think divorce should be easy if a couple is unhappy.  		Clearly, youth have fewer reservations about divorce in the face of unhappiness  		than they do about entering marriage. However, even if a couple is unhappy, six  		in ten females and five in ten males feel divorce should not be easy.</p>
<p>In this context, it bears mentioning that eight in ten males and seven  		in ten females feel that children do better with both parents, and that two in  		three youth feel that "when parents divorce, children develop permanent  		emotional problems." With such negative attitudes about divorce, it is not  		surprising that youth have reservations about entering marriage.</p>
<p>On the basis of the responses of youth to these several items, it might  		be fairly concluded that youth hold generally negative attitudes about divorce,  		though nearly half do accept divorce for unhappy couples. A logical question at  		this point is the extent to which negative attitudes about divorce arise from  		the youth's personal experiences with divorce. The hypothesis is that youth who  		have experienced disruption in their own families would be more cautious about  		entering marriage, but perhaps more tolerant of marital disruption in the case  		of unhappiness.</p>
<p>To address this question, the data in the previous three tables were  		partitioned according to whether the young person's two biological parents had  		formed an intact marriage. <a href="marfet.htm#table15">Table 15</a>, for example,  		duplicates the data in <a href="marfet.htm#table10">Table 10</a> on the best age to get  		married, but shows it by the additional "intact/disrupted" distinction. Youth  		whose parents never married, or who married but separated or divorced, are  		included in the category "disrupted." Youth whose parents married and remained  		married, including those few cases in which one partner died, are included in  		the category "intact."</p>
<p>There is no clear evidence in these data that youth exposed to family  		disruption are more likely to delay marriage. (It may be the case that an  		association is obscured by social and economic correlates of age at marriage;  		but such an examination is beyond the scope of this paper.) In fact, youth from  		disrupted families are less likely to insist upon a life-long marital  		commitment than are youth from intact families (see <a href="marfet.htm#table16">Table  		16</a>). In each race/gender subgroup, youth whose biological parents have  		married and remained married are significantly more likely to feel that a  		couple should not get married unless they are prepared to stay together for  		life. It should be noted, however, that even among youth from disrupted  		backgrounds, a majority consistently oppose entering marriage without a  		lifelong commitment.</p>

</tr></table><p>On the other hand, youth's feelings about the ease of divorce are not  		affected by family background among whites. There is an effect among blacks;  		but the effects are in opposite directions for males and females (see  		<a href="marfet.htm#table17">Table 17</a>). Black males from disrupted backgrounds are  		significantly more likely to agree that divorce should be easy for unhappy  		couples, while black females from disrupted families are somewhat more likely  		to oppose easy divorce. Again, the evidence is clearer with regard to making a  		marriage commitment, with blacks and youth from disrupted families somewhat  		more accepting of marriage without a lifelong commitment, than it is regarding  		the acceptability of eventual divorce.</p>
<p>There is one topic, however, on which youth from disrupted backgrounds  		do feel more strongly than youth from intact families. That issue is child  		support (see <a href="marfet.htm#table18">Table 18</a>).</p>
<p>Particularly among white males, but to some extent among white females  		as well, youth whose own parents, marriage was disrupted are more likely to  		feel that an absent father should pay child support, despite a variety of  		extenuating circumstances. For example, 73% of white males from disrupted  		families feel the father should pay child support even if the father has  		another family to support, compared to 65% among comparable males from intact  		families. Similarly, 41% in the disrupted category believe in child support if  		the mother has remarried, compared to 20% of those from intact families.</p>
<p>Overall, youth are generally favorable toward child support unless it  		would force a father who is in high school to leave school. Whites tend to feel  		that remarriage and a mother who prevents a father from seeing the child are  		excuses for not paying child support; but blacks do not ease up in these cases  		to the same extent. In fact, overall, with only one exception (black males are  		more likely to see high school enrollment as a justifiable exception), a higher  		proportion of blacks than whites favor child support. This may reflect the  		higher rate of non-marriage and marital disruption in the black community.  		Given the stronger feelings of white youth from disrupted family backgrounds  		compared with white youth from intact families, it seems that experience with  		father-absent families leads to stronger attitudes favoring child support.</p>

<p>Despite major changes in the marriage and fertility behaviors of  		contemporary Americans, the attitudes of youth about these changes have been  		somewhat slower to change. Nevertheless, the attitudes and values of youth do  		reflect the period in which they have grown up. Most important, the opinions  		expressed by youth show important opportunities for policy leverage, as well as  		some areas in which behavior change may be resisted. Because the attitudes of  		youth vary greatly from topic to topic, each issue must be discussed in  		turn.</p>
<p>Regarding sexual intercourse during adolescence, it is clear that,  		despite increases in the proportions of youth initiating sex during their early  		teen years, the vast majority of older teens feel that sex is wrong for 14- and  		15-year-olds. The disapproval weakens for 16- and 17-year-olds, however,  		suggesting that there is strong support for abstinence among young people  		themselves in the early teen years and into the middle teen years but waning  		support in the late teen years. Given the acceptance of youth for the trend  		toward premarital sex during the later teen years, support for sustained and  		correct contraceptive use among older adolescents seems essential. On the other  		hand, a striking degree of support is evident for abstinence during the early  		teen years.</p>
<p>Regarding peer pressure, a third of white males and half of black males  		report having been pressured by peers to have sex when they were teens, but  		only a third report that their mothers discouraged sex. Hence there are clear  		opportunities for programs to undercut peer pressure and to encourage parents  		to become more involved, particularly among male adolescents. Female  		adolescents receive less peer pressure to have sex and more discouragement from  		mothers; but many adolescent females are also the objects of pressure to have  		sex and about four in ten die not feel discouraged to have sex by their  		mothers, so efforts may be appropriate fore both groups.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority, particularly among whites, feel that both teen  		motherhood and teen fatherhood are disasters -- "one of the worst things that  		could happen" to a 16-year-old. In addition, the vast majority of sexually  		experienced youth report wanting to avoid pregnancy when they initiated sex.  		Hence, most youth can be expected to be receptive to programs intended to  		prevent pregnancy. One caveat is that black youth feel less negative about  		early pregnancy and parenthood than do white youth. Nevertheless, even among  		blacks, a large majority hold negative attitudes about adolescent  		pregnancy.</p>
<p>Youth also hold mixed but fairly negative attitudes about abortion. With  		the exception of rape, the sample is quite divided on the acceptability of  		abortion. The group least accepting of abortion is the group that most often  		obtains abortions -- black females. Hence, considerable receptivity exists not  		only for postponing sex in early adolescence and for preventing early pregnancy  		and childbearing, but for preventing abortion as well. It bears mentioning,  		however, that one-third to two-thirds of the sample are accepting of abortion  		for social reasons such as being young or unmarried. This suggests that laws to  		prohibit abortion would face considerable resistance. Since considerable and  		relatively unequivocal support exists for prevention, programs stressing  		prevention may be the most-productive avenue for policy initiatives.</p>
<p>Regarding marriage, contemporary young adults hold strong attitudes.  		They prefer delayed marriage, in keeping with the trend toward being older at  		first marriage, and they feel strongly that couples should not marry unless  		they intend to remain together for life. However, most youth plan to marry at  		some time during their twenties. Only among black males does a substantial  		proportion prefer to avoid marriage, with about one in six black males  		expressing this preference.</p>
<p>Perhaps reflecting their perception of this attitude, but probably also  		reflecting the relatively poor job prospects of black males, three-quarters of  		black females feel that it's "hard for most women to find a man who has a good  		job and wants to be married." Since the propensity to marry is there for most  		youth, programs might help by strengthening employment prospects, particularly  		for blacks. It is important to note that, despite discouragement about the  		prospects for marriage, most youth plan to marry and favor a commitment to a  		lifelong marriage.</p>
<p>Although youth from disrupted families are significantly less likely to  		require a lifelong commitment, a substantial majority even within this group  		favor such a commitment.</p>
<p>In keeping with their reservations about marriage, about half of the  		youth feel cohabitation is a good idea and only about one in five are opposed  		to non-marital childbearing.</p>
<p>Youth tend to hold highly negative attitudes about divorce. Only about  		half think divorce should be easy for unhappy couples; about three-quarters  		feel that children do better with two parents; and two-thirds feel that  		"children develop permanent emotional problems" when their parents divorce. In  		addition, youth favor child support, and youth from disrupted families tend to  		feel even more strongly than youth whose parents married and remained  		married.</p>
<p>In sum from the perspective of discouraging early and unwanted pregnancy  		and single parenthood, data on the attitudes and values of youth are more  		hopeful than the data on trends in behavior. Youth are skeptical about early  		sexual activity, and very opposed to early pregnancy and to abortion. In  		addition, they favor marriage with a lifelong commitment, are concerned about  		the consequences of divorce for children, and are strongly in favor of child  		support. While they accept childbearing outside of marriage, they feel that  		children do better with two parents. While many youth feel discouraged about  		the prospects for women to find an employed man who wants to be married, most  		youth do want to marry, generally during their twenties. Policies that can be  		constructed to support youth in bringing their behavior in line with their  		attitudes may be able to affect the behavioral trends that have caused so much  		concern during the past several decades.</p>
