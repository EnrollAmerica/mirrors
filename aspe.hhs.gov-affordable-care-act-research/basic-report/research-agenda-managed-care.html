<h2>December 5, 1994</h2>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This paper provides background information for a meeting on managed care  		and people with disabilities. The meeting will be hosted by the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation's Office of Disability, Aging,  		and Long-Term Care Policy in Washington, D.C. on December 5, 1994. </p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting is to: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Review the implications of the movement toward managed health care  			 for people with physical and mental disabilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flesh out a program of research and demonstration which improves our  			 understanding of the impact of managed care on people with disabilities and how  			 it can become more responsive to their needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In particular, we ask you to help us: (1) assess the benefits and risks  		that managed care may pose to people with disabilities; (2) identify key policy  		concerns that the Federal Government and States must consider in designing  		managed care initiatives for people with disabilities; (3) highlight relevant  		research that has been done or is currently underway; and (4) suggest policy  		relevant projects and studies which ASPE might pursue. </p>
<h2>II. CONCEPTUAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK </h2>
<h3>A. Defining Managed Care For Individuals with  		Disabilities</h3>
<p>In this paper we use the term "managed care" very broadly to refer to  		health care systems that integrate either the financing, the delivery or both  		of primary care, acute care and, much less frequently, long-term supports. The  		goal of managed care is to control health care costs and improve access to and  		continuity and coordination across a continuum of services. Managed care plans  		can range from prepayment models with full capitation to fee for service plans  		where a primary care case manager authorizes all covered services provided by  		others. Managed care can also refer to a network of providers who coordinate  		their efforts on behalf of an individual client without consolidating  		decision-making or risk in a single entity. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this paper, "individuals with disabilities" includes  		individuals of all ages with ongoing conditions or chronic illnesses that  		result in a need for extra medical services or assistance with daily living  		tasks. It is important to note that most experience to date in managed care for  		individuals with disabilities has been focused on elderly individuals (e.g.,  		Social Health Maintenance Organizations (SHMO) Program of All Inclusive Care  		for the Elderly (PACE), TEFRA HMOs). In this paper, we will generalize this  		experience to the disabled population to the extent possible, but readers  		should be aware that the comparison will not be absolute due to the different  		characteristics and needs of younger people (including children) with  		disabilities and the elderly disabled. An additional challenge for readers of  		this paper and participants in the expert meeting will be to look at the extent  		to which the SHMO and PACE models are replicable across the age spectrum. </p>
<h3>B. The Policy Context: Health Care Reform</h3>
<p>Our interest in the implications of managed care for people with  		disabilities arises from our participation in the health care reform debate and  		the aftermath of that debate. Clearly, the Administration's health care  		proposal put a tremendous emphasis on managed care as a vehicle for controlling  		health care costs and moving toward universal health care coverage. The great  		promise of managed care is that it will allow people to receive a more  		appropriate range of services at less cost to themselves and to public  		programs. </p>
<p>We have talked with many people from the disability community over the  		past two years in conjunction with our work around health care reform. We heard  		little about the promise of managed care and much about their fears and  		concerns. Here are the kinds of questions they asked us. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Why won't the private insurance market continue to select out people  			 with significant disabilities, further perpetuating a two tiered system...one  			 for healthy people and one for people with chronic conditions and disabilities?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will managed care plans achieve cost savings? Will they limit  			 the access of people with disabilities to essential health services like  			 preventive care, rehabilitation services and comprehensive drug coverage?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will long-term needs for rehabilitation, personal assistance  			 services and assistive devices be treated? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the amount of services be limited by arbitrary cost caps?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will utilization controls deter people with disabilities from  			 seeking specialty care? Will doctors with specialized experience in caring for  			 people with disabilities even be allowed to participate in managed care plans?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the gatekeepers for managed care plans have enough experience  			 to understand the special needs of people with mental or physical disabilities?  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In today's climate, where universal health care reform seems less  		likely, State reform initiatives also appear to be directed toward the creation  		of managed care systems. In this case the goal is to achieve savings in public  		programs, particularly Medicaid, and reinvest at least some of the savings in  		covering previously uninsured lower income groups. </p>
<p>Within the last few years we have witnessed a dramatic growth in the  		number of States requesting Medicaid waivers which allow them to mandate the  		enrollment of Medicaid recipients in managed care arrangements. Currently,  		statewide reform efforts using the 1115 waiver authority have been approved in  		six States and over ten new waiver proposals or amendments have been submitted  		to HCFA. </p>
<p>There is significant variation in the extent to which statewide reform  		efforts seek to include people with disabilities in their managed care  		arrangements and the extent to which both acute care and long-term care needs  		are addressed. Washington State's plan to provide health and long-term care  		services to all it's citizens is the most comprehensive State proposal at this  		point. The State of Oregon, which already has an approved waiver to create a  		managed care system for the AFDC population, now has a proposal into HCFA to  		cover aged, blind, and disabled SSI recipients. Rhode Island, Tennessee and  		Florida also are considering mandating the participation of various populations  		with disabilities in their statewide reform efforts. </p>
<p>Regardless of the movement around comprehensive statewide health care  		reform initiatives, the proportion of Medicaid recipients in managed care has  		steadily increased. At least 16 States enroll the SSI disabled population in  		Medicaid managed care plans. Many of these recipients participate in 1915(b)  		(freedom of choice) waiver programs. A recent study conducted by Brandeis  		University estimated that about 12% of SSI disabled Medicaid recipients are now  		in managed care arrangements. </p>
<p>The greatest momentum around managed care is in the private sector. Some  		private sector plans extend managed care principles by creating arrangements  		for populations with special needs (e.g., the management of subacute care by  		hospitals and SNFs; the development of contracts between providers of  		rehabilitation services and employer based health plans; new forms of home  		health care to manage high risk and special populations). </p>
<p>Of particular interest to our goals is the work carried out around the  		integration of acute and long- term care. The first generation efforts to  		tackle the challenge of integrating these services have been targeted on the  		elderly and carried out by the Social Health Maintenance Organizations, On Lok  		and Pace and the TEFRA HMOs'. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the  		Chronic Care Consortium are also taking leadership roles in developing new,  		integrated service delivery models. RWJ is paying particular attention to the  		application of managed care principles to the under 65 population with  		disabilities including children. </p>
<p>In short, the movement toward managed care in the public and private  		sector is an important and continuing trend that is likely to have a  		significant impact on people with disabilities. This will occur whether or not  		national health care reform is achieved any time in the near nature. </p>
<p>The remainder of this paper highlights what we believe to be critical  		policy areas and related research issues around managed care and disability.  		The paper focuses on the following topics: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>FUNCTIONAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PERSONS WITH  			 DISABILITIES IN MANAGED CARE</i> including the extent to which people with  			 disabilities participate in managed care; the demographic, functional and  			 health status characteristics of enrolles; and patterns of disenrollment.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>THE IMPACT OF MANAGED CARE</i> including how participation  			 effects access to needed services; quality; affordability and costs; and  			 individual outcomes such as consumer satisfaction, health status and  			 functioning. Also comparisons of the impact of the traditional fee for service  			 system and managed care on disabled participants. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>TARGETING</i> including whether managed health care plans can be  			 successfully organized and marketed to a broad population which includes both  			 healthy persons and persons with special needs or are more effective when  			 targeted to people who are already disabled; e.g., On Lok and Pace. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>FINANCING AND REIMBURSEMENT</i> including identifying the  			 financing barriers to successful managed care systems and new approaches to  			 overcoming these barriers including funds pooling and risk management and risk  			 adjustment methodologies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>SERVICE COVERAGE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM</i>  			 including the extent to which and how specialized services such as long-term  			 rehabilitation, assistive technology, transportation etc. are included in  			 managed care arrangements; the effectiveness of various approaches to  			 integrating acute and long-term care services; and the feasibility of operating  			 generic delivery systems for people of all ages and conditions with  			 disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>QUALITY ASSURANCE</i> including the development of new methods  			 for measuring quality such as consumer satisfaction measures and the  			 development of quality indicators for monitoring the impact of managed care on  			 people with disabilities. </p>
</li>
</ul><h2>III. ISSUES AREAS</h2>
<h3>A. Functional and Demographic Characteristics of Persons  		with Disabilities in Managed Care</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues</b></i></p>
<p>Many people with disabilities believe that managed care is a threat  			 to the delivery of high quality health services for people with special needs.  			 To make managed care more responsive requires a better understanding of how  			 today's system works. We place a very high priority on collecting basic  			 descriptive information about the experience of managed care plans in serving  			 people with disabilities, particularly persons with significant functional  			 impairments and how this experience compares with that of traditional fee for  			 service plans. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway</b></i></p>
<p>Virtually no information is available on the extent of participation  			 of younger persons with disabilities in managed care plans. Fama and Fox  			 recently analyzed the National Health Interview Survey to determine if the  			 chronically ill under age 65 are under represented in managed care plans. The  			 study concluded that people with disabilities (broadly measured) are not  			 disproportionately represented in indemnity plans suggesting that neither HMOs  			 nor indemnity plans benefit from favorable selection and that HMOs have been no  			 more successful at risk selection than indemnity plans (Fama, 1994). </p>
<p>The Medicaid program which has legged behind the private sector in  			 developing managed care arrangements, has seen a steady increase in the  			 enrollment of Medicaid recipients over the last decade. A recent survey of  			 eight States conducted by the Institute for Health Care Policy at Brandeis  			 University shows widely different participation patterns for disabled Medicaid  			 recipients. For example, in California only 3.2 % of SSI recipients were  			 enrolled in managed care plans, while in Colorado about 40% were enrolled and  			 in Kansas over 50% of SSI disabled recipients were in managed care. Arizona,  			 with the largest statewide effort to capitate both acute and long-term services  			 for Medicaid recipients, enrolled 11,699 elderly and physically disabled  			 persons and 6,437 persons with mental retardation or other developmental  			 disabilities in fully capitated plans as of January 1994. </p>
<p>Harriette Fox, et al., conducted a survey in 1993 of all State  			 Medicaid agencies to determine their policies for enrolling and serving special  			 needs children in HMOs. This survey found that one-third of the States require  			 Medicaid recipients to enroll in an HMO or other managed care plan and that  			 most of these provide some type of protection for at least some special needs  			 children. These include exemptions from enrollment, arrangements for providing  			 out of plan care, and exclusion of services from HMO contracts. However, Fox  			 concluded that in most cases, the special protections that States provide to  			 special needs children do not affect all chronically ill and disabled children  			 and may not be effective in ensuring that these children receive adequate care.  			 </p>
<p>The Medicare Risk Program (implemented under the Tax Equity and  			 Fiscal Responsibility Act or TEFRA) allows HMOs to assume responsibility for  			 providing all Medicare covered services under a capitated payment. TEFRA HMOs  			 have increasingly captured a greater percentage of the older population with  			 about 2.9 million elderly persons enrolled in 233 different plans. While there  			 is little detailed information on the experience of older persons with  			 significant disabilities in these plans, results from an evaluation conducted  			 by Mathematica (Hill and Brown, 1992) show that Medicare beneficiaries with  			 chronic health problems are less likely to enroll in HMOs. For example,  			 enrollees had fewer functional disabilities and other indicators of chronic  			 health problems than non-enrollees; they also were less likely to be over 80  			 and less likely to be Medicare-entitled because of disability rather than age.  			 Further, they were less likely to exhibit serious health problems such as  			 cancer, heart disease or stroke. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>What is the rate of participation in private managed care plans by  			 people with disabilities? in Medicaid managed care arrangements? in TEFRA HMOs?  			 Are people with disabilities disproportionately represented in the traditional  			 fee for service system in comparison to the general population? </p>
<p>What is the nature and severity of the disabilities of participants?  			 How do managed care providers identify particularly high risk persons who may  			 require intensive and high cost services? </p>
<p>What services are available in managed care plans which address the  			 needs of people with disabilities? What service use patterns typify managed  			 care participants with differing levels of disability and need? </p>
<p>What marketing, enrollment strategies, and eligibility assessments  			 are used to enroll people with disabilities in the managed care plans? </p>
<p>Are there new ways existing data can be analyzed to describe the  			 participation of people with disabilities in managed care? </p>
<p>How can we use information from the Federal Health Benefits Program,  			 consumer satisfaction surveys carried out in the private sector, national  			 survey data, private insurance data bases (MEDSTAT) and other specialized data  			 bases to better understand the number and characteristics of people with  			 disabilities in managed care? </p>
<p>What original data collection is most important to carry out to  			 describe the participation of people with disabilities in managed care and how  			 can we efficiently go about collecting it? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>B. The Impact of Managed Care</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>Some aspects of managed care have the potential to be more  			 advantageous than traditional fee for service arrangements for people with  			 disabilities. Managed care plans can ensure providers more discretion than the  			 traditional fee for service system in allocating resources. Theoretically, the  			 ability to access a more comprehensive range of services and providers can  			 enhance continuity of care, coordination, and appropriateness of services  			 provided. </p>
<p>Such discretion can even allow a shift away from institutional  			 settings to community-based services, which are widely preferred by most people  			 with disabilities. In a carefully case managed system new benefits may be added  			 without uncontrollable increases in costs. If case managers are skilled at  			 understanding the service needs of people with disabilities, more appropriate  			 as well as less costly care may result; e.g., decreased use of hospitals and  			 increased emphasis on preventive services and the timely provision of community  			 based, "low tech," long-term care services. </p>
<p>In addition, under managed care arrangements, people with  			 disabilities can potentially limit their exposure to high copayments and  			 deductibles. To the extent that managed care systems avoid extensive use of  			 copayments, enrolles are shielded from a financial threat that is particularly  			 difficult for people with chronic conditions who use a lot of care. </p>
<p>However, as we discussed at the beginning of this paper, many  			 aspects of managed care are potentially disadvantageous to people with  			 disabilities. The major concern is that more emphasis on cost savings will  			 translate into greater risk or less care or inappropriate care for the most  			 vulnerable people. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>Most of the research on managed care outcomes for people with  			 disabilities has been targeted on the elderly. The Mathematica evaluation of  			 TEFRA HMOs examined the impact of managed care on enrollees with functional  			 impairments. Results indicated that HMOs increased the probability that  			 enrollees in poor health and those with functional impairments were admitted to  			 the hospital and reduced the number of hospital days and home health visits.  			 Quality of care results suggest that these reductions are more likely the  			 result of eliminating unnecessary services or substituting other types of care  			 than of restricting access (Brown, 1993, HCFA Review). </p>
<p>A study conducted by Clement et al. in 1990 of over 12,000 Medicare  			 beneficiaries reporting joint pain or chest pain in the previous 12 month  			 period found that HMO enrolles were less likely to report seeing a specialist  			 for care, to report that follow-up had been recommended or to report that  			 progress of their symptoms had been monitored. </p>
<p>Shaughnessy et al. (1994) examined longitudinal primary data on  			 health status and service use for a random sample of 1,632 Medicare  			 beneficiaries who received care from 38-certified home health agencies. They  			 compared the cost and quality of home health care across three financial  			 arrangements: HMO-owned agencies, HMO contractual agreements, and FFS systems.  			 Several findings on utilization, cost and outcomes raise important questions  			 about the impact of managed care on elderly recipients. HMO patients averaged  			 fewer visits than FFS patients during the 60-day period following admission;  			 similarly, patients receiving care from HMO-owned agencies had fewer visits  			 than those receiving care from agencies with contractual agreements. While the  			 FFS patients were less ADL and IADL impaired than their HMO counterparts,  			 service use and patient-level costs of Medicare home health care were  			 considerably lower for HMO than for FFS beneficiaries, even after adjusting for  			 the less intense case mix of HMO patients. Further analysis indicated that FFS  			 patients exhibited significantly superior case mix-adjusted outcomes for 14 of  			 55 measures. This finding held in comparisons between FFS patients and  			 HMO-owned and HMO-contracted agencies respectively. The superiority of outcomes  			 for FFS patients, who typically received more total home health visits and by  			 discipline, suggests that HMO patients may be underserved in this area. At the  			 same time, the absence of observed differences in outcomes for selected types  			 of patients (e.g., those requiring wound care) suggests that HMOs (with lower  			 service intensity) may be more efficient that the FFS sector for certain  			 procedures. The observation that beneficiaries receiving care from HMO- owned  			 agencies are characterized by the lowest cost and most inferior case  			 mix-adjusted outcomes among the three financial arrangements highlights the  			 importance of distinguishing between HMO arrangements and the need for further  			 investigation into a range of managed care practices. </p>
<p>There is also some very limited information on the impact of managed  			 care on disabled children. In a survey of 22 administrators of Medicaid managed  			 card plans serving children with disabilities, McManus and Fox found that  			 access to pediatric specialists, occupational, physical, speech and language  			 therapy was limited; the full range of EPSDT services is not generally  			 provided; and communication between HMO's and special education providers was  			 relatively rare. It is not clear from this study or others how children  			 receiving Medic-aid services outside managed care plans or similar children  			 receiving services through private health plans fare in comparison to  			 participants in managed care. </p>
<p>A study conducted by Horowitz and Stein, Yale School of Medicine in  			 1989 compared benefits offered to children in a small sample of Connecticut  			 HMOs to traditional indemnity plans. The study found that HMOs offered more  			 preventive care; however, both types of plans restricted the services most  			 needed by children with disabilities and chronic conditions; e.g., prescription  			 drugs, durable medical equipment, mental health services. </p>
<p>The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research  			 (NIDRR) within the Department of Education is focusing its 1995 research agenda  			 on analyzing the effects various gatekeeper arrangements have on access, the  			 degree of consumer choice in managed care plans and the efficacy of existing  			 managed care models serving the disabled. However, results of these studies are  			 not available. </p>
<p>There is limited information on the experience of working age adults  			 with disabilities in managed care arrangements. Allan Meyers and Robert Masters  			 at Boston University School of Public Health conducted a review of seventeen  			 managed care plans serving high risk populations. Evidence presented suggests  			 that insofar as the managed care plans affect costs medical care utilization  			 patterns, or quality, the effects have been limited t subsets of high-risk  			 populations. For example, disabled adults (n=205) participating in an  			 Independent Living primary managed care plan experienced fewer hospital days  			 per person than did those in the comparison group (Meyers, 1989). Another  			 controlled comparison found that chronically ill Medicaid eligible elderly  			 (n=978) had lower Medicaid expenditures and fewer hospital admissions than did  			 those in the comparison group (Meyers and Masters, 1989). Fourteen of the  			 seventeen studies in the review were limited in focus to the elderly and only  			 three studies examined prepaid managed care plans. </p>
<p>The Section 1115 waiver demonstration authority requires that HHS  			 conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the 1115 waivers. Evaluations are  			 currently being planned for five States (Hawaii, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Rhode  			 Island, and Ohio). HCFA has expressed interest in working collaboratively with  			 ASPE and other federal agencies to develop an add-on to their evaluation  			 efforts specifically designed to examine the impact of managed care on people  			 with disabilities. </p>

<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>What is the baseline of health and long-term care services and  			 benefits provided to people with disabilities and will managed care systems  			 make things better or worse? </p>
<p>What is the impact of managed care on people with special needs?

<p>How does managed care compare to fee for service plans with respect  			 to morbidity and mortality outcomes for different sub-populations of people  			 with disabilities? maintenance or improvement in functioning? disenrollment  			 rates and consumer satisfaction? </p>
<p>How does managed care affect service use patterns? Is there any  			 evidence that managed care plans prescribe more or less preventive services;  			 access to specialists; is there any evidence they reduce unnecessary  			 hospitalizations; e.g., hospital emergency rooms visits; etc. </p>
<p>Are individuals with disabilities in fee for service plans more or  			 less able to obtain rehabilitation services such as occupational, physical,  			 speech and language therapy? Is there any more (or any less) access to  			 long-term rehabilitation services? </p>
<p>Are particular sub-populations; e.g., children with functional  			 impairments and chronic conditions; working age adults with significant  			 physical disabilities; people with cognitive or mental impairments; befter or  			 worse off under managed care arrangements than they would be in the fee for  			 service system? How do service use patterns differ for these populations in  			 comparison to what their experience would have been in a typical indemnity  			 plan? </p>
<p>Are there important cost differences between providing services to  			 people with disabilities under a managed care plan versus a fee for service  			 plan? How do various cost control strategies effect access to care, quality of  			 care, and affordability of care for disabled populations and how do they  			 compare with cost containment strategies in the traditional fee for service  			 system? </p>
<p>How can ASPE, OMC, ORD, OSERS, the Medicaid Bureau, the Veteran's  			 Administration, and other public and private agencies coordinate their research  			 efforts to examine how people with disabilities are faring under managed care  			 arrangements? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>C. Targeting Issues</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>A critical design decision in the development of managed care  			 systems serving people with disabilities is whether to enroll a population  			 which includes healthy and disabled individuals or to enroll an already  			 disabled population. Another important decision is whether enrollment will be  			 mandatory or voluntary for the target population. Identifying the target  			 population is critical because decisions regarding capitation rate,  			 reimbursement method, scope of benefits, and risk arrangement (full capitation,  			 partial capitation) are made subsequent to selection and identification of risk  			 pools. </p>
<p>Plans have varied in the approaches they have taken. Several new  			 plans now in the development stage are attempting to carve out whole categories  			 of the disabled population; e.g., the District of Columbia's proposal to serve  			 all SSI-eligible children with disabilities under a new managed care system;  			 Rhode Island's CHOICES program which will include all persons with mental  			 retardation and other developmental disabilities under managed care; and,  			 Utah's provision of all Medicaid mental health services through a managed care  			 system. A small number of States are beginning to integrate people with  			 disabilities into their 1115 plans for the general population (Washington and  			 Oregon). </p>
<p>Even within plans that carve out a particular population with  			 disabilities, there is considerable concern regarding the level of severity  			 which can be accommodated. Some approaches are based on the assumptions that  			 the only way to address the financial concerns of a capitated system is to have  			 a mix of participants who have different health care trajectories. For example,  			 the Community Medical Alliance in Boston enrolls a mix of already disabled  			 individuals such as individuals with cerebral palsy who have a relatively flat  			 clinical course, individuals with AIDS who have a progressive course requiring  			 more services later, as well as individuals with spinal cord injury who require  			 more front-loading of services (Meyers, 1994). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is little data available from traditional  			 managed care providers in the private sector which would permit us to examine  			 the trade-offs between inclusive models which serve all types of people versus  			 specialized plans. From the viewpoint of the prospective consumer, considerable  			 skepticism has been expressed about equal access to care in a "separate but  			 equal" health care system--many people with disabilities and their  			 representatives fear that care in a "disabled only" system will be severely  			 constrained and of inferior quality. </p>
<p>Another important targeting choice is whether to operate a specific  			 program for a subpopulation of the disabled community; e.g., a separate system  			 for people with mental illness, or people with mental retardation, or the frail  			 elderly etc. or a generic program which includes all people with disabilities.  			 </p>
<p>Generic systems of care have been slow to develop because systems of  			 care coordination, and centralized clinical expertise cannot be readily  			 developed for all groups of people with disabilities. There is concern that a  			 generic service delivery system for all ages of people with disabilities could  			 not adequately address the highly specialized needs of individuals with mental  			 health problems, mental retardation, frail elders, adults with physical  			 disabilities, and children with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>Information about the trade-offs of targeting managed care to a  			 general population versus carving out specialized populations is still in its  			 infancy. HCFA has funded two models of managed care specifically designed to  			 provide a continuum of acute and long-term care services to elderly persons.  			 The Social Health Maintenance Organization (SHMOs) were designed to finance and  			 deliver a comprehensive package of acute, ancillary, short term nursing home  			 and community long-term care services targeted at a representative group of  			 elderly Medicare persons. </p>
<p>In contrast, the PACE program, designed to integrate acute and  			 long-term care services, was initially designed to only enroll elderly Medicaid  			 recipients who are already disabled and at risk of nursing home placement.  			 Limitations on the design of the evaluation of these demonstrations seriously  			 limit the generalizability of findings. </p>

<p><i><b>Questions for Future Research </b></i></p>
<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of designing and  			 implementing specialized managed care systems for people with disabilities  			 versus implementing models which include disabled persons along with the  			 general population? </p>
<p>How does the experience of people with disabilities enrolled  			 in-managed care arrangements along with the general population differ from  			 those who participate in carve outs or specialized plans? Do they have access  			 to more or less services? are they more or less costly? Do they have the same  			 or different outcomes? </p>
<p>How do open managed care plans manage risk for potentially high cost  			 populations in comparison with specialized plans? </p>
<p>What is the experience of managed care systems which attempt to  			 include all people with disabilities in a single organization versus those that  			 serve particular subpopulations? What are the advantages and disadvantages of  			 generic versus specialized plans regarding participation, appropriateness of  			 service coverage and costs? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>D. Service Coverage and Organization</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>In this section of the paper, we highlight some of the design and  			 training issues States and providers face in organizing and operating managed  			 care delivery systems which include people with disabilities. </p>
<p><b>Coverage of specialized services</b>. From the perspective of the  			 consumer, the success of managed care systems in serving individuals with  			 disabilities hinges heavily on the breadth and flexibility of benefits. From  			 the perspective of the provider, the benefits offered may effect financial  			 risk. An area of particular concern is access to ongoing rehabilitation  			 services (occupational, physical, and speech-language therapies). The debate  			 around health care reform generated serious concerns among disability groups  			 about the definition of these services used in the basic benefit package, the  			 imposition of annual or lifetime caps to limit their use, the role of  			 gatekeepers and primary care case managers in accessing these services and most  			 importantly who should pay for them and how they should be paid for. These same  			 questions pose a significant challenge in current public and private insurance  			 plans; anecdotal evidence suggests that private managed care plans are  			 increasingly limiting coverage for rehabilitation therapies. </p>
<p>Most rehabilitation services offered in private plans are provided  			 for a specific period after an acute medical event such as a car accident or  			 stroke. Yet a variety of long-term rehabilitation services may be necessary to  			 prevent secondary conditions as well as to maintain conditioning and  			 functioning in the years and months following rehabilitation after an acute  			 event. During the health care reform debate, some people with disabilities  			 clearly articulated a belief that if more of these services were covered by  			 managed care plans, there would be an increase in independence and a decrease  			 in rehospitalization rates. It would be desirable to investigate these  			 hypotheses. </p>
<p>Provider reluctance to cover long-term rehabilitation services is  			 based on a lack of information about costs in combination with limited  			 knowledge about what services of what intensity and duration are likely to  			 improve outcomes. This lack of information makes it difficult for providers to  			 accept financial risk. </p>
<p><b>Integration of health services and long-term supports</b>. A  			 second key design issue in organizing managed care systems for people with  			 disabilities is the extent to which and how long-term care services should be  			 integrated with acute care. People with significant disabilities may need  			 access to both acute care services and long-term supports such as personal  			 assistance services...sometimes for the remainder of their lives. In some  			 cases, these supports are successfully provided by family members and other  			 informal caregivers. However, most families are not able to manage the burden  			 of providing intensive services; e.g., 24 hour supports for their adult family  			 members for an extended period. Access to personal assistance services may be  			 the prerequisite for a working age person with a disability to hold a job, be  			 self supporting, raise a family and otherwise participate in community life.  			 </p>
<p>Managed care models that offer and coordinate transitional and  			 long-term care services, in addition to acute care are sometimes referred to as  			 integrated service delivery models. They have the potential to cover or to  			 coordinate a wide range of health and supportive services. To the extent they  			 can control access to acute and long-term care services, they also have the  			 potential to limit the cost shifting that now goes on between hospitals,  			 nursing homes and community based services. To the extent that full control of  			 a comprehensive array of services permits the substitution of lower cost more  			 appropriate services for higher cost care, savings to the entire health care  			 system may accrue. </p>
<p>Most experts agree that there is extremely limited experience to  			 guide the development of successful models of integrated care. Models developed  			 to date range from vertical integration efforts which attempt to consolidate  			 all services under a capitated arrangement within a single delivery system to  			 network arrangements where providers attempt to coordinate services on behalf  			 of an individual across a wide range of settings. </p>
<p>There are a significant number of administrative, financial, and  			 clinical barriers to creating integrated system of care for people with  			 disabilities. These barriers include: lack of financial incentives, difficulty  			 in establishing capitation rates, reorganizing medical structures traditionally  			 bifurcated around acute medical and long-term care service lines, developing  			 new clinical pathways, an inability to predict potential expenditures and risks  			 associated with integrating care, and resistance from State bureaucracies to  			 pooled funding streams. </p>
<p><b>Developing a Manned Care Workforce</b>. A third design issue in  			 organizing and delivering managed care systems for people with  			 disabilities--and one that has received very little attention--is the  			 development of a workforce that is trained in how to address the full range of  			 care needs of the consumer (and family) and how to coordinate efforts to  			 achieve this goal. Graduate medical education, nursing, social work, pharmacy  			 and therapy programs have not tended to focus on the interdisciplinary needs of  			 people with disabilities, and few models of service delivery have adopted such  			 an approach. The field of geriatrics provides a framework that may be useful in  			 designing educational curricula and practice guidelines for serving the "under  			 age 65" as well as the elderly population in that it is devoted to the care,  			 treatment, and rehabilitation of older persons, as well as health promotion and  			 disease prevention (Butler, 1992). Geriatrics requires comprehensive assessment  			 and service delivery, encompassing social and behavioral as well as medical  			 aspects of care, and emphasizing a team approach to caring for patients.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p><b>Coverage of Specialized Services</b>. Little is known about the  			 experience of managed care plans in covering and paying for specialized  			 services like rehabilitation or including physicians who specialize in treating  			 people with disabilities in their provider network. </p>
<p>The National Institute of Health within the Public Health Service is  			 currently interested in developing a research agenda around medical  			 rehabilitation outcomes research. NIDRR is examining reimbursement models for  			 inpatient rehabilitation care. </p>
<p>The Health Services Research and Development Service within the  			 Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting two studies related to long-term  			 rehabilitation services. The first focuses on the effect patient-selected  			 outcome measures have on the percentage of patients who are successful in  			 achieving their rehabilitation treatment goals. The second focuses on whether  			 the provision of ongoing primary care services for inpatients discharged from  			 the hospital can reduce rehospitalization rates. </p>
<p>Carl Granger and others at American Academy of Physical Medicine and  			 Rehabilitation and American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine have created a  			 set of Functional Independence Measures (FIM) to develop a patient .  			 classification system to determine categories of need for rehabilitation  			 services. This classification system is the first prospective payment system of  			 its kind that uses data from the Uniform Data System along with clinical  			 judgement to classify people in need of medical rehabilitation services. Such  			 systems have the potential to highlight who needs long-term rehabilitation  			 services, and to justify the payment of such services for groups of individuals  			 with disabilities. </p>
<p>Margaret Stineman at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center  			 has developed and refined patient classification systems and case mix measures  			 that can be used in calculating hospital reimbursement rates for elderly people  			 with physical disabilities. These systems could potentially be used in  			 prospectively estimating the resources needed to care for people within managed  			 care structure. </p>
<p>The National Chronic Care Consortium has assembled a task force led  			 by Cathy Michaels of Carondelet Health Care in Tucson to develop a risk  			 identification instrument that will help providers to identify and manage  			 patients who are at high risk of using extensive and costly services. This  			 instrument will identify risks for specific conditions and interventions, and  			 will include tools to assist providers in identifying risk. </p>
<p><b>Integration of Care</b>. Most of the research in this area has  			 targeted the frail elderly. HCFA has sponsored two pioneering initiatives over  			 the past ten years to develop managed care arrangements which integrate acute,  			 chronic and long-term care for the elderly (described earlier in this  			 paper)--the SHMOs and PACE. </p>
<p>The success of the SHMOs in achieving an optimum integration of  			 acute and long-term care services has been questioned by several studies  			 (Newcomer, 1990; Harrington 1993; Manton 1994). While SHMOs clearly succeeded  			 in offering long-term care services to their members, these studies conclude  			 that they failed to achieve a well-coordinated system of care with acute and  			 chronic medical services. Harrington identified the following types of  			 limitations: lack of communication between physicians and SHMO case managers;  			 lack of understanding by physicians of the long-term care benefits provided by  			 SHMOs; few practitioners trained in geriatrics; insufficient attention to  			 identifying and treating medically at-risk members. </p>
<p>The PACE organization and management model appears to reinforce a  			 high degree of coordination between acute and long-term care services. A  			 multidisciplinary team consisting of a nurse, social worker, physician, and  			 others is responsible for assessing each participant's needs; developing plans  			 of care including in-home, day health and medical services; and on-going  			 monitoring. Considerable staff time is devoted to staff interaction. The impact  			 of this type of model on participant outcomes has yet to be determined. It is  			 clear that the PACE sites have experienced considerable turnover of physician  			 staff. According to an analysis of PACE operations (Kane, 1992) the demands for  			 practice in a very different model have made recruitment and retention of  			 physicians in PACE sites difficult. </p>
<p>The Mental Health Services Program for Youth (MHSPY) is a special  			 initiative sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to develop seven  			 integrated systems of care for children with severe mental, emotional, and  			 behavioral disturbances. Using prepaid capitation ranging from $1,600 to $3,600  			 per member month, these systems provided a flexible array of health, mental  			 health, education, juvenile justice and social services. Results from the final  			 evaluation of this initiative are not available. </p>
<p>Community Medical Alliance (CMA) in Boston developed an integrated,  			 fully capitated system of medical, health, and social services for some of the  			 most costly and medically complex subpopulations of Medicaid's SSI population  			 including persons with AIDS, adults with severe disabilities, and individuals  			 with spinal cord injuries. Initial evaluations suggest cost savings and quality  			 care (Masters, 1994). </p>
<p>The National Chronic Care consortium has assembled a task force led  			 by Alice Kethley of the Benjamin Rose Institute in Cleveland to develop a tool  			 to measure the degree of integration that exists in managed care systems  			 serving persons with chronic care needs. This tool is intended to be used for  			 evaluation purposes as well as for a "report card" to inform consumers and  			 advocates. A final product is scheduled to be completed by April 1995. </p>
<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau within the Public Health  			 Service is conducting numerous State research and demonstration projects aimed  			 at developing new knowledge and approaches to integrated health care systems  			 for children with disabilities. A few of these projects focus specifically on  			 managed care arrangements, the majority focus on coordinating integration  			 efforts between existing providers, hospitals, and specialty care centers. </p>
<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is funding a series of  			 initiatives to develop integrated care for people with chronic conditions (one  			 of these is a replication of the PACE model targeted on children with  			 disabilities, in South Carolina). </p>
<p><b>Developing a Managed Care Workforce</b>. A 1987 NIA-sponsored  			 Consensus Conference on geriatric assessment indicates that under certain  			 conditions this technology can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment  			 outcomes. NIA sponsored a randomized, controlled prospective study, scheduled  			 for completion in January 1995, comparing geriatric assessment and treatment  			 planning with usual community medical diagnosis for 442 subjects. Preliminary  			 analysis indicates that geriatric assessment units were significantly more  			 likely to identify and treat cognitive impairment, depression, and incontinence  			 than were community physicians. Identification of these prevalent problems may  			 lead to treatment that can reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of  			 older adults and their families. According to data from caregiver interviews,  			 family caregivers were significantly less likely to experience increase in  			 burden over time than caregivers of patients seen by community physicians  			 (McDowell et al., 1994). </p>
<p>The On Lok model (and the PACE replications) is perhaps the best  			 example of a managed care arrangement that employs this philosophy. The team,  			 consisting or nurse, social worker, physician, and others, is responsible for  			 assessing each participant's care needs; developing individualized plans of  			 care; delivering and/or arranging delivery of services; and ongoing monitoring  			 of quality, costs, and treatment results. Effort is made to enlist the  			 paraprofessional as well as the professional staff in the discussions of  			 consumer status and change (Kane et al., 1992). </p>
<p>There is currently a shortage of geriatricians and physiatrists in  			 the United States as well as a dearth of training programs that have an  			 interdisciplinary focus. Reuben (1992) has emphasized the need to make careers  			 in geriatrics more attractive, including eliminating financial disincentives  			 and dispelling the myths of ageism. These concerns are applicable as well to  			 the development of a well- trained and knowledgeable workforce that will be  			 able to meet the diverse needs of younger populations. </p>

<p><i><b>Future Directions for Research</b></i></p>
<p><b>Service Coverage and Long-Term Rehabilitation</b> </p>
<p>Which specialized services; e.g., personal assistant,  			 rehabilitation, mental health, dental care, home and community services,  			 transportation etc. do managed care plans need to provide to effectively serve  			 people with disabilities? </p>
<p>What role do gatekeepers and case managers play in coordinating the  			 range of services needed by people with disabilities? </p>
<p>How do HMOs and other managed care plans arrange for access to  			 specialized care? To what extent do they refer people with disabilities to  			 specialists outside the plan? </p>
<p>How many people with what characteristics now receive long-term  			 rehabilitation and other specialized services and from what payment sources?  			 How does payment source effect quality and cost? </p>
<p>Which managed care models; e.g., staff and group HMOs, PPOs,  			 open-panel HMOs) provides greatest accessibility to specialty providers? Why?  			 </p>
<p>To what extent do managed care plans favor more familiar (and  			 potentially more costly) medical services over home health care and  			 rehabilitation services with which they are less familiar? </p>
<p>Can we predict who will need specialized services, what types of  			 services they will need and for how long? </p>
<p>How can specialized services including long-term rehabilitation  			 services be incorporated into capitation models without jeopardizing the plans  			 financial viability? </p>
<p>Which are the most cost effective settings for providing  			 rehabilitation services? How does this vary based on consumer characteristics?  			 </p>
<p>How can the benefits of long-term rehabilitation be determined? </p>
<p><b>Integration of Care</b> </p>
<p>Can/should both acute and long-term supportive services needed by  			 people with significant disabilities be integrated into a single, consolidated  			 managed care arrangement or only medical and health related services? If all  			 services should not be integrated, how should the acute and long-term care  			 support systems be linked and coordinated? </p>
<p>What models of integration are most promising and how does this very  			 depending on the nature of the population of people with disabilities to be  			 served? What barriers to integration must be removed for it to be successful?  			 </p>
<p>What differences are there in outcomes and consumer satisfaction  			 when services are integrated vertically versus through networking strategies?  			 </p>
<p>What are the risks and advantages of building integration efforts  			 off of existing administrative structures such as Medicaid, aging networks,  			 Title V, versus creating new authorities? </p>
<p>What barriers exist in the development of specialized integrated  			 care systems for children with disabilities, working age adults with physical  			 disabilities, the dually eligible, the MR/DD population and how can they be  			 addressed? </p>
<p><b>Developing a Managed Care Workforce</b> </p>
<p>What is the supply of service providers who understand the needs of  			 individuals with disabilities or who provide specialized services, such as  			 rehabilitation or assessment? Is the supply adequate to meet demand? How large  			 is the pool of physicians and ancillary personal who are trained in or  			 experienced in providing health services to special needs populations? How did  			 they get involved in specialized care? What steps are necessary to increase the  			 pool of providers who are able and willing to treat people with special needs?  			 </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>E. Financing Reimbursement</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>Financial incentives which would encourage providers to include  			 people with significant disabilities in managed care are largely lacking in  			 today's system. The result is that managed care plans attempt to select in  			 "good risks" while avoiding bad ones. Providers who do encourage the enrollment  			 of disabled individuals in plans that are fully capitated face a number of  			 risks. First, there is little empirical basis for predicting the added costs  			 (if any) of serving a population with disabilities. Under capitation  			 arrangements where the provider is at risk if costs exceed the capitation  			 payment, this is a large hurdle. To complicate matters further there are huge  			 variations in the service use patterns of even people with similar levels of  			 disability. To the extent that a provider does try to cover more high risk  			 populations in private plans, premium rates must be adjusted or the plan could  			 end up loosing money. Two problems then face the provider. First, there is  			 little guidance from past experience about how to set rates in such a way as to  			 reflect potential costs. Second, if higher premium rates are charged, more  			 healthy participants are likely to opt for lower cost plans, leaving the plan  			 financially vulnerable. </p>
<p>Two types of financial incentives have been developed to try to  			 address the special problems of incorporating high risk populations into  			 managed care arrangements: Risk Sharing and Risk Adjustment. </p>
<p>Another critical issue related to financing of managed care for  			 individuals with disabilities is the question of "who pays?". There are  			 multiple segregated sources of financing for health care for people with  			 disabilities--some specialized, others generic health care payers. How can  			 these diverse financing streams be combined to deliver appropriate managed care  			 systems? An example of a combined system is the approach currently being tried  			 in five counties in Minnesota, which combines Medicare and Medicaid to provide  			 managed health and long-term care services to the elderly. </p>
<p><b>Risk Sharing</b>. The first major question in need of resolution  			 relates to how risk can be shared between payers and providers, especially in  			 the context of integrated funding streams. We need to find ways to spread the  			 risk by specifying who pays for what and outlining whether and how States can  			 offer reinsurance plans. </p>
<p>The second major risk sharing question concerns risk sharing between  			 plans and providers. One way to protect providers against the risks associated  			 with fully capitated plans is to permit them to develop separate contracts with  			 certain providers outside the plan who are willing to share the risk. For  			 example, under TEFRA risk contracts, HMOs may develop separate contracts for  			 separate services and providers even though the care may be for the same person  			 and addressing the same conditions. While separate contracts may limit some of  			 the risk of the managed care plan by shifting it to other providers it may also  			 result in more fragmented care and potentially conflicting care and cost  			 management goals. </p>
<p>Many States have developed partially capitated programs to encourage  			 managed care plan providers to serve high risk populations. There are two type  			 of partially capitated programs, either acute care programs in which outpatient  			 services are capitated or specialty carve-out programs, where specialty set  			 vices are capitated. Partially capitated programs, in theory, should provide  			 incentives to integrate services around a particular set of services such as  			 acute care or long-term care. Partial capitated programs may include  			 reinsurance or stop loss provisions to insure that providers are protected from  			 losses above a certain amount. </p>
<p>In addition, the Federal Government has allowed States to carve out  			 coverage entirely of those high cost subpopulations for whom risk sharing  			 arrangements are difficult to create due to tremendous variability of costs  			 within a particular group (e.g., mentally ill, children with disabilities,  			 MR/DD, dually diagnosed, severely physically disabled). A substantial portion  			 of individuals in these groups require a range of health related service much  			 broader than those generally classified under acute care such as ongoing  			 maintenance therapies, personal assistance services, durable medical equipment,  			 and assistive devices. </p>
<p><b>Risk Adjustment</b>. Risk adjustment is the process of modeling  			 and calculating the expected expenses of one class of person or persons in a  			 plan relative to others. Risk adjustment methodologies attempt to ensure that  			 plans with high risk enrolles are not inappropriately penalized and those with  			 low risk enrolles are not inappropriately rewarded. </p>
<p>Progress in risk adjustment for people with disabilities has a long  			 way to go. We lack the kinds of actuarial information we need to predict  			 service use and cost. It is made more difficult because of the tremendous  			 variation in the characteristics, service needs and utilization patterns of  			 persons with disabilities. </p>
<p>Research suggests that the predictive validity of risk adjustors  			 traditionally used such as age, sex, Medicaid status, nursing home status, and  			 geographic adjustors explains only a small proportion of the variation across  			 individuals (MPR, 1993). Because of this fact, alternative risk adjusters have  			 been proposed which include clinical information, prior utilization data,  			 self-reported information, functional status measures, and mortality adjustment  			 measures. High collection costs, unreliable information, and issues with  			 patient confidentiality often prevent such information from being gathered.  			 </p>
<p>Researchers agree that even with substantial improvements in the  			 collection of risk factor information and modeling techniques for people with  			 disabilities, risk adjustment methodologies will only account for a small  			 degree of variability (Luft, 1994). In the absence of the "perfect risk  			 adjustment model" many managed care organizations serving the disabled and  			 non-disabled have relied on prior utilization and cost data to estimate service  			 expenditures. However, such data often fall to capture physical and cognitive  			 measures of functional capacity which are essential to estimating potential  			 care costs in certain populations. Until or unless risk adjustment methods  			 emerge which protect providers from financial loss due to serving high risk  			 populations, risk selection practices designed to weed out risk will prevail.  			 </p>
<p>Many States have experimented with insurance market reforms to  			 provide incentives for plans to serve people with disabilities while  			 simultaneously protecting the plan from high risk. Creating subsidized  			 condition-specific high risk pools, mandatory and voluntary reinsurance pools,  			 community rating, and purchasing cooperatives are examples of attempts to  			 control for risk despite the lack of adequate risk selection criteria. </p>
<p>It may be possible to manage risk by structuring plan operational  			 characteristics; e.g., should people be randomly assigned to plans or be  			 allowed to sign up for the plans of their choice? Some experts suggest that  			 random enrollment should equally distribute risk among programs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Research Completed or Underway </b></i></p>
<p>A National Chronic Care Consortium task force led by Michele Lepore  			 of Henry Ford Continuing Care Corporation in Detroit is attempting to develop a  			 risk contracting model to assist in the development of acute and long-term care  			 managed care systems serving persons with chronic illness. The model intends to  			 address management issues, gatekeeping arrangements, and risk management  			 contracting. </p>
<p>An important component of the Medicaid Working Group is Medicaid  			 risk adjustment. The Community Medical Alliance in Boston, serving individuals  			 with spinal cord injury and AIDS, is experimenting with new severity of  			 impairment measures, and functional status measures to improve their ability to  			 accurately predict future service use and cost. While these models are specific  			 to particular disabilities such as spinal cord injury and AIDS, learning the  			 methods by which we can develop similar clinically descriptive analog can  			 potentially benefit other managed care plans serving people with disabilities.  			 </p>
<p>Randy Ellis at Boston University is currently developing expanded  			 diagnostic cost groups for disabled individuals in managed care systems. Using  			 a sample of 680,000 Medicare beneficiaries, he is attempting to develop a  			 classification system for inpatient and outpatient medical expenditures. While  			 individuals with disabilities such as HIV/AIDS, Diabetes, SCI, TBI, Renal  			 Dialysis are included; others such as children with disabilities are missing  			 from this study. </p>
<p>James Fowles and others of Johns Hopkins University recently  			 conducted a side-by-side comparison of claims-based and survey-based risk  			 assessment methods for approximately 6,000 adult and elderly HMO enrolles in  			 Minnesota. Such studies would be extremely useful in managed care plans serving  			 subpopulations of the disabled community. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Directions for Future Research</b></i></p>
<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of various risk sharing  			 arrangements? How do different risk sharing mechanisms affect the  			 willingness/capacity of the managed care provider to insure access to a broader  			 range of services including rehabilitation and specialized services? to  			 coordinate services across settings? </p>
<p>How do different risk sharing arrangements affect the participation  			 of people with disabilities in managed care? their service use patterns and  			 their costs? their satisfaction with the plan? </p>
<p>What new risk adjustment strategies, or insurance market reforms,  			 are being developed to offset the incentives of managed care providers to  			 select out potentially high risk persons? Are some approaches more promising  			 than those used to date? why? </p>
<p>Are current risk adjustment methods sufficiently sensitive to  			 compensate for variation due to disabling conditions, or severity of  			 impairment? </p>
<p>To what extent can insurance reforms such as subsidized high risk  			 pools, community rating and purchasing cooperatives designed to promote  			 cross-subsidization of high and low risk groups promote the development of  			 managed care serving the disabled? What barriers will not be overcome-by  			 insurance reform alone? </p>
<p>When is reinsurance an appropriate strategy; what potential does it  			 service for different managed care arrangements serving people with  			 disabilities? </p>
</li>
</ol><h3>F. Quality Assurance</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Policy Issues </b></i></p>
<p>The principal policy issue which faces both the proponents and  			 critics of managed care is the extent to which its emphasis on cost controls  			 reduces the quality of care provided. For high risk populations this is an  			 especially serious threat. </p>
<p>The regulation of managed care plans is uneven. With the passage of  			 the Federal HMO Act in 1973, managed care plans are responsible for a set of  			 quality standards through the process of Qualification or Certification in  			 order to contract with the Federal Government to enroll people covered by  			 Medicaid and Medicare. However, State bureaucracies responsible for such  			 oversight and regulatory decisions (i.e., Department of Insurance and  			 Department of Health) may overlap and duplicate one another, as well as leave  			 unaddressed gaps. Fragmented regulatory procedures have the potential to place  			 people with disabilities at risk. For example, managed care systems which  			 integrate a continuum of acute and supportive services are currently outside  			 the purview of most State regulatory authorities. </p>
<p>Accreditation is the main process by which States attempt to  			 regulate quality. Similar to State Certification processes, State vary in their  			 degree of regulation and oversight over the process for determining the  			 qualification of provider networks serving people with disabilities. In some  			 States accreditation reviews are required to be conducted and the results are  			 made available within the States, in other States accreditation is a condition  			 for licensure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Questions for Future Research</b></i></p>
<p>How should quality of care be measured for people with disabilities?  			 (i.e., enrolles satisfaction, actual versus expected mortality rates,  			 medication compliance, rates of preventable rehospitalization, etc)? How can  			 these indicators be applied? </p>
<p>How can new indicators be developed to address the issues of  			 consumer empowerment and quality of life? </p>
<p>What methods of regulation, oversight and monitoring are most  			 effective for people with disabilities? </p>
<p>To what extent can expansion on HEDIS standards to include standards  			 of care for people with disabilities assist in State regulatory efforts? </p>
<p>What are the training needs of providers in managed care  			 systems-serving people with disabilities? What do people with disabilities  			 identify as the critical skills needed by providers? </p>
<p>How do private managed care systems provide continuing education and  			 training to providers? Can public managed care systems similarly use such  			 efforts? </p>
<p>What special training is provided to primary and specialty providers  			 who serve a disproportionate share of people with disabilities? </p>
<p>In what types of managed care arrangements is accreditation as a  			 condition of licensure overburdensome, and in what conditions is it most  			 appropriate to improve quality for people with disabilities? </p>

<hr /><h1><a name="sumpaper" id="sumpaper">FOCUS GROUP ON MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS  		FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES: SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION AND WRITTEN COMMENTS FROM  		EXPERT MEETING</a></h1>
<h2>December 5, 1994</h2>
<h2>I. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
<p>We wish to thank the thoughtful and enthusiastic participation of the  		experts who gave generously of their time and talents. They have played a key  		role in representing the views of researchers, advocates, and service providers  		to ASPE in the development of its research agenda on managed health care  		systems serving people with disabilities. </p>
<p>We wish to especially thank the many experts who assisted in the  		preparation of the issue paper used for the meeting. </p>
<h2>II. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		sponsored a expert meeting on research related to managed care and people with  		disabilities. The meeting was hosted by the Office of Disability, Aging and  		Long-Term Care Policy (DALTCP) at the Quality Hotel Capital Hill in Washington,  		D.C. on December 5, 1994. This day long meeting was part of an ongoing series  		of three expert meetings on disability topic areas that DALTCP is considering  		for inclusion in its research agenda. National experts who are academicians,  		researchers and service providers versed in the topic area were brought  		together with representatives of related federal agencies. Their charge was to  		review the implications of the movement toward managed health care for people  		with physical and mental disabilities; and flesh out a program of research and  		demonstration which improves our understanding of the impact of managed care on  		people with disabilities and how it can become more responsive to their needs.  		In particular, we asked their help to: (1) assess the benefits and risks that  		managed care may pose to people with disabilities, (2) identify key policy  		concerns that the Federal Government and States must consider in designing  		managed care initiatives for people with disabilities; (3) highlight relevant  		research that has been done or is currently underway; and (4) suggest policy  		relevant projects and studies which ASPE might pursue. </p>
<h3><a name="SP-IIA" id="SP-IIA">Welcome</a></h3>
<p>Mary Harahan, Director of DALTCP's Division of Long-Term Care Policy,  		welcomed the participants and provided a policy context for their deliberations  		on developing a research agency on managed care for people with disabilities.  		She explained that DALTCP's interest in managed care arises from our  		participation in the health care reform debate and the aftermath of that  		debate. She explained that in, that debate we talked with many people from the  		disability community who told us much about their fears and concerns of people  		with disabilities entering the managed care arrangements. Key concerns included  		selection bias, access to specialty care, access to a broad range of  		rehabilitation services, appropriately trained providers and a broad range of  		preventive services. Additionally, she highlighted the urgency of our research  		agenda in light of the dramatic growth of States requesting Medicaid waivers  		which allow them to mandate the enrollment of Medicaid recipients in managed  		care arrangements as well as the growth of managed care within the private  		sector. </p>
<p>Ruth Katz, a program analyst within DALTCP, then framed what we believe  		to be critical policy areas and related research issues around managed care and  		disability. These policy areas include (1) functional and demographic  		characteristics, (2) the impact of managed care on people with disabilities,  		(3) targeting, (4) financing and reimbursement issues and (5) quality issues.  		</p>
<h2>III. RECOMMENDATIONS ON KEY RESEARCH ISSUES</h2>
<h3>A. Functional and Demographic Characteristics</h3>
<p>Experts believed, in general, that there was a lack of data and  		information on innovative State managed care arrangements serving people with  		disabilities. Suggested studies were recommended to include a distinction  		between administrative type, cost sharing arrangement, clinic service  		indicators, benefit packages, varying medical courses, functional impact,  		population served (physical and emotional characteristics) and programs  		targetting specific disabled populations. In addition, some panelist  		recommended clearer distinction between administrative arrangements, finance  		mechanisms, clinical models and provider relationships that target specific  		disabled populations. </p>
<h3>B. Impact of Managed Care</h3>
<p>Repeatedly, many experts suggested that ASPE focus its research efforts  		on outcome measures that will allow a better understanding of how the disabled  		are faring in managed care arrangements. However there was disagreement over  		the type of outcomes to use, and whether or not those outcomes truly reflect  		quality, or access. For example, does increased access to a specialty provider  		necessarily represent an improvement in care? Do fewer home health visits  		represent favorable selection, improvement in pre-discharge care, a limited  		benefit package and/or an impact of cost containment strategies. </p>
<p>Is improvement of managed care based more on better case management or a  		reduction in the utilization of unnecessary technology? </p>
<p>In addition, many panelists recommended the need for better indicators  		of outcomes. Long-term care researchers have had little agreement in the past  		over appropriate outcomes. Some basic outcome measures were recommended for  		future research studies such as: physical functioning, social functioning,  		consumer satisfaction, cognitive functioning, affect, morbidity, mortality,  		etc. Some panelists suggested that future research move toward condition  		specific outcome measures (such as pressure sores and PCP for PWAs) rather than  		trying to develop clinical performance measures or outcome measures accross  		heterogenous medical conditions. </p>
<p>Other recommendations on the impact of managed care on disabled  		populations included: (i) studies examining the consequences of incentives to  		underservice, and how such incentives can potentially take different forms with  		different populations (e.g., SHMO enrollees versus children with a disability),  		and (ii) effectiveness studies to examine stratified groups of people who can  		profit from knowledgeable primary care case management and/or those who can  		profit from different type of rehabilitation therapies (including PAS,  		maintenance therapies, etc). </p>
<h3>C. Targetting</h3>
<p>The discussion of mandatory enrollment (as is prescribed with 1915  		waivers) was discussed throughout the meeting. While most panelists expressed  		that there is no reason not to impose mandated choices of managed care plans if  		researchers are confident that the choices are safe and effective, they agreed  		that they do not currently know that those choices are safe or effective. </p>
<p>Panelists discussed how often pricing always increases for plans  		targetting disabled populations, and how little research there was on pricing  		and costs biased on specialized systems of care. Such research, that would  		examine cost-related subgroups with clinically and prognostically related  		characteristics, could potentially make it attractive for insurers and  		providers to enter sub-specialty markets. Other researcher posited that while  		their is a tendency for insurers to price disabled subgroups separately, they  		still are reluctant due to lack of accurate cost or utilization information.  		</p>
<p>Panelists recommended a series of preliminary research steps necessary  		prior to cost, outcome, or utilization review studies. It was suggested that a  		task force of providers and researchers be assembled to develop a useful and  		meaningful taxonomy or topology of people with disabilities so that specialized  		tracking systems can be developed. Specific questions to be answered were: what  		are the services provided to disabled? who are the meaningful subgroups? how  		can researchers tie these subgroups to utilization and cost data? how do we  		define outcomes? What are the clinically meaningful outcomes for subgroups of  		people with disabilities? How can researchers track these outcomes and  		encourage managed care plans to its own collect baseline data on people with  		disabilities? Natural partners for such research were suggested, including:  		IBM, Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, Kaiser, California Employee  		Retirement System (CALPERS) (the 30 HMOs in California), etc. </p>
<h3>D. Financing and Reimbursement</h3>
<p>Panelists recommended further research to better predict the costs of  		clinically related groups of disabled populations. Many agreed that research on  		reimbursement categories, based on Carl Granger's functional independence  		measure work, was an important step in this direction as should be continued.  		However, some researchers pointed out that this will be extremely difficult  		within subgroups of disabled individuals with great variability in severity and  		utilization of services. Some researchers pointed out that variation in costs  		and utilization is not due to patient characteristics alone, but also to  		provider characteristics and payor/plan structure. </p>
<p>A few researchers suggested that it would be extremely useful to  		unbundle (at even a descriptive level) the variables that are contributing to  		total costs such as co-morbidities within a subgroup of people with  		disabilities--examining how many of those co-morbidities are retractable and  		treatable. </p>
<p>Panelists suggested payment-oriented research that would examine how  		providers are currently being reimbursed to provide primary care and specialty  		services to people with disabilities. </p>
<h3>E. Service Coverage and Organization of the Delivery  		System</h3>
<p>Many researchers pointed throughout the meeting at the dramatic rise in  		primary care case management (PCCM) because of the lack of State infrastructure  		that currently exists to support the development of managed care arrangements.  		Some panelists recommended research to promote the development of a provider  		infrastructure, and to better understand why some doctors are more inclined to  		work with disabled populations. Along this line, panelists suggested contacting  		doctors at Evercare, who have developed contracts with specialists who train  		primary care practitioners in ways of feeling more comfortable in caring for  		people with disabilities. </p>
<p>Along similar research lines, panelists questioned the technology that  		providers use to assess if the are conducting the appropriate intervention at  		the correct time. Such technology could include practice guidelines for  		providers caring for disabled specific subgroups, performance review,  		disability specific instrument development, best practices guidelines, prior  		approval mechanisms, specialty training, annual or semi-annual registration, or  		interagency mechanism of tunnelling information back to physicians. The  		emphasis here is on testing technology within managed care plans for providers,  		not financing mechanism or cost containment strategies. </p>
<p>Other researchers suggested research on various gatekeeper arrangements  		in relation to rehabilitation within different settings (acute, subacute,  		home). </p>
<p>Panelists suggested further research to develop performance measures  		specific to caring for people with disabilities. HEDIS chronic care measures  		were recommended as a good start, but many of their limitations were pointed  		out. </p>
<p>Some panelists recommended studies comparing outcomes, access, benefits,  		cost and utilization between staff and group model HMOs serving people with  		disabilities. Peter Fox and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation will potentially  		study patients with three clinical conditions and tracking what happens to them  		over time. </p>
<p>Other panelists suggested research examining advances in technology such  		as prosthetics, orthotics, indwelling robotics, communication devices,  		cognitive and sensory aides and retrofitting. Specific questions such as who is  		going to pay for them, how much will their costs vary, to what degree does  		customization effect success are important research questions that have yet to  		be answered. </p>
<p>Panelists also recommended studies on the amount of in-service training  		that occurs in different managed care arrangements for people with  		disabilities, including the education for unpaid providers. HERSA within SAMPSA  		is currently conducting public sector provider education. </p>
<h3>F. Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>Panelists varied in their recommendations for quality assurances. Some  		believed the best strategy included: (i) the need for improved instruments and  		methods to understand in a clinically meaningful way how to better serve a  		disabled population, (ii) identification of delivery systems that facilitate or  		provide efficacious treatments for disabled populations, (iii) redefine what we  		mean by quality--developing medical guidelines and population pathways, and  		(iv) rationalize what are quality assurance mechanisms mean. Other panelists  		believed that quality assurance instruments, such as report cards, were meant  		for the low risk populations, not for high risk populations. They recommended  		quality assurance research that focused on both generalized measures (as  		outlined in the paper) as well as condition specific measures (e.g., the extent  		to which children stay in school, employment attainment for MR/DD, access to  		and utilization of other ancillary services, etc.). </p>
<p>Panelists agree that the development of baseline measures of quality for  		people with disabilities is extremely important to create; however, the  		panelist could not decide precisely what measures would be reflective and  		accurate accross differently disabled individuals. </p>
<p>Some panelists recommended qualitative studies on what physicians  		understand chronic illness to be, and subsequently how they define quality in  		their practice, technical competencies would be useful to examine in such a  		study. </p>
