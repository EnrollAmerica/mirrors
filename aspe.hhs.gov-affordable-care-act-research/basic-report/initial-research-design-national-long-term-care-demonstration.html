<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. OVERVIEW: THE POLICY PROBLEM AND THE CHANNELING  		DEMONSTRATION</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in recognition of the  		large and rapidly growing need for long term care for the functionally impaired  		elderly, has funded a major demonstration to test the feasibility and  		effectiveness of an alternative community-based service delivery concept termed  		channeling. The full report describes the evaluation design for the National  		Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration. In order to set the context of the  		research design, we begin with a brief review of the policy issues and the  		channeling demonstrations program elements.</p>
<h3>A. POLICY BACKGROUND</h3>
<p><b>Changing Demographics</b>. The demographic characteristics of any  		nation are key determinants of the problems and realities that nation  		confronts. The older industrialized nations generally are beginning to face the  		demographic shift from a younger to an older population. In the United States,  		the reasons for the aging of the population include improved medical  		technology, increased financing for health care through medicare and medicaid,  		improvements in sanitation and public health, and demographic trends. On both  		an absolute and percentage basis, the number of older people is increasing. In  		1900, 3.1 percent of the U.S. population was over age 65; by 1980, that figure  		had risen to 11 percent. While the elderly as a group continue to increase as a  		proportion of the general population, the old/old group--those over 75--is  		growing at an even faster rate than the over-65 population as a whole (Glick  		1979).</p>
<p>The aging of the population has profound effects across the entire  		spectrum of society. As the work force becomes older and the number of younger  		workers supporting retired workers decreases, extra demands are put on  		government income maintenance and health care programs, and on individuals who  		care for their elderly relatives. Business begins to change its marketing focus  		in recognition of the growing number of older people. Housing needs change,  		potentially resulting in a scarcity of apartments for single elders,  		particularly those with chronic disabilities. Similarly, the changing  		demographics have a considerable impact on the need for health and long term  		care services.</p>
<p><b>Implications for Long Term Care</b>. The increase in the utilization  		of health and long-term care services has been great. For example, 5 percent of  		the over-65 population now are in nursing homes, accounting for more than 85  		percent of the nursing home beds used; 20 percent of the elderly will spend  		some time in a nursing home before dying. Those over 75 experience  		proportionally an even greater utilization of services. Eleven percent of  		persons between the ages of 75 and 84 have severe limitations on activities of  		daily living and, of those, 56 percent are in nursing homes. For the group 85  		and over, those with severe limitations reach 35 percent, of which 61 percent  		are in nursing homes (HCFA 1981). The need for acute care also increases with  		age, with nearly 50 percent of patient stays in hospitals being accounted for  		by older persons.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the increase in demand for health care, public  		expenditures for health services, especially long term care in nursing homes,  		have increased rapidly in recent years. In 1960, public expenditures for  		nursing home care totaled 500 million dollars. By 1981, medicaid expenditures  		for nursing homes, which constitute the majority of public expenditures for  		that purpose, had risen to 8.8 billion dollars (Long Term Care, July 1982).  		Nursing home care now consumes nearly 35.3 cents of every medicaid dollar spent  		in the United States (GAO 1982). Total costs for nursing home care rose to 24  		billion dollars in 1981, a 17.4 percent increase from 1980 expenditures (Long  		Term Care, July 1982).</p>
<p><b>Problems with the Long Term Care System</b>. Despite the increased  		service expenditures, there is general concern about the degree to which the  		needs of the aged are being met, and about the extent to which the system  		established to meet those needs is functioning effectively and efficiently.  		This central concern--that the long term care system fails to provide an  		efficient and appropriate match of services to individual needs--has been  		attributed to three major problems: limited understanding of which services are  		most effective for different client groups; fragmentation of services and a  		lack of information concerning program availability and eligibility; and the  		financial incentives of the current public funding alternatives, which favor  		institutional over noninstitutional services. These are problems channeling is  		designed to address.</p>
<p>The limited understanding about the groups of disabled older persons for  		whom different types of services are most appropriate and effective is  		reflected in the way services are utilized. Despite the heavy reliance on  		nursing homes discussed above, it is estimated that the majority of all long  		term care services are provided informally by family and friends. (Estimates  		are that from 50 to 80 percent of care is provided by family or friends, NCHS  		1972; Laurie 1978; GAO 1977b; Monk, 1979.) For every older person in a nursing  		home, it is estimated that 1.3 to 3 residing in the community require an  		equivalent level of care (HCFA 1981). In addition, many nursing home beds may  		not be well utilized; it is estimated that from 10 to 40 percent of those in  		nursing homes are placed at a higher than needed level of care (Morris 1971,  		Williams, et. Al. 1973, CBO 1977, GAO 1979). Risk factors associated with  		institutionalization, and norms relating functioning or other traits to  		specific services and settings, though widely discussed, have not been refined  		sufficiently for use in predicting the services which will be most appropriate  		and effective for different groups and individuals (HCFA 1981).</p>
<p>A second problem is that older persons with long term care needs  		frequently lack understanding and information about what services they need,  		where the services can be obtained; and what financing they are eligible for.  		Determining what services are needed, knowing how and where they can be  		obtained and who can pay for them, and arranging for and monitoring their  		provision can be difficult. Older persons may be too disabled to coordinate and  		arrange for their own services, judge when service quality is adequate, or  		follow up when services are not delivered.</p>
<p>The programs that provide services to the elderly are administered by a  		diverse group of federal, state, and local agencies; and no single person or  		organization is accountable for the entire package of services provided to an  		individual (GAO 1979). The fragmentation of administration, eligibility, and  		provision of care is particularly evident between medical and social services.  		For some aged persons, family and friends are more knowledgeable and better  		able to arrange for and monitor service provision. However, many families now  		live far away, have other responsibilities, or are unwilling to devote the time  		and money needed to care for a severely impaired elderly person; and some of  		the elderly do not have family and friends to help them. It can be so difficult  		for an impaired elderly person to access and coordinate the services needed to  		live in the community that he or she may enter a nursing home because it is the  		simplest alternative; others remain in the community without adequate help  		(Select Committee on Aging 1980).</p>
<p>For an impaired elderly person, the care required can be substantial,  		and paying for it can be a large financial burden. Even an impaired person with  		income above the poverty line can be very poor, once the cost of services  		needed to survive are taken into account. Recognizing this, the government  		provides for public financing of some long term care services. A number of  		programs provide long term care; but medicaid is the program that accounts for  		the bulk of government financing in this area, and medicaid contains strong  		incentives to use institutional rather than community care (Morris 1971,  		Mechanic 1979, CBO 1977, Kane and Kane 1980, Rossman 1973).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> For noninstitutional care,  		medicaid covers primarily medical services; nonmedical services such as room,  		board, help with shopping, transportation, meals, and household chores are not  		covered. Because all of nursing home care is considered a medical service,  		however, its entire cost (at least as reflected in reimbursement rates) is  		covered by medicaid--even though a substantial portion of the services provided  		by a nursing home are nonmedical.</p>
<p>Further, in many states income eligibility for institutional care under  		medicaid is set at a much higher level than for community care. It is estimated  		that about half of all nursing home patients were not initially poor, and could  		not have qualified for medicaid benefits had they not entered institutions  		(HCFA 1981). Having low enough income to qualify for medicaid home care  		benefits, howevere, may not leave enough to meet routine nonmedical needs (HCFA  		1981).</p>
<p>Medicaids incentives to provide nursing home rather than  		community-based care are not the only distorting financing incentives. That  		medicare--the major source of financing for medical services for the  		elderly--covers only medically-oriented care may lead some covered by medicare  		to substitute relatively expensive medical services for less expensive  		nonmedical services that would be equally appropriate. These distortions in  		incentives are aggravated with respect to hospital care in some states  		where--in an effort to control the medicaid costs of nursing home care--nursing  		home reimbursement rates have been held down and limits have been placed on  		nursing home construction. The resulting shortage of nursing home beds  		sometimes leads to the functionally-impaired elderly being placed in acute care  		facilities while they await nursing home admission, even though they may not  		have a serious medical problem (Rossman 1977, Pinker 1980, Shapiro et al.,  		1980).</p>
<p>There are reasons for the emphasis on medical services in existing  		government programs, given the need to control government expenditures in the  		health sector. Recent surveys indicate that most elderly persons would prefer  		to live in the community, relying heavily on family and friends for care, or  		living in the community without having all their needs met (Laurie 1978).  		Limiting medicaid reimbursement to medical services for those living in  		noninstitutional settings is designed to constrain costs, given this documented  		preferences among the elderly for community living. In addition, using the  		medical system as the entry point for those applying for service reimbursement  		is, in principle, another way to limit the use of government financed services  		to those in real need--without a need certified by the medical profession,  		government financing is not available. Removal of these constraints runs the  		risk of increasing participation in programs funded by the government and  		increasing costs by more than would be saved from a reduction in nursing home  		placements.</p>
<p>These problems are, of course, not new. Policymakers at both the federal  		and state levels are and have been concerned with long term care for the last  		decade. The National Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration is intended to  		provide information that will help in establishing national policy for  		community-based long term care.</p>
<h3>B. THE CHANNELING INITIATIVE</h3>
<p>The National Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration is designed to test  		a particular approach to mitigating these problems of lack of information,  		service fragmentation, and distorting financial incentives. Channeling does not  		address all the problems of long term care, not is it the only alternative for  		improving the matching of needs with services. But channeling is an approach  		that has many advocates. Similar case management programs have been implemented  		previously, and the approach is viewed increasingly as an alternative to the  		current system, despite ambiguous evidence about its cost-effectiveness. In the  		context of limited public financing and services, the objective of channeling  		is to match the services available to those most in need. The target population  		of the demonstration is the severely impaired elderly who required long term  		care services for an extended period of time and who, in the absence of the  		channeling program, are at very high risk of being institutionalized. For this  		group of people, the goal of channeling is to rationalize the delivery of long  		term care services through a unified program of comprehensive needs assessment  		and case management. With respect to utilization of services, the objective of  		channeling is to substitute services provided in the community--both formal  		services and informal care provided by family and friends--for institutional  		care, wherever community care is appropriate. This substitution is intended, in  		turn, to reduce costs and to improve the quality of life of its clients.</p>
<h4>Target Population</h4>
<p>The target population for channeling is those persons who are at high  		risk of a nursing home placement but who, with the help of channeling, can  		remain in the community. Identifying this group, however, is not a simple  		matter. Since service needs, and to an extent costs, are a function of  		impairments and the individuals support system, the channeling  		demonstration will identify this target population based on functional  		impairment, unmet need, and the status of available informal supports. Specific  		eligibility criteria for channeling are:</p>
<ol type="a"><li><b>Age</b>. Clients must be 65 years of age or older.</li>
<li><b>Functional Impairment</b>. Operational measures of functional  		  impairment are based on individuals abilities to perform activities  		  required for daily living (ADL)--eating, transferring, dressing, bathing,  		  toileting, and controlling bladder and bowels--and institutional activities of  		  daily living (IADL)--meal preparation; housekeeping or shopping; taking  		  medications; telephone, travel, or money management. Previous studies (Grauer  		  and Birnbom 1975, Sherwood et al. 1977, Noelker et al. 1979, Seidl et al. 1980,  		  Skellie et al. 1981) have demonstrated a correlation between these measures of  		  functional impairment and the probability of institutionalization. These  		  measures are included in the eligibility criteria to enable channeling to  		  concentrate on those at highest risk of institutionalization. Minimum  		  impairment criteria for eligibility are: (1) two moderate ADL impairments,  		  <b>or</b> (2) three severe IADL impairments, <b>or</b> (3) two severe IADL  		  impairments and one severe ADL impairment.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></li>
<li><b>Unmet Needs</b>. To focus the project more closely on those  		  clients for whom channeling is expected to have the greatest impact, one of two  		  need conditions must be met to establish eligibility: Either the present unmet  		  service needs of the individual must be predicted to continue for at least six  		  months, or the individuals informal support system must be on the verge  		  of collapse. The intent of this provision is twofold: to avoid simply  		  substituting channeling for other services, formal or informal, that can  		  adequately meet a clients needs; and to help prevent indiscriminate  		  caseload transfers by other agencies.</li>
<li><b>Residence in the Community</b>. To increase the likelihood that  		  clients are appropriate for community living, either they must be living in the  		  community when they apply for channeling or, if institutionalized, they must be  		  certified for discharge to a noninstitutional setting within three months.</li>
<li><b>Residence in Catchment Area</b>. Clients must be residents of the  		  geographic catchment area defined by the demonstration. For program purposes,  		  this establishes service system boundaries; for purposes of the demonstration,  		  it prevents artificial inflows of clients from different areas.</li>
</ol><h4>The Channeling Approach</h4>
<p>The two variants of channeling that will be tested in the demonstration  		are: a basic case management model and a financial control model. These two  		models share a core set of functions: outreach, screening, comprehensive needs  		assessment, care planning, and case management (arranging for services,  		monitoring, and reassessment). These core channeling functions are designed to  		identifying the population most appropriate for community care, to provide  		information about individual needs and services, and to arrange for and  		coordinate services that most appropriately and efficiently meet those  		needs.</p>
<p>The two models diverge in several important respects: their authority to  		arrange for services, their reliance on the existing services and public  		programs, and their approach to cost containment. The case management model,  		through the core functions cited above, relies on the case manager to negotiate  		access to existing services and to make efficient use of them; some limited  		funds are available to purchase services not normally available under existing  		programs, but in general this variant works within the structures and services  		of the current system. The financial control model, in contrast, confers  		authority on the case manager to authorize and purchase services out of a pool  		of funds without respect to many important existing program requirements, such  		as income eligibility. It does, however, impose strict controls on costs  		through caps on program and individual expenditures, and requires cost-sharing  		by clients with higher incomes.</p>
<h4>The Basic Case Management Model</h4>
<p>The basic case management model inserts a coordinating and  		accountability mechanism--case management--into the present system of service  		providers and government programs. It depends upon the array of services  		already available in the long term care system, but introduces an organization  		responsible for helping clients gain access to and coordinate those services  		they need to live in the community. The channeling organization assigns to each  		client a case manager who performs a comprehensive assessment of service needs;  		develops a plan of care that responds to those needs; arranges for the  		provision of the needed services, relying on family and friends wherever  		feasible; follows up to see that they are provided and monitors their provision  		on an ongoing basis; and reassesses needs periodically or when circumstances  		change. Thus, the case manager is accountable for planning and arranging the  		entire package of services needed by the client, and helps negotiate the  		complex array of programs and service providers.</p>
<p>While it is recognized that the channeling functions will be implemented  		by organizations of varying capacities and in very different environments, some  		uniformity in the intervention across sites has been established. The basic  		case management model consists of a set of eight standard elements (more  		detailed descriptions of which can be found in Gottesman 1981). The first seven  		of these are the core channeling functions mentioned above, which are held in  		common with the financial control model--the last is a distinctive feature of  		the basic model.</p>
<p><b>a. Outreach</b>. Outreach activities are needed to identify and  		attract the target population. The channeling projects will establish  		relationships with information and referral agencies, hospital discharge  		planners, and other agencies who will refer potential clients to channeling.  		The channeling projects may also engage in various community education  		activities to bring channeling to the attention of elderly disabled persons not  		being served by the current system.</p>
<p><b>b. Screening</b>. Applicants to channeling are screened over the  		telephone to determine whether they are eligible for channeling. Ineligible  		applicants are referred back to the referral agency or, if they were not  		referred by an agency (i.e., if they applied themselves or were referred by a  		family member), are referred to an information and referral agency.</p>
<p><b>c. Comprehensive Needs Assessment</b>. Channeling will perform a  		comprehensive assessment of each client to determine problems and service  		needs. Using a structured assessment instrument, channeling staff will collect  		information on the physical and mental functioning ability of the clients,  		their service needs, financial resources, eligibility for services, family  		situation, living arrangements, etc., which will serve as the basis for care  		planning. Specialized assessments by physicians or other professionals may be  		used to follow up on special problems identified through the structured  		assessment process.</p>
<p><b>d. Care Planning</b>. Based on the needs assessment, case managers  		will develop a plan of care specifying the type and amount of care to be  		provided. The care plan will include the type and extent of informal care that  		can be provided by family and friends.</p>
<p><b>e. Arranging for Services</b>. Case managers will then make  		arrangements with both informal and formal providers to implement the care  		plan. Case managers will work to overcome barriers to receiving services, as  		well as work with providers to ensure that the prescribed services are  		delivered.</p>
<p><b>f. Monitoring</b>. Case managers will then follow up to see that  		services are provided as called for in the care plan and to ensure that they  		continue as planned or are modified as necessary.</p>
<p><b>g. Reassessment</b>. Approximately three months after program entry  		and every six months thereafter (or earlier if called for by a change in the  		clients status), case managers will reassess clients needs and  		adjust their care plans in response to changes in conditions.</p>
<p><b>h. Gap-filling Services</b>. In addition to the above core channeling  		functions, the basic case management model has a distinctive feature to  		overcome gaps in existing services or funding programs. It provides a limited  		amount of additional service dollars for direct purchase of community-based  		services to fill in gaps for individual clients. Because these gap-filling  		funds are limited, however, in developing a plan or care the case manager must  		rely primarily on family and friends, services provided by voluntary agencies,  		and existing government programs.</p>
<p>The case management model, therefore, will test the premise that the  		major difficulties in the current long term care system are problems of  		information, access, and coordination, which can be essentially solved by  		client-centered case management.</p>
<h4>The Financial Control Model</h4>
<p>The second model to be tested adds to the core channeling functions--(a)  		through (g) above--several elements directed at changing certain features of  		public long term care programs, which the basic case management model accepts  		as given. First, present medicaid income eligibility rules tend to restrict  		community-based services to low income groups. As a result, higher income  		clients may become institutionalized because the lack of services and, after  		they have exhausted their assets, public funds then pay for high cost  		institutional care when community care might have delayed or prevented  		institutionalization. Second, many communities often lack essential services  		for community care (e.g., day care, respite care, etc.), thus resulting in no  		service or inappropriate use of more costly services. Third, some components of  		the present system lack incentives to use less costly services because  		reimbursement for many services is open-ended and resource tradeoff decisions  		do not have to be made by planners of care. Fourth, the present system does not  		have a single coordinated mechanism for selecting and authorizing the amount,  		duration, and scope of specific services for individuals.</p>
<p>The following six program elements, embodied in the financial control  		model, are intended to alter these financial incentives and to control  		costs.</p>
<p><b>i. Expanded Service Coverage</b>. Funding will be extended to include  		some community-based services not usually reimbursed by government programs or  		which are unavailable in many communities. Services for which coverage will be  		extended include: </p>
<blockquote><p>Day health and rehabilitative care Day maintenance care Home  		  health aide services Homemaker/personal care services Housekeeping  		  services Chore services Companion services Home delivered meals  		  Respite care Skilled nursing Physical therapy Speech therapy  		  Occupational therapy Mental health services Transportation service  		  Housing assistance Adult foster care Nonroutine consumable medical  		  supplies Adaptive and assistive equipment</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>j. Funding Pool</b>. The above services will be paid for from a pool  		of service dollars. Technically, this pool is drawn from medicaid, medicare,  		and other government programs. From the perspective of the client and case  		manager, however, coverage of the expanded services for any individual client  		does not depend on eligibility for particular categorical programs. However,  		because this model of channeling will be funded partially through waivers under  		medicare, an additional eligibility criterion is added to those described  		earlier for the target population--to participate in the financial control  		model of channeling, all clients must be covered by medicare (Part A).</p>
<p><b>k. Authorization Power</b>. Case managers have the power to authorize  		the amount, duration, and scope of services paid for from the funding  		pool.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> This gives case  		managers the power to access funding for services directly. At the same time,  		it vests in them the power to limit, alter, or terminate services in response  		to changes in client needs or failure of a provider to deliver services of  		adequate quality. The power to authorize community-based services under a whole  		group of programs will enhance the case managers ability to obtain  		services for clients and make the case manager accountable for the full package  		of services funded.</p>
<p><b>l. Cap on Average Expenditures</b>. A maximum (cap) will be set on  		average service expenditures per client for the channeling projects  		caseload as a whole. Average annual expenditures, calculated for active client  		days, will not be permitted to exceed 60 percent of the average of the state  		rates for intermediate care facilities (ICF) and skilled nursing facilities  		(SNF). Project management will routinely monitor the average service costs  		using a computerized financial control system to ensure that they remain within  		the 60 percent cap.</p>
<p><b>m. Limits on Expenditures for Individuals</b>. Under the cap on  		average expenditures, the cost of individual care plans can vary; but those who  		exceed the 60 percent cap must be offset by persons whose care is below the 60  		percent cap. There will also be direct limits on annual expenditures for each  		individual, set at 85 percent of the average of the states reimbursement  		rates for ICF and SNF care. Exceptions to the 85 percent limit can be made only  		with state approval of specific cases. This limit is intended to reduce costs  		by making case managers more sensitive to the cost of care. They will be made  		responsible for estimating the cost of the care plans they develop, and for  		staying below the 85 percent limit for individual clients and within the 60  		percent cap on average.</p>
<p><b>n. Client Cost Sharing</b>. To focus government financing for the  		expanded list of community-based services on those clients most in need,  		individuals with incomes in excess of a protected amount--equal to 200 percent  		of the states Supplemental Security Income eligibility level plus the  		food stamp bonus amount<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup>--are required to share in the cost of their  		services. The plan requires them to pay all their income above the protected  		amount, except they are not required to pay for services that are generally  		available at no cost, and they are not required to pay more than the cost of  		services received. The cost sharing plan is designed to accomplish two  		competing objectives: (1) to ensure that government funds are not spent on  		those who can readily afford to pay for their care, and (2) to encourage  		participation by the spend-down population by setting the protected  		level high enough to include those who are above the medicaid income  		eligibility level as long as they are in the community, but who would become  		eligible for medicaid after being institutionalized and spending down their  		resources to the eligibility level.</p>
<h3>C. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION</h3>
<p>After initial federal planning and design, and state responses to the  		DHHS request for proposals, contracts were awarded in October 1980. Detailed  		operational plans were refined at the state and site level, and final  		specifications for the two planned variants were developed at the federal  		level, from this time through February 1982, when the first sites began  		operations.</p>
<p>The basic case management model is being tested at five sites:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eastern Kentucky (8 counties) York and Cumberland Counties, Maine  		  Baltimore, Maryland Middlesex County, New Jersey Houston,  		  Texas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All began operations in February and March of 1982 except Eastern  		Kentucky which began in June. The financial control model is being tested at  		five sites, which began operation in May and June of 1982:</p>
<blockquote><p>Miami, Florida Greater Lynn, Massachusetts Rensselaer County,  		  New York Cuyahoga County (Cleveland), Ohio Philadelphia,  		  Pennsylvania</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All demonstration sites are scheduled to run for three years, and the  		final research report is scheduled for completion in early 1985.</p>
<h3>D. OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH</h3>
<p>In order to determine whether channeling achieves its intended impact on  		long term care for severely impaired older persons, the evaluation of the  		National Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration will address the following  		major questions:</p>
<ul><li>What is channeling's impact on service utilization?
<ul><li>Does channeling alter living arrangements so that its clients  				live in the community rather than nursing homes?</li>
<li>Does channeling reduce the use of hospital care? </li>
<li>Does channeling increase the use of formal health and long term  				care services provided in the community?</li>
<li>Does channeling increase or decrease the amount of informal care  				provided by family and friends?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is channeling's impact on the public and private costs of long  		  term care?</li>
<li>What is channeling's impact on clients?
<ul><li>Does channeling reduce mortality rates of its clients? </li>
<li>Does channeling reduce the rate of deterioration of functioning  				and improve the social and psychological well-being of its clients?</li>
<li>Does channeling reduce unmet needs and increase satisfaction with  				services provided?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is channeling's impact on informal caregivers?
<ul><li>Does channeling increase or decrease caregiver stress and  				well-being? </li>
<li>Does channeling increase or decrease caregivers' satisfaction  				with the care received by the elderly individual for whom they care?</li>
<li>Does channeling increase or decrease the income and employment of  				caregivers?</li>
<li>Does channeling increase or decrease the financial support  				provided by family and friends?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>These questions will be answered for each of the two channeling models  		described above and for selected groups of the target population. The answers  		to these questions for each of the two models should enable policymakers to  		judge whether channeling is a cost-effective intervention and, if so, which of  		the two channeling models is the more effective, and for which groups within  		the target population. This analysis of cost-effectiveness will be enhanced  		with inputs from the more qualitative implementation and process research  		described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVIII">Chapter VIII</a> of the full report. Taken  		together, the impact analysis and process research will aid in determining the  		best way to organize and deliver channeling services should it be found to be a  		cost-effective intervention.</p>
<p>An experimental methodology (described in detail in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a> of the full report) will be used to answer the  		impact questions listed above. To enter the project, individuals are screened  		by telephone to determine whether they are eligible and interested in  		participating in channeling. If so, they are randomly assigned to either a  		treatment group (and thus have the opportunity to participate in channeling),  		or a control group (the members of which must continue to rely on the existing  		long term care system). The control group thus establishes a basis for  		measuring the outcomes that would have occurred in the absence of channeling,  		and to which we will compare the outcomes of channeling. The difference between  		the treatment group average and the control group average on outcome measures  		such as public and private costs, institutionalization rates, mortality rates,  		and functional capacity will provide quantitative estimates of channeling's  		impacts which will be subjected to formal hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>Data will be collected for a sample of 4,900 individuals. Baseline  		assessments of clients in the treatment group are conducted by channeling  		project staff, while control group baselines are administered by research  		interviewers. Two follow-up interviews to be administered to both groups by  		research staff at 6-month intervals will collect information on  		institutionalization, service utilization, housing and living arrangement,  		functional capacity, and other outcome measures. An 18-month follow-up  		interview collecting the same information will be administered to half the  		sample. The interviews will be administered in person and will be approximately  		an hour in length. Medicaid, medicare, and provider billing records will be  		collected to provide more reliable information on the services utilized and to  		obtain data on costs. A telephone interview of the primary informal caregivers  		of a subsample of the treatment and control groups will collect data on their  		characteristics, the amount and type of informal care provided, financial  		burden, stress experienced by caregivers, and other impacts on informal  		caregivers. Finally, data for the documentation of the channeling process and  		the implementation of channeling will be collected from a variety of sources:  		interviews with individuals associated with and knowledgeable about the  		implementation and operation of channeling; quantitative data form the research  		instruments and standard program forms (e.g., tabulations of active caseloads  		and length of stay data from a computerized client tracking system, data from  		the telephone screen, and channeling project expenditure data); and public and  		project documents describing the long term care system and channeling  		operations (e.g., channeling project procedures manuals; copies of relevant  		laws, regulations, and state plans, and census data and other locally available  		statistics).</p>
<p>The following chapters of this report present the research design for  		the evaluation of the demonstration in more detail. <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter  		II</a> presents the research methodology. <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>  		presents the framework for the research. The remaining chapters discuss the  		major research questions to be addressed and the data used to answer them in  		the following areas: impacts on service utilization, impacts on costs, impacts  		on clients, impacts on informal caregivers, and analysis of the implementation  		and process of channeling.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>The primary objective of the research is to determine the impacts of the  		demonstration on service utilization, public and private costs, clients, and  		caregivers. To address these issues the overall research methodology must  		encompass two types of interpretive comparisons. First, how is what is observed  		under channeling different from what would have happened in its absence?  		Second, what are the differential impacts of the two channeling models?</p>
<p>In order to make such comparisons, differences caused by the impacts of  		the program and its two variants must be distinguished from differences cause  		by other influences. For example, suppose channeling participants were observed  		to be institutionalized less frequently than those who did not receive  		channeling. The research design must ensure that the observed difference is  		attributable to channeling rather than to the fact that those who participate  		in channeling, because they are actively seeking community based services, are  		inherently less likely to be institutionalized than those who do not. The  		control group methodology used to achieve this objective, along with the  		problems that may arise and their potential solutions, are presented in the  		first section.</p>
<p>The second section discusses the related issues of sample size and  		sample allocation and presents the sample design we have chosen from the  		channeling demonstration. The third section discusses the planned data analysis  		methodology. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the  		methodological research that must be done in response to potential weaknesses  		in the research methodology: sample attrition and noncomparability of baseline  		data.</p>
<h3>A. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY</h3>
<p>The methodology that will be adopted incorporates random assignment of  		the potential channeling participants to the channeling treatment  		or to the control group. Control groups, which now play a central role in the  		state-of-the-art methodology for evaluating social programs, permit an  		approximation to research methods used in the experimental sciences and provide  		a powerful method of isolating program effects. Under this methodology mean  		outcome values of the treatment group are compared with the mean outcome values  		of the control group. The differences in means then give unbiased estimates of  		average program impacts on the treatment group if the following three  		conditions are met.</p>
<p>First, we must be confident that the observed differences are  		<b>caused</b> by the program rather than by any prior differences between the  		two groups. In the channeling evaluation this condition of a proper design is  		met through random assignment, which permits observed differences to be  		attributed to treatment effects with a known degree of statistical  		precision.</p>
<p>Second, the behavior of the control group during the life of the  		demonstration must accurately reflect what they would have done if the  		demonstration had not existed. In other words, the control group must be  		uncontaminated by the presence of the demonstration, either directly or  		indirectly. Direct contamination could occur if channeling staff have  		interaction with the control group substantial enough to change their behavior  		or their subsequent experiences. Indirect contamination could occur if the  		demonstration affects the environment in a way that in turn affects the control  		group. In such a case the control group does not provide an accurate measure of  		what would have happened in the absence of channeling. Such indirect  		contamination is particularly troublesome because its form and the direction of  		the bias it causes are difficult to predict theoretically or document  		empirically.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup> If  		channelings caseload is small relative to the target population in the  		community, then the indirect effects are likely to be small and spread over a  		larger population than if the intervention encompasses a major part of the  		target population.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> We  		have sought to minimize the risk of indirect contamination by having planned  		caseloads small relative to the size of the target population. Nonetheless, the  		risk of indirect contamination remains at the channeling sites in smaller  		communities; we will attempt to document any indications of indirect  		contamination as part of the process research, in order to take account of it  		in interpreting our impact results.</p>
<p>Third, the data must be comparable for the treatment and control groups  		at both the baseline and follow-up interviews. This ensures that the measured  		differences between treatments and controls represent real impacts rather than  		differences in measurement. As indicated above, the data collection strategy  		calls for screening data to be collected by channeling staff, baseline data on  		the treatment group to be collected by channeling staff, baseline data on the  		control group to be collected by research staff, and follow-up data for both  		groups to be collected by research staff. Although this strategy minimizes the  		risk of direct contamination of the control group, it does run the risk of  		noncomparability of baseline data between treatment and controls.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup> To determine whether this  		potential noncomparability exists and to adapt the analysis accordingly if it  		does, we will conduct methodological work (discussed further below) using the  		screening data (which are comparable between treatments and controls) and a  		validation subsample of the treatment group to whom research interviewers will  		readminister the baseline assessment.</p>
<p>However, it is important to emphasize that, although this potential for  		noncomparable baseline data exists, as long as random assignment yields  		comparable groups, the fact that the followup interview data will be collected  		for both groups in a comparable way will ensure that treatment-control outcome  		comparisons will be unbiased. The main analytic functions of baseline data in  		this case, are to permit modeling of the impacts in a way that will increase  		the efficiency of the overall estimates, and to make possible estimates of  		subgroup impacts. Only if the random assignment fails to yield pretreatment  		comparability are baseline data necessary to reduce bias.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. SAMPLE DESIGN</h3>
<p>We begin our discussion of sample size with the allocation of the sample  		to treatment and control groups. Second, we estimate the sample size needed to  		have a good chance of detecting channelings impacts. Third, we discuss  		the allocation of the sample across sites. Together these three subsections  		describe the basic sample design and the motivation behind each decision  		implicit in the design. We conclude by discussing a midcourse  		correction that was built into the design to increase the research sample  		build-up in case the rate of channeling project caseload build-up fell short of  		plan, which turned out to be the case.</p>
<h4>Allocation of Sample to Treatment and Control  		Groups</h4>
<p>The primary objective of the research is to detect impacts of each of  		the two channeling models separately; a secondary but important objective is to  		detect differences in impacts between the two models. Thus, we will first  		develop the sample design for detecting impacts of a single model, and then  		examine its implications for the ability to detect differences between  		models.</p>
<p>The most efficient allocation of the sample between treatments and  		controls depends upon the variance of the outcome measures and the cost of  		observations for treatments and controls. If neither variance nor cost differs  		between the treatments and controls, then maximum statistical precision is  		obtained by comparing equal numbers of treatments and controls. Under the null  		hypothesis of no impact, random assignment implies an equal expected variance  		between the treatment and control groups. The issue of cost differences is more  		complicated. Because members of the treatment group receive their initial  		assessments from the channeling project, whereas the controls are assessed by  		research staff, the treatment group observations are about 25 percent less  		costly than the control group observations.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note9">9</a></font></sup> This cost difference could imply that the  		treatment group should be larger than the control group. However, we calculated  		the improvement in minimum detectable difference in outcomes from increasing  		the treatment-control ratio above one (holding the budget constant) and found  		that the gains were extremely small. Because a larger treatment-control ratio  		would require a larger total sample size to maintain the same detectable  		difference and because the ability to generate enough eligible clients is  		questionable, we decided that the very small gains in ability to detect impacts  		were probably not worth the increased risks of falling short of the needed  		sample. We will return to this issue below when we discuss the midcourse  		correction.</p>
<h4>Sample Size</h4>
<p>Having concluded that the preferred design was to have treatment and  		control groups of equal size, the ability of the research to detect the impacts  		of a particular channeling model--it such effects actually occur--determines  		the sample size needed for the research. Five factors must be considered in  		assessing alternative sample sizes from this perspective: the confidence level  		of the hypothesis tests to be performed, the desired power of the tests (i.e.,  		the probability of observing statistically significant impacts if they exist),  		the size of the true impacts, the statistical variances of the outcome  		measures, and the level of disaggregation to be used in the analysis. Each will  		be discussed in turn.</p>
<p><b>Confidence level of hypothesis tests</b>. With regard to the  		confidence level of the hypothesis tests to be conducted, we assume a 95  		percent confidence level, one-tailed test. This standard is equivalent to a 90  		percent two-tailed test, the type of test used when one has no hypothesis about  		the direction of the effect. However, a one-tailed test is more appropriate  		than a two-tailed test for the analysis of any of the channeling impacts for  		which we have strong a priori hypotheses concerning the direction of any  		impacts. The ability to observe statistically significant differences could be  		increased (or the required sample sizes could be lowered) if lower confidence  		levels were used. However, the use of tests comparable to those assumed here is  		widely viewed as standard practice in the research and evaluation community,  		and therefore is important to the defensibility of the results.</p>
<p><b>Desired probability of detecting impacts</b>. With respect to the  		desired probability of detecting statistically significant impacts when such  		impacts occur--i.e., the power of the proposed hypothesis tests--we use a  		common standard in the evaluation community for reliability: a desired  		detection probability of 90 percent. A 90 percent power level means that under  		the proposed sample size the research would have a nine out of 10 chance of  		detecting program impacts of a specified size if they are present.</p>
<p><b>Size of detectable impacts</b>. The size of the impacts which are  		expected to be observed is important because larger impacts are easier to  		detect and therefore require smaller sample sizes for a given desired detection  		probability. Our sample size calculation is based on the ability of the  		research to detect impacts on the rate of nursing home utilization. While  		ability to detect impacts on other outcome measures is also clearly important,  		the institutionalization rate is one of the most important outcome  		measures--reducing unnecessary institutionalization is the major mechanism  		through which channeling is expected to have impacts--and sample sizes needed  		to detect impacts on other dichotomous outcomes (mortality rates, the  		proportion severely impaired, etc.) are similar.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note10">10</a></font></sup> Specifically, the sample is designed so that  		six percentage points is the minimum reduction in the institutionalization rate  		that can be detected (with 90 percent power).</p>
<p><b>Variance of outcome measures</b>. The statistical variance of the  		outcome measure is important because the larger the variance of the outcome  		measure (relative to the difference to be detected), the more difficult it  		becomes to attribute an observed difference to channeling rather than to chance  		sample variance. To be conservative, we have used the largest possible variance  		of the institutionalization rate, that is, .25.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Level of disaggregation in the analysis</b>. The sample size  		estimates are based on analysis conducted at the model level of disaggregation.  		To the extent that greater disaggregation is desired, such as analysis for  		individual sites or analysis for specific subgroups of the target population,  		relevant sample sizes for those parts of the analysis would be smaller, and  		thus the minimum detectable impacts for a given level of power would have to be  		greater. In other words, the program's impacts for subgroups would have to be  		larger in order to be detected with the same 90 percent power. (Smaller impacts  		do, of course, have a chance--albeit lower--of being detected for  		subgroups.)</p>
<p>*   *   *</p>
<p>Combining these five factors and the, one-to-one treatment-control  		ratio, it was determined that the single model hypotheses should be tested by  		comparing a sample of approximately 1,200 treatments with 1,200  		controls.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note12">12</a></font></sup> This  		implied a total sample size of 4,800, including both channeling models.</p>
<p>Such sample size calculations depend upon an assumption about the  		ability to pool control groups between the two models. Two extreme assumptions  		are possible. One assumption is that systematic cross-site differences make the  		control groups for the two models noncomparable, requiring the treatment group  		within each site to have its own control group. Since channeling models were  		not randomly allocated to sites, systematic differences are clearly possible.  		Under this assumption, which is the one made in the sample size calculations  		performed above, impacts for each model must be estimated using the control  		group from the sites where that model is being tested. Thus, for example, the  		control groups from the basic case management sites are assumed to provide no  		additional information about what would have happened to individuals in the  		absence of the treatment being tested at the financial control sites because  		the environments or individuals at the basic sites are very different from  		those in the financial control sites.</p>
<p>In testing for differential impacts between the two models under this  		assumption of cross-model dissimilarity of the control groups, the research  		must test for <b>differences</b> between the treatment-control  		<b>differences</b> for the two models.</p>
<p>The precision with which such differences of differences can be detected  		is smaller than the precision with which simple treatment-control differences  		for a single model can be detected. In particular, with the sample of 1,200  		treatments and 1,200 controls in each model, the minimum detectable  		differential between models is 8.4 percentage points.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note13">13</a></font></sup> The differential impacts, therefore, will  		have to be relatively large to be detected with the sample size. For example,  		if one model reduces the institutionalization rate by 3.0 percentage points,  		the other would have to reduce it by 11.4 points in order to have a 90 percent  		chance of finding a statistically significant differential impact between the  		two models if a difference in impacts of the two models is detected, the  		research cannot distinguish, based on the hypothesis tests alone, whether the  		difference is due to a difference in the effects of the channeling models on  		the one hand, or a difference in the control groups at the sites where it was  		tested, on the other. A judgment about which possible explanation of observed  		differential impacts to choose will have to be made based on information  		obtained as part of the process research described below.</p>
<p>The other extreme assumption is that the control groups can be pooled  		without question as they could, for example, if the treatment group were  		randomly assigned to the basic case management or financial control treatments  		<b>within</b> a site. Then, the estimates of basic case management model  		impacts would be based on a comparison of the case management model treatment  		group with the <b>entire</b> control group for both models and, similarly, the  		financial control model impacts would be estimated based on a comparison with  		the entire control group. Differential impacts of the two models would be  		estimated simply by comparing the treatment groups of the two models (since  		individuals were randomly assigned to the two treatments). In this extreme case  		of perfect pooling--i.e., a common control group--the ability to detect impacts  		is greater. With the added assumption of no site-specific variability, the  		minimum detectable difference for a single model would be 5.2 percentage points  		(rather than 6.0), and for differential impacts between models, 6.0 percentage  		points (rather than 8.4.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In reality, the channeling demonstration lies somewhere between these  		two extremes. We have assumed that pooling will not be possible because the  		groups of sites where the two models are being tested do appear to differ  		systematically from each other and because the models may attract and enroll  		different populations. Moreover, because the extent of the ability to pool can  		only be known ex post, assuming that pooling can be done runs the risk that if  		the pooling assumption is incorrect, the minimum detectable difference would be  		too large. After examining the risks of assuming pooling is possible, we  		concluded that the design should not take the risk of being unable to pool the  		two models. Of course, if pooling does prove to be feasible, then the minimum  		detectable difference will be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<h4>Allocation of the Sample Across Sites</h4>
<p>The allocation of the sample across demonstration sites has been  		influenced by the desire to draw inferences from the observed impacts of the  		demonstration about what the impacts of a channeling program would be across  		the nation. Although the channeling demonstration sites have not been chosen to  		represent a national population, they will provide a test of channeling in a  		broad range of environments.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note15">15</a></font></sup> For the basic case management model, sites  		range from Houston, Texas to the counties surrounding Portland, Maine, and for  		the financial control model, from Rensselaer County in upstate New York to  		Miami, Florida. The best strategy to test channeling in this broad range of  		environments is to have approximately equal samples across sites. As discussed  		in the following section, however, this plan could not be implemented  		fully.</p>
<h4>The Midcourse Correction</h4>
<p>The plan to have equal samples at each site imposed a constraint on the  		total sample: its size would be determined by the capacity of the smallest  		site. The size of the potentially eligible target populations, and hence the  		capacity to build caseloads, differs considerably from, for example, Rensselaer  		County to Philadelphia. Because slower than expected caseload build-up would  		increase the cost of the demonstration and delay the completion of the  		research, it was decided to build into the design the possibility of a  		midcourse correction if sites' caseload build-up fell short of plan.</p>
<p>The plan was straightforward. Sites were divided into three groups,  		small, medium, and large, depending on the estimated size of the target  		population in the community and capacity to build caseload. The sites had  		different ratios of treatments to controls--small 1:1, medium 1.5:1, and large  		2:1. If caseload build-up had gone according to plan, all treatments and  		controls would have been followed in the research sample at small sites, but  		only two-thirds of the treatments at medium size sites and half the treatments  		at large sites. This plan would have resulted in a research sample with an  		equal number of treatments and controls at all sites and approximately equal  		samples across sites.</p>

</tr></table><p>The alternate plan, which was to be considered after five months of site  		operations (just before the first follow-up interview) was to follow up all  		treatments (as well as all controls) at all sites. The alternate plan required  		a somewhat larger total sample size to maintain the same precision of the  		estimates because the ratio of treatments to controls is not equal.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note16">16</a></font></sup> At the designated decision  		point, five months after site operations began, the caseload build-up had  		fallen short of plan, making the midcourse correction necessary. We then  		developed a revised alternate plan that took actual caseload build-up during  		the first months into account. Although this revised plan yields an unequal  		distribution of the sample across sites, it permits the demonstration to meet  		its sample size target more easily, given shortfalls in caseload build-up.  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableII1">Table II.1</a> summarizes the three plans.</p>
<p>A final decision point when some additional adjustment of the sample  		allocation may be possible is near the end of research sample intake (which is  		scheduled to extend over one year of site operations). At that time, it will be  		possible to end intake one or two months early (if a particular site dominates  		the sample unduly) or to extend sample intake a month or two at some or all  		sites (if there is a serious shortfall).</p>
<h3>C. ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY</h3>
<p>All the areas of the impact research--service utilization, costs,  		clients, and caregivers--use the same basic analysis methodology. However, each  		emphasizes different specialized analysis techniques as appropriate for the  		hypotheses being tested. This section discusses the basic statistical  		techniques to be used in the analysis generally, and briefly describes  		refinements that will be used in certain parts of it. </p>
<h4>Comparisons of Means</h4>
<p>The simplest method for assessing channelings impacts is to  		compare mean levels of the outcomes of interest for the treatment group and a  		like group of individuals not offered the program treatment. For example,  		comparison of the number of days treatment and control group members were  		institutionalized provides unbiased estimates of channeling's impact on this  		important outcome.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note17">17</a></font></sup>  		Whether the estimated impact is statistically important--i.e., is unlikely to  		be a chance result--is tested using standard t-tests.</p>
<p>This procedure has the advantage that it is straightforward and  		inexpensive to implement and, thus, is particularly useful in preliminary  		analyses and in descriptive analyses. It has, however, several important  		shortcomings. First, while comparison of means generally gives unbiased  		estimates of impacts, alternative statistical techniques give more precise  		estimates of channeling's impacts. Second, despite random assignment,  		treatments and controls may differ along key characteristics relevant to the  		outcome of interest, either due to chance or to sample attrition that results  		in the unavailability of follow-up data. Such differences cannot be accounted  		far by using a simple comparison of means. Finally, some questions require  		comparisons to be drawn across sample subgroups defined by factors that are not  		independent of (i.e., are endogenous to) receipt of the channeling treatment  		(e.g., whether the individual resides in the community). In these cases, the  		proper handling of the inherent selection bias problems requires a more  		sophisticated approach to the analysis (see further discussion below).</p>
<p>For these reasons, additional analyses must be undertaken to obtain  		accurate, defensible estimates of impacts. Such analyses must rely on  		behavioral modeling--knowledge about the factors that affect outcomes--and on  		more sophisticated statistical techniques to take advantage of that knowledge  		in the estimation of impacts. By doing this, the analysis can make more precise  		estimates of channeling's impacts (thus, maximizing the ability to detect  		impacts); improve the explanation of how channeling achieves its impacts and  		why they vary across sites and among subgroups; and facilitate judgments about  		impacts in other environments, over a longer time period, or under a modified  		form of channeling.</p>
<h4>Regression Analysis</h4>
<p>The statistical technique to be used for much of the impact estimation  		is multiple regression analysis, a natural extension of comparisons of means  		that allows the incorporation of a priori knowledge about the factors that  		affect outcomes. Channeling's overall impact will be estimated by regressing  		outcomes of interest (such as costs, measures of functional capacity, etc.) on  		a dichotomous variable for whether the sample member was in the treatment or  		control group and a set of variables that measure factors that affect the  		outcomes of interest. The specific type of equation that will be estimated is  		given by equation (1),</p>
<p>(1) Y<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>T</sub>T +  		b<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + ... + b<sub>N</sub>X<sub>N</sub> +  		u<sub>i</sub>,</p>
<p>where Y<sub>i</sub> is the outcome of interest; T is a binary variable  		equal to one if the person is in the treatment group and zero otherwise;  		X<sub>i</sub>...X<sub>N</sub> are exogenous and predetermined control variables  		that predict the outcome including a constant term; a<sub>T</sub> and  		b<sub>i</sub>...b<sub>N</sub> are the coefficients to be estimated; and  		u<sub>i</sub> is a random disturbance term. The estimated coefficient of the  		treatment variable, a<sub>T</sub>, is the estimate of the average impact of  		channeling on the treatment group as compared to the control group. Again,  		whether the impact is statistically significant will be tested using standard  		t-tests.</p>
<p>The difference between the comparison of means and the regression  		estimates of impacts results from the inclusion of the variables that  		control for or hold constant important factors that  		affect the outcome--factors such as level of disability, living arrangement,  		financial resources, or prior service utilization.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note18">18</a></font></sup> Controlling for such factors improves the  		precision of the estimates, and hence increases the likelihood of detecting  		impacts. It corrects for measured differences between the treatment and control  		groups that arise as a result of chance sampling variability or sample  		attrition. In order not to bias the estimates of channeling's impacts, however,  		these variables must be independent of the treatment; they are thus collected  		in the screen and baseline interviews, which are administered prior to receipt  		of the channeling treatment.</p>
<p>Choice of control variables must be based on a priori specification of  		the factors that affect outcomes. We have identified several factors we expect  		to affect behavior with respect to institutionalization and service utilization  		(and hence all other outcomes): the individual's care needs, the availability  		of informal supports, financial constraints, the cost of care, and attitudes  		toward institutionalization, as well as demographic characteristics. In  		addition, the availability of services--both institutional and  		community-based--will affect service utilization as will other environmental  		factors. Because there are only five sites for each model, the variation in  		such factors will be quite limited, so we will use a dichotomous variable for  		each site to control for differences in service availability and environmental  		factors across sites. To control for other factors not accounted for by those  		listed above, we will include the baseline value of the outcome measure being  		analyzed (or a slight variant of it) as a proxy for unmeasured predictors of  		the outcome. For example, in estimating impacts on utilization of home health  		services at six months, we will include utilization of home health services  		prior to channeling (reported on the baseline) as a control variable.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableII2">Table II.2</a> summarizes these various factors and  		presents the operational measures that will be used as proxies for them. These  		proxy variables will be standardized as much as possible across the analysis of  		various outcomes. For the basic analysis, the control variables will be limited  		to measures obtained at baseline to minimize the risk of biasing the estimates  		of treatment-control differences.</p>
<h4>Maximum Likelihood Techniques</h4>
<p>The analytic framework presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>  		is implicitly a recursive model in which channeling affects costs, clients, and  		caregivers indirectly through its impact on living arrangement and service  		utilization. It is, as indicated, a simplification that ignores the  		simultaneity among outcomes. Because the primary interest of the research is  		channeling's overall impacts, the basic analysis will estimate a reduced form  		model, such as equation (1) above, rather than the structural models that may  		underlie it.</p>
<p>The regression analysis model that will typically be used in our  		analysis is the linear ordinary least squares form because of its flexibility  		and relative simplicity. In certain cases, however, it may not yield estimates  		of channeling's impacts with desirable statistical properties, for example,  		where the outcome measure is dichotomous.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note19">19</a></font></sup> Maximum likelihood techniques have been  		developed to analyze these outcome measures, but they are expensive to  		implement for large data bases of the magnitude to be produced by this project.  		Because the standard regression models have been shown in most applications to  		yield unbiased estimates at lower cost, we plan to rely primarily on that  		procedure and to reestimate selectively using maximum likelihood techniques.  		These techniques are briefly described here.</p>
<p>Regression is not a theoretically appropriate method of analysis when  		the dependent variable of interest is binary or otherwise strictly  		qualitative--for example, in the case where the hypothesis of interest is  		whether channeling affects the probability that a client enters an  		institution.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note20">20</a></font></sup> The most  		frequently used alternatives in such cases are probit and logic analysis. These  		techniques assume that, although the dependent variable is dichotomous, it is  		an outcome that is a function of an unobserved continuous variable. Such  		specifications result in equations similar to equation (1) above, which can be  		estimated to determine the impact that channeling has on outcomes, such as the  		probability of institutionalization and whether the particular impact is  		significantly different from zero. Variants of these models can also be used to  		obtain estimates of program impacts on outcomes that can be defined only in  		terms of multiple categories (whether ordered or unordered). For example, in  		examining the impact of channeling on mortality, institutionalization, or  		community residence, this procedure could be used to estimate the effect of the  		program on the probability that a sample member falls into each of the  		specified categories.</p>
<p>Another type of outcome for which regression is not the appropriate  		method of estimation involves outcome measures defined as a duration or length  		of time until an event occurs. This is important, since key outcomes of  		interest include the effect of the program on the length of time until  		individuals die or become institutionalized, and since the follow-up period is  		limited to 18 months. Survival rate analysis is an analytic method that  		consists, basically, of assuming that the length of time until the event of  		interest occurs follows a specific distribution (e.g., the exponential or the  		Weibull distribution).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Yet another technique which is useful in making estimates beyond the  		18-month follow-up period is event history analysis. This technique employs a  		Markov-type model to estimate channeling's impacts on possible outcome states.  		For example, three states can be defined as: institutionalized, deceased, and  		living in the community. Maximum likelihood techniques are then used to  		estimate the transition probabilities between states as a function of factors  		that affect these outcomes. (See Tuma and Robins, 1980, for an application of  		this technique.)</p>
<h4>Disaggregations of the Overall Impacts Based on  		Exogenous Variables</h4>
<p>We do not expect channeling's impacts to be uniform across sites or  		among subgroups of the target population. As indicated above, an important  		objective of the research is to estimate and compare the impacts of the two  		channeling models to be tested by the demonstration. The sample size is  		designed to satisfy these objectives, and both models will be tested in a range  		of environments to permit meaningful comparisons.</p>
<p>Other differences across the sites are also likely; we will examine them  		in the context of the findings for the demonstration as a whole and attempt to  		understand: the reasons for any significant differences. This analysis will be  		based on the documentation of the channeling intervention and the long term  		care environment described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVIII">Chapter VIII</a>. Because  		there will be only tea sites and there are many variations across sites that  		could account for differences in impacts--such as level of public funding for  		long term care, the existence of other case management services, the  		integration of channeling in the health and home care system, or the  		organizational structure and staffing of the channeling project--definitive  		conclusions about the reasons for site differences are unlikely. Thus, although  		we will be able to test rigorously for the existence of differences across  		sites, explaining those differences will be more difficult. Nonetheless, based  		on the process research, we should be able to suggest plausible causes of  		differences in impacts across sites.</p>
<p>We also expect differences among subgroups of the target population. For  		example, we expect differences in impacts depending on level of disability and  		the need for care. One purpose of disaggregating the overall impact by this and  		other dimensions is to try to identify subgroups of the target population for  		which channeling is most effective. In addition, such disaggregations will  		identify the distribution of impacts among the client population, for example,  		their distribution by income class. We have identified the following major  		dimensions along which subgroup analyses will be conducted:</p>
<ul><li>Functional Status</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Availability of Informal Supports</li>
<li>Financial Resources</li>
<li>Insurance Coverage (medicaid, medicare, and private insurance)</li>
</ul><p>These and other subgroups that may be added during the analysis will be  		defined using baseline data, to ensure that the definition of the subgroups is  		independent of the channeling treatment. It should be noted that the sample  		size in each subgroup will be relatively small, so that subgroup differentials  		must be larger than the overall impacts in order to have a similar likelihood  		of being detected.</p>
<p>The methods for disaggregating the overall impact by subgroup of the  		target population or by site are natural extensions of the methods described  		above. Comparison of means can be extended to subgroup analysis simply by  		dividing the sample into the subgroups of interest (e.g., age groups) and  		comparing the treatment group mean with than of the control group for each  		subgroup.</p>
<p>The regression technique is extended by including a separate treatment  		variable for each subgroup. Specifically, the treatment variable is  		"interacted" with variables for each subgroup using the following  		specification:</p>
<p>(2) Y<sub>i</sub> = (a<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>1</sub> + ... +  		a<sub>m</sub>z<sub>m</sub>)T + b<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + ... +  		b<sub>n</sub>X<sub>n</sub> + u<sub>i</sub></p>
<p>where Z<sub>i</sub>...Z<sub>m</sub> are binary variables denoting  		whether the sample member is a member of a particular subgroup.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note22">22</a></font></sup> For example, to estimate impact  		on different age groups, Z<sub>1</sub> would be defined as one if the sample  		member was between 65 and 74 years old, zero otherwise; Z<sub>2</sub> would be  		one if the sample member was between 75 and 84, zero otherwise; and  		Z<sub>3</sub> would be one if the sample member was 85 or older, zero  		otherwise. The impact of channeling on an individual in subgroup Z<sub>i</sub>  		is a<sub>i</sub>. To determine if channeling's impact on any one group is  		significant, we will test whether the coefficient a<sub>i</sub> is different  		from zero with a t-test. To determine if a set of subgroups differ from one  		another (i.e., whether a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>j</sub> = .... = a<sub>k</sub>) we  		will use an F-test. For these tests to be valid, the Z<sub>i</sub> must not be  		affected by channeling, so we will generally use the predetermined baseline  		values of variables to define the subgroups,</p>
<h4>Disaggregations Based on Endogenous Variables</h4>
<p>In some cases, the disaggregation of interest is not independent of the  		channeling treatment. Whenever such disaggregations are attempted, we can no  		longer rely on the power of the experimental design to interpret the results,  		and specialized statistical techniques are required for estimates. Two examples  		will illustrate the type of disaggregation that falls in this category.</p>
<p>One example is the estimation of impacts on those who actually  		participate in channeling. For a variety of reasons, not all sample members  		will participate in channeling--some will make arrangements for services on  		their own or change their minds about channeling prior to the initial  		assessment, and others will be determined ineligible by channeling after  		assessment or will decline to participate in channeling after they discuss the  		care plan with their case manager. One question, then, concerns the magnitude  		of impacts on the participant subgroup of the treatment group.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The difficulty in estimating impacts on participants is that such  		estimates necessarily depart from the basic treatment-control comparison  		methodology. The virtue of an experimental design is that successful  		randomization ensures that the comparison of the treatment and control groups  		outcome measures the difference between what happens in the presence of  		channeling and what would have happened in its absence. Application of the  		experimental methodology requires, however, that the <b>entire</b> treatment  		group be compared to the <b>entire</b> control group (unless subgroups are  		selected as described above based on characteristics determined prior to  		randomization).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note24">24</a></font></sup>  		Departing from this principle weakens the research integrity that randomization  		is designed to ensure. Such a departure requires assumptions about the  		determinants of participation and use of formal statistical techniques to  		adjust for the "selection bias" that would be inherent in comparing the  		participant group--which is clearly a "selected" subset of the treatment group,  		selected through channeling's appropriateness determination and the  		individual's own participation choice--with the entire control group.</p>
<p>A second, somewhat more complicated, example is the disaggregation of  		impacts on total costs (or any other outcome) among three subgroups--those who  		die, those who are in nursing homes, and those who live in the community. Total  		costs can be disaggregated into three components according to:</p>
<p>(3) C = C<sub>D</sub>P<sub>D</sub> +  		C<sub>I</sub>P<sub>I</sub> + C<sub>C</sub>P<sub>C</sub></p>
<p>where C = average total cost;C<sub>D</sub>, C<sub>I</sub>, C<sub>C</sub>  		= the average cost for those who die, enter institutions, and remain in the  		community, respectively; and P<sub>D</sub>, P<sub>I</sub>, P<sub>C</sub> = the  		corresponding proportion of sample members in the three groups. Although  		average total costs can be disaggregated according to this accounting identity  		for both treatment and control groups, the <b>difference</b> between the  		treatment and control groups for specific cost components must be interpreted  		very carefully. For example, the difference between the treatment and control  		groups in average cost of community care results from two factors: (1) impacts  		on the cost of community care for a given type of individual and (2) changes in  		the composition of individuals residing in the community. For example, the  		average cost of community care could go up because the subset of the treatment  		group that remains in the community is more disabled than the subset in the  		control group that remains in the community. This could be true, even though  		channeling reduces the cost of community care for each of individual. To  		attempt to determine whether the cost of caring for a given type of individual  		has been affected by channeling, special estimation techniques must be  		used.</p>
<p>Analyses such as those just described require special techniques to  		disaggregate overall impacts along variables that are endogenous. A number of  		statistical techniques are available for such analyses (Heckman 1976; Maddala  		and Lee 1976; and Barnow, Cain, and Goldberger 1978). The Maddala-Lee method,  		for example, would involve four steps in applying it to the estimation of  		impacts on participants:</p>
<ul><li>specifying a probit model for the probability of participating in  		  channeling as a function of personal characteristics and other factors that may  		  affect the probability of participation</li>
<li>estimating this model using the entire treatment group</li>
<li>from these estimates, constructing for each sample member the  		  predicted probability of participating in channeling</li>
<li>replacing the binary variable representing actual participation with  		  predicted probabilities for these individuals, and running the desired  		  regression.</li>
</ul><p>The Heckman procedure involves the same first two steps as the  		Maddala-Lee procedure. The third step requires construction of a variable for  		each observation:</p>
<p>(4) d = f(XB) / F(XB),</p>
<p>where f() and F() are the density and cumulative distribution functions  		of the standard normal function, X is a row vector containing the personal  		characteristics and other variables that affect the probability of  		participating specified in the first step, and B is a vector of the  		coefficients estimated in the second step. This new variable is then included  		as an additional regressor in the equation of interest to account for the  		nonzero conditional expected value of the disturbance term, given the selection  		rule. Both the Maddala-Lee and the Heckman procedures yield asymptotically  		unbiased estimates of the effects of the program on the outcomes of  		interest.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII.D" id="sectionII.D">D. METHODOLOGICAL  		RESEARCH</a></h3>
<p>Two potential methodological problems are inherent in the research  		design: sample attrition and noncomparability of baseline data. It is essential  		that we determine whether these potential problems arise in fact and, if they  		do, to use appropriate techniques to adjust the results to the extent  		feasible.</p>
<p>The possibility of attrition bias is inherent in any study of this type.  		If the proportion of treatment group members who refuse to be interviewed  		differs from that of controls, if the characteristics of nonrespondents differ  		between the the two groups, or if nonresponse is related to as outcome of  		interest, then the treatment-control comparisons may not be valid.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note25">25</a></font></sup> Conceptually, the problem is  		similar to that of sample selection bias just discussed: treatments and  		controls in the sample available for analysis are not comparable in a way that  		is systematically related to the outcomes of interest. To the extent that  		estimated differences in behavior treatments and controls in this selected  		sample may differ from that for the full sample, biased estimates of  		channeling's impacts will result.</p>
<p>In the analysis of potential attrition bias, we will use the Heckman  		technique just described to control for the fact that impacts will be estimated  		based on incomplete samples. A probit model of the "nonresponse decision" will  		be specified and estimated using data on individual characteristics and other  		variables that affect the probability of nonresponse obtained from the baseline  		assessment; and the results from this model will be used to estimate  		channeling's impacts. If this analysis shows that controlling for selection  		bias on key outcomes leads to different estimates of impacts--i.e., if there is  		attrition bias--then all important impacts will have to be estimated using the  		Heckman approach. The analysis will be complicated by the fact that attrition  		will occur prior to the baseline, and we expect differential attrition between  		treatments and controls. The screening data, which is available for everyone  		who is randomized, will therefore be important in the analysis of sample  		attrition.</p>
<p>The potential problem of noncomparable baseline data arises because, as  		discussed above, to permit channeling project staff to conduct the baseline  		assessment for clients--which is important from a clinical  		perspective--noncomparable data collection procedures are used at baseline.  		Research interviewers administer the baseline assessment to the control group;  		channeling staff administer it to the treatment group. Since baseline data play  		an important role in the research, it is important to test for systematic  		differences in data collected by research and channeling interviewers and to  		attempt to correct for differences if they are found.</p>
<p>There are two ways of testing for noncomparability. First, the mean  		characteristics of the treatment group can be compared to those of the control  		group at baseline and the difference attributed to differences in methods of  		data collection. Such an inference require that (1) the randomization resulted  		in treatment and control groups that are comparable at the screen, and (2)  		there is no differential nonresponse between the screen and initial baseline  		assessment by treatments versus controls. If differences are observed at  		baseline, therefore, differences in data collection procedures will be only one  		of several possible explanations.</p>
<p>Therefore, a second, more direct test of data comparability will be  		conducted. A random sample of about 400 treatment group members will be  		interviewed a second time by research interviewers as .a validation sample.  		This will allow comparison of the two data collection procedures applied to the  		same individuals. This second method is stronger than the first in that it does  		not requires assumptions about the integrity of the randomization procedures  		and differential nonresponse. It is weaker, however, in several respects. The  		sample size for the comparison is smaller.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note26">26</a></font></sup> Time will inevitably pass between the first  		(clinical) assessment and the second (research validation) assessment, during  		which the individual's condition and circumstances may change. In addition,  		there may be some respondent learning or change in willingness to respond  		between the first and second administration of the interview. The comparison of  		the original (clinical) and second (validation) administration data is, thus,  		not a pure test of differences in data collection techniques.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note27">27</a></font></sup> If differences exist, a  		judgment will have to be made concerning the reason for any differences.  		Despite the limitations placed by circumstances on validation methodology, it  		should provide evidence of any serious noncomparability that may exist.</p>
<p>In the event of serious noncomparability, it may be necessary to take an  		alternative approach: use the screening data instead of the baseline data,  		either entirely or for a selected set of variables where there are  		noncomparabilities. Use of the screening data has the advantage that it is  		comparable between treatments and controls, but the disadvantages are that it  		is limited in scope and may not be comparable across sites.</p>

<p>This chapter has described the research design and analysis methodology.  		The next chapter introduces the presentation of channelings impacts on  		service utilization, costs, individuals and informal caregivers by establishing  		a framework for the research.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. FRAMWORK AND OVERVIEW OF EXPECTED  		IMPACTS</a></h2>
<p>To evaluate channeling, the research design needs a framework that  		serves as a basis for developing hypotheses about expected outcomes, focusing  		attention on the most important policy questions, and guiding the data  		collection activities.</p>
<h3>A. FRAMEWORK</h3>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#figureIII1">Figure III.1</a> presents a framework for  		analyzing channeling's potential impacts that is intentionally simplified to  		focus attention on the most important ones.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note28">28</a></font></sup> In the left-hand box of the figure are the  		exogenous factors (i.e., variables not affected by channeling) that condition  		channeling's impacts on the outcomes of interest.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note29">29</a></font></sup> Client characteristics (disabilities, for  		example) are important determinants of service needs and hence the potential  		role of case management. Similarly, the availability of funding under existing  		public programs as well as the nature of the service provider system in the  		community are major determinants of the way in which channeling intervenes and  		of the opportunities that exist for substituting community for institutional  		care.</p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figureIII1" id="figureIII1">FIGURE III.1</a>:  			 Simplified Framework for the Research</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/67621/designesFIII1.JPG" /></td>
</tr></table><p>The next box in the figure represents channeling's intervention on  		behalf of clients and caregivers by providing assessment, case management, and  		expanded funding for community services, and by applying the financial control  		model's limitations on the use of community services. The remainder of  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#figureIII1">Figure III.1</a> gives the sequence of potential  		outcomes. Impacts on service utilization are diagrammed first in the sequence.  		This is because, although some impacts on service utilization can be regarded  		as beneficial in and of themselves, the major <b>ultimate</b> impacts of  		channeling (cost impacts, client impacts, and caregiver impacts) are effected  		<b>through</b> channeling's impact on service utilization, particularly through  		reductions in institutionalization. In other words, channeling is expected to  		affect service utilization by rationalizing the delivery of services and  		improving access to community-based services, in particular, by substituting  		community-based services for nursing home care. This change in service  		utilization in turn affects public and private costs, the well-being of elderly  		clients, and the well-being of the family and friends who take care of  		them.</p>
<p>Whether channeling is ultimately judged a success depends in part on how  		well the various sites perform their mission and in part on the needs and  		characteristics of the clients they serve. In developing expectations about  		channeling's impacts, it is useful to classify the clients into analytic groups  		according to what would have happened to their living arrangement status in the  		absence of channeling. For this purpose, the important analytic distinction is  		in terms of how channeling affects a client's community living arrangement  		compared to what it would have been in the absence of channeling.</p>
<p>Broadly construed, there are two possible statuses--in the community or  		in an institution. The matrix shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII1">Table III.1</a>  		defines the possibilities. Down the left-hand side are the two possible states  		without channeling. Across the top are the two possible states <b>with</b>  		channeling. The result is a four-part classification:</p>
<ul><li>The A group (institution/community) are those who would have been in  		  an institution but who avoid or postpone institutionalization because of  		  channeling and thus reside in the community.</li>
<li>The B group (community/community) are those who would have been in  		  the community in the absence of channeling and who also live there as  		  channeling clients.</li>
<li>The C group (community/institution) are those who would have been in  		  the community in the absence of channeling but who live in an institution  		  because of channeling.</li>
<li>The D group (institution/institution) are those who would have been  		  in an institution in the absence of channeling and who remain in an institution  		  with channeling.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note30">30</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Considerable effort has been devoted in the demonstration to defining  		the eligibility criteria to maximize the likelihood that channeling will serve  		group A--that is, the group who would have been institutionalized without  		channeling but whom channeling enables to stay in the community. This is  		because channeling is expected to have its greatest impact in postponing or  		preventing institutionalization for those who are in the community but are at  		greatest risk of unnecessary institutionalization.</p>

</tr></table><p>Channeling is also designed, however, to have an impact on group  		B--those who would have remained in the community without channeling and whose  		type of living arrangement remains unchanged under channeling. For this group,  		channeling is also intended to bring about an improved match of services to  		needs--reducing unnecessary use of services on the one hand, and assisting  		those with unmet needs in gaining access to needed services, on the other.  		Because the services received by this group in the absence of channeling would  		in any case have been community-based services, the impacts of channeling for  		this group are likely to be different in important respects from its impacts on  		the first group (Group A), who would have received nursing home (or other  		institutional) care in the absence of channeling.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to Group C--those who would have been in the community  		in the absence of channeling, but who live in an institution because of the  		channeling intervention. Channeling is not designed with this group in mind;  		therefore, its quantitative importance in the client group and in the research  		sample is likely to be small. For this reason, Group C will be less prominent  		in our subsequent discussion. To the extent that clients in this group are  		encountered, however, it is certainly reasonable to expect the channeling  		process to result in arranging for more timely admittance to a nursing home.  		This would apply to those clients who, without channeling, would have remained  		longer either in the community (albeit at great risk to personal safety) or in  		a hospital, awaiting nursing home placement. In some evalulation contexts, this  		makes the analytic importance of this group greater than would be indicated  		either by its expected size or by the fact that it is not one of the groups  		channeling is designed to serve. In those limited contexts--particularly in the  		area of hospital utilization and its impact on overall costs--this group will  		be included in the discussion.</p>
<p>The fourth group (Group D)--those that would be institutionalized  		without channeling and are also institutionalized in its presence--can be  		properly ignored in the subsequent discussion of channeling's expected impacts.  		Channeling is not designed to serve this group, so the eligibility criteria are  		intended to exclude them from the program (and hence from the research  		sample).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>So, we have two major and one minor group left in our analytic  		framework:</p>
<ul><li>those who would have been institutionalized without channeling but,  		  with channeling, are enabled to stay in the community (the primary target  		  group)</li>
<li>those who would have been in the community without channeling and,  		  with channeling, are still in the community</li>
<li>those who would have been in the community without channeling but,  		  with channeling, are institutionalized.</li>
</ul><p>We should note that these analytic distinctions are made for purposes of  		developing hypotheses about channeling's overall impacts. It is tempting to  		think of dividing the sample into these analytic groups and conducting the  		analysis separately for each group. This is impossible however because, by  		definition, "what would have happened if" is unobservable for any particular  		sample member. The data from which our expected impact estimates will be  		calculated will not, therefore, differentiate along this dimension. In  		consequence, the observed treatment-control differences will be the overall  		impacts on all groups taken together. As discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter  		II</a>, we will also conduct subgroup analyses along observable characteristics  		such as measures of functional capacity (ADL and IADL) that are correlated with  		the risk of institutionalization.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The rest of this chapter discusses, within the framework of the three  		analytic groups as appropriate, the research objectives and expected impacts  		with respect to the four major areas--service impacts, and, primarily through  		them, cost, client, and caregiver impacts. Chapters IV through VII then go into  		each area in further detail.</p>
<h3>B. SERVICE UTILIZATION</h3>
<p>Our expectations with respect to the impacts of channeling on service  		utilization for the three analytic groups, along with our expectations of the  		overall impacts, are shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII2">Table III.2</a>.</p>
<p>For the group that is the primary target of channeling's eligibility  		criteria (i.e., the group that would be institutionalized in the absence of  		channeling but lives in the community as a result of channeling), impacts on  		service utilization flow directly from the impact on living arrangement.  		Nursing home utilization is reduced by definition. Utilization of both formal  		and informal services provided in the community is, therefore, expected to  		increase as a direct consequence of living in the community rather than a  		nursing home. Episodic hospital utilization for this group is not likely to be  		affected significantly by channeling; if anything, it can be expected to  		increase somewhat because nursing home care can to some extent substitute for  		hospital care. (A person residing in the community who becomes ill might be  		hospitalized, whereas some nursing home residents might remain and receive  		treatment in the nursing home.)</p>

</tr></table><p>For the group who would have been in the community without channeling  		and whose type of living arrangement is unaffected by the program, the impact  		on use of nursing homes is, again by definition, zero. The impact on the  		utilization of other services is, however, subject to countervailing  		influences. For example, if unnecessary hospitalizations result from inadequate  		community services or lack of nursing home beds, channeling, by improving  		access to the needed community services, may be able to reduce hospitalization  		among this group. On the other hand, under channeling better community services  		and more frequent monitoring of clients' needs by case managers might result in  		quicker attention to medical problems and hence, in some cases, more  		hospitalizations; however, we expect that total days in hospitals (as opposed  		to rates of hospitalization) would be lower even in this instance. Therefore,  		on balance, we hypothesize a reduction in the use of hospital care for this  		group.</p>
<p>The impacts on services provided in the community to this second group  		is also likely to be in both directions. Because channeling seeks to improve  		access to services and to reduce unmet needs, many individuals in this group  		can be expected to receive more formal community services. This is clearly  		possible in the financial control model sites, where channeling can pay for  		community services not available under regular government programs. However,  		channeling could also reduce utilization of formal community services for this  		group by encouraging greater reliance on informal care or avoiding utilization  		of unnecessary services. Indeed, in the financial control model sites, the caps  		on individual and average service expenditures are intended to encourage  		cost-saving changes to offset the availability of additional publicly financed  		services. Although the net impact of these competing effects could be positive  		or negative, our judgment is that the expansion of access to community services  		(in both channeling models, though more so in the financial control model) will  		dominate the cost-saving alterations in service packages. On balance, we thus  		expect that formal community service utilization will be higher for those who  		would be living in the community irrespective of the channeling  		intervention.</p>
<p>Channeling's impact on informal care provided by family and friends for  		this group is again likely to be in both directions. To the extent that formal  		services are substitutes for informal care, channeling would be expected to  		reduce informal care. But, to the extent that formal community services  		complement informal care--as, for example, respite care does--and to the extent  		that channeling case managers can work effectively with family and friends to  		encourage the provision of care, then channeling may increase the amount of  		informal care provided. We hypothesize that the former will outweigh the  		latter, and that formal services will substitute for, or at least change the  		nature of, informal care for this group.</p>
<p>With respect to the third group--those who would have been in the  		community but instead are institutionalized as a result of channeling, the use  		of both formal and informal community care will, by definition, be lower and  		nursing home care higher as a consequence of channeling. In addition, because  		part of this group may well have been in a hospital awaiting nursing home  		placement in the absence of channeling, hospital utilization for this group is  		hypothesized to decrease.</p>
<p>The overall impact on service utilization depends, at least in part, on  		the relative sizes of the three subgroups described above; or, put another way,  		it depends on channeling's impact on the living arrangements of its clients. We  		expect the first two analytic groups, by virtue of their relative sizes, to be  		the most important in determining the overall impact on service utilization. As  		can be seen in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII2">Table III.2</a>, the use of nursing home  		and hospital care overall is expected to be lower, and use of formal community  		services higher than they would have been in the absence of channeling; with  		respect to the net impact on informal care, we have no prior expectations as to  		the direction of the impact.</p>
<h3>C. COSTS</h3>
<p>Changes in service utilization are the primary determinants of  		channeling's impacts on service costs and who pays them. <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII3">Table III.3</a> shows channeling's expected impacts on public  		and private costs for each of the three subgroups and overall. For channeling's  		primary target group, those who would have been institutionalized but who are  		in the community because of channeling, channeling is expected to reduce public  		costs. Its impact on private costs is less clear. On the one hand, living in  		the community requires a substantial private expenditure for basic necessities.  		Such private costs would not be incurred if someone were in a nursing home and  		eligible for medicaid. On the other hand, many persons enter nursing homes as  		private pay patients and must spend down before becoming eligible for Medicaid.  		We have no prior expectation as to which of these countervailing factors will  		predominate.</p>
<p>For the second group, those who would be living in the community  		irrespective of channeling, the public cost for community based long term care  		services is expected to increase relative to what would have happened in the  		absence of channeling. This is because increased access to formal community  		services and the availability of expanded services are expected to more than  		offset any cost reductions achieved by substituting less costly services for  		more expensive ones and by timely adjustment of care plans to changes in  		clients' needs. However, a reduction in public expenditures for unnecessary  		hospitalization could more than offset the anticipated increase in community  		service costs. The net impact is therefore difficult to predict. Private  		expenditures, in contrast, are likely to decrease for this group because some  		substitution of public for private expenditures seems likely.</p>

</tr></table><p>For the group that is institutionalized as a result of channeling,  		public costs could be reduced, under the assumption that this (arguably small)  		group will be more costly to serve in the community than in an institution. On  		the other hand, if such (more expensive) formal community services were not  		available or accessible in the first place, institutionalization would be  		likely to increase public costs. The net impact could thus be in either  		direction. We have no prior expectations concerning the direction of impact on  		private costs.</p>
<p>The overall impact on costs again depends upon the relative sizes of the  		three groups and the magnitude of the changes in service utilization. As can be  		seen from <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII3">Table III.3</a>, we have no prior expectation as  		to the net impact of channeling on either public or private costs. Given this  		uncertainty, and the intense policy concern about long term care costs, the  		research must place major emphasis on estimating cost impacts.</p>
<h3>D. CLIENTS</h3>
<p>As in the case of costs, impacts on clients are also determined  		primarily by channeling's ability to improve the match between client needs and  		long term care services, thus altering service utilization patterns (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#figureIII1">Figure III.1</a> above). The effects of the improved  		match on client well-being are measured by examining the impact of channeling  		on longevity, levels of functioning, degree of social and psychological  		well-being, the proportion of unmet needs for long term care services, and  		satisfaction with services received. The expected impacts on these measures for  		each of the three subgroups are summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII4">Table  		III.4</a>.</p>
<p>Because several aspects of nursing home placement--particularly negative  		functional and social-psychological attributes of institutional living and  		harmful effects of forced relocation--are associated with higher mortality in  		some cases, channeling can be expected to reduce mortality among the primary  		target group (those for whom institutionalization is prevented or delayed).  		Among the group who would be in the community irrespective of channeling,  		improved access to services (particularly health-related services) and  		monitoring of clients' conditions by case managers are also expected to prevent  		some avoidable deaths. For the group who became institutionalized because of  		channeling, however, the effect on mortality could be in either direction. On  		the one hand, the negative aspects of the institutionalization process itself,  		may increase mortality; but, on the other, better safety and supervision,  		increased access to medical care, and improved access to services available as  		a result of appropriate institutional placement may reduce mortality. Overall,  		we expect the latter effect to predominate.</p>

</tr></table><p>Impacts on functioning for the first two analytic groups are  		hypothesized to be positive. The deterioration of functioning with age, which  		is believed to be accelerated as a consequence of institutionalization, may be  		reduced for channeling clients who would have been placed in a nursing home in  		the absence of the channeling intervention. For the group who would have been  		in the community in any case, provision of specific needed services (e.g.,  		physical therapy, review of medications) or equipment (e.g., grab bars to  		assist with bathing, special toileting apparatus) may also enable channeling  		clients to function more independently. For the group institutionalized because  		of channeling, the impacts can be in both directions. If the client can receive  		services in an institution, particularly rehabilitative services not available  		in the community, then functioning could be positively affected. Declines in  		functioning associated with the institutionalization process could also be  		present for this group, however, and we have no prior expectations as to which  		effect will dominate.</p>
<p>Client social and psychological well-being, again, is expected to be  		positively affected for the first two groups. One major mechanism for affecting  		client well-being involves enabling individuals to reside in the community,  		because it is well documented that the majority of the elderly would prefer to  		remain there rather than enter a nursing home. Based on this preference, it is  		hypothesized that the social and psychological well-being for those clients  		avoiding nursing home placement would be improved. For the group whose living  		arrangements in the community are unaffected, the improved access to services  		and the presence of a case manager to arrange and monitor services is expected  		to have a positive effect on well-being. Impacts for the third group are, as  		before, less clear. An elderly individual living in isolated, substandard, or  		unsafe conditions may prefer to live in a nursing home. On the other hand, even  		in cases where community residence is unsafe, placement, while perhaps  		necessary for physical reasons, could have a negative impact on the social and  		psychological well-being of clients. On balance, we cannot predict the  		direction of the impact for this group.</p>
<p>Channeling's objective to increase the match of services to needs is  		also expected to reduce unmet need and increase satisfaction with services.  		While channeling is expected to achieve these results, in some situations this  		may not be the case. For example, for the primary target group, certain needs  		may be more difficult to meet in the community, particularly for those clients  		with relatively high levels of disability. Additionally, for some whose  		community-based status is unchanged, an improved match between needs and  		services could mean a reduction in services compared to what they would have  		received in the absence of channeling. Indeed, in the financial control model,  		where constraints are imposed on service expenditures, it may be impossible to  		meet all the needs of some clients. For the group institutionalized because of  		channeling, we expect unmet needs to be reduced, but have no prior expectations  		with respect to satisfaction with services. On balance, given that an objective  		of channeling is to improve access to services and the match of services to  		needs, it is reasonable to expect an overall reduction in unmet needs and an  		increase in service satisfaction.</p>
<p>In summary, as can be seen in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII4">Table III.4</a>, the  		direction of expected impacts on clients is relatively clear. The uncertainty  		in these areas, rather, concerns the magnitude of the impacts and the policy  		importance to attach to them.</p>
<h3>E. INFORMAL CAREGIVERS</h3>
<p>Channeling can affect informal caregivers through its impacts on service  		utilization, which in turn alter the demands placed on informal caregivers; and  		through the direct efforts of case managers to strengthen and support the  		informal care network. Channeling is expected to affect the emotional  		well-being of caregivers, their levels of work effort and income, and the  		amount of financial support they extend to clients. These impacts are  		summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII5">Table III.5</a>.</p>
<p> Channeling's impact on the emotional well-being of caregivers of  		clients to the primary target group is likely to go in either direction. On the  		one hand, these caregivers avoid the stresses associated with  		institutionalization; on the other, they must cope with the added stress of  		being a caregiver for a longer period. For the caregivers of the other two  		groups, however, channeling is expected to have a positive impact on emotional  		well-being. For those whose living status in the community is unaffected, the  		increased availability of formal services is expected to ease the stress  		associated with caregiving. For the informal caregivers of clients who are  		institutionalized as a result of channeling, it is expected that the stress  		associated with institutionalization will be more than compensated for by the  		reduction in stress resulting from an appropriate institutional placement where  		clients receive a needed higher level of care in a safe environment. Overall,  		the emotional well-being of caregivers is expected to be improved as a result  		of channeling.</p>

</tr></table><p>With respect to the employment and income of caregivers, channeling's  		impacts can be predicted unambiguously for each group. For those giving care to  		the primary target group, lower levels of labor market work are expected  		because of the additional caregiving demands these caregivers will face . The  		other two groups are expected to provide fewer informal services as a result of  		channeling and, therefore, to report higher levels of employment and earnings.  		Overall, however, the outcome is uncertain because we cannot predict the size  		of the two groups.</p>
<p>Channeling's impact on the level of financial support provided goes both  		ways for the primary target group. Expenditures will increase to the extent  		that living expenses must be paid. On the other hand, if nursing home placement  		would have required the family to provide financial support in order to enable  		the client to enter as a private ay patient, then expenditures may decline as a  		result of channeling. The reverse is true for the small group that is  		institutionalized as a result of channeling. For the group whose living status  		in the community is unaffected, the publicly subsidized formal services are  		likely to substitute for services previously purchased by family members,  		thereby reducing the family's contribution and enhancing their financial  		well-being. We have, as can be seen from <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIII5">Table III.5</a>,  		no prior expectations with respect to the overall effect.</p>
<p>*   *   *</p>
<p> This chapter has laid out the directions of channelings expected  		effects to the extent that they can be assessed a priori. Chapters IV through  		VII spell out the hypotheses for each of the major areas in more detail and  		discuss the complex task of measuring them.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIV" id="chapIV">IV. SERVICE UTILIZATION</a></h2>
<p>As discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapI">Chapter I</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>, the cost-effectiveness objectives of  		channeling--reduced cost and improved well-being of clients--are to be achieved  		by altering service utilization patterns. If channeling does not alter service  		utilization patterns, then it is not likely to be a cost-effective  		intervention. A fundamental research task, therefore, is to analyze  		channeling's impacts on service utilization.</p>
<p>Channeling has the opportunity to alter the relation of services and  		needs in a variety of ways, largely because major elements of the four  		important types of services--nursing homes, hospitals, formal community-based  		services, and informal care--can be substituted for one another. For example,  		for clients requiring primarily personal care and help with housekeeping and  		meals, congregate housing with the needed services may substitute for nursing  		home care. Similarly, personal care needs can be met in the home by a visiting  		nurse, a home health aide, or an adult child with the proper support and  		respite care. Although there are many ways in which channeling may improve the  		match between services and needs and thereby minimize use of unnecessary  		services, the primary mechanism' is this sort of substitution of  		community-based care (both formal and informal) for institutional, particularly  		nursing home, care.</p>

</tr></table><p>In order to describe our approach to the evaluation of channeling's  		impact on service utilization, we begin by summarizing in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV1">Table IV.1</a> the four major hypotheses to be tested in this  		component of the research, along with the outcome measures to be used to test  		them and the data sources for these measures. We then discuss the first three  		hypotheses in more detail in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIV-A">Section A</a>, and in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIV-B">Section B</a>, approaches to measuring these outcomes. The  		fourth hypothesis listed in the table, concerning impacts on informal services,  		is included in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVII">Chapter VII</a>'s discussion of channeling's  		impacts on informal caregiving and caregivers.</p>
<h3><a name="chapIV-A" id="chapIV-A">A. HYPOTHESES ABOUT FORMAL SERVICE  		UTILIZATION</a></h3>
<p><b>Living Arrangement and Nursing Home Utilization</b>. As discussed in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>, channeling's most important intended impact  		on service utilization involves changes in clients' living arrangements,  		specifically a reduction in institutionalization and an increase in community  		living. This is also the primary mechanism through which channeling is expected  		to have its ultimate impacts on costs, clients, and caregivers. Many have  		argued that due to a lack of knowledge of alternatives, restricted availability  		and funding of community services, and the institutional orientation of the  		medicaid program, some individuals are placed in nursing homes even when that  		may not be the most appropriate living arrangement. As noted in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapI">Chapter I</a>, previous studies have concluded that a  		substantial percentage of nursing home residents are inappropriately placed,  		and that many individuals living in the community require the same level of  		care or have the same level of measured functioning as those in nursing homes.  		Channeling is expected to enable clients to live in the community (rather than  		in nursing homes) more often than they would without channeling through several  		means: making clients aware of options for living in the community, assessing  		needs and developing a plan for care in the community, paying for some  		community services not covered by existing programs, working with family and  		friends who can help, and helping to arrange for and monitor service provision.  		Although reduction in nursing home use is clearly a major objective for both  		channeling models, a larger reduction is expected for the financial control  		model because its expanded service coverage provides a greater opportunity and  		incentive to substitute community for institutional care.</p>
<p>Because community living is valued in and of itself, and because changed  		living arrangements have major implications for costs, clients and informal  		caregivers, this first hypothesis is particularly important. Testing the  		hypothesis involves straightforward outcome measures: the proportion  		institutionalized at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization, and the number  		of days spent in nursing homes per year.</p>
<p>Reflecting its importance, previous evaluations of community care  		demonstrations have consistently examined impacts on nursing home utilization.  		Four recent projects, the Georgia Alternative Health Services (ASS) project,  		the Milwaukee site of the Wisconsin Community Care Organization (CCO), the  		National Center for Health Services Research (NCHSR) Homemaker and Day Care  		Demonstration, and the Worcester Home Care project are particularly relevant.  		These demonstrations were somewhat similar to channeling in that they served a  		target population at risk of institutionalization with a form of case  		management and expanded funding for some community-based services. In addition,  		the evaluations of these demonstrations all used randomized experimental  		designs. In this and subsequent chapters we will concentrate attention on these  		four studies, noting the findings of other studies only where they are  		particularly relevant.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note33">33</a></font></sup></p>
<p>These four studies (summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV2">Table IV.2</a>)  		provide some evidence in support of the hypothesis that nursing home  		utilization will be reduced. They all found reductions in the number of days  		spent in a nursing home<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note34">34</a></font></sup> although the estimates range widely--from  		about a day a year for the NCHSR and Worcester studies, to about seven and  		eleven days a year respectively, for the Wisconsin CCO and Georgia AHS studies.  		Only the Georgia AHS result was statistically significant, however. For the  		other outcome measure, the percent institutionalized, the Georgia AHS and  		Wisconsin CCO studies found reductions of between one and two percentage  		points, although these were also not statistically significant.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note35">35</a></font></sup> Because of the general lack of  		statistical significance, these studies are inconclusive concerning both the  		existence and magnitude of any reductions in institutionalization. Nonetheless,  		the direction of the impact for all four projects was toward reduced nursing  		home use, providing suggestive evidence that programs like channeling may be  		able to reduce institutionalization.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is worth noting that in these studies the control groups use of  		nursing home care was generally low, suggesting that it is quite difficult to  		identify the population that would be institutionalized in the absence of  		alternative community care interventions. Indeed, one of the reasons for the  		generally small impacts on nursing home utilization may have been the failure  		to identify the target population most likely to benefit from community care  		alternatives.</p>
<p>Previous research has tended to view impacts on living arrangements as  		dichotomous--a client either is institutionalized or lives in the community. In  		reality, of course, there is a continuum of living arrangements with different  		intensities of care--skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), intermediate care  		facilities (ICFs) of different levels, personal care homes, foster care,  		congregate housing with congregate meals, as well as private homes or  		apartments. In addition to estimating channeling's impact on the rate of  		institutionalization, therefore, we plan to examine the impact on these more  		detailed categories of living arrangements. Channeling may be expected to use  		supportive housing as an alternative for many in the primary target group  		(those in the community who would have been institutionalized in the absence of  		channeling) who need care only slightly below the intensity provided in nursing  		homes, and for those in the second analytic group (those living in the  		community irrespective of channeling) whose needs are better met through  		supportive housing (including foster care). However, the overall impact of the  		use of supportive housing can be expected to be small, because channeling is  		not expected to be able to increase the already limited supply of such  		housing.</p>
<p><b>Hospital utilization</b>. Because the most intensive--and  		costly--form care is provided in hospitals, it is important to examine  		channeling's possible impacts on hospitalization. As indicated in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>, channeling's impact on hospital utilization  		is difficult to predict because of several possible effects, some of which  		could increase hospital utilization and others of which could reduce it. There  		are several ways in which channeling maybe able to reduce unnecessary hospital  		use.</p>
<p>One important mechanism involves those unnecessarily "backed up" in  		hospitals awaiting nursing home admission. This problem, which exists to some  		degree in many states, has arisen is large part because of states' efforts to  		reduce nursing home costs paid for by medicaid.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note36">36</a></font></sup> By limiting construction of nursing homes  		and keeping medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates low, many states have  		made it difficult, particularly for medicaid patients, to gain admission to a  		nursing home. Those who cannot live in the community, therefore, have to await  		nursing home placement in a hospital. Such "administratively necessary days"  		are costly from the point of view both of society and of the government  		programs that pay for them. Channeling can be expected to rationalize the  		delivery of services to such patients in a hospital in two ways. First, by  		providing access to .the services needed to live in the community and  		coordinating and monitoring their delivery, channeling can be expected to  		substitute community care for hospital care. Such substitution is similar to  		the substitution of community for nursing home care that we have repeatedly  		emphasized--indeed, were it not for the regulatory and other restraints on  		nursing home bed supply, these individuals would probably be in a nursing home.  		Second, in cases where a nursing home is the most appropriate placement,  		channeling tan help to rationalize the delivery of care by helping clients  		waiting in a hospital to gain admission to a nursing home.</p>
<p>There are other ways in which channeling may be able to reduce  		unnecessary use of hospitals. By providing community care alternatives,  		channeling may enable patients to return to their homes after acute illnesses  		earlier than they would have otherwise. To the extent that hospitals are used  		improperly as respite care because informal caregivers are exhausted,  		channeling's respite care and support may also result in a reduction of  		hospital use. And by maintaining or developing a safe and supportive home care  		environment, channeling may enable certain medical, nursing and therapeutic  		treatments to be provided on an outpatient or in-home basis rather than on an  		inpatient basis.</p>
<p>There are also cases where channeling may increase hospital utilization.  		If improved monitoring under channeling identifies more medical problems and  		improves access to medical care, instances of hospitalization (though not  		necessarily total days) may increase. And, as indicated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>, for the primary target group, an increase in  		hospital utilization can be expected to the extent that such care would  		otherwise be provided in nursing homes for those who are already  		institutionalized. For example, a nursing home patient who gets a severe case  		of influenza may be adequately cared for there, whereas a similar elderly  		patient living in the community might in some instances be hospitalized.</p>
<p>Overall, the impact on hospital utilization could be positive or  		negative depending on the magnitude of these potentially offsetting effects.  		If, as intended, channeling is successful in rationalizing the use of hospital  		care, we would expect a net reduction, and that is what we hypothesize.</p>
<p>The outcome measure for this purpose is simply the number of days a  		person is hospitalized during the year. As can be seen in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV3">Table IV.3</a>, the previous demonstrations showed no  		consistent pattern of impacts on hospital utilization. The Wisconsin CCO  		demonstration significantly reduced hospitalization paid for under medicaid by  		a day per month; but because hospital days covered under medicare (the primary  		funding source for hospital day) were not analyzed, it is possible that this  		reduction was offset by an impact on medicare hospital days, although there is  		no a priori reason to expect that this would be the case. The other three  		demonstrations had no significant impacts on hospital utilization.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Formal community-based services utilization</b>. Channeling is  		expected to increase utilization of formal community-based services both by  		substituting community for institutional care and by improving access to formal  		community-based services through case management and expanded financing for  		community services. For the group that would have been in a nursing home in the  		absence of channeling, of course, use of community-based services will increase  		by definition.</p>
<p>For the group who would in any case have been in the community,  		channeling will have effects in both directions. By identifying clients'  		service needs and improving their access to formal services, case managers are  		expected to increase the utilization of formal community services. This is  		particularly so at financial control model sites, where additional funding for  		community-based services is available and the case manager has the power to  		authorize them. There are, however, a number of ways in which utilization of  		community-based services could be reduced, including: (1) encouraging greater  		reliance on informal care provided by family and friends; (2) substituting less  		costly for more costly community-based services through careful assessment and  		care planning (for example, arranging for a home health aide rather than a  		visiting nurse when the former can provide the needed care at lower cost); and  		(3) reducing unnecessary service utilization through prompt adjustment of  		service packages in response to changing needs. The financial control model's  		limits on individual and average service expenditures are intended to encourage  		such cost-saving behavior of case managers. As noted in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>, we do, however, expect the expansion of access  		to services in the community to dominate the cost-saving alterations in service  		packages, increasing the use of formal community-based service by the second  		group. This increase (compared to the control group) is expected for both  		channeling models, but is expected to be greater for the financial control  		model because of the greater access to community service it permits.</p>
<p>Although the use of community-based services will be reduced for the  		third analytic group (those who are institutionalized as a result of  		channeling) we expect this group to be small. Overall, therefore we hypothesize  		that the utilization of formal community-based services will be increased as  		compared with the control group. Most previous demonstrations have shared this  		presumption, and expansion of funding for community-based services was an  		important part of the interventions they tested. However, because comprehensive  		data on service utilization were not collected, they provide little guidance as  		to the magnitude of the overall impacts.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="chapIV-B" id="chapIV-B">B. MEASUREMENT STRATEGY</a></h3>
<p>One difficulty in analyzing impacts on service utilization lies in  		developing comprehensive measures that accommodate services delivered by a  		large number of different types of providers and paid for by several public and  		private funding sources. Data are not available in a single place, and  		developing a measurement strategy that ensures comparability of the data for  		the treatment and control groups is, therefore, difficult.</p>
<p>We shall collect data from several sources to be used in various ways,  		depending on the service. Our strategy has been developed with four  		considerations in mind. First, individuals have limited ability to recall how  		much of which services they have used; this may be a particular problem for the  		disabled elderly who constitute our sample. Second, it is important that data  		collection itself not introduce an artificial difference in measured service  		utilization between the treatment and control groups; this implies using  		comparable data collection procedures or, where this is not practical, applying  		special safeguards to maximize the comparability of different data collection  		procedures. Third, measurement of service utilization must mesh with  		measurement of costs, implying that, wherever possible, we should collect cost  		and utilization data from the same source. Fourth, where it is necessary to  		combine data from more than one source we must develop and employ a common  		framework for defining services.</p>
<p>In this section, after a brief overview of the data sources from which  		utilization and cost data will be drawn, we discuss the specific measurement  		strategy for capturing utilization of the formal services.</p>
<p><b>Overview of Data Sources</b></p>
<p>Service utilization data will be drawn from individual interviews with  		elderly participants, extracts from records of service providers, and telephone  		interviews with persons contracted privately to provide services. In addition  		to these, some records will come from the channeling sites, including the  		automated financial control system's records and the standard client tracking  		reports submitted by channeling sites. Medicare program records will be  		obtained centrally from the Social Security Administration, and medicaid paid  		claims records will be obtained from the state medicaid agency in each of the  		participating states. Finally, interviews with informal caregivers will provide  		data from the perspective of the families and friends who care for the elderly  		at home. Each will be discussed in turn.</p>
<p><b>Individual interviews</b>. Data on quantities of service received  		will be collected through the individual interviews administered to the full  		sample at program entry and 6 and 12 months after entry. This will yield a  		baseline plus a full year of follow-up data for the entire sample. Half the  		sample will be followed up in another 6 months, for a total of 18 months of  		followup. Because of limited ability to recall detailed service utilization  		information, for most services the interview asks only about the services  		received during a single week. For those in the community, this means the week  		prior to the interview; if the respondent is institutionalized at the time of  		the interview, the interview asks about the community services used during the  		week prior to entering the hospital or nursing home. In addition, for some  		services, interviewers will ask respondents to identify providers used during  		the past six months for later use in obtaining data directly from service  		providers.</p>
<p><b>Provider records extracts</b>. Because we anticipate some measurement  		error in the individual interview data, and because we want to measure  		utilization over the full six-month period (rather than the single week asked  		about during the interview), we also plan to collect utilization (as well as  		cost) data directly from providers, using a 20 percent subsample of treatment  		and control group members. We will go to providers identified in the individual  		interviews for this subsample and transcribe data from billing records for each  		individual for the full six-month period on services used, charges, and  		payments.</p>
<p><b>Survey of privately contracted individuals</b>. In some cases, formal  		services will be provided not by an agency but by individuals with whom the  		elderly person (or person acting in his or her behalf) contracts privately to  		provide care. This is expected to occur most frequently with homemaker  		services, but could occur with any services provided in the home. Indeed,  		channeling projects can negotiate such contracts with private individuals. This  		can be done in financial control sites through the funds pool and in basic case  		management sites with funds designated for service expansion. In most cases, of  		course, we will not be able to rely on regular billing records to obtain  		estimates of service utilization for the full six-month period. Instead, we  		will conduct a brief telephone interview with these privately contracted  		individuals to obtain information on the services provided.</p>
<p><b>Channeling client tracking system</b>. All sites use a common client  		tracking system to provide information on caseload build-up and elapsed time  		between channeling functions. Among the many functions this system serves is  		providing information on the number of months each treatment group member  		receives case management services from channeling.</p>
<p><b>Medicaid, medicare, and channeling financial control system  		records</b>. Records of claims generated by government programs and channeling  		in the reimbursement process constitute a fourth source of utilization data for  		those eligible.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note38">38</a></font></sup>  		Subject to the availability and accessibility of records containing the data we  		need on individuals and their services, and the cost of obtaining them, we plan  		to obtain medicaid claims data from state medicaid agencies at all 10 states.  		Similarly, claims records for services paid for by channeling through the  		waivered funds pool in financial control sites will be obtained from the Office  		of Direct Reimbursement of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).  		Data on services purchased by the channeling project's service expansion funds  		in case management sites will come through provider records and channeling  		project records.</p>
<p><b>Caregiver interviews</b>. The final source of service utilization  		data will be interviews with the primary caregivers. Some data on receipt of  		informal care from family and friends will be obtained for the full sample by  		asking the elderly individuals about the informal care they receive. In  		addition, a subsample<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note39">39</a></font></sup>  		of caregivers will receive a baseline and a 6-month follow-up interview. For  		those primary caregivers who continue to give care at six months and for whom  		the elderly individual remains in the community, a 12-month followup will be  		administered, providing a full year of followup for the bulk of the caregiver  		subsample.</p>
<p>The art of developing the measurement strategy is to combine these  		complementary data sources in a way that maximizes the strengths of each source  		for each service and minimizes bias to the treatment-control comparisons. In  		the discussion of the measurement strategy for specific services that follows,  		we identify both primary and alternative data sources for each service. We have  		developed these data backups because they can substitute if the primary sources  		for some reason fail; and because in some cases they can be used for purposes  		of validation.</p>
<p>The various data sources will be used for analysis in two ways. First,  		we will analyze service utilization data directly from each of the various  		sources in the form in which they are collected--this implies using the  		definition of service, units of service, and time period of data available from  		that source. Second, for each service we will establish a standard service  		definition, unit of service, and time period (normally the 6-month period  		between individual interviews that permit us to combine measures of utilization  		from various data sources to obtain a measure of total utilization for each  		service.</p>
<p><b>Measurement Strategy by Service Type</b></p>
<p><b>Nursing Homes and Hospitals</b>. <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV4">Table IV.4</a>  		summarizes the units used to measure outcomes, the primary data sources, and  		alternative data sources.</p>
<p>As indicated above, the impact of channeling on nursing home care will  		be measured in two ways. We shall examine the proportion of people  		institutionalized at 6, 12, and 18 months. We shall also analyze the mean  		number of days spent in a nursing home during each six-month period broken down  		by level of care, i.e., skilled nursing facility (SNF) or intermediate care  		facility (ICF). As indicated in the table, the primary sources of data will be  		medicaid records and, for those not covered by medicaid, extracts of nursing  		home billing records. In the individual interview, we will identify whether the  		individual reports being in a nursing home during the six-month period and  		whether he or she was covered by medicaid at the beginning and end of the  		six-month period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note40">40</a></font></sup> We  		will confirm medicaid eligibility through an entitlement check with state  		medicaid agencies. For those whose eligibility is confirmed, we will rely on  		medicaid data for the dates of institutionalization to determine the number of  		days spent in nursing homes. Those who did not report they were eligible for  		medicaid will have been asked for the name(s) of the nursing home(s) they were  		in. These identities, coded and used to generate provider billing extract  		forms, will be accumulated and later used to extract the dates of  		institutionalization (as well as charge and reimbursement data) from the  		nursing home's billing records. By merging the data from the billing record  		extracts with the medicaid data, we should obtain quite complete data on  		nursing home utilization.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
<p>  Hospital days will be estimated in a similar manner except that  		medicare will be is a primary data source. That is, the individual interviews  		will report whether the individual is participating in medicare or medicaid  		(either of which is then confirmed through entitlement checks); provider  		(billing) records will be extracted only if the individual is eligible for  		neither program and reports utilization. In instances where billing records  		cannot be obtained, the individual interview will serve as a backup  		estimate.</p>

</tr></table><p>The basic measure of use of institutional services will be the sum of  		the number of days of care reported on medicaid and medicare records and the  		days of care reported on provider records obtained in cases where the service  		is not paid by medicaid or medicare. This basic measure, however, is expected  		to understate utilization for a number of reasons. First, there are lags in  		claims processing and not all claims will reach the medicare and medicaid files  		in time for our analysis. One way to adjust for this would be to estimate the  		percent of claims missing--based on prior experience of each state's medicaid  		agency with claims processing lags--and then adjust the average utilization  		reported on medicaid and medicare records accordingly.</p>
<p>Second, some of the providers serving the nonmedicare/nonmedicaid  		clients may be unwilling or unable to provide the data we require on days of  		institutional care. One way to correct for this, would be to impute the average  		utilization for the group with complete records to the group without.</p>
<p>A third possible type of underreporting results when sample members fail  		to identify an instance of using a hospital or nursing home for which medicare  		or medicaid data are not available. To correct partially for this we could  		estimate (for those covered by medicare or medicaid) the proportion of cases in  		which respondents reported no hospital or nursing home utilization but in fact  		had utilization recorded on medicaid or medicare records. We could then use  		this ratio for medicaid/medicare eligibles to estimate the extent to which such  		cases occur for the ineligibles, and increase the measure of utilization  		accordingly.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In any event, the potential usefulness of these correction factors will  		be evaluated in light of our actual data collection experience. If we decide to  		proceed with some or all of them, it will be desirable to estimate utilization  		with and without them and to determine what difference alternative  		specifications make.</p>
<p><b>Formal community-based services</b>. It will be necessary to combine  		data from a variety of sources in order to get good measures of the use of  		community-based services by treatment and control group members. Here we  		describe in general terms how data from those sources will be used. The one  		source we will have for all participants, regardless of utilization, is the  		individual interview. The individual interview contains questions about the  		provision of services during the week prior to the interview (or, if the person  		was in a hospital or nursing home, the last week in the community prior to  		that). In addition, individuals are asked to identify providers who delivered  		services at any time during the past six months. This provides a  		snapshot of service utilization at 6, 12, and (for a subsample) 18  		months after randomization. These snapshot estimates can be used to estimate  		channeling's impact on community-based services in two ways. First, the  		utilization of formal community services during the one-week period six months  		after randomization can be compared for the treatment and control groups.  		Second, a somewhat better estimate can be obtained by taking into account the  		effect of institutionalization on days of community services. This can be done  		by multiplying the snapshot estimate for a week times the number of weeks the  		person spent in the community during the six months.</p>
<p>These snapshot approaches based on the individual interview data have  		two shortcomings. First, the data are limited (by necessity) to a short recall  		period of one week--the preferred measure is continuous data for the entire  		6-month period. Second, self-report data are subject to misreporting and  		omission, and hence to measurement error. For these reasons, we will also  		collect actual utilization data for each 6-month period by extracting the  		information from provider billing records. Because this data collection is  		costly and may be perceived as burdensome by providers, it will be collected  		for a random subsample (20 percent) of the research sample. For services  		provided by privately contracted individuals, we will obtain estimates through  		the telephone survey of privately contracted individuals.</p>
<p>Thus, the provider records extracts and the survey of privately  		contracted individuals will provide continuous data for full 6-month periods.  		Since this subsample will be a random sample of participants, estimates of  		service utilization can be used to make direct treatment-control comparisons to  		estimate channeling's impacts. Although the small size of this subsample  		reduces the likelihood of detecting impacts using these data by themselves,  		data from the subsample can be used in conjunction with data from the  		individual interviews to make a better estimate of service utilization for the  		full sample. This involves adjusting the self-reported utilization for under-  		or over-reporting, and extending the snapshot estimates to full 6-month  		continuous estimates.We will employ two alternative methods for this purpose,  		depending on the extent to which a service is paid for by medicaid and  		medicare.</p>
<p>Services for which medicaid and medicare do not cover most instances of  		utilization include all the community-based services in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV4">Table IV.4</a> except skilled nursing and home health. The  		basic strategy for estimating the full sample average utilization of these  		services for six months involves multiplying reported utilization for a week by  		three factors. The first factor--the number of weeks the sample member was  		actually in the community in the six-month period--is needed to inflate the  		weekly "snapshot" utilization estimate to six months. The second factor is  		needed to compensate for the differences between self-reported utilization and  		the more accurate utilization data available from provider records. The average  		utilization from self-reports may differ from actual average utilization  		because utilization at the end of the 6-month period (as reported for one week  		in the followup interview) may not be typical of utilization for the entire  		period,<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note43">43</a></font></sup> or because  		individuals understate or overstate services received. Because both of these  		possibilities could be affected by channeling, it is important to estimate this  		second adjustment factor separately for treatment and control group  		members.</p>
<p>To this point, self-reported weekly utilization will have been extended  		to six months and adjusted to correspond to provider data. But we know that  		provider data will be subject to incomplete identification of providers and  		problems in gaining access to records. Therefore, a third adjustment is  		required. It will be based on the ratio of utilization reported on medicare and  		medicaid records to utilization as collected from provider records, for those  		cases on which we have data from both sources. Together, these three factors  		will provide a means of estimating average utilization for the full sample for  		the full six months for both treatment and control groups. An alternative  		method of estimating utilization of community-based services can be employed  		for those services (skilled nursing ad home health) for which most of the  		utilization for both treatment and control groups is recorded on medicaid,  		medicare or financial control system records. For these services, most of the  		utilization can be obtained directly from medicare and medicaid  		records.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Using data from provider and payor records, the survey of privately  		contracted individuals, and individual self-reports requires that services be  		defined in comparable ways even though data are obtained from different  		sources. The same service can be referred to by a variety of different terms  		depending upon the funding source, locality, and whether or not everyday  		language or technical terms are being used to refer to them. This requires  		developing rules (which can be specified for computer programs) to map the  		definitions used in the various programs and data sources to a set of common  		categories. The categories used in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV4">Table IV.4</a> are those  		that we plan to use after that mapping is completed. They most closely  		approximate the categories used in public funding under medicaid, medicare, and  		the funds pool available to channeling clients in the financial control sites.  		They differ somewhat from the more detailed categories that are used in the  		individual interviews and the survey of privately contracted individuals, which  		must use every day terms to define discrete activities. Although most of the  		analysis will be done using the common service definitions, which aggregate  		some individual services, some analysis will be done using the more detailed  		individual interview data on the various components of services; that can be  		done prior to mapping the services into the common categories.</p>
<p>Have described in general terms our strategy for measuring utilization  		of community-based services, we turn to a brief discussion of some particular  		concerns for subgroups of services in this category.</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>In-Home Assistance</b>. An important set of services are those we  			 call in-home assistance (visiting nurse, home health aide, housekeeper, chore  			 doer, and companion), which are all services provided by someone who comes into  			 the elderly person's home. For services in the in-home assistance group we will  			 obtain detailed information for a sample week from individual interviews on  			 what services were provided in the in-home visit, and how long the provider  			 stayed. This detailed information will permit some comparison of the intensity  			 of such services provided to treatment and control group members. The  			 self-reported quantity of visits will be used, together with provider records  			 extract data as described above, to calculate an estimate of the quantity of  			 services provided in each six-month interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Community-Produced Services</b>. Medical and social day care,  			 transportation, and home-delivered and congregate meals will be measured  			 following a similar strategy, but with two differences. First, the primary data  			 sources are limited to the individual interviews and the extracts of provider  			 billing records; the survey of privately contracted individuals will not be  			 done for this set of services, because these services are not commonly provided  			 by individuals under private contracts. Again, the alternative data sources  			 differ by service depending upon whether the services are funded under  			 medicare, medicaid, or the channeling funds pool.</p>
<p>Use of senior centers and the like (labeled in the table as  			 recreation services), will be estimated based on the individual interviews  			 alone, since such services are not covered by medicaid or medicare and we do  			 not expect to be able, at a reasonable cost, to obtain accurate utilization  			 records for such services from providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Case Management</b>. Case management is the central feature of  			 the channeling intervention. If the control group were found to be receiving  			 similar case management through existing programs, then at least at basic case  			 management model sites, we would not expect large channeling impacts. Because  			 of the difficulty of defining and measuring whether an individual receives case  			 management, we will conduct provider records extracts for 100 percent of those  			 who report receiving case management (or services from an agency that provides  			 case management). This is in addition to the 20 percent subsample for the other  			 services discussed above. As part of the process of extracting records, we will  			 determine the nature of the case management services provided. For channeling  			 clients, of course, most of the case management agencies identified by the  			 individuals will be the channeling agency itself. In those cases, we will be  			 able to use the client tracking system data to determine the number of months  			 individuals received case management services. As an alternative data source,  			 we will have the individuals' own self-reports concerning whether or not they  			 received assessment and help in arranging for services, or ongoing case  			 management and monitoring.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Noninstitutional Medical Services</b>. Physician services,  			 therapy (occupational, speech, and physical), and mental health counseling are  			 covered under medicare, medicaid, and channeling's funds pool, but are  			 generally not covered by other government programs. Moreover, it is unlikely  			 that individuals will use a large amount of these services outside these  			 programs. Consequently, we will not conduct provider records extracts for these  			 services but will instead rely on the medicaid, medicare, and financial control  			 system data. This strategy omits, therefore, services paid for by private  			 individuals or private insurance. In the unlikely event channeling has an  			 impact on noninstitutional medical services paid for privately, the  			 treatment-control comparisons will be biased. An alternative data source, but  			 only for therapy and mental health counseling provided in the home, is the  			 individual interviews. This will give some indication whether there may be bias  			 in the use of the reimbursement records for these two services. There is no  			 alternative data source for the physician visits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Housing and Related Services</b>. Housing is another important  			 service required to maintain individuals in the community and we will  			 investigate the nature of sample members' living arrangements--whether they are  			 living alone, with family or friends in a private house or apartment, or in  			 supportive housing of some kind, as well as whether they are institutionalized.  			 In the individual interviews respondents will be asked about their living  			 arrangements and whether they live in a special place where they can receive  			 services. In cases of private housing without supportive services, that  			 interview will be the only source of housing data. But for those respondents  			 who indicate that they are in supportive housing, we will find out the name or  			 address of their residence and contact the provider to determine the nature of  			 the supportive housing and to find out how long the person has lived there. In  			 some cases this will require an in-person visit, while in others a telephone  			 contact may suffice. These contacts will enable us to classify correctly the  			 type of supportive housing and to obtain an accurate estimate of the length of  			 time they have been living there. In cases where we cannot obtain this  			 information from the housing staff, we will rely on the individual self-report  			 data contained in the interview.</p>
<p>The next group of housing-related services include emergency housing  			 and moving assistance. These are services not generally covered under existing  			 programs, but which will be available as waivered services for channeling  			 clients in financial control sites and could be covered by service expansion  			 dollars in the case management sites. Impacts on utilization of these services  			 will be obtained from the individual interviews. An alternative data source is  			 the financial control system, but this contains data only for the channeling  			 clients, and using it alone would imply zero utilization for the control group.  			 It will, however, serve as a basis for validating the self-report data for  			 channeling clients.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>*   *   *</p>
<p>It is clear that developing comprehensive and comparable measures of  		service utilization is a complex task. Previous demonstrations of  		community-based long term care have generally, avoided these complexities by  		focusing only on services funded by a very limited set of public programs. By  		undertaking to develop more comprehensive estimates of service utilization,  		however, we hope to shed greater light on which community services are most  		effective for particular client groups, and to provide more accurate estimates  		of channeling's impacts on costs, the subject to which we now turn.</p>
<h2><a name="chapV" id="chapV">V. IMPACTS ON COSTS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS</a></h2>
<p>Through its impacts on service utilization, channeling will affect the  		public and private costs of caring for the impaired elderly. For purposes of  		policymaking, it is important to understand both the overall impact on costs  		and how these cost impacts are distributed among payors. The cost analysis  		must, therefore, determine the costs associated with provision of services to  		treatments and controls and identify who has paid for each service. These cost  		impacts, together with the impacts on clients and caregivers, will determine  		the overall cost-effectiveness of channeling.</p>
<h3>A. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COSTS AND UTILIZATION</h3>
<p>The analysis of impacts on costs is a natural extension of the analysis  		of impacts on service utilization described in the previous chapter in two  		respects: the sources of the cost data are generally the same as for the  		utilization data (see the discussion of the cost measurement strategy later in  		this chapter) and, more important, much of channeling's impact on costs is  		expected to come through its impact on service utilization. This causal link  		between service utilization and cost, stressed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter  		III</a>, is straightforward: If channeling brings about a change (compared to  		the control group) in use of a service, then the expenditures for that service  		can be expected to change accordingly.</p>
<p>Although the cost analysis is a natural extension of the utilization  		analysis, several additional cost issues must be addressed that do not apply to  		the utilization analysis. First, as already indicated, channeling may alter the  		source of payment for services. This shifting of expenditures from one payor to  		another--especially shifts between public and private sources--is important to  		assessing the program cost implications of channeling. Second, some costs not  		directly associated with services are expected to be affected by channeling.  		For example, because some government transfer payments are available in the  		community but not in nursing homes, they may increase as a consequence of  		channeling's impact on living arrangements. Similarly, a reduction in  		institutionalization would increase some private housing and living expenses.  		Our objective is to identify the major costs that may be affected by channeling  		and to include them in the analysis. Third, although channeling's primary  		impact on costs is expected to come through its impact on service utilization,  		channeling may also have an impact on the prices paid for services which would  		not be reflected in utilization measures. For example, financial control model  		channeling projects might negotiate lower than average rates for services they  		purchase through the funds pool, or they might demand higher quality services  		from providers and pay higher than average rates as a result. Although these  		impacts are expected to be small relative to the impacts effected through  		service utilization, we will attempt to estimate such impacts to the extent  		feasible. Finally, attaching costs to the service impacts permits an  		aggregation of multiple service impacts, some positive and some negative, using  		a common measure (dollars). It thus provides a single summary measure of a  		complex set of impacts.</p>
<p>Since the term "costs" can mean many things, before turning to a  		discussion of specific hypotheses let us define the terminology more precisely.  		The cost analysis will focus on two important types of costs, analysis will  		focus primary attention on expenditures because they are the expenditures and  		resource costs.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note46">46</a></font></sup>  		"Expenditures" are the amounts actually paid for a purpose--to providers for  		services, to individuals as welfare payments, etc. Many of the expenditures  		important in this study are reimbursements to providers from third party payors  		such as private insurance, medicaid, medicare, and other government programs.  		"Resource cost" (or economic cost as it is sometimes called) is the value of  		the resources used from the perspective of society as a whole, regardless of  		the dollar amount actually paid for the resource or even whether there was an  		expenditure. The most readily measured and directly usable data sources (since  		they are recorded on providers' billing records and the reimbursement records  		of government programs) and because expenditures, particularly of public  		programs, are of the most immediate policy interest.</p>
<p>Although expenditures approximate resource costs in many cases, it  		should be kept in mind that the two can differ for several reasons: (1)  		reimbursements may not accurately reflect the actual resource cost of producing  		a service, as in the case of government-established reimbursement rates that  		may not cover the cost of producing a service; (2) because there is sometimes  		no expenditure despite the use of a real resource (as, for example, a homeowner  		with a paid-up mortgage who implicitly incurs a cost for housing even though  		there is no mortgage expenditure); or (3) because an expenditure is not  		associated with the use of resources (as, for example, a transfer payment that  		shifts purchasing power but does not in itself constitute the use of real  		resources).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note47">47</a></font></sup> We will  		in most cases use the term "cost" generically to refer to both expenditures and  		resource costs. In cases where they differ in important respects, the  		distinction will be preserved.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note48">48</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THE COSTS OF COMMUNITY-BASED  		CARE</h3>
<p>Many previous studies that have investigated the cost of community-based  		care for the elderly have suffered from at least one of two types of problems,  		which have limited their usefulness for policymaking purposes. First, many  		early studies did not make comparisons of relative costs in actual situations,  		but rather made hypothetical estimates of what costs would be in community care  		situations (and compared them with the costs of nursing home care). For  		example, Brickner (1975) compared the cost per day of a program for the home  		bound in New York City with the cost of institutional care; he did not,  		however, account for the probability that not all the program participants  		would actually enter an institution in the absence of the program. Burton et  		al. (1974) estimated that for 13 percent of a sample of nursing home residents  		in North Carolina, community alternatives would be slightly less costly; but  		this estimate is based on a review of clinical records of client  		characteristics and likely needs rather than actual cost experience. Similarly,  		Greenberg (1974) calculated that 9 percent of skilled nursing facility (SNF)  		residents with relatively low levels of impairment could be cared for in the  		community at less expense; but, again, this estimate was based on hypothetical  		cost estimates for persons who were in SNFs, rather than costs actually  		experienced by such persons in the community. These studies were useful in  		demonstrating that community care <b>could</b> be less costly than  		institutional care, and in listing and costing out the component costs of  		community care.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note49">49</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Second, although more recent studies have overcome this problem by  		making comparisons of actual costs of care for a treatment group that received  		a community care alternative and a control group that did not, many of them  		suffer from another problem: lack of comprehensiveness in the measurement of  		costs--that is, the failure to account for costs of some important funding  		source or for some important types of services. This makes it necessary to  		interpret their results with caution. The Wisconsin CCO study, for example,  		(Seidl et al. 1980) limited comparisons to medicaid program costs and found the  		treatment group to have total medicaid costs about the same as those of the  		control group. The NCHSR adult day care and homemaker demonstration (Weissert  		1980) focused primarily on medicare-related costs and did not collect  		comprehensive data on expenditures for institutional care under medicaid.  		Although this study found medicare costs to be higher for the treatment group,  		the possible offsetting cost savings under medicaid was not fully  		investigated.</p>
<h3>C. HYPOTHESES</h3>
<p>The major cost hypotheses to be tested are summarized in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV1">Table V.1</a>, together with outcome measures and, data  		sources to be used in testing them. Although these hypotheses serve as a useful  		summary and basis for organizing the discussion of impacts on expenditures,  		they are oversimplifications of the analysis that must actually be conducted.  		To address the full set of questions concerning impacts on expenditures for  		different services paid for by different funding sources, a matrix of data on  		expenditures, by service category and payment source, must be collected and  		analyzed. This matrix is summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV2">Table V.2</a>  		together with expected outcomes for each type of expenditure. Even this matrix  		is a simplification, because several services have been aggregated in each  		service cost category and several funding sources aggregated in some of the  		payment source categories. In the discussion of hypotheses that follows, we  		will be addressing impacts on expenditures for the services cost categories and  		for the various payment sources shown in the table.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Nursing Home and Hospital Costs</b>. As a consequence of the expected  		reduction in institutionalization rates (discussed in the previous chapter),  		channeling is expected to bring about a reduction in nursing home costs.  		Depending on the situation, nursing home care is paid for by medicare (for a  		relatively short period after a hospitalization), medicaid (for those below the  		income eligibility level for that program), and private individuals (the  		elderly individuals themselves or their families and friends).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note50">50</a></font></sup> Thus we expect reductions in  		expenditures for all of these funding sources. The relative magnitudes of the  		reductions will depend primarily on whether the population served is below or  		above the medicaid income eligibility.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two of the four studies of previous demonstrations discussed in the  		previous chapter provide some evidence that nursing home expenditures could be  		reduced for channeling clients. The Georgia (ARS) project, using both medicaid  		and medicare data for measuring nursing home costs, found that treatment group  		costs averaged $35 per month, while those for controls averaged $45 per month.  		The Wisconsin CCO examined nursing home expenditures incurred under the  		medicaid program only, reporting lower costs for treatment clients. Treatments  		were reported to have mean monthly costs of $49 compared to $68 for the control  		group.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note52">52</a></font></sup> The  		differences in nursing home costs were, however, not statistically significant  		in either study.</p>

</tr></table><p>As a consequence of a reduction in utilization of hospitals (as  		hypothesized in the previous chapter), expenditures for hospital care are  		expected to decrease correspondingly. Of course, the uncertainty surrounding  		the direction of channeling's impact on hospital use translates directly into  		uncertainty concerning impacts on hospital costs. Because most of the hospital  		costs will be paid for by medicare, channeling's impact on hospital costs can  		be expected to be largest for that funding source.</p>
<p>The two previous community care demonstrations that studied hospital  		costs provide no clear guidance. The Wisconsin CCO project found significantly  		lower inpatient hospital costs incurred by medicaid for treatment clients.  		Program clients were reported to have mean monthly costs of $41, compared to  		average monthly costs of $111 for the control group. As discussed earlier,  		however, this project was unable to examine medicare data for research sample  		members, thus limiting its ability to monitor hospital costs. The Georgia AHS  		project, in contrast, demonstrated significantly higher inpatient hospital  		costs for the treatment group than for the control group. Utilizing both  		medicaid and medicare data, results showed a mean monthly cost of $85 for  		treatments, compared to $62 per month for controls.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note53">53</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Formal Community-Based Services and Noninstitutional Medical  		Services</b>. As a consequence both of the substitution of care in the  		community for nursing home care for channeling's primary target group and of  		the improved access to services in the community, even for those who would have  		been in the community in the absence of channeling, increased utilization and  		hence increased costs of community-based services are expected. These costs are  		borne by a variety of funding sources including medicare, medicaid, a variety  		of other federal, state, and local government programs, the elderly individuals  		themselves, their families and friends, and in some cases private insurance. In  		addition, channeling clients will have access to community-based services  		through funding for gap-filling services or through the service funds pool,  		depending on the model.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict how the increase in costs of these services  		will be distributed among payors. Because channeling itself will pay for many  		of these services, an increase in costs is certain to occur for this funding  		source. Medicaid, medicare, and other government programs are likely to show an  		increase in expenditures for these services for the group who but for  		channeling would have been, in a nursing home, but could well show a decrease  		for those who would have been in the community in any case (because of a shift  		in funding source for some services covered by channeling). Because of  		differences in federal, state, and local funding shares under the different  		programs, these shifts could be of consequence for some policy decisions, even  		though they may not affect overall public sector costs. Whether private  		expenditures for community-based services increase or decrease also depends  		upon channeling's impact on institutionalization rates. For those who would  		have been in nursing homes, private expenditures for community-based and  		noninstitutional medical services will, like utilization of those services,  		increase; for the group that would have remained in the community, however, the  		impact depends upon whether channeling expenditures substitute for private  		expenditures on such services.</p>
<p>Because of the multiplicity of funding sources, measuring the costs of  		community-based services is difficult. Previous studies have documented the  		expenditures on community-based services paid for by the demonstrations but  		have generally not measured the cost of such services for the control group  		(except to the extent they are covered by medicaid or medicare). Although the  		direction of the impact is widely expected to be an increase in the cost of  		community-based services, evidence on the magnitude of impacts on the cost of  		community-based services has not been available.</p>
<p><b>Housing and Living Expenses</b>. Because of channeling's expected  		reduction in institutionalization rates for the primary target group, the  		housing and living expenses for food, clothing, etc. associated with living in  		the community are expected to increase for them as a result of channeling.  		Although channeling can pay for a modest amount of moving assistance or  		emergency housing, the bulk-of these costs are borne by private individuals. In  		some cases, government also bears a part, through housing subsidies and the  		food stamps program. These largely private expenditures are required for  		community living; the corresponding cost of room and board for those  		institutionalized is included in the cost of nursing home care, which is often  		borne by medicaid. It is thus important to estimate the magnitude of  		channeling's impact on these costs. For those who would have been in the  		community in any case, channeling may also increase costs somewhat by assisting  		individuals to find better housing or more appropriate housing with supportive  		services, or by assisting its clients to benefit from subsidized housing  		programs for which they are eligible but in which they were not previously  		participating.</p>
<p><b>Cash Transfers</b>. A type of expenditure associated with living in  		the community that may not be associated with institutionalization are  		transfers paid for by income support programs such as supplemental security  		income (SSI), general assistance, and other government programs. Another such  		expenditure is the financial support families give to their elderly relatives  		so that they can pay living expenses in the community. Because some of these  		public and private transfer payments are not made to those in nursing homes, we  		expect channeling to increase these costs. From the perspective of the  		government budget, it is important to examine the magnitude of channeling's  		impact on income maintenance program expenditures, because a reduction in  		medicaid expenditures for nursing home care is likely to be partially offset by  		an increase in expenditures under income maintenance programs. Very little is  		known about the magnitude of this potential increase, and the issue has not  		generally been addressed in previous studies of community care programs.</p>
<p><b>Overall Costs</b>. Channeling's impacts on the costs of specific  		services paid for by different funding sources must be estimated in order to  		build up total cost estimates. But the ultimate interest of the cost analysis  		is total public and private expenditures and total resource costs. As the  		preceding discussion clearly indicates, the overall impact on these totals  		depends upon many potentially offsetting impacts, the magnitudes (and in some  		cases even the direction) of which are difficult to predict. One of the most  		important determinants of the overall impact on costs is channeling's impact on  		institutionalization rates, because of the expected major reduction in costs  		resulting from reduced nursing home expenditures. Other important potential  		impacts in determining overall cost impacts include: the average cost of  		community care for those in the community; the extent to which services paid  		for by channeling substitute for private expenditures for nursing homes on  		behalf of those who are not (yet) eligible for medicaid; and the extent to  		which channeling is able to encourage the provision of informal care to those  		living in the community.</p>
<p>As noted, the efforts of previous studies to examine total costs have  		been limited. For example, the Georgia AHS project, which collected the most  		comprehensive cost data, reported information only on medicaid, medicare and  		AHS program service costs. Significantly higher service costs were found for  		treatment clients ($288 monthly compared to $168); however, no cost data were  		collected in a number of important service areas-- including those services  		covered by Title XX, Title III, United Way and other voluntary sector agencies,  		and county or city service programs, as well as private expenditures. These  		unmeasured costs are more likely to be incurred by members of the control group  		than those in the AHS treatment group, biasing their estimated differential  		upward. The Wisconsin CCO found overall monthly costs to be virtually  		equivalent for the two groups ($330 per month for treatments, $325 for  		controls), but their study was even more limited, examining only medicaid and  		CCO program costs. The NCHSR study found significantly higher total costs for  		treatment group members ($605 per month for treatments, compared to $422 for  		controls) but emphasized only medicare costs. The Worcester study was unable to  		examine overall costs at all. Given the data limitations and the potential bias  		they introduce into the overall cost impact estimates, the results of these  		studies do not provide much guidance, except perhaps to make clear the  		importance of comprehensive cost data and the difficulties of collecting  		it.</p>
<h3>D. DATA SOURCES AND MEASUREMENT STRATEGY</h3>
<p>The data sources for the cost analysis correspond generally to those of  		the utilization analysis described in the preceding chapter. These include  		medicare and medicaid records, the automated system of records for the  		financial control model of channeling, manually produced channeling project  		operations cost reports, provider records extracts, the survey of privately  		contracted individuals, individual interviews with participants, and interviews  		with informal caregivers. Sources for the estimates of the cost for each type  		of service are identified in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV1">Table V.1</a>.</p>
<p>Because the cost analysis is concerned with funding sources as well as  		service types, however, there are many more categories of cost that need to be  		considered for each of the categories of utilization. The objective is to  		obtain estimates of the average cost for treatment and control groups for each  		of the cells in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV2">Table V.2</a>. The impact of channeling on  		costs in every service/funding source combination (which is represented in  		summary fashion by each cell in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV2">Table V.2</a>) is the  		difference between average cost in the cell for the treatment and control  		groups, using the basic analytic method for treatment-control comparisons  		described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>.</p>
<p>We will have data from a number of sources, which in some cases will  		overlap and provide similar information on the same instances of service  		utilization. We must, therefore, make decisions as to which data will be used  		and how. The principal areas where data will be incomplete or not directly  		comparable for treatment and control groups are indicated by the following:</p>
<ul><li>Data from medicaid, medicare, and financial control system records  		  will not cover other payors.</li>
<li>Financial control system data, used by financial control model sites  		  to monitor channeling expenditures for services, are not available for the  		  control group.</li>
<li>The provider records data will only be collected for a  		  subsample.</li>
<li>Individual interview data for community-based services only apply to  		  a one-week period.</li>
</ul><p>There are three possible approaches to dealing with the problem of  		nonuniform data sources:</p>
<ul><li>Use all available data regardless of comparability for treatment and  		  control groups.</li>
<li>Use only data for which we have complete records for both treatment  		  and control groups.</li>
<li>Use extra information from incomplete or noncomparable data sources  		  to adjust data into complete and comparable categories.</li>
</ul><p>We reject the first of these alternatives because it could lead to  		erroneous conclusions about the impact of channeling. We will, however, employ  		each of the other two options. We will examine the separate data sources by  		themselves. Specifically, we will estimate expenditures for community-based  		services directly from provider records data for the subsample for which they  		are collected; we will estimate impacts on those expenditures where comparable  		data from individual interviews are available; and we will estimate total  		program expenditures directly from medicaid, medicare, and financial control  		system records.</p>
<p>We obviously cannot, however, make estimates of the total impact of  		channeling on costs directly from data sources that are complete, because they  		do not cover all necessary areas. In order to obtain an estimate of cost of  		services for each full 6-month period, we will, therefore, use natural  		extensions of the methods described in the previous chapter, which make use of  		the full sample of individual interview data, the provider records data (only  		available for a subsample), and the more complete medicaid, medicare and  		financial control system records. This approach permits us to make a "best  		available information" estimate of the full impact of channeling over time  		using all the available data.</p>
<p>We now turn to a description of the methods we will use to compute  		expenditures for each service-funding source category.</p>
<h3><a name="chapV-E" id="chapV-E">E. COMPUTING EXPENDITURES</a></h3>
<p>The method used to compute expenditures will depend on the type of  		service and, of course, availability of data. While many details will differ  		for individual services, the general approach to be followed for each of the  		major service categories is as follows.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Services</b>. Data on the cost of institutional  		services will come mainly from records of paid claims recorded on medicare and  		medicaid files. Provider records extracts will be conducted for instances of  		institutional care not covered by either medicaid or medicare. The method of  		computing the cost of institutional services by funding source is similar to  		that for utilization. As with institutionalization, expenditures reported on  		medicaid and medicare records need to be adjusted for the share of claims that  		have not yet been processed. An additional adjustment is required, however, to  		estimate actual program expenditures in cases where claims reflect interim  		payments to providers who will later be reimbursed for actual cost. This can be  		done simply by multiplying the reported expenditures by the average ratio of  		interim to final payments.</p>
<p>Expenditure data from provider records will understate actual  		expenditures for the same reason that utilization is understated--that is,  		failure of respondents to identify providers and failure to gain access to  		provider records. To correct for this missing data the same adjustments as used  		for the utilization analysis can be employed. (See <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIV">Chapter  		IV</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIV-B">Section B</a>).</p>
<p><b>Community-Based Services</b>. Our general approach to measuring the  		cost of community-based services involves provider record extract data for a  		subsample of participants. For that subsample we will have direct measures of  		public and private expenditures. As described in the preceding chapter on  		utilization, we can estimate 6-month utilization for the full sample based on  		self-reports from individual interviews and the relationship between  		self-reports for one week and provider data for six months for the provider  		records subsample. Estimating expenditures by source of payment is somewhat  		more tricky because we have little information from individual interviews on  		source of payment for community-based services for individuals not in the  		provider records subsample.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note54">54</a></font></sup> We can, however, get expenditures for  		covered services directly from medicaid, medicare, and financial control system  		records and, assuming that a similar proportion of services are under-reported  		for other funding sources (including self-pay, Title III of the Older Americans  		Act and Social Services Block Grants), we can estimate expenditures under those  		funding sources as well.</p>
<p>As with utilization, our approach to measuring the cost of  		community-based services involves two alternative methods depending on  		availability of medicaid and medicare records for the majority of cases in  		which the service is provided.</p>
<p>The first method of computing the cost of community-based services is  		deigned to be used for services that are not primarily funded by medicare or  		medicaid such as housekeeper, chore, transportation, and meals. To construct an  		estimate of 6-month expenditures for the treatment and control groups we will  		begin with an estimate of 6-month service utilization based on the number of  		weeks spent in the community and the reported utilization for one week obtained  		from the individual interviews available for the sample. Expenditures will then  		be estimated for each funding source and service based on the provider records  		subsample's average ratio of expenditures to the above estimate of 6-month  		service utilization. As with service utilization,we can then adjust for  		underreporting by individuals and provider nonresponse on the basis of the  		provider record subsample's ratio of expenditures for medicaid, medicare, and  		financial control model services (as obtained from the claims data for those  		sites) to the estimate based on provider records.</p>
<p>A second method for estimating the cost of community-based services can  		be used for services paid for primarily by medicaid or medicare (e.g., skilled  		nursing and home health aides); this makes direct use of medicaid and medicare  		records to measure expenditures. Total expenditures for a service/funding  		source cell are computed as the sum of expenditures reimbursed under medicare,  		medicaid, and (if applicable) the channeling financial control system, plus an  		estimate of total 6-month expenditures paid by other sources based on  		self-reported utilization and provider records. To avoid biased  		treatment-control comparisons, this method can be used only where the bulk of  		reimbursement for a service comes from medicare and medicaid.</p>
<p>One important community-based service that will receive particular  		attention in the cost analysis is case management, including both that provided  		by channeling projects and that provided by other agencies. Provider records  		extracts will be conducted for case management services for the full sample  		(rather than just for the provider records subsample) whenever they are  		identified as being provided in individual interviews. Cost estimates of case  		management services will be based on an estimated cost per client day. In the  		case of channeling agencies, this cost will be computed from data on channeling  		project cost reports and the client tracking system (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVIII">Chapter VIII</a>). For other providers of case management  		services, estimates of the cost per client day will come from cost data  		obtained in the set-up visits done in the process of collecting provider  		billing records.</p>
<p><b>Noninstitutional medical services</b>. For other medical services and  		supplies including physician services, therapies, drugs, and adaptive  		equipment, expenditures will be measured directly from medicaid, medicare,  		financial control system records. For self-pay and third party reimbursements,  		we must make an estimate based on individual interview data.</p>
<p><b>Housing and Living Expenses</b>. Individual interviews will be the  		primary source of data on housing and living expenses. It will be necessary to  		impute the cost of housing for home owners since expenditures will not reflect  		the full cost of their housing. In addition, to estimate the cost to the  		government, housing subsidies need to be approximated by imputing an average  		government subsidy amount.</p>
<p><b>Cash Transfers</b>. Transfers payments are obtained directly from the  		self-reported transfer income in individual interviews. These transfers include  		social security, SSI, and other cash income maintenance payments. In addition,  		we will measure informal transfers from families and friends to the elderly  		based on the individual and caregiver interviews.</p>
<h3>F. COST-EFFECTIVENESS</h3>
<p>One of the important objectives of the research is to assess the overall  		cost-effectiveness of channeling. The purpose of the cost-effectiveness  		analysis, therefore, is to draw together the results of the analysis of  		channeling's impact on-costs on the one hand, and individual and caregiver  		outcomes (discussed in the succeeding two chapters) on the other, in a format  		that facilitates judgments about whether channeling is a cost-effective long  		term care policy intervention.</p>
<p>We purposely refer to this analysis as "cost-effectiveness" analysis  		rather than "cost-benefit" analysis to reflect our approach to the problem of  		weighing the benefits of channeling against its costs. One possible approach to  		weighing benefits against costs, which is not uncommon in benefit-cost  		analysis, is to put a value on all the benefits and costs of a program and to  		come up with a single benefit-cost ratio that purports to summarize the  		program's effectiveness. Such an approach may be appropriate for certain types  		of investments, where many of the benefits of the investment are amenable to  		valuation in dollars, but we do not believe this approach is appropriate for  		the evaluation of a social program like channeling, where the benefits are  		impossible to value <b>objectively</b> in dollar terms. Attaching a monetary  		value to changes in physical and mental functioning, social and psychological  		well-being, and mortality inevitably depends on sets of assumptions about which  		there is no ready consensus.</p>
<p>Our approach will instead identify costs and effects as comprehensively  		as possible, value the costs that can be tied to changes in resource use, and  		measure the remaining important effects without attributing a value to them.  		There are, of course, value judgments inherent in choosing which costs and  		effects to focus attention on, deciding how to aggregate costs and effects that  		occur at different points in time, and determining how to handle effects that  		may occur after the measurement period of the demonstration. However, the  		advantage of this approach is that the value judgments required to weigh  		benefits that cannot be valued objectively against costs are not built into the  		estimates but, rather, left to the user of the research.</p>
<p>Client outcomes (mortality, physical and mental functioning, social and  		psychological well-being, unmet needs, and service satisfaction) and caregiver  		outcomes (social and emotional well-being) are discussed in the subsequent two  		chapters. The client and caregiver outcomes that will go into the  		cost-effectiveness analysis are discussed there. Here we focus on the analytic  		accounting framework that will be used to examine costs in the  		cost-effectiveness analysis. Our approach is to identify and estimate resource  		costs according to the analytic accounting framework laid out in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV3">Table V.3</a>. This framework takes the perspective of the  		entire economy, identifying for each type of cost the resource use that is  		affected, attaching an estimate of its value to the entire economy, and  		indicating which groups bear the cost.</p>
<p>The resource cost accounting framework shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV3">Table  		V.3</a> differs in several respects from the similar <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV2">Table  		V.2</a> that showed channeling's expected impacts on expenditures. First, the  		right hand column shows resource costs from the perspective of the economy as a  		whole (rather than total expenditures regardless of who paid them, which is the  		total shown in the earlier table).</p>
<p>Second, transfer payments are shown as a cost (a "+" in the table) the  		government programs that pay them and as a benefit (a "-", for the negative  		cost, in the table) to the elderly to whom they are paid; from the perspective  		of the economy as a whole, these transfers net out so that they involve zero  		resource costs from the perspective of the economy as a whole (except for the  		administrative costs associated with them, which are discussed below). This  		prevents double-counting of the costs of living in the community, while at the  		same time correctly indicating what transfers are within the economy. Third,  		accounting for the resource costs of transfer payments requires, in addition to  		adopting the proper accounting perspective, the estimation of the  		administrative costs of making the transfer payments, because administrative  		costs are a real resource cost. Such administrative costs also apply to the  		medicaid, medicare, and other government programs. These costs can be  		approximated based on the average ratio of administrative costs to transfer  		payments under the relevant program and the estimated impact on transfer  		payments.</p>

</tr></table><p>Fourth, a resource cost is associated with informal caregiving. Informal  		care is the dominant form of care received by the impaired elderly, and caring  		for one's impaired spouse or parent is widely viewed as a familial obligation  		to be given without expectation of being paid. Yet, although there is no  		monetary payment for informal care, there is nonetheless a cost imposed on the  		family and friends who provide the care. For some, the cost takes the form of  		giving up employment to stay home to care for a parent or spouse; for others,  		the cost is in the form of leisure time and travel that is impossible given the  		demands of caregiving; and for still others the cost takes the form of stress  		associated with caring for an impaired relative. Although it is difficult to  		attach a value--to these costs on an objective basis, these costs are quite  		real and should not be ignored in assessing channeling's impacts on costs from  		the perspective of society as a whole. There are three ways of valuing the cost  		of informal care. A conservative estimate is the lost GNP due to reductions in  		employment. This impact is estimated by the treatment-control difference in  		caregiver earnings as obtained through interviews with caregivers (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVII">Chapter VII</a>). As discussed further below, it is expected  		to be small. At the other extreme, informal care can be valued at the cost that  		would have to be paid for similar services purchased from providers. Such an  		estimate can be made based on the data on informal services from the individual  		interviews and the average cost of services obtained from the analysis of the  		cost of formal services. This is expected to be high. An intermediate approach  		attaches an estimated value of leisure time (based on existing literature) to  		the time spent giving informal care (again obtained from the individual  		interviews). These three methods will provide a range of estimates of the cost  		of informal care. We will test the sensitivity of the overall results to  		alternative assumptions about the value of informal care, including treating it  		as no cost to society.</p>
<p>Fifth, expenditures can differ from the resource cost of producing a  		service because of reimbursement policies which may keep reimbursements below  		resource costs. In these cases, an estimate of resource costs can be based on  		expenditures and the average ratio of resource costs to expenditures. If  		resource costs exceed expenditures, it is often difficult to know who bears  		this cost difference and hence it appears simply in an "other" column in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableV3">Table V.3</a>.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Sixth, as indicated above, resource costs of housing may differ from  		expenditures because mortgages are paid up or mortgage payments do not  		represent the current most of the housing. To obtain a measure of resource  		costs for housing, we must add to expenditures the imputed value of housing  		services in excess of expenditures for home owners.</p>
<p>We recognize that conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis involves  		making numerous assumptions about which there may be uncertainty. While we will  		develop a "benchmark" estimate, which reflects our best judgment about the most  		reasonable estimates of costs and effects, we will also subject the important  		assumptions and estimates to sensitivity tests in order to investigate the  		extent to which the results change under alternative assumptions. This will  		enable readers to determine which assumptions are critical to the conclusions  		and learn how the conclusions change under alternative formulations. A prime  		example of such a problem is costs and benefits that appear after the period of  		observation.</p>
<p>Data on individual outcomes and costs are currently planned to extend  		for at most 18 months (and 12 months only for later enrollees). But, to the  		extent that channeling increases the utilization of community-based services  		and postpones institutionalization, it may have benefits and costs that extend  		beyond the measurement period of the demonstration. The question thus naturally  		arises: what about those future costs and benefits? We will tackle this  		question by examining the time path of costs and effects as the cost and  		outcome analyses become available, in order to make a judgment about the  		probable importance of costs and benefits beyond the measurement period. If  		they appear to be important, we will attempt to "extrapolate" costs and  		outcomes beyond that measurement period. The methodology available for doing so  		is crude at best, and the data with which to make such extrapolations will be  		limited. Nonetheless, some idea of the importance of unmeasured future impacts  		will be provided. In order to see how much confidence should be placed in the  		estimates, alternative estimates will be developed using different assumptions  		to establish the likely range of responses. The greater the range revealed by  		these sensitivity tests (i.e., the greater the differences in results caused by  		changing the underlying assumptions), the less confidence should be placed in  		the prediction.</p>
<h2><a name="chapVI" id="chapVI">VI. IMPACTS ON CLIENT WELL-BEING</a></h2>
<p>Judgments about the effectiveness of channeling require information not  		only about the demonstration's impacts on the costs of long term care, but also  		about its impact on the lives of participants. An analysis of the channeling  		project's effect on client well-being will therefore be one of the primary  		components of the evaluation.</p>
<p>Channeling, like previous home and community care programs, is intended  		to enable disabled older persons to live at home. Its particular focus is the  		use of case management and expanded access to community services to improve the  		efficiency and appropriateness of care. By providing access to services that  		enable older people to live in the community, and by ensuring that these  		services are tailored to individual needs, channeling is intended to support  		clients' daily functioning and improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p>Improving the well-being of the elderly by expanding in-home service  		alternatives has been one of the major dimensions of the home care movement in  		the United States (Home Health Report on Regional Hearings 1976; U.S. Select  		Committee on Aging 1980). Public opinion studies, reports from human service  		professionals, and surveys of the elderly themselves (G.A.O. 1977, Laurie 1978)  		have consistently indicated that the majority of older Americans would prefer  		to remain in their own homes, even when seriously disabled. Evaluating client  		well-being as an outcome of home and community care programs, however, has  		proved difficult. Unlike the analysis of impacts on service utilization and  		costs--which primarily face problems of data collection--the evaluation of on  		services will influence the four dimensions of client well-being identified  		measures are then client well-being faces challenging problems of definition,  		measurement, and interpretability.</p>
<p>Our approach to studying the effects of channeling on client well-being  		is centered on multidimensional measures encompassing important aspects of  		individuals' lives that are most likely to be influenced by the channeling  		intervention. These outcome measures cover four dimensions of life quality:</p>
<ul><li> Longevity: mortality rates and survival days</li>
<li> Functioning: individuals' ability to perform the routine tasks  		  of personal care and daily living</li>
<li> Social-psychological well-being: subjective quality of life and  		  satisfaction</li>
<li> The meeting of unmet needs and service satisfaction: the extent  		  to which perceived needs are met, and satisfaction with the way services are  		  provided.</li>
</ul><p>In the next section, we examine the mechanisms through which the  		channeling intervention is expected to influence client's lives. This  		establishes a framework for the analysis, focused on how channeling's impact  		above. Hypotheses and the selection of client outcome organized around these  		dimensions.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVI-A" id="chapVI-A">A. THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH  		CHANNELING AFFECTS WELL-BEING</a></h3>
<p>As described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapI">Chapter I</a>, channeling is designed  		to intervene in the provision of long term care at both the client and  		community level. The client level intervention centers around the case  		management function. Case managers are responsible for planning, arranging, and  		monitoring a combination of formal and informal services based on a  		comprehensive assessment of individual needs. These case management functions  		are intended to rationalize the system of care from the client's perspective,  		and to ensure the provision of the most appropriate services for each  		individual. At the community level, the channeling agency is to establish the  		interorganizational linkages needed to identify and recruit the target  		population, facilitate access to services and promote the development of  		alternative services where needed.</p>
<p>These client and community level interventions, which are  		interdependent, are intended to yield an improved match between client needs  		and long term care services. The two major aspects of this improved match are  		the substitution of community services for institutional care, and the more  		appropriate selection and use of community services. As described in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>, channeling is expected to achieve its  		greatest impacts for two groups of persons: those who but for channeling would  		be in institutions, and those who in the absence of channeling would reside in  		the community but with less appropriate services to meet their needs. The way  		in which channeling is expected to affect these two groups establishes the  		framework for evaluating the program's impacts on client well-being.</p>
<p><b>Impacts of Substituting Community Care for Institutional Care</b></p>
<p>Evidence indicates that many institutionalized elderly persons could be  		sustained in the community through an appropriate array of home services and  		supportive living arrangements. Administrative, financial, and social factors,  		however, result in many persons being inappropriately, or unnecessarily,  		institutionalized. For example, recent literature has documented the problem of  		elderly patients "backed up" in acute hospital beds awaiting nursing home  		placement (Pinkner 1980; Shapiro, Roos, Kavanaugh 1980; Rossman 1977).  		Similarly, it is believed that many individuals are placed in nursing homes  		even when that may not be the most appropriate living arrangement--due to lack  		of knowledge, choice, availability of alternatives, or financial resources  		(Morris 1971, Williams 1973, Comptroller General 1977, GAO 1979).</p>
<p>The channeling program is intended to address these problems by  		identifying such persons, providing information, and arranging alternative care  		in the form of in-home services or supportive community living arrangements.  		This substitution of community care for institutional expected to have  		important impacts on the lives of those affected. By enabling clients in the  		primary target group to live in their preferred community setting rather than  		an institution, channeling is expected to avert some of the negative influences  		often associated with institutionalization: poor social-psychological  		condition, loss of functional skills, and mortality related to the relocation  		process.</p>
<p>Research has suggested, for instance, that certain aspects of  		institutionalization are associated with poor social-psychological well being  		in some persons. Problems associated with institutionalization include low  		self-esteem, poor morale, increased anxiety and depression, inability to make  		judgments, heightened dependency, withdrawal, and reduced emotional  		responsiveness (Pollack et al., 1962; Lieberman and Lakin 1963; Lawton and  		Bader 1970; Tobin and Lieberman 1976; Rossman 1973).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note56">56</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Loss of functional capacity and skills have also been attributed to  		institutionalization (Friedman 1966; Lawton 1972, Tobin and Lieberman 1976).  		Nursing homes and other long term care facilities have been accused of having  		"institutionalizing" effects on clients (Townsend 1962; Kane and Bane 1980).  		Environmental conditions, and rules and regulations which often are necessary  		from an organizational perspective, may lead to heightened dependency of the  		client. For example, nursing home regulations generally do not permit certain  		activities such as unrestricted mobility, independent bathing, shopping,  		financial interactions, traveling, and the unsupervised consumption of  		medicine. While prohibiting these types of activities can be justified from a  		safety perspective, such policies may contribute to dependency and a decline in  		overall functioning for elderly residents.</p>
<p>In addition to the social, psychological, and functional deterioration  		associated with institutionalization, gerontologists have also expressed  		concern about the effects of forced relocation on frail elderly clients  		(Blenkner et al., 1974; Brody 1977). Relocation trauma is identified as a  		potential problem in cases where an individual is forced to change residence,  		often to enter an institution, without choice, and without adequate emotional  		support. It has been hypothesized that forced relocation can result in an  		increase in both morbidity and mortality rates for frail elders (Blenkner,  		Bloom, Neilsen 1971; Tobin and Lieberman 1976). While researchers have  		addressed the problem of environmental discontinuity for several decades (see  		Fried 1963; Jasnau 1967), concern about the negative effects of forced  		relocation remain considerable for those working with the elderly in need of  		long term care services.</p>
<p>Although the channeling intervention places strong emphasis on the  		community care alternative, not all nursing home and institutional placements  		should be considered negative outcomes. There are people who, because of  		severe disability or lack of community alternatives and social supports, can  		best be served in an institution. There are also those for whom short periods  		of institutionalization for rehabilitation or convalescence are both  		appropriate and necessary. Research in this area suggests that appropriate  		institutionalization may have a positive impact on some individuals and their  		families (Lawton and Cohen 1974; Smith and Bengston 1979). For this group,  		which is the third of our analytic groups (those who are in an institution  		because of channeling) channeling facilitates prompt and appropriate  		institutional care, with attendant positive consequences for the individual's  		well-being.</p>
<p>Thus channeling's intervention in the institutionalization process--by  		substituting equivalent or improved community care and living arrangements, or  		by facilitating the most appropriate use of institutional care when  		necessary--is expected to influence clients' mortality, functioning,  		social-psychological well-being, and satisfaction of service needs.</p>
<p><b>Impacts of Improving Access to Appropriate Community Services</b></p>
<p>Altering the use of institutional care is not the only mechanism through  		which channeling is expected to influence the lives of program clients. A  		second area of intended improvements involves providing access to a coordinated  		set of community services, tailored to individual needs. This applies not only  		to the principal group discussed in the previous section--those for whom  		channeling substitutes community for institutional care--but also to a second  		major group whom channeling is expected to serve: clients who would have  		remained in the community regardless of channeling, but with a mismatch of  		services and needs.</p>
<p>Channeling's emphasis on arranging, monitoring, and coordinating  		community services, including the purchase of an expanded service package is  		expected to result in increased access to and use of community services. These  		services are of two types: "caring" or compensatory services oriented at  		supporting and maintaining the client (e.g., homemaker or personal care  		services to help clients maintain their activities and living arrangements);  		and "curing" or rehabilitative services designed to eliminate or moderate a  		specific problem affecting client functioning (e.g., physical therapy, speech  		therapy, or skilled nursing care) (see Morris 1971, Caro 1981). Through its  		assessment, care planning, service arranging, and service expansion mechanisms,  		channeling is expected to increase client access to a wide range of services:  		homemaker and home health care, meals prepared at home or provided through the  		home-delivered meals program, transportation services for medical care and  		social activities, and respite care for short-term relief of existing  		caregivers. In addition to improving access to such services, channeling's  		assessment, care planning, and monitoring functions are intended to maintain a  		close match between services and individual needs. This should not only enhance  		the effectiveness of the caring and monitoring types of services which are  		particularly important to the long term care client (Morris 1971, Mechanic  		1979), but also provide a better balance between these services and the skilled  		services that the current system is biased toward. This coordinated,  		individualized package of services, emphasizing both "caring" and "curing," is  		expected to influence the longevity, functioning, and general well-being of  		clients.</p>
<h3>B. MEASUREMENT AND DATA ISSUES</h3>
<p>Before turning to the specific hypotheses and measures to be examined,  		it is useful to discuss briefly three general'-issues which influence our  		approach to evaluating well-being: measurement of the dimensions of wellbeing;  		data collection factors; and the problem of multiple outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Measurement Issues</b></p>
<p>The well-being of the elderly has been a topic of considerable interest  		in the gerontological literature (see, for example, Larson 1978). Much of the  		research in the area has employed survey approaches to identify the dimensions  		of life which correlate with overall well-being (e.g., health and physical  		functioning, social supports, social interaction, residence and housing,  		financial status, and access to services). Many of the measures employed in  		these surveys have been adapted to serve as measures of channeling's impact on  		well-being. Subjective well-being (e.g., contentment, overall life  		satisfaction) has proved a particularly difficult concept to operationalize and  		quantify, especially as a measure of program impact. For example, although many  		elderly express a preference for living in their own homes, it is difficult to  		identify a measure of satisfaction that will capture the impact of a program  		that enables people to avoid institutionalization.</p>
<p>We have also reviewed the approaches of earlier long term care  		demonstrations, similar in nature to channeling, which have evaluated program  		impacts on quality of life. Although some studies demonstrated impacts on  		single dimensions of life quality (e.g., mortality, social supports, or  		functioning), they were generally unable to find consistent evidence of effects  		across dimensions of well-being for program participants. A review of these  		earlier studies suggests several reasons for this lack of conclusiveness,  		including small sample sizes, limitations in project interventions,  		difficulties in identifying the appropriate target population, the lack of a  		rigorous research design, and problems in measuring and interpreting the  		dimensions of well-being.</p>
<p>Our response to these problems has been to identify the important  		dimensions of an individual's life that contribute to well-being, to determine  		those which channeling is intended or expected to influence, and then to select  		or adapt the most suitable existing measures. Where necessary, we have  		developed new measures in areas where none were available, such as the  		effectiveness of case management services.</p>
<p><b>Data Collection Issues</b></p>
<p>Because information about client impacts will be collected almost  		exclusively through interviews, additional constraints are placed on our  		selection of measures of client well-being. The first of these involves the  		expected use of proxy respondents. Given the frailty of the target population,  		we expect that proxy respondents will be needed in a high proportion of the  		interviews. Unlike the collection of utilization and cost information (which  		can often be answered equally well or better by proxies and which are  		supplemented by program records), measures of well-being necessarily rely  		heavily on subjective questions asked of the respondent. A high proportion of  		proxies could thus create a problem for the analysis, because it has the effect  		of increasing the number of missing responses. Second, questions concerning  		health and well-being, such as detailed items on physical and mental  		functioning and social supports, can be burdensome for the elderly respondent,  		again contributing to missing data on these items.</p>
<p>These constraints require us to design and select measures which can be  		asked either of clients directly or of well-informed proxy respondents when  		necessary. By designing the wording and format of questions so they can be  		addressed by proxies, we hope to reduce the number of missing responses. This  		reliance on proxies, however, could also create reliability problems for  		selected measures. An examination of the proportion of proxy responses and the  		potential effect on research results will, therefore, be included in the  		analysis.</p>
<p><b>Multiple Outcomes</b></p>
<p>In addition to these difficulties, the nature of the channeling  		intervention poses a special measurement problem, which we have termed the  		"multiple outcomes" problem. Its roots lie in the fact that channeling clients,  		while sharing a general need for long term care services, vary widely with  		respect to their individual disabilities, medical conditions, available  		supports, and specific needs. Since the case management intervention is  		designed to arrange services tailored to the needs of each individual, outcomes  		may be expected to differ by individual. For example, by providing a person  		special equipment such as bath grab bars, channeling may enable a recipient to  		bathe without supervision, and hence be better able to perform the activities  		of daily living (ADL) than a comparable person in the control group who did not  		receive such equipment. For another client, a thorough review and adjustment of  		medications may lead to better mental functioning than a control group member  		not getting such a review. This pattern is repeated for a great number of small  		subgroups within the channeling target population. Each specific impact of  		channeling may be quite high on the subgroup affected (i.e., those with  		problems bathing who receive grab bars), but it may be expected to be low or  		zero for the other groups. Thus, for the program as a whole, the aggregate  		impact on each of these specific outcomes is likely to be small.</p>
<p>Our approach to the multiple outcomes problem is to employ measures that  		can be aggregated into indices or scales. For example, we have developed an  		index of unmet needs which attempts to combine various dimensions of unmet need  		into a single aggregated index.</p>
<h3>C. SPECIFIC HYPOTHESES</h3>
<p>We turn now to the hypotheses and outcome measures for each of the  		dimensions of quality of life that channeling is expected to influence  		mortality, functioning, social-psychological well-being, and unmet needs and  		service satisfaction. (See <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableVI1">Table VI.1</a>.) In developing  		specific hypotheses about the impacts of channeling on clients, we have  		operationalized the concept of well-being as a set of outcome measures  		utilizing both objective and subjective indicators. These reflect a  		multi-dimensional approach to conceptualizing and measuring the quality of an  		individual's life, and are based on the nature of the channeling intervention  		and the experiences of earlier studies of life quality--as well as on previous  		projects that have provided coordinated community and in-home services to  		elderly clients. It should be emphasized that hypothesized "improvements" for  		channeling participants in these areas are relative to the control group;  		absolute improvements are not generally expected for this chronically disabled  		population.</p>

<p>Reduced mortality is a potential channeling impact of obvious  		importance. As measured by percent deceased or the number of survival days  		following randomization, it has been examined in some form in virtually all  		previous research projects of this nature. While the channeling project is not  		expected to have pronounced effects on longevity, several aspects of the  		demonstration could affect it.</p>
<p>One key mechanism affecting longevity is channeling's emphasis on the  		care setting, specifically the substitution of community services for  		institutional care to enable persons to live in their preferred community  		setting. Avoiding unnecessary institutionalization is expected to affect the  		mortality rates of program participants, as a function of two major aspects of  		institutionalization: adverse physical, social, and psychological attributes  		associated with institutional placement; and relocation trauma.</p>
<p>The negative effects of institutional placement have been addressed in  		our review in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVI-A">Section A</a>. It is hypothesized that the  		functional and psychological deterioration associated with institutional living  		can increase the likelihood of death. A second negative aspect of institutional  		placement involves the effects of forced relocation. Placing an elderly person,  		particularly one with severe physical and mental disabilities, in a different  		environment, especially in an unwanted institutional setting, can be harmful to  		the individual (Tobin and Lieberman 1976, Blenkner et al., 1974). To the extent  		that the channeling project reduces forced relocations into institutions this,  		too, could result in increased longevity for channeling clients.</p>
<p>Although channeling is basically designed to serve the two major  		analytic groups identified in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a> with a  		consequent emphasis on community and in-home services, the analysis of the  		third group involves focusing on the effects of the channeling case manager  		recommending and arranging for institutional placement. For this group, as  		noted in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>, the impacts on longevity are less  		straightforward. On the one hand, it is assumed that case managers would  		recommend nursing home care only if the client's health and safety were  		severely threatened in the community. This suggests that institutional  		placement would provide greater access to medical care and supervision, thereby  		reducing mortality. But, on the other hand, it is possible that these positive  		effects of placement could be offset by the above mentioned problems associated  		with institutional placement. On balance, we expect longevity to be improved  		for this group too.</p>
<p>Another important mechanism affecting longevity is improved access to  		health-related services. Although medicare and medicaid have dramatically  		expanded coverage of health services for the elderly, problems of availability  		and accessibility--particularly for the home-bound aged--remain (Mechanic  		1979). Arranging and monitoring medical appointments, transportation, and  		escort support could improve access to out-patient care. Increased coordination  		of home care, particularly health-related services such as home health aide  		care, physical therapy, and nursing, could also improve access to medical  		treatment, thus affecting mortality rates. Comprehensive assessment and regular  		monitoring should also lead to earlier detection of health-related problems  		before they become acute or life threatening. Channeling's emphasis on the  		provision of other community services, particularly in such areas as increased  		access to nutritional services and insuring adequacy of an individual's living  		environment, is also a factor that could influence client longevity. </p>
<p>A review of earlier demonstrations highlights some of these points. For  		example, the Georgia AHS project (Skellie and Strauss 1982), reported that  		program participants had significantly lower rates of mortality than members of  		a randomly-assigned control group. The program evaluators have theorized that  		an important factor contributing to this finding was improved access to and  		receipt of medical and other support services for an under served population.  		The NCHSR demonstration (Weissert et al. 1980), which provided a test of three  		interventions to expand the availability of in-home and community services  		(homemaker, day care, and both services combined), also found significantly  		lower mortality rates for clients having access to the homemaker intervention,  		once again highlighting the importance of an expanded set of community  		services. Two additional studies which expanded the use of visiting nursing  		care (Katz et al. 1972) and home health aides (Nielsen et al. 1972) also found  		significantly lower rates of mortality for clients in the treatment groups  		giving further evidence that improved access to medical care can affect  		longevity for this population.</p>
<p>Although these studies indicate that the provision of an expanded set of  		community and in-home services can affect mortality rates, several other  		research efforts have not shown significant effects. For instance, the  		Worcester, Wisconsin CCO, and Triage projects found no statistically  		significant differences in mortality. In each of these cases treatment group  		mortality rates were below those of the control group, but none of the  		differences was statistically significant. Finally, it should be noted that one  		study providing protective services and other in-home care to a severely  		impaired elderly population showed significantly higher rates of mortality for  		treatment clients (Benjamin Rose Institute Study for Protective Services,  		Brenkner et al. 1974).</p>
<p>The client contact sheet completed by interviewers and the client  		tracking form completed by channeling staff will be the major sources for  		recording mortality. Medicare and medicaid records, as well as provider record  		extract billing records will also provide the research with information on  		client status. When a client's status cannot be determined through other means,  		mortality will be verified through each state's Bureau of Vital Statistics.</p>
<p>Measurement of longevity is generally straightforward. However, because  		philosophical questions about extending life versus the quality of life have  		become an important issue in modern day society, it will also be important to  		examine impacts on longevity in the context of other measures of well-being,  		particularly those concerned with functioning and social-psychological  		well-being, to which we now turn.</p>
<p><b>Client Functioning</b></p>
<p>The impact of channeling on individuals' functioning is also an  		important dimension of the quality of life analysis. This area consists of  		three major outcome measures: activities of daily living (ALL), instrumental  		activities of daily living (IADL), and the number of restricted days (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableVI1">Table VI.1</a>). ADL and IADL are measures of functioning  		which have been widely used in gerontological research. The number of  		restricted days in which the elderly person is confined to bed combines both  		functioning and health; our study puts more emphasis on it than have previous  		studies in this area.</p>
<p>Two major dimensions of the intervention are hypothesized to affect  		functioning. One primary mechanism focuses on the reduction of inappropriate  		institutionalization. Because of the nature of institutional care, critics  		argue that nursing homes and hospitals tend to place high priority on the  		safety and supervision of their patients, rather than on maximization of  		individuals' independence. This may contribute to atrophy of ADL and IADL  		skills, particularly in such areas as bathing, transfer, shopping, meal  		preparation, medicine consumption, and handling of financial matters.</p>
<p>A second feature of the intervention that is hypothesized to affect  		functioning is the provision of an expanded and coordinated set of services,  		supplies, and equipment. The comprehensive, periodic assessment of client needs  		by channeling may increase the likelihood of identifying the need for such  		services. The channeling case manager may enable clients to receive services  		that are otherwise limited in availability or not normally accessible in the  		community, through a direct intervention with providers or the use of funds  		pool or service expansion dollars to purchase services. The case manager's  		ability to meet such needs (e.g., through installation of wheel chair ramps,  		supplying a prosthesis or walker to enhance mobility) could help individuals  		maintain their independence and slow the deterioration of functional capacity.  		Again, the channeling assessment and care planning processes are critical in  		identifying these needs and exploring alternatives.</p>
<p>Previous studies have examined the hypothesis that the provision of case  		management and expanded community services, either through the development of  		informal caregivers or through the use of formal providers, will result in  		improved client functioning. For example, the Worcester project reported that  		clients in the treatment group showed less deterioration than controls for  		select sub-groups of the research sample (Claffey and Stein 1976). In addition,  		the sites of the NCHSR demonstration that tested the day care component found  		that clients receiving services maintained or increased physical independence  		at a significantly higher rate than controls (Weissert et al. 1980). The other  		NCHSR demonstration sites that tested homemaker services and homemaker and day  		care combined, the Wisconsin CCO project and the Georgia AHS project all found  		no treatment-control differences on these outcome variables.</p>
<p>Thus findings about impacts on personal functioning, as measured by ADL  		and IADL, have been inconsistent in previous long term care demonstrations.  		Some gerontologists have explained the lack of consistent impacts on  		functioning by suggesting that the frail elderly population have chronic  		disabilities that cannot be corrected or improved by such interventions. The  		adequacy of functioning as an outcome measure (Seidl et al. 1980) has also been  		questioned. Still others have identified methodological concerns with previous  		studies in this area, raising questions as to whether the measure has been  		adequately tested.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In measuring ALL and LADL functioning, several problems have been  		identified in the review of earlier studies which could affect the findings.  		For example, some of the previous projects, including Wisconsin and Georgia,  		used a dichotomous scale to measure disability (i.e., clients were classified  		either as dependent or independent on each of the scale dimensions). In order  		to increase sensitivity to changes, the ADL and IADL measures used in this  		project attempt to discriminate between levels of functioning (severe,  		moderate, independent). Like many of the recent demonstrations, channeling  		relies on client self-report for the ADL and IADL dimensions. This data  		collection strategy does represent a variation from the approach used in the  		initial scale development and may result in reporting errors of client  		disability. However, given the randomized design, this should not be a problem  		in comparing treatment and control outcomes for channeling.</p>
<p>From the evidence of previous studies, it is difficult to assess whether  		functioning can be affected by the demonstration. It is our judgment that,  		although we do not expect channeling clients in general to improve in their  		physical functioning, it is reasonable to hypothesize that channeling clients  		will deteriorate at a slower rate than the control group members, for the  		reasons outlined above.</p>
<p>An additional indicator of health and physical functioning will be the  		number of restricted days reported by respondents in the research follow-up  		interview. This measure (defined as the number of days that the individual  		remains in bed most or all of the day over a one-month period), combines  		aspects of both health and functioning. It has not generally been reported in  		the previous long term care demonstrations reviewed, although it has been used  		in some of the general population surveys. The measure of restricted days is  		different from the number of hospital days, used as a measure of service  		utilization. Because medical care is influenced by the availability of  		services, insurance coverage and finances, utilization is not synonymous with  		morbidity. The restricted days measure was selected in an effort to separate  		medical utilization and morbidity.</p>
<p><b>Social and Psychological Well-Being</b></p>
<p>Measuring social and psychological well-being is also a key component of  		the outcomes analysis. This dimension of client well-being, however, is  		difficult to quantify and measure. In an effort to evaluate this dimension of  		well-being, three measures-will be used: a contentment index, a global life  		satisfaction measure, and a series of general indicators of life quality (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableVI1">Table VI.1</a>). These measures vary in approach, and will  		be used collectively to measure impact on overall life quality.</p>
<p>Overall, channeling is expected to have a positive impact on social and  		psychological well-being. This outcome follows from the expectation that  		channeling will help ensure an appropriate living environment for elderly  		clients, particularly by avoiding unnecessary institutionalization. This  		hypothesized outcome is due to generally negative attitudes toward nursing home  		placement reported by many elderly, restrictions of institutional life on  		social interactions and social support mechanisms, life style changes  		concerning privacy and independence, and a series of other perceived adverse  		consequences of institutionalization. A second mechanism influencing this  		dimension involves the presence of the case manager in the service arrangement  		and monitoring role. Having a person to contact who can provide information,  		respond to concerns, and negotiate the complex health and social service system  		is seen as an important aspect of the intervention, which can also contribute  		directly to the quality of life.</p>
<p>Most of the measures chosen to evaluate psychological and social  		well-being have been used in earlier studies. The contentment index, developed  		in pioneering work on evaluating home care services at the Benjamin Rose  		Institute (Bloom and Blenkner 1970), examines several dimensions of well-being,  		including satisfaction with life in general, health, community, and in-home  		services. We have chosen the contentment index for several reasons. First, it  		has been used in previous long term care demonstrations: two studies undertaken  		by the Benjamin Rose Institute, one on the effects of expanding use of home  		health aides, and the other on protective services for the aged, used the  		index, as did the NCHSR demonstration. Second, it attempts to focus on the  		areas which we believe are likely to be affected by the channeling  		intervention. The Benjamin Rose home health aide study reported treatment  		clients showing positive changes on the contentment index. The NCHSR  		demonstration found higher rates of contentment (approaching statistical  		significance) for treatment group members. Finally, the contentment index is  		short and easy to administer, unlike many of the life quality measures reviewed  		(See Phillips, Baxter and Stephens 1981).</p>
<p>Although the contentment index has been used in previous studies, it  		does not include certain quality of life dimensions identified as being  		important by the gerontological community (Larson 1978). A series of additional  		items have, therefore, been added for the research on channeling's impacts:  		satisfaction with social participation, an assessment of social interactions, a  		rating of overall health, a measure of confidence in getting services  		delivered, a confidence measure concerning worry about receiving help, and an  		assessment of client nutrition. These will be examined independently, as well  		as combined to form a general life quality index.</p>
<p>A single item global life satisfaction question will also be used to  		measure well-being. This question was developed by the Institute for Social  		Research at the University of Michigan and has been widely used in public  		opinion research. Analysis of single item measures of overall life satisfaction  		have demonstrated that these items explain a relatively high proportion of the  		variance in longer batteries of items measuring life satisfaction (Andrews and  		Withey 1976).</p>
<p>All of the information to be collected in this section will come from  		the individual baseline and follow-up assessment interviews.</p>
<p><b>Unmet Needs and Service Satisfaction</b></p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the long term care system and their own  		frailty, many aged clients have a difficult time arranging for services, and is  		many cases receive either none at all, or services which do not meet their  		needs (GAO 1979, U.S. Select Committee on Aging 1980). Because channeling is  		explicitly designed to resolve such client problems with the service system, we  		consider the area of unmet needs and satisfaction with services of major  		importance as a client outcome.</p>
<p>The unmet needs measure we have devised is organized around the  		important functions with which the chronically impaired client is likely to  		need help in daily living. These include aid with dressing, transfer,  		toileting, bathing, medical treatments, meal preparation, housekeeping and  		transportation. These unmet need dimensions have been selected as the areas in  		which channeling clients are expected to report a need for daily or weekly  		assistance. Higher degrees of independence are expected in other functional  		areas, such as eating and using the telephone so these items were considered  		less important for assessment of unmet needs. Unmet need items will be  		individually examined and then aggregated to form an overall index.</p>
<p>A second measure of unmet needs involves the use of interviewer  		observations to rate participants' personal and physical environments. The  		observational items are designed to identify those individuals living in  		substandard conditions, either in an institutional or community setting.</p>
<p>Our approach to measuring satisfaction involves the selection of major  		service areas in which channeling case managers are expected to be actively  		involved. By asking specific questions in each of these major service areas we  		hope to focus the respondent on specific services. This is intended to  		alleviate some of the response problems reported in previous studies of global  		service satisfaction, which suggest that individuals have a tendency to report  		high levels of satisfaction, regardless of service quality. The service  		satisfaction component will focus on four major service areas: personal care  		services, medical treatments, transportation, and meals. Within each of these  		service areas, the research will focus on satisfaction with the timeliness and  		reliability of service, and performance quality. The satisfaction questions are  		designed to be examined individually and also to be combined to form an overall  		service satisfaction rating.</p>
<p>The major mechanism through which the intervention is expected to affect  		these outcomes involves once again the match between client needs and services.  		The case manager's emphasis on planning and arranging care based on a  		comprehensive assessment of needs and continued service monitoring, is the  		critical element of the intervention, which is expected to influence the level  		of unmet needs and service satisfaction. Because improving this match between  		needs and services is the critical component of the intervention, the unmet  		needs and service satisfaction measures provide a direct evaluation of the  		intervention from the client's perspective.</p>
<p>While the intervention is designed to alleviate unmet needs and.  		increase satisfaction with services, several aspects of the demonstration could  		affect these outcomes in a negative way. For example, because channeling will  		endeavor to substitute informal for formal community care, and to reduce use of  		unnecessary services, it is conceivable that channeling clients in the  		community could report a higher level of unmet needs or lower satisfaction with  		services than members of the control group.</p>
<p>Although the level of unmet needs has not generally been used as an  		outcome variable in previous long term care studies, some assessment of unmet  		needs has been used in general population surveys of the elderly to assess the  		need for services (Branch 1977, Odell and Wan 1980). The unmet needs measure we  		will employ is based on the needs assessment literature, although it remains  		untested as an outcome measure. There is some concern that self-reported unmet  		needs may be a biased estimate of the actual unmet needs experienced by the  		client. However, in a recent study of the needs of the elderly in  		Massachusetts, a clinical team was used to validate the self-reported unmet  		needs identified through a needs assessment survey process. This study found  		that, "in nearly every instance, both methods produced estimates of older  		people with unmet needs in the various areas that were within one or two  		percent of each other" (Branch 1977). This suggests that the elderly can  		accurately identify areas in which they need services and that the provision of  		services can result in a perceived reduction of unmet needs.</p>
<p>The data sources for both unmet needs and satisfaction with services  		will be the baseline assessment and research follow-up instruments. These items  		have been developed specifically to evaluate the channeling intervention and  		have been included because of the demonstration's emphasis on matching needs to  		services.</p>
<h2><a name="chapVII" id="chapVII">VII. IMPACTS ON INFORMAL CAREGIVING AND  		CAREGIVERS</a></h2>
<p>The literature on long term care defines informal caregivers as  		individuals, usually family, close friends or neighbors, who provide health or  		social services to the elderly without receiving a direct payment for those  		services. Past research indicates that informally-provided services are  		pervasive and that informal caregivers are the primary providers of long term  		care to the elderly (Community Council 1978, GAO 1977b). Indeed, one study  		estimated that 80 percent of the home health services used by the elderly were  		provided from informal sources (National Center for Health Statistics 1972).  		Channeling could affect the provision of informal care to clients and, as a  		consequence, change the public and private costs of providing long term care to  		the frail elderly. The analysis of informal care focuses on channeling's  		impacts on this important part of the service network supporting the elderly.  		Of particular interest is whether channeling induces a shift from private  		caregiving to public services, or whether it strengthens the informal care  		network.</p>
<p>This chapter presents a research design for evaluating the impact of  		channeling on informal caregiving and caregivers. First, it develops a  		framework which is useful in identifying important research issues and their  		interrelationships. Then the data sources, sample design, and general analytic  		approach are presented. In the following four sections, the specific research  		issues and hypotheses that are addressed by the research are described. These  		include: the utilization of informal services by clients and controls, the  		impact on the emotional well-being of caregivers, the impact on the economic  		well-being of caregivers, and the relationship between the impacts on informal  		caregivers and the decision to place an elderly individual in an  		institution.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVII-A" id="chapVII-A">A. THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH  		CHANNELING AFFECTS THE INFORMAL CARE NETWORK</a></h3>
<p>In general, channeling designed to reduce the costs of long term care  		and improve the well-being of its clients by facilitating access to formal and  		informal community-based services, thereby delaying or negating the need for  		costly institutionalization. In carrying out its mandate to accomplish these  		objectives, channeling is expected to affect the informal care network in a  		number of ways. The purpose of this section is to describe how these impacts  		will come about so as to establish a context for discussion of the  		hypotheses.</p>
<p>As part of the needs assessment and care planning functions, channeling  		case managers are expected to work directly with informal caregivers to support  		their efforts and to develop a coordinated service plan that makes the best use  		of the available formal and informal services. At the same time, the case  		manager will increase clients' knowledge of available community-based services  		and assist clients to gain access to them. Where funds are available, financial  		access to such services can be facilitated through subsidization of their  		purchase. In considering how channeling is likely to affect informal caregiving  		as a result of these aactivities, we must confront the complex array of factors  		that influence the informal care network.</p>
<p>The amount of informal care provided depends on a number of  		factors--among them the needs and condition of the clients, the availability of  		formal services, the emotional and financial resources of informal caregivers,  		and the effectiveness of the case managers. Case managers can have only a  		limited influence on the condition of the client. Thus, channeling's impacts on  		informal care will depend primarily on the extent to which formal services are  		substituted for informal ones and on the extent to which the informal care  		network is directly strengthened and supported by channeling.</p>
<p>There is an interaction between these considerations, because  		substitution of formal services for informal ones is one way a case manager can  		support informal caregivers. By itself, substitution of formal for informal  		services does not necessarily imply a shift of the burden of care from the  		family to a public program; we must examine the actual patterns of service  		utilization before drawing a conclusion. For example, assume a channeling case  		manager arranges a formal service to relieve an informal caregiver of a  		particularly difficult task. The result could be a more resilient caregiver who  		continues to provide care for a longer period than a comparable caregiver who  		was not provided such relief. Because institutionalization would be delayed in  		such a case, we would expect that the quantity of informal services provided  		over time would be greater where some formal community-based services were  		substituted for informal ones, and that the types of services provided would be  		different. Substitution, therefore, should be viewed as a process, the outcome  		of which depends on the specific circumstances of each case and the skills of  		the case managers in developing and implementing care plans.</p>
<p>The above example implies a relationship between emotional well-being of  		the informal caregiver and the quantity of informal care provided. Channeling's  		potential impact on the emotional well-being of caregivers may not always be so  		positive. If channeling delays institutionalization but does not substantially  		reduce the burdens felt by informal caregivers, the stress experienced by  		caregivers would be prolonged and intensified. Channeling can, thus, have  		countervailing effects on the emotional well-being of caregivers.</p>
<p>Channeling is also expected to have an impact on the economic well-being  		of caregivers. For example, the need to provide informal care may restrict the  		employment opportunities of some caregivers. If channeling results in the  		substitution of formally-provided services for care previously provided on an  		informal basis, this constraint may no longer be as severe. Informal caregivers  		for channeling clients may be observed working outside the home in greater  		numbers for longer hours at more demanding positions than caregivers for  		control group members. They may use a portion of their additional income to  		purchase greater amounts of formal services for care recipients, or to increase  		the amount of money which they spend on these individuals for things such as  		food, clothing, and housing. Thus, the lines of causality between channeling's  		impact on the utilization of informal services by care recipients and caregiver  		economic outcomes may also run in both directions--if channeling's  		subsidization of formally-provided services enables some caregivers to increase  		their labor market work effort, thereby enhancing the economic position of  		caregivers, this could in turn result in the private purchase of additional  		formally-provided services for care recipients.</p>
<p>Alteration of employment and expenditures can affect emotional  		well-being, while feelings of stress or of relief can result in changes in the  		quantity of informal services provided, employment, and spending behavior. This  		suggests that observed differences in the utilization of informal care by  		treatments and controls are likely to be the result of a complex interaction of  		several changes stimulated directly and indirectly by channeling, as are  		observed differences in the emotional and economic well-being of caregivers (<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#figureVII1">Figure VII.1</a>). The analysis may not be able to estimate  		the individual contributions of these factors to outcomes. However, it should  		be able to identify the presence or absence of the conditions which are likely  		to be associated with significant indirect effects on these outcomes. Also,  		since the analysis will be carried out at different points in time, indirect  		effects that require time to develop could be reflected in changes in observed  		differences over time.</p>
<p>The hypotheses relating to impacts on the provision of informal care and  		to the other impacts of interest are stated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableVII1">Table  		VII.1</a>. The table also indicates in summary fashion what outcome measures  		will be used and the sources of the data.</p>
<p>Before discussing the hypotheses in more detail, it will be useful to  		review briefly the data sources and design of the caregiver analysis.</p>
<h3>B. DATA SOURCES, SAMPLE DESIGN, AND GENERAL ANALYTIC  		APPROACH</h3>
<p><b>The Interviews</b>. Data on informal caregiving and caregivers will  		be obtained from two sources: the reports of elderly individuals about the care  		they receive from family and friends (individual interviews) and a survey of  		the primary caregiver of each individual treatment and control group member in  		a subsample of late enrollees (caregiver interviews). The data collected in the  		individual interviews will identify up to five informal caregivers, their  		relationships to the elderly individual, the types of services each one  		provides, and, for caregivers who do not live in the elderly individuals  		home, the total time each caregiver spends helping each week or month on all  		tasks. The caregiver survey, which is administered by telephone, supplements  		these data by providing more detail on the tasks performed by the primary  		informal caregiver, including the time spent performing each task, as well as  		providing data about the financial and emotional well-being of the primary  		caregiver. This survey will also be used to obtain a second estimate of the  		total amount of care provided by other informal caregivers. A baseline  		caregiver interview and two follow-up interviews at 6-month intervals will be  		conducted.</p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figureVII1" id="figureVII1">FIGURE VII.1</a>:  			 Interrelationships Among Informal Caregiving and Impacts on  			 Caregivers</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/67621/designesFVII1.JPG" /></td>
</tr></table><p>The primary informal caregiver, identified by the elderly individual at  		the time the baseline interview is administered, is the family member or friend  		who provides the most help in assisting with ADL and IADL tasks. At the 6 month  		and 12 month follow-up interviews the elderly individual is asked to identify  		the primary caregiver at that time. If a new caregiver is identified, both the  		caregiver identified at baseline and the caregiver identified at the follow-up  		interview will be interviewed, to the extent feasible.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note58">58</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Ideally, one would like to identify the impact of channeling on all  		informal caregivers providing care. Budget limitations preclude interviewing  		all caregivers in each individual's support network, but some information on  		the network is obtained from both the individual interview and the caregiver  		survey, although it is necessarily limited in scope. Nevertheless, data  		collected on informal caregivers for use in the channeling evaluation will  		expand the general knowledge base concerning the characteristics of caregivers  		and the types of care they provide. Because these data will be relatively  		detailed, originate from diverse geographic areas, and be based on a relatively  		large sample, they will avoid many of the drawbacks of previous studies. One  		shortcoming is that they will be collected on a narrowly-defined set of  		caregivers--those who provide care to the severely disabled elderly. One part  		of the analysis will be a decription of caregivers serving this population and  		the care they provide, with appropriate cautions concerning generalization to  		all informal caregivers.</p>
<p><b>Sample design</b>. The sample design for the caregiver baseline is a  		direct outgrowth of the sample design for evaluating channeling's impacts on  		individual clients described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>. It therefore  		embodies the random assignment used for the sample of individuals, and thus  		permits the analysis of treatment-control differences for primary informal  		caregivers. The caregiver sample is identified by the elderly individuals  		enrolled in the research sample after November 15, 1982.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note59">59</a></font></sup> The sample design for the caregiver survey  		(like that for the elderly individuals) calls for equal sample sizes in the two  		models. The sample size is projected to be 1100 after attrition at the 12 month  		follow-up.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Analytic approach</b>. The analysis of the data will rely on the  		techniques and approaches described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>, except  		that the baseline control variables will include baseline characteristics of  		caregivers in addition to some baseline characteristics of the elderly  		individuals.</p>
<p>The data collected for the channeling evaluation are superior in many  		ways to those used in previous studies of informal caregiving (the sample size  		is larger, there is more geographic breadth, and the information collected is  		more comprehensive). In addition, the experimental design permits an evaluation  		of the impact of channeling on informal caregiving and caregivers, something  		which has not been undertaken systematically in previous evaluations of  		community care demonstrations.</p>
<p>The data for this evaluation still suffer from some limitations,  		however, which seem to be generic to all attempts to evaluate  		informally-provided care. For instance, the general discussion in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVI">Chapter VI</a> of the problems inherent in attempts to  		quantify human feelings is applicable to the analysis of caregivers as well.  		There appears to be no completely satisfactory set of questions that measures  		stress yet is straightforward enough to administer in telephone interviews.  		(Indeed, measures of stress are still in the development stage for in-person  		interviewing.) The discussion of <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVI">Chapter VI</a> will not be  		repeated here. But it should be clear that the measurement of psychological  		impacts is in general a difficult evaluation problem. Also, even the more  		"objective" economic variables can be difficult to value in practice. For  		example, when the care recipient resides with the caregiver, estimates of  		expenditures on care recipients for such items as food and housing contain a  		significant potential for error. In these cases, the caregiver is required to  		identify "how much extra" is spent on care recipients--clearly a difficult  		proposition. In addition, in an attempt to measure the effect of channeling on  		the entire informal care network (as opposed to just the primary caregiver),  		the primary caregiver is asked to estimate expenditures by other caregivers. If  		relatively large numbers of caregivers are unable to answer this question, it  		will be difficult to quantify expenditure changes for the entire informal care  		network. Although data collected in this manner have limitations, they are ones  		that are inherent in any survey data collection effort with a resource  		constraint.</p>
<p>In addition to evaluating channeling's impacts on informal caregiving  		and caregivers, the research will add substantially to the body of knowledge  		about the characteristics of caregivers and the type of care they provide. The  		data that are presently available tend to be based on samples of limited size  		(Lewis et al. 1980), and/or are collected from caregivers in one geographic  		area (Community Council 1978, GAO 1977b, HCFA 1981, Lewis et al. 1980).  		Therefore, generalization from the findings of these studies is questionable.  		As noted above, however, the channeling caregivers are a particular subset of  		all caregivers, which will limit the generalizability of the findings to those  		caregivers who care for the severely disabled elderly.</p>
<p>We now turn to consider the hypotheses concerning channeling's  		impacts.</p>
<h3>C. IMPACTS ON THE QUANTITY AND TYPE OF  		INFORMALLY-PROVIDED SERVICES</h3>
<p>In general, it is expected that channeling will increase the use of  		formally-provided community-based services and decrease the use of  		institutions. As a result, the number and types of informal services utilized  		by treatments and controls are likely to differ. However, it is not clear on an  		a priori basis whether channeling clients would increase or decrease their use  		of informally-provided services, or what the magnitude of the change is likely  		to be. Past analyses of community care demonstrations provide little guidance  		in this respect because they have not addressed this issue systematically.  		Greenberg et al (1980) reviewed nine such demonstrations<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note60">60</a></font></sup> and identified no research hypothesis  		pertaining to the impact of formal community services on informal care  		utilization or the well-being of informal caregivers. The Granville Corporation  		(1980) identifies several instances where other demonstration projects have  		shown sensitivity to the informal care network (e.g., Southwest Arkansas Area  		Agency on Aging, Inc., Alternative Program of Utah, California's Multipurpose  		Senior Services Project). However, in none of these instances is any specific  		research design proposed that could address the impact of providing  		community-based services on informal care utilization.</p>
<p>Channeling's overall impact on the quantity and type of informal  		services provided must therefore be specified by examining the available  		evidence on the interaction between informal service utilization and the  		availability of formal community-based services. It will be useful to do this  		in the context of the three analytic groups identified in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapIII">Chapter III</a>.</p>
<p>When the issues are considered in this context, it becomes clear that  		the previous studies of the relationship between informal and formal care focus  		primarily on persons in the second analytic group (that is, the group who would  		have resided in the community even in the absence of channeling). As such, they  		can provide only indirect evidence with respect to the other two groups.</p>
<p>For the primary target group, persons who because of channeling live in  		the community rather than an institution, the quantity of informally-provided  		services is expected to increase because the opportunities for informal service  		provision are greater when the recipient of care resides in the community. A  		corresponding but negative impact on informal caregiving, albeit small, is  		expected for the informal caregivers of persons who are institutionalized as a  		result of their participation in channeling.</p>
<p>For the group that would have resided in the community even without  		channeling, the impacts are more difficult to predict, despite the availability  		of limited empirical evidence on the topic. This evidence should be viewed as  		suggestive, rather than definitive, however, due to limitations of sample size  		and the representativeness of the sample. In a "before-after" comparison, Lewis  		et al. (1980) found that the availability of formal homemaker services  		increased the percentage of formally-provided help on all tasks except picking  		up mail, helping with finances, and giving medication; the percentage of  		informally-provided help decreased or remained the same for personal care,  		light and heavy housework, and apartment maintenance. However, where a spouse  		or child was present as an informal caregiver, informal help <b>increased</b>  		for idiosyncratic tasks in such areas as mail pick-up, grocery shopping, and  		visiting the doctor. In general, these findings suggest that the availability  		of formal care does reduce utilization of informal care, but not for all types  		of care or caregivers. In some cases, increases in informal care utilization  		were observed. These results are reinforced by the case study analyses of  		Rzatalny et al. (1980). These studies also indicate it is important to  		distinguish among the types of informal services provided and to disaggregate  		caregiver impacts by such caregiver characteristics as relationship to care  		recipient, age, sex, and living arrangement.</p>
<p>Greene (1982) approached the issue using cross-sectional data on 124  		individuals receiving case management and homemaker services in Tucson,  		Arizona. He noted that observation of a simple negative relationship between  		utilization of formally- and informally-provided services in a cross-sectional  		framework is not necessarily evidence that the availability of formal services  		reduces utilization of informal services. It could simply reflect agency  		response to the relative unavailability of informally-provided care. That is,  		one would expect that individuals with fewer informal resources would tend to  		be targeted for higher levels of formally-provided support, other things  		equal.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note61">61</a></font></sup> His results  		suggest that formal care does replace informal care, but his data are limited  		in the types of informal care included and do not track changes over time.</p>
<p>Neither Lewis et al. (1980) nor Greene (1982) provide evidence on  		whether the case management activities of channeling-type agencies themselves  		might change the nature of similar activities provided by informal caregivers  		(such as identification of resources and helping clients work with public  		agencies), although several authors have recognized this possibility (Monk  		1979, Dunlop 1980). While channeling case management could reduce the  		utilization of case management provided by informal caregivers, the opposite  		might also occur. Applebaum (1980) reports that, at the Milwaukee site of the  		Wisconsin CCO project, service coordinators made a strong effort to involve the  		families of project clients in the planning of services. There was no attempt  		to measure formally the success of these efforts; however, if channeling were  		successful in similar efforts, the utilization of informally-provided case  		management activities could increase.</p>
<p>The evidence thus suggests that for some persons in the second analytic  		group (those in the community irrespective of channeling), the increased  		knowledge of formal services available in the community and the availability of  		core channeling services and additional funding for services, particularly in  		the financial control sites, will reduce the amount of informal services  		provided. For others, the efforts of the case managers in encouraging informal  		caregivers, supporting their efforts through the provision of respite care and  		relieving them of particularly difficult tasks, will increase the utilization  		of informal care. The net result of these competing effects depends on the  		strength of the impacts and the relative size of the affected groups.</p>
<p>The hypothesis as stated in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableVII1">Table VII.1</a>  		reflects the intended overall impact of channeling. However, the existing  		evidence that can be brought to bear in formulating hypotheses in this area,  		and particularly in stating the direction of the expected differences, is  		extremely limited. There are sound arguments which could be made for expecting  		impacts in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3>D. SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING OF CAREGIVERS</h3>
<p>In <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapVII-A">section A</a> we have described the interactions  		among the outcomes of interest. Thus, changes in the quantity and type of  		informally-provided services are expected to have an impact on the social and  		emotional well-being of caregivers. It has long been recognized that provision  		of informal care to the elderly can be a stressful experience for the caregiver  		(Monk 1979) and the caregiver's family. Since the female child is the  		predominant informal caregiver, and since male children apparently have a  		greater ability to "distance" themselves from their parents (Robinson and  		Thurnher 1979), this stress is felt most acutely by her. Compounding the stress  		experienced by the female child is the apparent unwillingness of many  		caregivers to share stressful situations with a spouse (Horowitz 1978).</p>
<p>The actual sources of stress for the informal caregiver seem to result  		from a combination of several activities associated with caregiving. For  		example, some types of informal care, such as aid in toileting, may be  		stressful for some caregivers to perform. The reaction of the care recipient to  		the caregiver can also cause stress. For instance, one would expect caregivers  		of elderly individuals who are difficult to care for to experience higher  		levels of stress than caregivers serving helpful, cooperative care recipients.  		Beyond these obvious sources of stress, the literature also identifies several  		more subtle factors related to caregiver psychological well-being. As Robinson  		and Thurnher (1979) discovered, the confinement associated with caregiving can  		be more burdensome than the actual activities associated with the provision of  		care. This restriction was especially resented by children of retirement age  		who felt deprived of the opportunity to enjoy their retirement freedom because  		of the constraints imposed by caring for their parents. Therefore, one would  		expect greater stress levels to be associated with situations where there were  		no available substitutes to assume caregiver responsibilities.</p>
<p>The expenditure of financial resources on informal care also could cause  		stress among elderly spouses who are informal caregivers, particularly given  		the relatively poor average income position of elderly families with disabled  		members (CBO 1977). A further factor associated with caregiver stress is the  		nature of the demands imposed on informal caregivers by their own families.  		Horowitz (1978) has noted that caregiving can be associated with emotional  		conflicts with spouse and family members who find their own needs receiving  		lower priority. In the case of three generation families, the demands of  		grandchildren must be considered as well. One could hypothesize, therefore,  		that the structure of the caregiver's own family could be related to the stress  		resulting from caregiving. The stress experienced by the caregiver may be  		greater in families where incomes are relatively low and pressures on female  		caregivers to enter the labor market are greater (Treas 1977). Conflicts of  		this type are likely to increase in the future as the declining number of  		children coincides with, an increased life span for the elderly and increased  		opportunities for female labor force participation.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the source of stress, Robinson and Thurnher (1979) argue  		that it increases with the passage of time, with the physical deterioration of  		the elderly care recipient, and with the additional demands which this  		inevitably places on the informal caregiver.</p>
<p>In developing hypotheses it is again useful to consider the differential  		impacts of channeling on the three analytic groups identified in the research  		framework. Channeling's impact on the emotional well-being of the caregivers of  		those persons that are in the primary target group (those who reside in the  		community because of channeling) is not clear cut. While these caregivers avoid  		the stress associated with the institutionalization of a family member or close  		friend, the research of Robinson and Thurnher (1979) suggests that stress could  		increase because the period during which the informal care network is expected  		to supply services is lengthened. As they note, this can increase feelings of  		anxiety, tension and confinement on the part of caregivers. Whether the stress  		observed in caregivers for clients exceeds, or is less than, stress experienced  		by caregivers for the control group depends on the magnitude of this negative  		"prolonged caregiving " effect relative to the positive "availability of  		community-based services" effect.</p>
<p>In contrast, for the group that would have remained in the community  		even in the absence of channeling, Robinson and Thurnher's study suggests that  		feelings of anxiety, tension and confinement associated with caregiving might  		be eased by increasing the accessibility of community-based services. Dunlop  		(1980) also believes that the increased availability of these services could be  		helpful in increasing the emotional well-being of the caregiver. In her case  		studies, Horowitz (1978) found corroborating evidence that the introduction of  		formal services provided informal caregivers with greater freedom from  		emotional pressure and improved the quality of the relationship between  		caregiver and recipient.</p>
<p>For the group institutionalized as a result of channeling, the outcome  		is expected to be positive on the ground that such a person will be an  		unambiguously appropriate institutional placement, and that the caregiver  		stress associated with institutionalization will be more than offset by the  		reduction in stress resulting from the fact that the elderly individual is  		receiving an appropriate level of care in a protected setting.</p>
<p>There is no single, widely accepted measure of stress, even though the  		literature examining the relationship between caregiving and caregiver stress  		is extensive. Instead, much of the focus of this literature has been on  		identifying factors which seem to be associated with stress. For the purpose of  		comparing stress in caregivers for treatments and controls, two approaches have  		been adopted. First, caregivers are asked to respond to questions which are  		structured to measure general levels of stress. Because these questions are  		relatively untested, caregivers are also asked a series of questions designed  		to identify the presence or absence of factors commonly associated with  		stressful caregiving experience. In analyzing these responses, it will be  		assumed that the number of such stress factors identified is positively  		correlated with the degree of stress experienced by the caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to the effect of channeling on caregiver stress, there are  		several related hypotheses that fall under the broad category of social and  		emotional well-being. For instance, both the Horowitz (1978) and Dunlop (1980)  		studies suggest that, for the group that would have remained in the community  		even without channeling, the increased availability of formal services will  		improve the quality of the relationship between the caregiver and recipient.  		Another important indicator of the quality and stability of the caregiver  		relationship is the caregiver's perception of the problems involved in  		delivering care. It is hypothesized that caregivers for channeling clients will  		perceive fewer problems in providing care. Because channeling monitors the  		provision of services and strives for an appropriate match between services and  		needs, caregivers are expected to be more satisfied with the care their elderly  		relative or friend is receiving. Finally, because channeling is expected to  		reduce stress, improve the quality of the relationship between care recipient  		and caregiver, and identify help for the caregivers in the community, it is  		hypothesized that caregivers for channeling clients are less likely to support  		institutionalization than caregivers for controls.</p>
<h3>E. ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF CAREGIVERS</h3>
<p>If the channeling demonstration results in differences in the informal  		services provided by caregivers between treatments and controls, it is  		hypothesized that this will lead to differences in the employment experience  		and earnings of caregivers. If that occurs, then the expenditures by caregivers  		on care recipients may also change. It is widely assumed that the demands of  		caregiving do constrain the ability of caregivers to seek paid employment, to  		alter employment situations, or to work at an existing job to the extent that  		otherwise might be possible. If channeling increases the demands on informal  		caregivers, then caregivers serving clients may experience more labor market  		constraints and earn lower incomes than caregivers for control group members.  		Labor force participation decisions generally are the result of a complex array  		of considerations, and the introduction of channeling into this decision  		process adds further complexity. For example, lower labor market participation  		of client caregivers could be observed because, in the basic case management  		model of channeling, the caregiver of a non-medicaid eligible client might find  		that the cost of purchasing privately the services recommended by channeling  		outweighs the potential for increased income through paid employment. On the  		other hand, the financial control model channeling agency may be able to  		purchase additional services using public funds, with the possible result that  		caregivers are more likely to become employed.</p>
<p>These examples suggest that it may be important to disaggregate the  		analysis of economic impacts by the two channeling models. However,  		disaggregation of this type will make it extremely difficult to detect  		differences because the number of people for whom issues of employment and  		employment-related earnings are relevant is expected to be small, and  		disaggregating by model may result in a sample size that is too small to  		provide statistically significant results.</p>
<p>There is certainly no doubt that the time commitment of caregivers can  		be substantial, and this suggests that employment opportunities for caregivers  		may be limited. For instance, Newman et al. (1976) found that two-fifths of a  		sample of children caring for parents in their homes spent the equivalent of a  		full time job in their caregiving activities. It also is clear that women are  		increasingly earning income outside the home and that this conflicts with the  		ability of daughters and daughters-in-law, who have often been the primary  		caregivers, to devote time to the provision of informal services. For example,  		Brody (1979) notes that the proportion of working married women between the  		ages of 45-54 increased from 11 percent to almost 53 percent from 1940 to 1978.  		While these two facts suggest that channeling, if it reduces the time necessary  		to provide informal care, could have a major impact on some informal  		caregivers, it does not necessarily mean that the average impact on channeling  		caregivers as a group will be large. This depends on the number of caregivers  		who would participate in the labor force, given the opportunity. A study of the  		elderly population in Cleveland revealed that 42 percent of the elderly  		receiving help at home secured care from their children, while 24 percent were  		aided by spouses, and a smaller percentage by friends and family. Since  		channeling is targeted on the frail elderly, it is likely to induce few changes  		in employment and earnings for spouses who will be elderly as well. It is also  		likely that a substantial proportion of even the children providing care will  		be elderly themselves and no longer participants in the labor force, although  		there is little evidence on which to base an estimate.</p>
<p>Even though the number of caregivers whose earnings and employment are  		affected by channeling may not constitute a large proportion of the total  		number of caregivers, there are several reasons why hypotheses relating to  		income and employment will be investigated in the analysis. First, where these  		effects are present they may be large and therefore of substantial importance  		for a subgroup of caregivers. Second, there is very little existing evidence  		which bears on this question (Brody 1979). Finally, as discussed in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapV">Chapter V</a>, it is important to document this impact for a  		complete assessment of the resource costs of channeling, since higher levels of  		employment and income of caregivers offset the costs of channeling.</p>
<p>A second aspect of the economic behavior of caregivers is the pattern  		and amount of expenditures by caregivers on care recipients. It is difficult, a  		priori, to predict how expenditures by caregivers of channeling clients will  		differ from expenditures by caregivers of control group members since  		conflicting forces are at work. Again, it is likely that the direction and  		amount of any observed difference will be strongly influenced by the particular  		model of channeling. For example, in the basic case management model the  		channeling agency will have limited funds for the purchase of services. The  		care plan developed by the channeling case manager may call for additional  		formal services which would require new expenditures by the caregiver, assuming  		the services are not covered by medicaid or medicare or the care recipient is  		not program-eligible. In contrast, in the financial control model the  		channeling agency may have dollars to purchase services previously paid for by  		the caregivers. The total caregiver expenditures on the care recipient could  		decrease, and the observed difference between treatment and control group  		caregivers would then be negative.</p>
<p>As the above discussion suggests, the overall impact of channeling on  		economic well-being is difficult to predict a priori because of the diverse  		ways channeling can affect caregivers. For the group who live in the community  		rather than a nursing home because of channeling, the impact on financial  		well-being is uncertain. On the one hand, opportunities for employment might be  		diminished because of the demands placed on the caregiver and the possible need  		to provide financial assistance for living in the community. On the other hand,  		if an institutional placement would have required a financial contribution from  		the family to enable the elderly person to enter an institution as a private  		pay patient, then economic well-being might be enhanced by avoiding  		institutionalization. If, however, the elderly person would have entered the  		nursing home as a medicaid patient, then the family might incur a greater  		financial burden if the person remains at home. </p>
<p>For the group that would have remained in the community even without  		channeling, channeling is expected to improve the financial well-being of  		informal caregivers. Since channeling will increase access to formal community  		services, some caregivers might have more time available to seek outside  		employment, work longer, or accept more demanding jobs. Furthermore, channeling  		might result in substituting subsidized services for ones that had been  		previously purchased by family members. For the caregivers of the third group  		(clients that are institutionalized as a result of channeling), opportunities  		for employment or greater work effort will be enhanced. But, if the family must  		assist the client financially so that he or she can enter a nursing home is a  		private pay patient, then they could be worse off. The impact on this group is  		again uncertain.</p>
<h3>F. THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION DECISION</h3>
<p>The decision to seek an institutional placement is a difficult one, that  		must take into account a number of factors such as the condition and needs of  		the elderly person and the availability of formal and informal services. This  		decision process is often complex, involving several individuals interacting  		around a highly emotional issue over a period of time. Of particular interest  		is the impact of changes in caregiver well-being on the institutionalization  		decision. It is commonly believed that institutionalization of the elderly  		person can be traced to some precipitating event. Sometimes this event does not  		involve the caregiver directly. For instance, a fall which results in a broken  		hip could result in institutionalization. At other times, however, the  		precipitating event may relate directly to the informal support system. For  		example, the onset of incontinence may precipitate a crisis in the informal  		support system because the caregivers find it extremely difficult to cope with  		this problem. The result could be a decision by informal caregivers to support  		institutionalization. Even when the precipitating event does not involve a  		direct action by an informal caregiver, the eventual institutionalization might  		be primarily the result of the impact of that event on the informal support  		system. In the broken hip example, the existing informal support system might  		be capable initially of providing care to the elder in the community after  		hospital discharge. However, this probably could be accomplished only with a  		dramatic increase in the efforts of the informal support system. Eventually the  		stress and economic demands associated with this higher level of care could  		become intolerable, leading informal caregivers to support an  		institutionalization decision.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the types of involvement the informal care  		system can have in the institutionalization decision. The channeling evaluation  		provides an opportunity to investigate this involvement. The data will enable  		us to describe changes in caregivers and caregiving after precipitating events  		which ultimately lead to institutionalization. Most past research on  		institutionalization has employed cross-sectional data, where the presence or  		absence of some measure of informal support is related to the subsequent  		institutionalization of an individual (Vicente et al. 1979, Palmore 1976) or  		institutionalization rates in a defined population (Dunlop 1976, Wolf 1978,  		Scanlon 1980). The channeling analysis will focus on the institutionalization  		process over time and the role which informal caregivers play in it.</p>
<h2><a name="chapVIII" id="chapVIII">VIII. IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCESS OF  		CHANNELING</a></h2>
<p>Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of channeling requires, in  		addition to the basic comparison of treatment-control outcomes, an  		understanding of the way the channeling concept is actually implemented, and  		the processes and relationships through which it functions. This chapter first  		describes the objectives of the implementation and process analysis. We then  		present our general approach to the data collection and analysis. In following  		four sections, we discuss research questions to be pursued with respect to the  		projects themselves, their environments, their clients and costs.</p>
<h3>A. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCESS ANALYSIS</h3>
<p>The implementation and process analysis component of the channeling  		evaluation serves three interrelated functions. First, it documents the  		implementation and operation of channeling in the 10 demonstration sites.  		Second, it supports interpretation of the findings of the impact analyses by  		identifying underlying factors not explicitly apparent in the quantitative  		data, and by verifying the integrity of the experimental design. Third, it  		provides a basis for making informed judgments about establishing channeling or  		other case management systems as a program beyond the current  		demonstration.</p>
<p><b>Documentation</b>. As described in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapI">Chapter I</a>,  		channeling is a complex intervention composed of screening, assessment, care  		planning, case management, service expansion, and cost controls. Two planned  		variants--a basic case management model and a financial control model--are  		being tested. The demonstration projects are being implemented in 10 sites,  		each with its own long term care system and pool of potential participants. The  		design, initiation, operation, and costs of each project therefore reflect an  		array of interdependent factors. In order to impose structure on the  		documentation of channeling, the process analysis will concentrate on four  		aspects of the demonstration:</p>
<ul><li>The channeling project: its design, intent, implementation, and  		  functioning both within and across sites.</li>
<li>The channeling environment: the system of community services and  		  public benefits in which channeling functions and with which it interacts.</li>
<li>The channeling clients: their characteristics, and the routes through  		  which they come to participate in channeling.</li>
<li>The costs of channeling: expenditures and funding sources for  		  planning, start-up, and ongoing operations.</li>
</ul><p><b>Interpreting impacts</b>. Documentation of each of these areas will  		support the quantitative measurement of channeling's impacts on service  		utilization, costs, clients, and informal caregivers. The process analysis will  		provide qualitative information that helps to interpret the treatment-control  		comparisons, and to determine whether observed differences are attributable to  		channeling. It will establish whether the different components of the  		channeling intervention are actually implemented. In addition, it will describe  		how channeling as actually implemented differs from the mechanisms and  		opportunities available through the existing long term care system (that is,  		from what is available to the control group). Information developed through the  		process analysis will also help assess whether the integrity of the  		experimental design was maintained, so that the treatment-control comparisons  		do indeed provide a measure of channeling versus the current long term care  		system. Finally, the process analysis will identify similarities and  		differences among individual sites, and between the two channeling models, that  		could explain consistencies and differences in impacts.</p>
<p><b>Policy and program implications</b>. The findings of the process  		research will also inform program and policy decisions about initiating case  		management systems like channeling in other settings. They will identify  		factors that facilitate or constrain implementation, and strategies designed to  		overcome barriers to implementation. They will also identify variations in  		structure, approach, and environment that are relevant to incorporating  		features of channeling into future programs. Because channeling is being tested  		through a demonstration with a major research component, the process analysis  		will also distinguish features that may diverge from (or affect the ability of  		the channeling projects to simulate) a "natural" program. Finally, the process  		research will document the costs of channeling; this will support the cost  		impact analysis and can also be used to estimate the resources required to  		incorporate channeling-like components in future programs.</p>
<h3>B. GENERAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>The implementation and process analysis will have both quantitative and  		qualitative components. The former will include statistical descriptions of  		channeling clients and of certain aspects of the channeling projects, their  		operations, and their environments--for example, characteristics of applicants  		screened eligible for channeling, elapsed time between referral and first  		service initiation, unit costs of core channeling functions, and descriptions  		of provider agencies. The qualitative component will center on amplification  		and interpretation of the factual information (for example, the reasons certain  		actions were taken, the influence of factors and events on the demonstration,  		and the advantages of particular approaches). Together, these will be used to  		document operational patterns, interpret the results of the impact analysis,  		and make judgments about implementation of future case management programs. The  		absence of formal hypothesis testing and statistical tests of significance does  		not mean that these essentially descriptive and qualitative approaches to the  		analysis are unsystematic. The process data collection plan is structured to  		yield systematic evidence to ensure reliability and interpretability of the  		information collected.</p>
<p>The principal data sources will be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three rounds of in-depth on-site interviews with key actors in the  		  long term care system at the state and local level, including public officials,  		  providers, and channeling staff; and periodic interviews with federal officials  		  and the national technical assistance contractor.</p>
<p>Quantitative descriptive data from the research instruments and  		  standard program forms: screening instruments, individual baseline interviews,  		  client tracking and status change forms, the provider characteristics  		  instrument used to initiate cost-utilization data extracts from provider  		  records, cost reports and time sheets.</p>
<p>Public and project documents describing the long term care system  		  (state and area plans, budgets, resource inventories, and federal and state  		  regulations) and operational reports and plans generated by the state and site  		  channeling projects (e.g., routine statistical, management and narrative  		  reports).</p>

This reflects the complex way channeling is expected to affect  		outcomes, the array of factors influencing the long term care system and its  		clientele, and the considerably planned and natural variation across sites. For  		these reasons, and because these relationships change over time, the data  		collection, synthesis, and analysis for the process research are  		interdependent, as described below.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Data Collection, Synthesis, and Analysis</b> To impose the necessary  		degree of uniformity on the qualitative data collection procedures, and thus  		ensure a corresponding degree of data comparability, the on-site interviews  		will be conducted on a regular schedule, using a standard format to organize  		the data collected. In addition, the same staff will conduct interviews across  		a number of sites, thus further improving cross-site uniformity. All the  		information from each wave will then be synthesized by the same staff who  		conducted the interviews. Information will be arranged topically for each site,  		examined for consistency patterns both within and across sites, and then used  		to narrow down, expand, or derive new research issues or typologies as  		indicated by the ordering of the data at that point. If, for example,  		respondents with different perspectives report the same judgment or perception,  		then we can have some confidence in those judgments. Similarly, comparing  		responses across sites will yield inferences with respect both to generalizable  		findings and to response differences.</p>
<p>Quantitative data will be organized in tabular form by site and model,  		to provide an overview of channeling processes, environmental characteristics,  		and client characteristics. This information will then be used in combination  		with the process interview notes to provide both site-specific and topical  		(cross-site) syntheses of the information. To facilitate this cross-site  		comparison, data drawn from the interviews will be organized in narrative  		tables to characterize the sites with respect to the factors, processes, and  		structures of interest. For example, site client recruitment approaches could  		be categorized as door-to-door casefinding, regular contact with front-line  		referral source staff, formal agreements with referral sources, and public  		information strategies.</p>
<p>Organizing data in this fashion will permit cross-checking of factual  		and interpretative information, both to enhance and confirm the evidence and to  		clarify understanding as to what is occurring.</p>
<p><b>Phases of the process research</b>. The process research will proceed  		in three stages, each of which will emphasize different topics and types of  		information. The first phase, early in the demonstration, will document  		historical and structural information--how the projects are designed and  		implemented; how channeling is actually carrying out its core functions; and  		pertinent characteristics of its clientele and environment. The second phase  		will concentrate on the operations of channeling as a mature program with full  		caseload. The third phase will focus on specific issues pertinent to  		interpreting impacts and making judgments about the feasibility of implementing  		programs like channeling in the future.</p>
<p>Throughout the demonstration, the process research staff will  		incorporate into the site process files, in chronological order, the following  		kinds of materials: site and state deliverables, progress reports, and  		management documents; on-site interviews and periodic debriefings of federal  		and technical assistance staff; summaries of all staff visits; reports  		generated by the research data base on caseload, elapsed time, client status  		and client characteristics; and data from timesheets and cost reports, along  		with a log of federal/state policy program changes related to long term  		care.</p>
<p>The first phase of the process analysis, culminating in an interim  		process report scheduled for March 1983, will consist of the summarization and  		organization of information from the first round of on-site interviews,  		combined with as much of the ongoing quantitative and other documentary  		information as has then been integrated into the files. The report on this  		phase will describe the channeling projects, their environments, clients, and  		implementation experience from the planning phase through early operation. It  		will then serve as the basis for identifying enhancements or changes in the  		documentation areas, data sources, and analytical categories to be used  		subsequently.</p>
<p>A second round of site visit interviews will be structured to follow up  		on issues suggested by these early data. These interviews will be conducted at  		approximately the fourteenth month of each site's operations, and will focus on  		how channeling works as a relatively mature system with a full caseload.  		Quantitative data on project costs, clients, and channeling functions will be  		organized in parallel fashion. By this stage, the analysis of channeling's  		impacts will be underway. This preliminary impact analysis will permit  		identification of specific areas of inquiry for the third round of interviews.  		The third round of visits, currently planned for around the twentieth month of  		site operations, will therefore concentrate on site-specific issues that are  		important to the impact analysis and to decisions about future implementation  		of programs like channeling.</p>
<p>This scheduling enforces interaction both among the various analysis  		data collection activities and between the process analysis interviews and the  		impact of analysis. The analysis for the final process report will be based on  		the information from all three rounds of in-site interviews, combined with all  		appropriate documentary evidence and quantitative data. It will also be done in  		conjunction with the development of the final impact analysis.</p>
<p>The next sections of this chapter develop in detail how the process  		analysis will pursue the four major areas of documentation--the channeling  		projects themselves, their environment, their clients, and their costs--and  		their relevance to interpreting impacts and, making judgments about  		incorporating features of channeling in future programs. </p>
<h3>C. THE CHANNELING PROJECTS</h3>
<p>Beginning with response to the original request for proposal, each  		state's channeling project has an implementation history: site and lead agency  		selection, planning and design at the federal, state, and host agency level,  		final design of operational features, initial implementation, and operation.  		This process results both in planned variations between the basic case  		management and financial control models, and in natural variations across sites  		in how the core channeling functions are organized, staffed, administered, and  		carried out at each site.</p>
<p>The process analysis will address three principal questions about the  		structure and process of the projects:</p>
<ol><li>What is the design of channeling in each site?</li>
<li>What are the characteristics of the channeling structure and process  		  as actually implemented in each site?</li>
<li>How is channeling implemented, including the factors that facilitate,  		  or constrain implementation?</li>
</ol><p>These questions are intended to establish whether channeling is  		implemented according to plan, to refine the definition of the intervention  		that actually takes place, to identify the variety of structures and processes  		across sites and models that might explain differences in treatment-control  		outcomes across sites, and to provide insight into the conditions associated  		with successful implementation of case management programs more generally. </p>
<p><b>1. What is the design of channeling in each site?</b></p>
<p>Understanding the design of each channeling project is the first step in  		establishing whether the channeling intervention is actually implemented as  		intended. The federal design for the channeling demonstration, with its two  		planned variants, provides the basis for selecting the outcome measures  		employed in the demonstration. This design is summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapI">Chapter I</a>. The evolution of the operational design during the  		planning phase incorporated further refinements and variations by the states  		and host agencies to meet their own objectives and circumstances (the selection  		of sites, lead agencies to implement channeling, organizational structure and  		staffing, and so on).</p>
<p>Documentation of the project design will draw on two data sources.  		First, the written plans, guidelines, and reports prepared during the planning  		phase by the federal government, the national evaluation and technical  		assistance contractors, state officials, local host agencies, and channeling  		project staff provide a record of these design decisions. Second, interviews  		with key actors at each of those levels will identify the processes,  		rationales, and factors lying behind the evolution of the design. </p>
<p><b>2. What are the characteristics of the channeling structure and  		process as actually implemented at each site?</b></p>
<p>The next step in the sequence is to identify the characteristics of each  		of the channeling projects as they actually operate. In the first place, this  		establishes whether the planned intervention actually occurs. In the absence of  		such evidence, we cannot know whether any impacts revealed in the comparison of  		treatment-control outcomes can confidently be attributed to the intended  		channeling intervention. Verifying that the research requirements imposed on  		channeling are implemented (screening, randomization, referral of controls  		without influencing their use of the existing system, collection of baseline  		assessment data) is essential to assessing the integrity of the experimental  		design. In addition, the description of channeling as actually  		implemented--together with a description of the existing long term care system  		(discussed below)--is the basis for determining how channeling as implemented  		differs from what is availabe to the population needing long term care  		(including the control group). Fourth, the particular way in which the  		functions of channeling are organized and conducted may account for the  		relative success of channeling in the different sites; this includes both the  		core functions (screening, assessment, care planning, accessing services, case  		management) and the distinctive features of the two models (for the basic case  		management variant, service expansion funds and 'reliance on the existing  		service system; for the financial control model, the funds pool, expenditure  		limits, and client cost-sharing.) Finally, the comparison of channeling's  		original design with its actual implementation provides insight into the  		conditions influencing implementation of case management programs more  		generally.</p>
<p>In pursuit of these objectives, the process research will document the  		organization of each of the core functions within the channeling project, the  		host agency (and subcontractors), and the relevant state agencies. In  		particular we will emphasize structure (location in the host and state agency  		responsible for channeling, centralization or delegation of functions);  		staffing (separation or consolidation of functions, qualifications, health or  		social service orientation); and the time and resources associated with each  		function.</p>
<p>The design and structural characteristics of channeling alone, however,  		are not enough to establish "what channeling is". In order to understand  		channeling and its impacts, it is also necessary to document the processes and  		relationships through which it operates.</p>
<p>Documentation of channeling structures and processes will draw upon data  		from research instruments and standard program forms, reports generated by the  		projects, and the process interviews. Data from research instruments will  		provide a quantitative description of channeling processes: elapsed time  		between functions (client tracking forms), characteristics of the screening and  		assessment processes (screen and assessment instruments), the effort and  		resources devoted to each function including research-related activities (time  		sheets and cost reports), and formal and informal services relied on  		(utilization and cost data sources). Data from research instruments will also  		be used to determine whether research procedures are implemented (screens,  		assessments, and client tracking forms). Data from project documents will be  		used to determine whether the core channeling functions are implemented  		according to design (federal, state, and technical assistance contractor  		guidelines), to identify the organization and staffing of functions (state and  		site progress reports, budgets and subcontracts), and to establish the  		characteristics of the local and state agencies responsible for channeling  		functions. Data from channeling project management and progress reports will  		also add to understanding of the processes used and problems encountered. The  		interviews with state and site channeling project staff, with the national  		technical assistance contractor, and with providers involved with channeling  		will provide detailed description and interpretation of the assessment, care  		planning, service procurement, case management, and cost control processes, and  		of typical client pathways.</p>
<p><b>3. How is channeling implemented, including factors that facilitate  		or constrain implementation?</b></p>
<p>The history of each site's implementation provides valuable guidance on  		the problems that may be encountered in instituting programs like channeling at  		the federal, state, or local level. Successful implementation of such programs  		will depend not simply on copying the structures and processes associated with  		positive client or cost outcomes in this demonstration, but on adopting  		strategies at the state and local level that' will enable channeling or similar  		programs to be established and to operate in other complex environments.</p>
<p>The process analysis will identify the important factors facilitating  		and constraining implementation, including intra- and inter-organizational  		activities; statutory and administrative factors; influences of the relevant  		federal, state, and local agencies; the channeling projects' relationships with  		the existing long term care system; and the influence of features required by  		the research and demonstration context of the experiment (e.g., randomization,  		standardized clinical procedures, and documentation requirements).</p>
<p>We will pay particular attention to the areas where previous  		demonstrations of programs like channeling faced significant obstacles to  		implementation: long lead times prior to operations, problems identifying the  		target population, difficulty obtaining client participation (and thus slow  		caseload buildup), high attrition rates, resistance and competition from  		providers, statutory and administrative barriers, high staff turnover, and  		insufficient service availability.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Documentation of these factors will draw upon two categories of  		information. First, the state and site plans, budgets and progress reports, and  		formal agreements and contracts for each channeling project will provide  		details of the planning and early operational phases. Second, interviews with  		staff and officials of the state lead agency, local host agency, channeling  		project, providers, federal program staff, and the technical assistance  		contractor, will address the specific processes and circumstances that  		influenced implementation.</p>
<h3>D. THE CHANNELING ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>Each channeling project is established, of course, in its own unique  		setting. Geographic and demographic characteristics, supply and capacity of  		existing services, funding and eligibility for services, the relationships and  		roles of service providers, and client pathways all vary considerably from site  		to site. The implementation and impact of channeling both influence, and are  		influenced by, these environmental factors. Moreover, both the channeling  		projects and the environment will evolve over time, complicating understanding  		of these relationships. Documentation of these environmental factors during the  		demonstration will strengthen interpretation of the outcome analysis findings,  		as well as identify conditions that influence the implementation and  		effectiveness of channeling in varied settings.</p>
<p>Documentation of the environment in which channeling takes place will  		focus on the characteristics of the community, the local service system, and  		the larger regulatory and funding setting for long term care. The principal  		questions to be addressed are:</p>
<ol><li>What are the characteristics of the communities and long term care  		  systems in which channeling is introduced?</li>
<li>How does channeling interact with the existing long term care  		  system?</li>
<li>What changes occur in the long term care system during the  		  demonstration?</li>
</ol><p>Each is discussed in turn.</p>
<p><b>1. What are the characteristics of the communities and long term care  		systems in which channeling was introduced?</b></p>
<p>The process analysis will characterize the environment in which  		channeling is established and operates: its geography and demographics, its  		service system, and the way clients gain access to long term care services. It  		will identify opportunities for, and barriers to, long term care in each site,  		which may explain treatment and control group service utilization. One example  		of this would be the presence of established assessment and case management  		agencies in the sites, which may impede implementation of channeling or provide  		a similar experience for the control group. Other examples include the  		existence in the community of a wide array of accessible home care services, or  		a severe shortage of nursing home beds. The process analysis will also identify  		geographic or service system characteristics that may influence the  		implementation or efficiency of the channeling design (for instance, a widely  		dispersed catchment area, or one with few providers, may not be conducive to  		the introduction of an external, centralized case management agency).</p>
<p>Documentation of the characteristics of the community and long term care  		environment will draw on each of the principal data sources described above.  		Research instruments will provide important data on the existing system: types  		of referral sources and providers (including other case management agencies)  		used by channeling clients and controls (screen, assessment and follow-up); and  		characteristics of providers used by the research sample, including services  		offered, size and sources of funding (the provider characteristics data  		collected in the process of initiating extracts of provider billing records).  		Public and project documents describing the catchment area and the long term  		care system that will also be used include: channeling project plans and  		reports; resource inventories; federal, state and area health and social  		services plans, budgets and statistical reports; and federal and state  		regulations relevant to long term care benefits and services. Finally, in-depth  		interviews with key actors in the state and local long term care systems will  		be used to understand the relationships among providers (as well as funding  		sources) in providing long term care, both from the organizational and client  		perspective. These will include major referral sources and long term care  		providers, local and state officials, channeling and host agency staff. It  		should be noted that, while we will endeavor to develop quantitative  		descriptors of the long term care system across sites (e.g., nursing home bed  		supply and level of public funding for long term care services), the emphasis  		will be on categorizing these settings in a way that highlights the typical  		experiences of the population eligible for channeling at the site. For this  		reason, the interviews provide a critical perspective on the environment.</p>
<p><b>2. How does channeling interact with the long term care  		system?</b></p>
<p>In order to understand the implementation of channeling, the process  		analysis will describe how channeling responds to the existing system--how, in  		other words, it accommodates and intervenes in prevailing service structures  		and processes. The way channeling interacts with its environment is a major  		determinant of how its structure and processes evolve, and how channeling  		influences the long term care system. As such, the interdependence of  		channeling and the long term care system are closely related to examining  		channeling's structure and processes (discussed above) and to understanding  		changes in the long term care system during the demonstration. Thus,  		documentation of channeling's interaction with the long term care system serves  		both to interpret the impact analysis results, and to provide evidence about  		conditions for successful implementation and operation of channeling-like  		programs.</p>
<p>This documentation will be drawn primarily from the interviews with  		providers and referral sources, state and local long term care program  		officials, and channeling staff. In addition, information will be drawn from  		channeling project documents (provider contracts, referral source agreements,  		progress reports) and from research instruments (the client tracking form,  		screen, assessment, follow-up and provider data collection instruments) to  		identify the types of providers referring and serving clients. </p>
<p><b>3. How does the long term care environment change during the  		demonstration?</b></p>
<p>The documentation of the long term care system and channeling's relation  		to it (described above) must continue throughout the demonstration. This  		includes <b>changes</b>--both those attributable to channeling and those taking  		place in the larger system independent of channeling. This documentation is  		critical to understanding whether the experimental design has been compromised  		(whether the experience of controls has been altered), how successfully  		channeling has affected the long term care system, and the policy implications  		of expanding operations of channeling-like programs.</p>
<p>One of the intended effects of the demonstration is to encourage  		systemic changes in the organization and delivery of long term care services.  		We will be attempting to determine whether, for instance, providers change  		target population priorities and service delivery patterns, and whether they  		voluntarily accept channeling's assessment and care planning role. We will also  		document whether channeling has unintended effects on the existing system. It  		may be, for instance, that the introduction of an external case management  		agency in a community sets up a dysfunctional tension among providers, to the  		detriment of a smoothly functioning system.</p>
<p>Events and processes occurring in the community--many coincidental to  		and outside the control of the channeling project--may also influence  		channeling clients. These will be documented. For example, the state may change  		the requirements for medicaid reimbursement for home health care, resulting in  		differences in the amount and type of those services available for channeling  		clients in a basic case management site; or a new congregate housing project  		for the elderly may open in the area, and accept a number of channeling clients  		who were on the waiting list prior to channeling.</p>
<p>It is equally important to document processes in the community that may  		influence the experiences of the control group. Some events unrelated to  		channeling's presence in the site (such as a change in the medicaid program)  		may influence both the program treatment and control groups alike at a site.  		Although they may not bias the treatment-control comparison at that site, they  		need to be documented to inform the broader cross-site research findings. As  		discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>, other events--independent of or  		related to channeling's presence--can affect the control group differentially  		and may therefore distort the observed treatment-control comparison. One  		example might be the initiation of a separate case management service targeted  		to the same categories of individuals as channeling. To the extent such a  		service were available to and used by many in the control group, the observed  		treatment-control difference would understate the impact of channeling. An  		example of such an event occurred in the Worcester Home Care demonstration,  		when controls gained access to an assessment and care plan program that  		paralleled the one instituted for the treatment group. Another example, in the  		financial control model sites, might be the effect of expanded service coverage  		under the channeling funds pool on the supply of service available to the  		control group. If channeling transfers treatment group clients from existing  		services to waivered services, the control group may have greater access to  		services than it would have in the absence of channeling, because more  		nonwaivered services are freed for its use. Again, the observed  		treatment-control comparison would underestimate the effect of channeling as  		compared to the status quo. This effect was noted in the report of the  		Wisconsin CCO demonstration (Seidl et al., 1980).</p>
<p>Documentation of these changes over time will rest on the same sources  		cited for the above two questions, updated throughout the duration of the  		demonstration.</p>
<h3>E. CHANNELING CLIENTS</h3>
<p>The third major area of documentation for the process research concerns  		the characteristics of persons who apply to and participate in channeling, and  		the outreach, referral, and screening processes through which they become  		clients. In this area, we will address the following questions:</p>
<ol><li>How are applicants referred to the channeling projects, and what are  		  the characteristics of those deemed eligible for channeling at the screen?</li>
<li>What are the characteristics of those who participate in channeling  		  as clients, and what factors affect participation?</li>
</ol><p>The characteristics of persons deemed eligible for channeling and of  		those who actually participate, and the processes surrounding outreach,  		referral, and screening are expected to differ across sites. The extent to  		which these differ will inform both the impact analysis and decisions about the  		replicability of channeling.</p>
<p><b>1. How are applicants referred to the channeling projects, and what  		are the characteristics of those deemed eligible?</b></p>
<p>Channeling is designed to generate referrals of persons with sufficient  		disability and unmet need to qualify for nursing home levels of care. This  		demonstration has been predicated on the assumption that the principal referral  		sources of such persons are hospital discharge units, nursing home preadmission  		screens and waiting lists, community agencies serving the seriously impaired  		elderly, and families whose ability to care for a disabled exceeded by the  		person's needs and the families' resources.</p>
<p>The ability of channeling to generate such referrals will be relevant to  		implementing channeling on a broader scale. The extent to which substantial  		resources must be devoted to casefinding and screening functions will affect  		the cost-effectiveness of channeling. This is expected to be conditioned not  		only by the characteristics of the elderly in the channeling catchment area and  		those of the local long term care system, but also by the position of the  		channeling agency in the system, the perceived benefits of channeling compared  		with the existing system, and the impact of research requirements (particularly  		randomization) on referral sources.</p>
<p>Documentation of the casefinding, referral, and screening process will  		draw upon research instruments and program forms (screen, client tracking form,  		time sheets) for referral source, elapsed time between referral, and screening,  		and time devoted to casefinding, outreach, and screening. It will also rely on  		channeling statistical reports (ratio of inappropriates to appropriates,  		reasons deemed inappropriate at screen), progress reports (problems with  		referral sources, outreach strategies) and other documents (referral source  		agreements). Finally, interviews with referral sources (and potential referral  		sources not working with channeling), channeling screeners, and other  		channeling staff will document actual referral and screening processes, factors  		affecting them, and strategies employed to generate appropriate referrals.</p>
<p>The characteristics of those deemed eligible 'at screening will be  		documented based on data from the screening instrument. Characteristics of  		those deemed inappropriate--to the extent available--will be drawn from  		channeling project reports and interviews with screeners and referral  		sources.</p>
<p><b>2. What are the characteristics of those who participate in  		channeling as clients, and what factors affect participation?</b></p>
<p>Securing and maintaining participation by the appropriate population was  		a problem encountered in previous channeling demonstrations (from 20 to 40  		percent of those assigned to the treatment group did not participate for a  		variety of reasons).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note63">63</a></font></sup>  		Participation may be related to a variety of characteristics of the channeling  		projects and their environments: for instance, the perceived and actual  		availability of alternatives, primary referral sources, timeliness and  		responsiveness of channeling in meeting perceived needs, and the time-limited  		nature of the demonstration. We will document the rate of participation for  		those deemed appropriate and assigned to the client group, and the  		characteristics of participants versus nonparticipants. To the extent that they  		differ across sites, they may also be important in explaining outcomes.</p>
<p>We will also document caseload development at the sites over time. The  		success of channeling in generating and maintaining active participants at full  		capacity, and the "size" of this intervention relative to the pool of eligibles  		and the available services, will affect both treatment and control outcomes,  		the costs of channeling, and its acceptance by the provider community.</p>
<p>Documentation of participant characteristics will be drawn from the  		screen and baseline assessment, supplemented by interpretations obtained from  		interviews with key referral sources, providers, and channeling staff. Caseload  		development, participation rates for appropriates, and reasons for  		non-participation will be documented from the client tracking and status change  		forms, again supplemented by interpretation from the process interviews.</p>
<h3>F. CHANNELING PROJECT COSTS</h3>
<p>The analysis of channeling project costs will identify the costs of  		channeling site operations, which are relevant to estimating the costs of  		implementing similar case management programs. It will also document the total  		costs of the national demonstration (including planning, managing and  		monitoring), expenditures for direct services purchased by the channeling  		projects, and costs associated with the functions performed by the channeling  		projects.</p>
<p>The principal questions to be addressed are:</p>
<ol><li>What are the total costs of the channeling program?</li>
<li>What are the costs of planning and implementing the channeling  		  program?</li>
<li>What are the costs of operating channeling at each site, by function  		  and funding source?</li>
</ol><p>The operating costs of channeling identified in this analysis will be  		used in the impact analyses to calculate this component of the service costs  		for the participant subset of the treatment group. As they reflect the relative  		effort and resources devoted to particular channeling functions, they may also  		help explain differences in outcomes. These costs can also be used in  		estimating the costs of incorporating channeling components in future programs.  		In combination with information from the on-site process interviews, the  		documentation and analysis of channeling project costs will provide perspective  		on the factors influencing channeling operations and costs. In addition to the  		principal known determinants of costs (model, channeling functions, and types  		of services purchased), specification of other determinants will be developed  		in conjunction with the documentation of channeling's implementation and  		operations. These may include, for example, fluctuations or delays in caseload  		buildup, changes in service rates or reimbursement mechanisms, changes in  		organization and staffing, and client characteristics.</p>
<p><b>1. What Are The Total Costs Of The Channeling Program?</b></p>
<p>Incorporation of channeling components into national or state programs  		will require estimation of costs for both design and implementation, and for  		the selection of funding sources and payment mechanisms. In order to inform  		these decisions, documentation of total expenditures on the channeling programs  		will be by phase (excluding close-down costs), by participant (federal, state,  		channeling agency, technical assistance and evaluation contractors), and by  		funding source (federal, state and-local, private and individual  		contributions).</p>
<p>The analysis of total costs will distinguish costs in three phases in  		the life of the channeling project: planning, startup, and ongoing operations.  		For the purposes of presenting total cost data, the planning phase dates from  		October 1980, when the contracts with the states were let (excluding planning  		at the federal level preceding this date) through March 1982 (an 18month  		period), when the first sites became operational. Startup is the planned  		one-year period of caseload buildup dated from April 1982 through March 1983.  		Ongoing operations, defined as steady-state operations with approximately full  		caseload, is scheduled for the period from April 1983 through June 1984 (a  		15-month period).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note64">64</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most state and site channeling costs will be documented through invoices  		(for the planning phase) and through the formal cost reports established for  		the evaluation (for the startup and ongoing phases). Estimation of state and  		other contributions (particularly during the planning phase) will rely both on  		the invoices and cost reports, supplemented by information developed through  		the on-site interviews. Estimates of federal costs for research, planning,  		technical assistance and management will be developed through special inquiries  		to DHHS.</p>
<p><b>2. What are the Costs of Planning and Implementing the Channeling  		Program?</b></p>
<p>The costs of planning and implementing the channeling projects are  		relevant to replication. The average cost for both channeling models, the total  		site cost and total costs for the other major participants in the national  		demonstration (DENS and the national evaluation and technical assistance  		contractors), will be documented for both planning and startup phases. The  		principal data source for this will be the planning phase invoices and standard  		cost reports prepared by the channeling projects. These will be supplemented by  		information gathered in the on-site interviews with key actors in the planning  		and implementation processes.</p>
<p><b>3. What are the Costs of Channeling at the Site during Steady-State  		Operations?</b></p>
<p>Steady-state cost is the principal focus for the analysis of channeling  		project costs. Detailed analyses of channeling site costs will provide  		essential information for costing out future case management initiatives. These  		analyses will examine the total channeling site costs, unit costs per case  		month for operations, and purchase of services in the steady-state period. The  		following issues will be examined:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do costs differ by the scale of the agencies? </p>
<p>Do costs change across time?</p>
<p>What is the operational cost by channeling function (by site, model  		  and across time)?</p>
<p>What is the unit cost (total and by function) per client?</p>
<p>What is the distribution of costs by expenditure category (such as  		  salaries, rent, travel, and so forth), by model and site?</p>
<p>What are the costs of purchased services by service type by site,  		  model, and across time?</p>
<p>What are the funding sauces for operations and purchased services by  		  site and model?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most relevant costs for this detailed analysis are the steady-state  		costs of a fully operational site with full and constant caseload. Costs will  		be documented from the date that full caseload is reached (i.e., when research  		intake ends) continuing through the end of research data collection  		(approximately June 1984). This period excludes costs for the initial startup  		and learning period. These costs will be identified using the formal channeling  		project cost reporting schedules devised for the purpose. These schedules  		identify federal, state, and in-kind contributions to channeling site  		operations, by detailed line item. Federal and other contributions to direct  		service costs are also identified in these schedules.</p>
<p>Functional costs will be identified using the distribution of staff  		costs by function from the semi-monthly timesheets. The functions identified on  		the time sheet are: outreach, screening, baseline assessment, initial care  		planning, ongoing case management, and provider relations/administration/other.  		Line-item costs will be allocated to functions, taking into account such  		factors as dedication of subcontractor costs to specific functions undertaken  		by the entity, and identification of line items to specific functions. For  		example, medical assessments would be allocated to the baseline assessment  		function. The remaining costs will be allocated to functions using a step-down  		process based on the distribution of salaries to specific functions.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#note65">65</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Development of the unit cost (per active case month and per client)  		depends on the accurate calculation first, of total costs and second, of the  		number of clients and the time they spend in the program. These client counts  		and lengths of stay will be derived from the client tracking and status change  		forms, which the channeling sites complete for all clients.</p>

<p><a name="note1" id="note1">In</a> response to this problem, Section 2176 of the  			 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act enables states to apply to DHHS for medicaid  			 waivers to enable them to provide, through medicaid, community-based services  			 to persons who would otherwise be institutionalized. This is only a partial  			 answer, however, because the community services are only available through the  			 waiver authority, which is scheduled to expire three years after passage.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Indirect</a> effects could arise in at least three  			 ways. First, channeling could have impacts on the service delivery system as a  			 whole. It could, for example, increase the amount or quality of service  			 available in the community--and hence to the control group--causing the  			 treatment-control comparison to underestimate the true impact of channeling.  			 Second, channeling could increase the amount of services available to  			 individuals who are not channeling clients--including the control group. For  			 example, it may relieve demand for case management services that are already  			 available in the community, reducing caseloads or waiting lists and making  			 available to the control group more case management services than would have  			 been available in the absence of channeling. Again, this would lead to an  			 underestimate of impacts. Finally, to the extent that channeling increases  			 clients access to existing direct services (as distinguished from case  			 management services) in a way that puts channeling clients ahead of others in  			 the queues for existing services, this increase in services for clients will  			 come partly or entirely at the expense of nonclients. Thus, the control group  			 will receive fewer direct services than they would have received in the absence  			 of channeling. In contrast to the first two cases, this would lead to an  			 overestimate of impacts on clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">The</a> extent of indirect contamination also  			 depends upon how concentrated the indirect effects are and whether the  			 population served by channeling is a representative cross section of the target  			 population. Even a small scale demonstration can contaminate through indirect  			 system effects if they are concentrated in a small set of providers and the  			 control group is made up of individuals who are more likely to receive services  			 from those providers than is the target population as a whole. To avoid such  			 concentration, sites have been instructed to engage in broad outreach efforts  			 spread across the full range of referral agencies and to seek out clients not  			 currrently being served by the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">Another</a> strategy that would minimize control  			 group contamination would have been to have research staff administer baselines  			 to both treatments and controls (prior to randomization). This was rejected for  			 two reasons: (1) channeling staff felt strongly that they should make the  			 initial in-person contact with clients and that an assessment to be used for  			 clinical care planning and decisionmaking should only be performed by  			 clinically-trained staff; and (2) from a research perspective, research  			 intervention at the crucial point of assessment would have run the risk of  			 distorting the implementation of channeling from what it would be in a  			 nondemonstration situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">As</a> discussed further in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#sectionII.D">Section D</a>, sample attrition is one potential source of  			 noncomparability, and the baseline and/or screening data, therefore, play an  			 important role in the modeling associated with the attrition analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">In</a> developing the sample design, we placed  			 primary emphasis on the data collection costs, taking channeling operations  			 costs as essentially fixed. Caseload sizes were taken as given, based on a  			 desire to have projects of sufficient scale to test normal operating  			 procedures, subject to limitations imposed by the size of the target population  			 and potential indirect contamination of the control group. Based on preliminary  			 estimates of the sample size needed, planned caseloads for the two models  			 exceeded the sample size needed by a modest margin. Although we did not place  			 primary emphasis on site costs, taking them into account would imply a larger  			 control than treatment group. Another site operational concern, however, works  			 in the opposite direction: the lower the ratio of treatments to controls, the  			 less incentive referral sources have to refer to channeling, and the more  			 difficult it is to get channeling staff to accept randomization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">Technically,</a> the sample size depends on the  			 variance of the outcome measures which in the case of binomial distributions  			 varies with the mean of the outcome measure.

<p><a name="note15" id="note15">Ideally,</a> the demonstration sample would be  			 chosen to be representative of the national population by first dividing all  			 sites in the nation into strata such that the differences in population  			 characteristics between sites within a stratum are small, but the differences  			 between strata are large. After stratification, then one or more sites within  			 each stratum would be sampled randomly. By sampling from all the strata,  			 national population generalizations could be made. As a practical matter,  			 random selection of sites is rarely feasible in a demonstration--and the  			 channeling demonstration is no exception. Rather, sites apply to be in a  			 demonstration and are then selected based on a variety of criteria, including  			 the quality of the proposal. Although a stratified random sample is seldom  			 achieved, judgmental selection of sites could, in principle, seek to be broadly  			 representative of the nation, for example, with respect to regional  			 distribution, urban-rural mix, and availability of public funding for long term  			 care services. Original plans for the, channeling demonstration called for  			 selection of 23 sites in two waves. In the first round of site selection,  			 representativeness was not given primary importance because the second round of  			 selection provided the opportunity to correct for nonrepresentativeness. When  			 budget cuts forced the limitation of the demonstration to 10 sites already  			 selected, the demonstration was left with sites that, although representing a  			 diverse population, do not necessarily approximate a representative sample of  			 the nation.</p>
<p>Had sites been selected to represent a national population, the  			 allocation of the sample across sites would be determined based on that  			 sampling design. In this case we seek to avoid the sample's being dominated by  			 one or two sites and to have the sample broadly representative across the five  			 sites in each model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note16" id="note16">The</a> two plans are designed to have the, same  			 minimum detectable difference using the following formula:</p>

</tr></table><p>where N<sub>C</sub>, S, t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, and D are as  			 defined above and r is the treatment-control ratio,  			 N<sub>T</sub>/N<sub>c</sub>. Based on this formula, the <b>total</b> sample  			 (including treatments and controls) of the alternate plan is (1 +  			 r)<sup>2</sup>/4r times the total sample size for the basic plan (with equal  			 treatment and control groups). The research costs of the two plans are  			 approximately equal, however, because the larger treatment group is offset by  			 the lower relative research cost of treatment group observations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note17" id="note17">Because</a> of the different ratios of treatments  			 to controls across sites, this is technically correct only for each individual  			 site; estimates of aggregate impacts across a group of sites require weighting  			 of the sample to adjust for the different sampling ratios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">If</a> no control variables are included, then the  			 regression estimate of the treatment-control difference (a<sub>T</sub>) and the  			 difference in treatment and control group means are the same, and the  			 associated significance tests are equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note19" id="note19">In</a> other cases, regression analysis is  			 appropriate but must be modified to take account of particular error structures  			 by using generalized least squares estimation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note20" id="note20">The</a> shortcomings of least squares regression in  			 such instances are documented in many econometric texts, as are suggested  			 alternatives. For example, see Kmenta (1971, pp. 423-427). A paper by Nerlove  			 and Press (1973) contains a much more detailed discussion of this and other  			 related topics dealing with qualitative dependent variables.</p>

<p><a name="note21" id="note21">The</a> distributions are of ten converted into  			 "hazard rates," which essentially measure the probability that an event occurs  			 during a specified time interval, given that it has not yet occurred.</p>

<li>
<p><a name="note22" id="note22">This</a> specification assumes that the control  			 variables (X<sub>i</sub>) for the different subgroups have the same  			 coefficients. In some cases, we may need to allow some coefficients to differ  			 across subgroups, and in the extreme to estimate separate equations for the  			 different subgroups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note23" id="note23">One</a> approach to estimating the impact on  			 participants is to assume that the impact on nonparticipants is zero and  			 calculate the impact on the participants group based on the total treatment  			 group impacts and the proportion of the treatment group that participates. This  			 approach has the advantage of simplicity, but the assumption of no impact on  			 nonparticipants is questionable. The impact on nonparticipants could be either  			 positive or negative depending on whether the initial randomization and  			 assessment processes prior to dropping out had a positive or negative effect on  			 the outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note24" id="note24">Technically,</a> the variables used to disaggregate  			 the overall impact need not be predetermined, just independent of the  			 channeling treatment. Of those variables that are not predetermined, however,  			 most of those that would be of interest for purposes of disaggregation are also  			 likely to be affected by channeling. The extent of impact on such variables is,  			 of course, a continuum, and judgment is required concerning whether the impact  			 is likely to be large enough to require special modeling and statistical  			 analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note25" id="note25">In</a> thinking about nonresponse bias, it is  			 important to distinguish between interview nonresponse (which arises because  			 individuals refuse to be interviewed) and nonparticipation in channeling (which  			 arises because individuals drop out of channeling prior to full assessment, are  			 found inappropriate at full assessment by channeling assessors, or drop out  			 subsequent to assessment). Research interviewers will attempt to interview all  			 members of both the treatment and control groups regardless of whether they are  			 participants or nonparticipants. While there will undoubtedly be those who  			 neither participate in channeling nor respond to interviews, there will also be  			 followup interview nonrespondents who participate in channeling, and channeling  			 nonparticipants who respond to the interviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note26" id="note26">The</a> smaller sample size is offset in part by  			 lower variance in the differences being compared because the measures are for  			 the <b>same</b> individuals, eliminating variance due to individual  			 differences, which is a component of the variance of treatment-control  			 differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note27" id="note27">The</a> tactic of reversing the order of the  			 clinical and validation samples for half the validation sample, which would  			 solve this problem, is unacceptable to channeling project staff because they  			 feel they should make the first contact with all clients. Having channeling  			 staff reinterview a subsample of the control group is unacceptable because it  			 would possibly contaminate the controls and would impose unacceptable workload  			 burdens on the site during the caseload buildup period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note28" id="note28">The</a> simplification omits interdependence among  			 impacts and some direct causal relationships (e.g., potential impacts of  			 channeling that are brought about directly through case management rather than  			 indirectly through changes in service utilization.) This is deliberate in order  			 to focus attention on the primary causal relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note29" id="note29">Strictly</a> speaking, some client and caregiver  			 characteristics and some aspects of provider behavior may be affected by  			 channeling. In the analysis we will pay careful attention to the potential for  			 endogeneity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note30" id="note30">Bear</a> in mind that this group is defined as one  			 for whom channeling has no impact on the timing of the institutionalization. It  			 is certainly possible, however, that the channeling case manager's involvement  			 might result in a more appropriate level of care determination or aid the  			 client and family in selecting an institution that better meets their  			 requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note31" id="note31">To</a> the extent such persons do enter the sample,  			 their outcomes will be analyzed along with everyone elses. However, channeling  			 is expected to have little effect on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note32" id="note32">As</a> was also discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapII">Chapter II</a>, more sophisticated analytic techniques can be  			 used to estimate the <b>probability</b> of institutionalization to attempt to  			 explore differential impacts on these analytic subgroups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note33" id="note33">Other</a> literature on community care alternatives  			 to nursing homes is extensive but not directly relevant to channeling. In many  			 cases, the interventions differed from channeling in important respects. The  			 ACCESS demonstration (Price et al. 1980) and the Washington Community-Based  			 Care (CBC) demonstration (Solem et al. 1979) were both system level  			 interventions with mandates to serve the entire target population in their  			 communities; the Triage project (Hicks at al. 1979) also had such a mandate and  			 until recently did not require disability for program eligibility; the Highland  			 Heights experiment (Sherwood et al. 1981) was primarily a housing  			 demonstration. Earlier experiments (Blenkner et al. 1974, Neilsen at al. 1972,  			 Goldberg at al. 1970, and Katz at al. 1972) had interventions that differed  			 considerably from channeling, and were tested in different service environments  			 because they preceded the growth in public funding for community services.  			 There is an additional series of state/federal studies not yet completed, which  			 could, provide important information on evaluating the community care  			 alternative in the future. These include: California Multipurpose Senior  			 Services Project, New York's Nursing Home Without Walls Program, South  			 Carolina Community Long Term Care Program, Long Term Care Project of North San  			 Diego, OnLok Senior Health Services Community Care Organization, and Project  			 Open at Mt. Zion Hospital. Also not discussed here are a number of state and  			 local initiatives being conducted throughout the United States exploring  			 in-home service alternatives. A comparative study of many of the state/federal  			 demonstrations is currently being completed by Berkeley Planning  			 Associates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note34" id="note34">Two</a> demonstrations that were systemwide  			 interventions and could not be evaluated by a randomized design--the New York  			 ACCESS and Washington Community-Based Care (CBC) demonstrations--had reductions  			 in nursing home costs compared to comparison counties. Although their  			 methodologies were necessarily limited, these two studies also support the view  			 that community care may be able to reduce nursing home utilization. The Triage  			 demonstration in Connecticut, which was evaluated using a matched comparison  			 sample located in another part of the state, found no major differences in  			 nursing home utilization patterns between Triage clients and members of the  			 comparison group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note35" id="note35">It</a> should be noted that for three of these  			 studies the utilization data available were not comprehensive, being limited to  			 medicaid only (Wisconsin CCO), primarily medicare (NCHSR) or both (Georgia  			 AHS). The Worcester project obtained data from individuals. To the extent that  			 there is nursing home utilization outside these programs, the treatment and  			 control group means reported in <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#tableIV2">Table IV.2</a> are  			 underestimates, and to the extent that the demonstrations may have brought  			 about shifts in funding sources, the treatment-control comparisons could be  			 biased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note36" id="note36">See,</a> for example, Pinkner 1980; Schapiro, Roos  			 and Kavanaugh, 1980.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note37" id="note37">The</a> Wisconsin CCO demonstration is illustrative  			 of the problem. Utilization of services provided under a medicaid waiver was  			 zero for the control group, because such services were simply not available to  			 the control group under medicaid. Whether they received such services under  			 other programs or purchased them privately was not known because the data were  			 unavailable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note38" id="note38">If</a> the individual is reported as participating  			 in medicaid or medicare in the individual interviews, we will confirm that the  			 individual is entitled under the relevant program by confirming entitlement  			 periodically with HCFA and the state medicaid agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note39" id="note39">The</a> subsample will consist of the primary  			 informal caregivers (as identified by the treatment or control group member) of  			 those individuals randomized after the fall of 1983. The sample will consist of  			 100 percent of late enrollees in the case management sites and a proportion  			 large enough to obtain an equal sample size at financial control model  			 sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note40" id="note40">For</a> preliminary analyses and as an alternative  			 data source, the individual interview asks how many days the individual spent  			 in a nursing home during the six months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note41" id="note41">There</a> will still be three possible cases of  			 missing data, each involving non-medicaid recipients. These will will occur if:  			 (1) the individual fails to report using nursing home services, (2) the  			 individual does not report the identity of the provider (or identifies the  			 wrong provider), or (3) a nursing home identified by the individual refuses to  			 permit us access to their records. Some of these missing data may be contained  			 in medicare records, so we will check against the medicare data tapes to  			 determine whether there is any nursing home utilization. If so, these data will  			 then be merged with the other nursing home utilization data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note42" id="note42">It</a> should be noted that there are some  			 potential problems with this adjustment that need to be considered and resolved  			 before implementing it. It will not fully correct for failure of respondents to  			 identify providers because it only corrects for failure to identify utilization  			 at all. For example, it does not count those cases in which one nursing home or  			 hospital was reported correctly b ut another was not mentioned at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note43" id="note43">Utilization</a> of community-based services in the  			 reported week is likely to be higher than the average for six months for those  			 whose functional capacity declines over the period. This will also be true for  			 those who enter an institution during the period since they report on the last  			 week prior to institutionalization, which is likely to be a period of more  			 intensive service use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note44" id="note44">Then</a> it remains necessary to add an estimate of  			 utilization covered by other funding sources. By adjusting self-reports in a  			 manner similar to the first method, estimates of utilization covered by other  			 funding sources (self-pay, private insurance and other government programs) can  			 be added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note45" id="note45">In</a> order to avoid treatment/control bias, of  			 course, we will need to distinguish cases where channeling was identified by  			 the individual from cases where the individual was receiving case management  			 from channeling but the individual did not say so in the interview. By  			 comparing the estimates, we will be able to determine the extent of  			 under-reporting in the basic treatment/control comparisons and provide a basis  			 for adjusting those estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note46" id="note46">We</a> will also sometimes refer to "charges," the  			 amount providers bill for their services, which may differ from expenditures  			 and resource costs. In the case of some services provided directly by  			 government or nonprofit agencies, there may be no charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note47" id="note47">The</a> administrative costs of making the transfer  			 payments are, however, a resource cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note48" id="note48">See</a> <a href="../daltcp/reports/designes.htm#chapV-E">Section E</a> on  			 cost-effectiveness differences, conceptual and actual, between the for more  			 discussion of the two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note49" id="note49">They</a> did not necessarily identify <b>all</b>  			 costs of community care, however. The GAO (1977b) report on the cost of keeping  			 disabled persons in the community, for example, has been criticized for  			 excluding the costs of food, housing, and income maintenance for those at home  			 (HCFA 1981).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note50" id="note50">Some</a> other government programs also pay for  			 nursing home care, for example, the Veterans Administration and, in relatively  			 rare instances, private insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note51" id="note51">As</a> time passes, more of those who were not  			 eligible for medicaid initially will spend down their assets and become  			 eligible. Consequently, the distribution of cost reductions between medicaid  			 and private individuals may depend on the time period (relative to enrollment  			 in channeling) when the impact is measured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note52" id="note52">The</a> NCHSR study focused on nursing home  			 utilization under medicare, but reported only total medicare program costs. The  			 Worcester Home Care project did not report nursing home costs for either  			 medicaid or medicare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note53" id="note53">The</a> NCHSR and Worcester studies did not report  			 hospital costs. The ACCESS and Washington CBC demonstrations both found that  			 medicaid hospital costs were approximately equal in the treatment and  			 comparison counties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note54" id="note54">We</a> do not ask elderly individuals to report  			 source of payment for services, but we can rule out some sources based on  			 eligibility status for medicare and medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note55" id="note55">In</a> most cases, it is borne by others who use  			 the service and pay directly or through private insurance, but in some cases it  			 may be made up by charitable contributions or result in losses to  			 providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note56" id="note56">Although</a> there have been numerous studies on  			 the effects of institutionalization, it is difficult to separate out the  			 institutional effects from the individual characteristics of the residents.  			 Because the majority of these studies examine clients only after they have been  			 institutionalized, it is difficult to attribute these effects solely to the  			 "institutionalization process."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note57" id="note57">See</a> Greenberg et al. 1980. These concerns  			 include: inability to recruit appropriate target population, small sample  			 sizes, inadequate research design, inadequate measures, short time frame, data  			 collection problems and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note58" id="note58">In</a> a very limited number of cases it may be  			 necessary to interview three different caregivers at the 12 month  			 interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note59" id="note59">While</a> it obviously would have been preferable  			 to draw the sample over the entire period of caseload build-up, resources were  			 not available during the early months of intake to support the caregiver  			 survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note60" id="note60">Triage,</a> Wisconsin CCO, Washington CBC, NCHSR  			 Adult Day Care and Home Health, Highland Heights Experiment, OnLok Senior  			 Health Services, Georgia AHS, Worcester Home Care, and ACCESS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note61" id="note61">To</a> disentangle this reciprocal interaction,  			 Greene estimated a simultaneous two-equation model of formal and informal  			 support. The dependent variable was defined as the number of areas (maximum of  			 12) in which regular support was provided in the previous month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note62" id="note62">A</a> majority of the previous long term care  			 demonstrations experienced problems in these areas. See, for example, Wisconsin  			 Community Care Organization (Seidl et al. 1980); Georgia Alternative Health  			 Services (Skellie et al. 1980); Triage (Hicks et al. 1979); National Center for  			 Health Services Research (Weissert et al. 1979); Worcester Home Care Project  			 (Claffey and Stein 1975). For cross-site reviews, see Greenberg et. al. 1980;  			 Stassen and Holahan 1980.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note63" id="note63">Demonstrations</a> experiencing problems of this  			 sort include Wisconsin CCO, Georgia AHS, NCHSR Adult Day Care and Homemaker and  			 the Worcester Home rare project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note64" id="note64">Although</a> individual sites differ from this  			 schedule for startup, and there is some uncertainty about the length of the  			 caseload buildup period, this approximates the three phases for all sites as  			 envisioned at this point. If, in analysis, this appears to be too crude an  			 approximation, we retain the capability to redefine time periods for each site  			 based on its own staring date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note65" id="note65">Costs</a> related to the research have not been  			 identifed as a separate function because they are not easily distinguished from  			 other functions. Because the period for which operating costs will be estimated  			 is after the end of research sample intake, we expect research-related costs to  			 be a relatively small proportion of total operating costs then. We will  			 document the research-related activities identified by the channeling site  			 directors (on a reporting schedule designed specifically for that purpose) and,  			 based on that information, make a judgmental estimate of the order of magnitude  			 of research-related costs.</p>
