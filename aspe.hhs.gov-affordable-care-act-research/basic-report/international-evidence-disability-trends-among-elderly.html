<p>Life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and much of  		the industrialized world as death rates at older ages decline. But are today's  		elderly healthier than previous generations or does increased longevity come  		with increased risk of disability and reduced quality of life? This question is  		not only of personal and intellectual interest. It is of crucial policy  		importance, because it affects the public costs of the income, health, and  		long-term care needs of the elderly population. In aging societies like those  		of the United States and much of the industrialized world, these costs could  		have critical implications for the future financial stability of national  		budgets. Unfortunately for the public debate, it is a complex question to  		answer and has stimulated substantial controversy among the analytic  		community--with some evidence pointing to increasing disability rates as  		mortality rates fall and other evidence pointing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>In the ongoing search for a definitive answer, this report provides a  		comprehensive review of the evidence, both for the United States and  		internationally. The most defensible conclusion is that disability rates are  		falling in most industrialized countries.</p>
<p>In the United States, where several surveys have been used to estimate  		disability trends, a growing body of evidence points toward declines in  		disability rates among the elderly. Some studies show smaller declines than  		others, but in a variety of disability research employing different surveys and  		analytic methods, no sustained increase in disability rates has been observed.  		To the contrary, several sources of survey data, which in earlier years  		appeared to show either increasing disability or no pattern over time, now show  		statistically significant declines in elderly disability rates.</p>
<p>Similarly, in much of the industrialized world outside of the United  		States, available survey data point to an increase in the amount of time the  		elderly can expect to live without disability. The countries where disability  		among the elderly appears to be declining include France, Belgium, Taiwan,  		Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland. In countries where no substantial decline  		is apparent there is no consistent evidence that disability rates are rising.  		These include Australia, Canada, and Britain.</p>
<p>How fast disability rates are falling is still unclear, however, because  		wide disparities in the disability measures, field procedures, and sample  		designs prevent comparability across data sources. After reviewing and  		assessing the quality of the evidence, the paper ends with recommendations for  		future data collection and analysis to increase comparability and narrow the  		range of the estimates. Such measures are recommended to improve national  		estimates of disability trends and enhance the opportunities for international  		comparisons.</p>
<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction">1. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and much of  		the industrialized world as death rates at older ages decline (e.g., Manton and  		Vaupel, 1995; Vaupel and Jeune, 1994). But are today's elderly healthier than  		previous generations or does increased longevity come with increased risk of  		disability and reduced quality of life? This question is not only of personal  		and intellectual interest. It is of crucial policy importance, because it  		affects the public costs of the income, health, and long-term care needs of the  		elderly population. In aging societies like those of the United States and much  		of the industrialized world, these costs can have critical implications for the  		financial stability of national budgets. Unfortunately for the public debate,  		it is a complex question to answer and has stimulated substantial controversy  		among the analytic community--with some evidence pointing to increasing  		disability rates as mortality rates fall and other evidence pointing in the  		opposite direction.</p>
<p>In the ongoing search for a definitive answer, this paper provides a  		comprehensive review of the evidence, both for the United States and  		internationally. The basic conclusion is that disability rates are falling in  		most industrialized countries. For the countries where no decline is apparent,  		there is no consistent evidence that disability rates are rising. How fast they  		are falling, and what this may mean for national budgets are still unclear,  		however, because wide disparities in the disability measures, field procedures,  		and sample designs prevent comparability across data sources. After reviewing  		and assessing the quality of the evidence, this report ends with  		recommendations for future data collection and analysis to increase  		comparability and narrow the range of the estimates.</p>
<h3>1.1. Policy Significance</h3>
<p>The policy debate hinges on the implications of health and functioning  		among the elderly for retirement income support and health care needs. Labor  		force participation rates among the non-elderly have been falling drastically,  		increasing the number of years the average person depends on public or private  		pension income. In the early 1960s, for example, in 11 industrialized countries  		(Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, the Netherlands,  		Spain, Britain, and the United States, labor force participation rates were  		over 70% in all but one and over 80% in several. By the 1990s, although the  		rate in Japan had only dropped to 75%, it had dropped to 53% in the United  		States and to between 20% and 40% in Europe (Gruber and Wise, 1998). These  		reductions are plausibly attributable, at least in part, to the work  		disincentives embodied in the implicit tax that public pensions (like Social  		Security in the United States) typically levy on the labor earnings of persons  		who work after reaching retirement age.</p>
<p>If increasing longevity is accompanied by increasing disability rates,  		these labor force participation rates can be expected to continue to drop. But  		if disability rates are falling, public policy can be designed to promote labor  		force participation into older ages, reducing the length of time the average  		person spends in retirement (Tolley and Manton, 1998).</p>
<p>The latter possibility, combined with the fiscal pressures of supporting  		a longer-lived population and the prospect of the baby boomers' retirement, led  		the U.S. Congress to pass legislation in 1983 gradually raising the normal  		Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67 years by the year 2024. There have  		even been extensive discussions of accelerating this legislated increase, on  		the basis of recent research findings that disability rates among the elderly  		in the United States may, indeed, be falling (Tolley and Manton, 1996). In a  		number of other countries similar increases in the retirement age are being  		debated, though the data available on which such discussions are based is  		typically much less developed.</p>
<p>The policy impact of changing rates of chronic disease and disability  		among the elderly on health policy (including the provision of long-term care)  		may be even more direct than on retirement policy. However, the possibility of  		reduced disability has so far been virtually ignored in projecting the acute  		and long-term care needs of elderly Medicare and Medicaid recipients in the  		United States, as has the potential benefit of public health and medical  		research strategies to promote such a trend. Discussions in other countries  		have been characterized by similar neglect of the issue.</p>
<h3>1.2. Background to the Debate about Trends</h3>
<p>The theory that increasing longevity might actually be linked to  		increasing prevalence of disability was initially postulated as a response to  		three phenomena. First, medical interventions (such as cardiac surgery) in the  		management of children with chronic disorders (such as Down's syndrome) began  		enabling such children to survive into childbearing ages (Gruenberg, 1977).  		Second, models were developed suggesting that industrial societies were  		altering lifestyles in ways that raised the risk of chronic diseases among the  		elderly (Dubos, 1965; Antonovsky, 1968; Omran, 1971). Third, there was  		speculation that increases in medical expenditures were concentrated largely on  		very intensive and expensive medical care to preserve life in elderly, very  		ill, disabled persons to gain only small amounts of additional, relatively poor  		quality life.</p>
<p>The theory that increased longevity is inherently linked to increased  		disability has not withstood empirical examination. The theories about the  		links between industrial society and chronic disease risk were based largely on  		what turns out to have been an isolated phenomenon (increased risk of male  		coronary heart disease in the United States and Britain) in the 1950s and 1960s  		(Kaplan and Keil, 1993). The average person surviving past age 80 is now  		documented to be in better health and incurs lower health care costs than the  		average person dying in his 60s (e.g., Vita et al., 1998; Perls et al., 1997;  		Lubitz and Riley, 1993; Lubitz et al., 1995). And much new evidence suggests  		that health at late ages has been improving for a long time (Lanska and Mi,  		1993)--probably beginning, at least in the United States and Britain, for the  		generation born in the 1840s (Fogel, 1994; Perutz, 1998).</p>
<p>Whether the surviving elderly population in any specific country will be  		more or less healthy on average than the preceding generation is an empirical  		question. But the physiological potential for health improvements and health  		maintenance at very advanced ages (e.g., into the 90s) is now well established  		(Kasch et al., 1993; Fiatarone, 1990, 1993, 1994).</p>
<h2><a name="usevidence" id="usevidence">2. EVIDENCE ON DISABILITY TRENDS IN THE UNITED  		STATES</a></h2>
<p>With respect to the United States, the specter of rising disability  		rates was first raised as an empirical matter during the 1970s, when data from  		the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) showed increasing proportions of  		older adults classifying themselves as limited in their capacity to perform  		normal activities. Citing a number of methodological and conceptual problems  		with the survey, researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics,  		which is responsible for the NHIS, warned against taking these trends at face  		value (Wilson and Drury, 1984). Even so, various social scientists have  		interpreted those data to imply that health deteriorated in the 1970s  		(Verbrugge, 1984, 1989; Colvez and Blanchet, 1981; Chirikos, 1986; Crimmins,  		1990; Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1993, 1994; Crimmins, Saito, and Reynolds,  		1997).</p>
<p>The NHIS trend in self-reported disability rates changed dramatically  		during the 1980s, however--at least leveling off and perhaps even declining  		(Waidmann et al., 1995). Data for the 1984-1990 period from a related source,  		the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA), also showed modest improvements in  		rates for certain types of disability. And 1982-1994 findings from the National  		Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) showed dramatic declines (by as much as 15%) in  		the age-adjusted disability and institutionalization rates for the U.S.  		population over age 65 (Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1997b; Manton, Stallard,  		and Corder, 1998b).</p>
<p>What can we responsibly conclude about disability trends in the United  		States, given these widely different findings? The following discussion of this  		question owes much to a workshop sponsored by the National Research Council's  		Committee on National Statistics in 1993 (for the workshop report addressing  		this very question see Freedman and Soldo, 1994). We begin by reviewing the  		potential threats to validity. We then discuss each data base in turn.</p>
<h3>2.1. Potential Threats to Validity</h3>
<p>The possible threats to the validity of inferences from statistical data  		are many, and each of the major data bases is potentially vulnerable in at  		least one respect.</p>
<p><i><b>Survey methodology differences</b></i>. A review of the wide range  		of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) disabilities used in U.S. nationally  		representative surveys found that prevalence estimates are sensitive to  		differences among surveys (or between survey waves) in the number and wording  		of questions, sampling strategy, age composition of respondents, and data  		collection methods. This implies that comparisons over time are less likely to  		be biased if all these factors are held constant in a given survey series to  		the maximum degree possible.</p>
<p><i><b>Environmental changes</b></i>. Environmental changes over the  		measurement period can also distort trends. For example, if we use need for  		human assistance or devices to perform certain activities in our definition of  		disability, trend measurement will be distorted if access to assistance changes  		over time.</p>
<p><i><b>Social and economic changes</b></i>. Even consistently designed  		surveys can be affected if public attitudes or the economic climate varies over  		the measurement period. Changing attitudes toward the acceptability of the  		disabled role for a particular age group are likely to cause self-reported  		disability to increase, for example, even if actual prevalence does not.  		Economic expansion could cause the trend in self-reported disability to go in  		the opposite direction, as people who used to rationalize their joblessness as  		due to disability (a socially acceptable reason) are able to find jobs more  		easily.</p>
<p><i><b>Changes in proxy rates</b></i>. If proxy respondents are more  		likely to report disability than sample members themselves, as Dorevitch et al.  		(1992) indicate that they are, increases in proxy response rates could dampen  		estimates of disability declines (or falsely give the appearance of disability  		increases when there have been none).</p>
<p><i><b>Nonrandom attrition</b></i>. If respondents who drop out of a  		survey between waves are more likely to be disabled than are the respondents  		who remain in the sample, trend estimates will overstate declines, unless the  		design of the survey allows for appropriate replenishments to the sample.</p>
<p>How do each of these potential sources of bias affect the major sources  		of U.S. data on disability trends? We discuss each in turn.</p>
<h3>2.2. Findings from U.S. Surveys</h3>
<p><b><i>National Long-term Care Survey (NLTCS)</i></b></p>
<p>The NLTCS is based on a large list sample drawn from Medicare  		administrative files. It is designed to measure chronic disability in the  		Medicare-enrolled population ages 65 and older. It is longitudinal in design  		(with surveys done in 1982, 1984, 1989, and 1994, following individuals over  		time and replenishing samples by age group) and adds respondents as new cohorts  		age into the target population. The questionnaire asks about limitations  		lasting more than 90 days in the respondent's ability to perform 8 Instrumental  		Activities of Daily Living (IADL)--more minor disabilities--and 6 Activities of  		Daily Living (ADLs)--more major disabilities. The NTLCS represents both the  		population living in the community and the institutionalized population. And  		the records of all sample respondents (whether chronically disabled or not) are  		longitudinally linked to Medicare Part A and B files, which are currently  		available from 1982 to 1995.</p>
<p>Analyses of the NLTCS have consistently shown downward trends in the  		prevalence of chronic disability. For the 12-year period between 1982 and 1994,  		for example, NLTCS data--categorized by age-specific rates of non- disability,  		chronic IADL disability, and chronic ADL disability/institutionalization--show  		that the fraction of the 65to 74-year-old population that is not chronically  		disabled grew by 2.6 percentage points and the fraction of the 75- to  		84-year-olds not chronically disabled by 5.4 percentage points (Manton, Corder,  		and Stallard, 1997b). The fraction of those with only IADL impairments fell by  		nearly one-quarter for those ages 65 to 84 (from 4.3% to 3.1% for those 65 to  		74 and from 7.2% to 5.5% for those 75 to 84). It also fell, but not  		significantly, for those over 85. The fraction of those who were either ADL  		impaired or institutionalized fell significantly for all age groups (between 8%  		to 15% depending on age). These declines were confirmed using multivariate  		analyses applied to a broader range of disability measures--including a series  		of physical performance assessments (Manton, Stallard, and Corder, 1998b). The  		disability measures used also had excellent predictive validity in terms of  		Medicare expenditures by type (from 1982-1995) and mortality.</p>
<p>Subgroup analyses of the 1982-1989 period showed that the disability  		declines were larger for better-educated persons (Manton, Stallard, and Corder,  		1997b) and that younger cohorts showed less disability than older cohorts at  		comparable ages (Manton et al., 1997a). Blacks did not share in the reductions  		to the same degree as whites (for the 1982-1989 period see Clark et al., 1996;  		for the 1982-1994 period see Manton et al., 1998).</p>
<p>What factors might cause the NLTCS to overstate disability declines? The  		NLTCS is not vulnerable to sample methodology changes over time, but as with  		any longitudinal survey nonrandom attrition may be a problem. However, the  		NLTCS design explicitly addresses this issue by allowing for replenishment. A  		new sample of 5000 persons who passed age 65 between surveys was gathered in  		1984, 1989, and 1994. And older nondisabled persons are automatically  		rescreened. In any case, attrition rates for reasons other than death are quite  		small and have been found not to be systematically related to disability  		(Corder et al., 1996). Attrition analysis is made possible by the linked  		Medicare records (Manton et al., 1995).</p>
<p>Another factor that might be thought to cause the NLTCS to overstate  		declines arises from the screening-in to the sample of the most severely  		disabled persons. If there is regression to the mean (reverting to a more  		typical level-- high or low), those selected by the screen as chronically  		disabled are likely to have larger than typical (for themselves) disability at  		the time of the screen. Conversely, those screened-out as nondisabled are  		likely to have lower than typical disability at the time of the screen. If, as  		expected, individuals revert toward their typical level of disability in  		subsequent waves, the selected individuals would appear to improve while the  		nonselected ones would appear to deteriorate. In the case of the NLTCS,  		however, the regression to the mean problem is balanced out by the rescreening  		of all previously "nondisabled" and the continual follow-up at later waves of  		all persons who reported either chronic disability or institutional residence  		at any wave.</p>
<p>Thus, if at wave 1 a person reports no chronic disability and is  		screened-out, that person when rescreened is more likely, by chance, to report  		a higher level of disability than is accurate. The regression to the mean  		effect is further mitigated by the requirement that the disability had to exist  		at least 90 days, since regression to the mean is less likely for a persistent  		trait than for an event. The NLTCS screened-in sample contains a wide  		distribution of disability levels, making it possible to examine the traits of  		screened-out and screened-in persons for systematic differences over the  		complete follow-up interval (again from Medicare records). A study of such  		persons in the 1982,1984, and 1989 NLTCS showed no significant differences in  		mortality or Medicare service use (Manton et al., 1995).</p>
<p>A final factor that might be a potential problem in the NLTCS is the  		fact that proxy response rates fell from 1982 to 1989, which might have had the  		effect of overstating disability declines other things equal. In fact, this is  		unlikely to be a major problem for this survey, because the reason for proxy  		interviews in this case is primarily severe physical or cognitive disability.  		In fact, the decline in proxy rates over the 1982-1989 period itself represents  		a decline in the community-resident population with severe chronic  		disabilities.</p>
<p><b><i>National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)</i></b></p>
<p>The NHIS is the longest-running survey collecting health data on the  		population of the United States. It is an annual cross-section survey designed  		to be representative of the civilian non-institutionalized population residing  		in United States that has been collected continuously since 1957. The  		multi-stage probability sample consists of approximately 50,000 households  		(representing over 100,000 individuals) per year. It is conducted by the US  		Census Bureau under specifications established by the National Center for  		Health Statistics.</p>
<p>For the 1970s, NHIS data were restricted to self-reports of limitations  		in capacity to perform normal activities and of suffering from a number of  		potentially disabling chronic conditions. In 1982, the NHIS added two questions  		on the annual core questionnaire pertaining specifically to disabilities in the  		population over age 70. One question asks about the need for help in performing  		"routine needs," which it defines in such a way that it overlaps with some  		IADLs, and one asks about the need for help in performing "personal  		care"--which includes references to several ADLs. However, there is no  		requirement that these limitations be chronic.</p>
<p>As noted, the NHIS showed increased disability rates over the decade of  		the 1970s. In the 1980s, however, as also already noted, the NHIS self-reported  		data changed dramatically--at least leveling off and perhaps even declining  		(Waidmann et al., 1995). It showed statistically significant declines in the  		prevalence of disabilities related to routine needs, but no significant change  		in "personal care" limitations for specific age groups between 1983 and  		1993.</p>
<p>The NHIS is vulnerable in at least three respects, all of which tend in  		the direction of underestimating any real decline in disability rates. First,  		it does not cover the most severely disabled members of the population (because  		it excludes persons who are institutionalized) and includes people who may not  		be disabled in any durable sense (since it has no chronicity requirement).  		Second, its self-report data make it vulnerable to the distorting impacts of  		secular social change. An examination of the NHIS disability data for the 1970s  		and 1980s in the context of social changes, for example, argues that the  		observed deterioration in self-reported health during the 1970s reflects  		changes in the ways in which individuals respond to existing health problems  		and earlier diagnoses of existing chronic conditions (Waidmann et al., 1995).  		Finally, cross-section surveys like the NHIS are vulnerable to distortions from  		the dramatic fall in the institutionalization rate over the 1970s, 1980s and  		1990s. If newly deinstitutionalized persons are more likely to be disabled than  		the random noninstitutionalized individual, these surveys will understate  		declines in disability for the population as a whole.</p>
<p><b><i>Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA)</i></b></p>
<p>The LSOA began (in its LSOA-I incarnation) as a Supplement on Aging  		(SOA) to the 1984 NHIS--which was administered by personal interview to  		noninstitutionalized individuals over age 70 in 1984. It asked about difficulty  		in performing ADLs without assistance of persons or devices. These original  		sample members were followed and interviewed again in 1986, 1988, and 1990. A  		new Supplement on Aging (SOA-II) was administered in 1994, with the intention  		of starting a new Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA-II). For LSOA-II,  		interviewing is done in two stages, taking up to 29 months to administer, and  		major efforts are made to reduce proxy reporting (which affects reported  		disability rates as discussed further below). LSOA-II data will not yield trend  		estimates for several years. Like the NHIS, the LSOA does not have any  		chronicity requirement.</p>
<p>Initial studies using the LSOA found no evidence of significant declines  		in ADL disability. However, a recent analysis of NHIS and LSOA data that  		controls for changes in the age and sex composition of the noninstitutionalized  		population finds that the disability prevalence rate fell by 2 percentage  		points over the 11-year period 1982-1993 (Crimmins, Saito, and Reynolds,  		1997).</p>
<p>Using NHIS data, analysts found significant declines in both personal  		care and routine needs disability. Using LSOA-I data, their models found that,  		while the rates in 1986 and 1988 were higher than in 1984, rates for 1990 were  		lower than in 1988 and not significantly different from the 1984 rates. When  		ADL and IADL disabilities were analyzed, 1986-1990 declines were found for  		both. These results confirm the general downward trend indicated by the NLTCS  		analyses. However, for the LSOA analyses the overall fit of the multinomial  		logit model was not good, the samples of very elderly persons were small, and  		analysts were not able to strongly reject the hypothesis that all the  		coefficients in the model are zero (p=.13). Thus, more years of data are needed  		to confirm the persistence of any trend.</p>
<p>The LSOA has three weaknesses that cast doubt on comparisons between the  		1984 wave and more recent years. The first is that the mode of questioning  		changed during that period from in-person interviewing to telephone  		interviewing. The second is that the rate of proxy interviewing increased  		dramatically (and was not restricted to respondents with major disabilities).  		The third is that there was no sampling of institutional persons in 1984. The  		accounting for institutionalized persons in the later surveys is also  		questionable. In the 1986, 1988, and 1990 LSOA1, the transitions to  		institutions were counted to the extent that a household respondent was  		available to report such a change in the telephone interview (or a person  		entered or left an institution during the interval between surveys). Since the  		"accumulation" of institutionalized persons was incomplete, and the sample kept  		getting older (the youngest person in 1990 was 76), the effects on current  		disability prevalence rates are complex. This is because the  		institutionalization rate (which is now known to have declined) was  		misestimated due to the incomplete assessment of such transfers. The effects of  		institutionalization also vary strongly over age and by gender and race  		(Manton, 1997).</p>
<p><b><i>National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS)</i></b></p>
<p>The National Center for Health Statistics relies on the NNHS to provide  		statistics on the institutionalized elderly population, which is not  		represented in the NHIS. The NNHS is a survey of persons residing in nursing  		homes and similar facilities, which was fielded in 1973-74, 1977, 1985, and  		1995 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1989; Strahan, 1997).</p>
<p>According to the NNHS, the nursing home use rate for persons age 65 and  		over declined from 47.1/1000 in 1977 (a year by which the  		deinstitutionalization of elderly person from state mental hospitals was  		already relatively complete) to 41.3/1000 in 1995. The 1995 rate is lower than  		the rate yielded by the NLTCS, which was 51.1/1000 in 1994. This discrepancy is  		accounted for by the more comprehensive definition of institutionalization in  		the NLTCS and its more comprehensive individual-based (rather than place-based)  		sample frame.</p>
<p>The rates of decline yielded by the two surveys are similar,  		however--12.3% between 1977 and 1995 in the NLTCS versus 10.2% between 1982 and  		1994 in the NNHS. Both these may understate the actual reduction in the risk of  		institutionalization, because they are not adjusted for the rapid growth of the  		U.S. population age 85 and older. In the NLTCS, the 85+ institutional rate  		declined from 258.5 per 1000 in 1982 to 235.7 per 1000 in 1994, an 8.8%  		decline. The decline reflected in the NNHS was much more precipitous, going  		from 225.0 per 1000 in 1977 to 152.6 per 1000 in 1995--a 32.4% decline. The  		NLTCS-NNHS disparity here is accounted for, at least in part, by a more  		restricted definition of nursing home in the 1995 NNHS than in the previous  		wave.</p>
<p><b><i>Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)</i></b></p>
<p>SIPP is a longitudinal survey with 36-month long panels interviewed  		every four months. In each set of nine surveys, one specifically collects  		information on chronic disabilities. A comparison of data for the 1984 and 1993  		panels (Freedman and Martin, 1997a) used several measures of physical  		function--reading a newspaper, lifting and carrying a package weighing 10  		pounds, climbing a flight of stairs, walking three blocks--that are thought to  		be less susceptible to environmental and socio-cultural influences and more  		closely related to the actual process of physical disablement than ADL and IADL  		disability measures (Nagi, 1965; Pope and Tarlov, 1991). In hierarchical models  		of disability, these measures are often thought of as precursors to IADL and  		ADL disability. That analysis, which controlled for population composition  		change, found statistically significant declines in functional limitation for  		several measures over the nine-year period.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)</i></b></p>
<p>The MCBS is administered by Westat, Inc. under the supervision of the  		Health Care Financing Administration. The sample is designed to represent the  		beneficiary population of the Medicare program. Survey respondents are  		interviewed three times a year over a 4-year period. The sample is replenished  		every year to account for attrition and newly enrolled persons. The MCBS  		collects information on chronic condition prevalence, ADL limitations, IADL  		limitations, and functional limitations. Preliminary analysis of the MCBS,  		which controlled for demographic shifts in age, race/ethnicity, education,  		marital status, and gender, found significant declines in ADL and IADL  		disability and in measures of functional limitation (Waidmann and Liu,  		1998).</p>
<h3>2.3. Summing Up</h3>
<p>The 1993 National Research Council's workshop review reached a consensus  		that there had been declines in less severe (IADL) disability in the United  		States over the decade of the 1980s, although there was no agreement on the  		cause of the change. They noted the statistically significant declines in the  		prevalence of disabilities related to routine needs in both the NLTCS and the  		NHIS, even though the populations, nature of questions, and prevalence  		estimates differed. They interpreted the LSOA findings on IADL disability--an  		increase between 1984 and 1986, a fall between 1986 and 1988, and virtually no  		change between 1988 and 1990--as showing no pattern. Given the discontinuities  		between the 1984 and 1986 LSOA noted above, we feel that a more defensible  		approach is to exclude the 1984 data from the comparison. If this is done, the  		LSOA trend is suggestive of declining IADL disability. The workshop did not  		have the benefit of the SIPP and MCBS findings.</p>
<p>With respect to more serious (ADL) disability, the workshop failed to  		reach agreement. Before adjusting for changes in age composition, the NLTCS  		data on chronic ADL disabilities for 1982-1986 showed a shift from the fraction  		of the population with 5 or 6 limitations, to the fraction having 3 or 4  		limitations, and a decline in the fraction with 1 or 2 limitations. Adjusting  		for changes in the age composition of the elderly population yields significant  		declines in the 5 or 6 and 1 or 2 limitations category. The NHIS, however,  		showed no significant change in "personal care" limitation for specific age  		groups between 1983 and 1992. The LSOA-1 showed large increases in disability  		between 1984 and 1986 and essentially no change thereafter, with increasing  		prevalence rates for men and falling prevalence rates for women. Here again,  		the workshop did not have the benefit of the SIPP or MCBS findings.</p>
<p>Since 1993, the observed difference between the trend for IADL  		disability and the trend for ADL disability has been further discussed.  		Crimmins and colleagues (1997) suggest that the difference is due to the  		environmental factors that lead to IADL disability (e.g., the presence of  		helpers). However, Freedman and Martin's (1997a) analysis of SIPP data on  		physical functioning suggests that it is not solely changes in environmental  		factors, but also real improvements in health, that have caused declines in  		disability rates. This is consistent with declines in chronic morbidity, and in  		disability and physical performance measures in the 1982-1994 NLTCS (Manton et  		al., 1998b).</p>
<h2><a name="icevidence" id="icevidence">3. EVIDENCE ON HEALTH TRENDS IN OTHER  		INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES</a></h2>
<h3>3.1. Existing Data Collection Efforts</h3>
<p>There have been a number of efforts to assess the prevalence of chronic  		disability in elderly populations cross-nationally. Professor G. Andrews of  		Flinders University in Australia, under World Health Organization (WHO)  		auspices, has conducted a series of similarly constituted surveys of the  		population aged 60+ in roughly 25 countries in the Pacific and Middle Eastern  		regions of WHO. The United Nations maintains an international database (DISTAT)  		of disability statistics derived primarily from census sources (Chamie, 1990).  		A number of individual countries (Canada, France, and Britain) have conducted  		local area and cross-sectional national surveys of disability. The national  		surveys (many of them of labor force activity) have often been used in  		cross-national comparisons of chronic disabilities and handicaps. Relatively  		rare, however, are longitudinal surveys of chronic disability conducted using a  		consistent survey design and instrumentation, and methodologically comparable  		measures of disability impact on elderly populations.</p>
<p>An organization explicitly created to promote the generation of such  		measures for cross-national studies, the International Healthy Life Expectancy  		Network (REVES), held its first meeting in Quebec in 1989. Involved in that  		meeting were researchers from Canada, the United States, and four European  		countries (France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland). Since then,  		roughly 10 meetings have been held, the most recent in Tokyo, Japan in 1997.  		REVES membership has been growing rapidly since the first meeting. And its work  		has now received official recognition by both WHO (e.g., by Nakijima, then WHO  		Director-General) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  		(OECD) as well as by the governments of a number of countries (including  		Canada, Britain, and France).</p>
<p>The early work of the REVES group was stimulated by efforts to calculate  		population prevalence measures of disease and disability-free life expectancy  		(DFLE)--using procedures due to Sullivan (1966; 1971), the results of a WHO  		consultation held on the epidemiology of aging (WHO TRS 706), and early studies  		of chronic disability by Colvez and Blanchet (1983), Katz et al. (1983),  		Wilkins and Adams (1983), Robine et al. (1989), Bebbington (1988), Manton  		(1988), and Harris (1989), among others.</p>
<p>The advantage of relating life expectancy measures to the level of  		disability is that such "active" life expectancy measures integrate the  		population effects of disability at all ages past some index age. This tends to  		make the measures statistically more stable by utilizing data across multiple  		age categories - rather than examining rates within individual age categories.  		Also, by summarizing disability experience with a life-expectancy-based  		measure, the number of statistics that have to be examined to make  		cross-population comparisons is greatly reduced. Additionally, the integration  		of life expectancy and disability measures combines quantitative and  		qualitative measures of health and life span. The initial studies of DFLE had  		the limitation, however, that the Sullivan index was constructed from  		prevalence estimates of disability from sample surveys and the estimates of  		life expectancy from period life tables. As such, the classic Sullivan measures  		did not reflect the effects on population estimates of disability related to  		cohorts, returns to functioning, or selective mortality (Manton and Land,  		1998).</p>
<p>Over time, the annual meetings held by the REVES group (often with the  		input and coordination of J.M. Robine of France's INSERM) have placed  		increasing emphasis on comparable data collection strategies, methods to  		measure disability in a comparable fashion across countries, and on methods to  		make dynamic calculations of active life expectancy from nationally  		representative longitudinal data.</p>

</tr></table><p>An alternative effort to make cross-national estimates of the burden of  		disease and disability on populations has been conducted by the Global Burden  		of Disease (GBD) Group - a joint Harvard, WHO and World Bank effort (e.g.,  		Murray and Lopez, 1996). The GBD effort differs from REVES in focusing more  		attention on the use of vital statistics data, and the use of demographic  		modeling techniques, to make comprehensive global and regional analyses of the  		burden of disease and disability. The burden of disease in these studies was  		defined by disability-adjusted life years (DALY). The DALYs were created using  		a subjective expert panel elicitation procedure to develop weights indicating  		the degree of dysfunction associated with specific diseases (van Ginneken,  		1994). The prevalence of these diseases was then estimated for all the  		countries of the world and the global and regional burden associated with  		specific diseases calculated. However, concern has been raised by the WHO  		Medical Advisory Council as well as other researchers about the subjective  		nature of the DALY. (Similar concerns have been raised about the  		quality-adjusted life year (QALY) concepts.)</p>
<p>A final, ongoing effort is housed at WHO headquarters in Geneva,  		Switzerland where micro-data from a number of countries is being used to  		analyze the use of home health services to deal with the functional limitations  		of elderly persons. In that study (directed by J.E. Dowd) use is made of  		multivariate procedures to deal with some of the disability measurement  		problems.</p>
<p>Of these three efforts, the REVES initiative is furthest along. But even  		REVES is a considerable way from being able to produce estimates that are even  		plausibly comparable across countries. The problem is illustrated in  		<a href="international-evidence-disability-trends-among-elderly.html#TABLE1">Table 1</a>, which shows estimates of independent or active  		life expectancy at age 65 for a select set of developed and developing  		countries (WHO, 1997).</p>

</tr></table><p>Clearly, very different measures and methods were used to define  		disability status in these different countries. For example, the 12.4 years  		expected to be active of the 12.6 years of total life expectancy (98.4%) for  		males aged 65 in Thailand in 1989 is not likely comparable to the 2.5 years  		expected to be active of the 13.4 years (18.7%) expected to be lived at age 65  		in Finland in 1986. Thus, unless one is extremely careful in selecting  		countries and reviewing data collection methods, and the variety of definitions  		of chronic disability used, the cross-national comparison of disability levels  		is of little analytic or policy value.</p>
<p>Even when comparisons are restricted to those developed countries with  		relatively good data, comparing chronic disability prevalence rates across  		countries is still hazardous due to construct differences, as illustrated by  		<a href="international-evidence-disability-trends-among-elderly.html#TABLE2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the cross-national variation in the proportion of male and  		female disability free life expectancy (e.g., for females 90.5% in Japan in  		1985 to 35.3% in Spain in 1986) is still too extreme to allow us to be  		confident about their comparability and content validity.</p>
<p>An examination of the surveys in the different countries confirms that  		the calculations are based on disability measures that are often substantially  		different. For example, many countries used the International Classification of  		Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (i.e., the ICIDH; WHO, 1980)  		publication to define disability concepts and measures. However, in the ICIDH  		classification system there are actually three concepts used, impairments  		(which are the physical problems generating activity limitations, e.g.,  		blindness), disability, and handicaps (which tend to be social in nature, e.g.,  		inability to go to church). Different countries have made different choices  		among these concepts in their disability, health, and labor force surveys to  		define "disability" in their elderly populations. Likewise, the concept  		measured in surveys is often healthy life expectancy (i.e., free of morbidity)  		rather than active life expectancy. And there are very different periods of  		time during which the impairment or disability must last (if chronicity is used  		at all in defining the disability measure). Until these fundamental  		definitional issues are addressed, it is not much use to examine other analytic  		issues that affect the accuracy of reporting survey mode (e.g., in person vs.  		telephone administration) or whether specific types of institutions were  		included in the survey sample frame.</p>
<h3>3.2. Selected Country Findings</h3>
<p>Since cross-national comparisons of disability prevalence rate levels do  		not seem feasible except in a very few cases, it may be worth examining changes  		within a country to determine at least the direction and rate of change in a  		common culture with an internally comparable set of data. We do this for a  		select group of studies where there is some longitudinal perspective available  		in a developed country, where data quality is relatively good, and where the  		data collection methods are reasonably well defined. Consistency within a  		country sometimes requires focusing only on the most recent data, in order for  		the disability time series to be internally consistent. Canadian data, for  		example, which is not in any case directly comparable with U.S. data, is only  		methodologically and measurement consistent beginning with the HALS of  		1986.</p>
<p><b><i>France</i></b></p>
<p>The country with perhaps the highest quality longitudinal data on  		chronic disability in the elderly population other than the United States is  		France. There are two major French longitudinal disability surveys of  		relevance. The first French longitudinal study was composed of three regional  		pilot surveys started in 1978 and followed up after 3.5 and 6.2 years. The  		three French regions represented Upper Normandy, Lille and Ile-de-France -  		areas with very distinct social and economic characteristics. These data were  		used to make estimates of DFLE for which longitudinal changes in the functional  		status of individuals could be explicitly represented in life table  		calculations (Brouard and Robine, 1992). The second French study was of changes  		in chronic disability from 1981 to 1991 using nationally representative  		longitudinal disability surveys. A summary of results taken from Robine (1994)  		is presented in <a href="international-evidence-disability-trends-among-elderly.html#TABLE3">Table 3</a>. DFLE increased significantly at  		birth for both males and females in France from 1981 to 1991. For the French  		elderly population (i.e., persons aged 65+), we see sizable increases in DFLE,  		both absolutely and relatively, for both males and females.</p>

</tr></table><p>Robine et al. (1998) have recently estimated models of disability and  		morbidity to assess whether declines in disability are due to delayed onset of  		morbidity or improved management of potentially disabling conditions once they  		exist. They find that the prevalence of potentially disabling conditions rose  		significantly between 1980 and 1991, but that the propensity of those with the  		conditions to report themselves disabled fell. Combined with their previous  		findings of falling disability prevalence between 1980 and 1991, these findings  		suggest the possibility that the treatment or management of diseases has  		improved, or that rates of rehabilitation have increased. However, it is also  		possible that observed trends in condition prevalence reflect only increasing  		awareness of morbidity rather than real increases in morbidity and that these  		increased self-reports are concentrated among the less-severely impaired.</p>
<p><b><i>Belgium (Van Oyen and Roelands, 1994)</i></b></p>
<p>Three disability surveys were done in Belgium: in 1980 (the KUL Survey),  		1984 (the CBGS Survey), and in 1989 (the RUG Survey). Only the 1980 and 1989  		surveys have comparable disability measures in that a person was classified as  		disabled only if they could not do an activity without help. The 1984 CBGS  		Survey produced very different prevalence estimates (much higher) since a  		person was classified as disabled if the person had "trouble" doing the  		specific activity.</p>
<p>In <a href="international-evidence-disability-trends-among-elderly.html#TABLE5">Table 5</a> we present life expectancy,  		disability-free life expectancy (DFLE), and life expectancy with disability at  		age 65 by sex for the Flemish region of Belgium for their 1980 and 1989  		disability surveys.</p>
<p>In Belgium, there is an absolute and relative increase in DFLE for both  		males and females from 1980 to 1989. The relative increase for males was modest  		(i.e., +1.0%; but an absolute increase in DFLE of 1.8 years). The increases in  		DFLE for Belgian females were larger than those in France 1981-1991 (i.e., 9%  		vs. 6.6%).</p>

<h3>4.1. What Analyses of Existing Data can Inform Planning  		and Policy</h3>
<p>The most convincing evidence about trends in disability will come as  		more measures from more surveys are analyzed to yield independent replications  		that are robust to method differences. As many have argued, disability is a  		multi-dimensional concept that no single measure will capture completely.  		Different dimensions will be important for answering different policy questions  		(e.g. Manton et al., 1994; 1998). Thus there is value in continuing to conduct  		statistical analyses of existing data sets to get a more complete view of  		trends in health and disability status to aid policy development. Several areas  		of work are relevant.</p>
<p><i><b>Replications with additional data sources</b></i>. Further  		cross-survey checks using comparable populations can be used to validate  		existing findings and address areas of remaining disagreement in the field. For  		example, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey contains basic measures of  		disability (IADL, ADL, Institutionalization) as well as physical functional  		limitation. Data are available for the 1991- 1996 rounds of the MCBS.</p>
<p>As more waves of the AHEAD data become available, we will have further  		evidence for the late 1990s. Unfortunately, however, the form of the ADL and  		IADL questions changed between the baseline survey (1993) and the first  		follow-up (1995). In future waves, these disability questions are planned to be  		consistent with those in the HRS. Thus, it will still be some time until  		longitudinal estimates are available for the AHEAD survey.</p>
<p><i><b>Trends in sub-groups</b></i>. It would also be useful to know if  		trends in disability differ across subgroups of the population. The purpose of  		subgroup analysis is two-fold. First, similar findings on sub-group trends  		across surveys would further validate findings for the entire population.  		Second, since dramatic changes are predicted in the demographic and  		socioeconomic make-up of the elderly population over the next several decades,  		knowing how levels and trends differ among those groups is important. For  		example, one could decompose changes in disability rates between two surveys  		into changes due to demographic shifts (i.e., education, age, sex, ethnicity)  		and changes in group-specific rates of disability/limitation. These analyses  		will be potentially useful in predicting future trends since forecasting  		demographic composition is one of the most straightforward (i.e., stable)  		projections that can be made. This would complement similar analyses performed  		using the SIPP (Freedman and Martin, 1997b) and the NLTCS (Manton, Stallard,  		and Corder, 1997b; Manton, Stallard, and Corder, 1997a).</p>
<p><i><b>Reconciling findings and identifying differences that  		remain</b></i>. Several analyses can help to reconcile findings across surveys.  		For example, to compare findings with those from the NHIS, SOA I &amp; II, and  		SIPP, we could limit the MCBS and NLTCS to the non-institutional population --  		bearing in mind that such sample limitations inevitably limit the usefulness of  		the estimates. Second, further analyses may also be able to identify the causes  		of disability trends. Using the MCBS, for example, will permit analysts to  		relate physical functional limitation items to IADL and ADL disability status.  		This will promote better understanding of the relationship between these  		variables and the extent to which disability trends are driven by physical  		health problems (i.e., limitations in upper body and lower body function) that  		are relatively independent of environmental factors. The findings of Freedman  		and Martin (1997a) suggest that disability declines in the late 1980s and early  		1990s are not solely related to environmental factors, but the suggested  		analysis would serve as a more direct test. In addition, these analyses could  		be compared with multivariate analyses of performance and disability measures  		on the NLTCS (Manton et al 1998b).</p>
<p><i><b>Analyses of the relationship between health and Medicare  		costs</b></i>. Analyses that will be of direct use to policy and planning  		activities are those that relate health and disability status to health care  		spending, using links to longitudinal Medicare claims data. One approach would  		model trends in Medicare spending (overall and by type of service) as a  		function of disability trends and other forces. This could suggest the  		magnitude of an effect changes in disability status might have on future  		spending projections for the U.S. Medicare program. Another would use links to  		Medicare administrative and service use data to examine the potential role of  		increased health service utilization in lowering rates of disability. One such  		analysis could link improvements in vision-related disability to the increased  		utilization of cataract surgery. As of 1991, between 20 and 25 percent of  		Medicare beneficiaries have had this surgery. The extent to which this  		intervention delays the onset of disability and prolongs independence is of  		obvious policy interest for Medicare. The MCBS and NLTCS, which is linked to  		Medicare claims data, are two obvious sources of information on surgical and  		medical procedures performed, as well as on medical costs associated with  		subsequent disability (and, thus, the potential savings a particular  		intervention might achieve).</p>
<p><i><b>Dynamic structural models of disability</b></i>. If we model  		disability rates (e.g., IADL or ADL disability) as a function of underlying  		physical function limitations (e.g., difficulty lifting 10 lbs.), as well as  		demographic and environmental variables, we can decompose changes in disability  		into changes in the prevalence of functional limits, changes in the extent to  		which limitations lead to disability, changes in demographic composition, and  		changes in group-specific disability rates. Similar to the approach taken by  		Robine, et al. (1998), multivariate analysis can be used to assess the extent  		to which changes in limitation rates have led to changes in disability, and the  		extent to which the link between limitations and disability has changed over  		time. For example, if disability has declined because of the increased  		availability of personal care help, or assistive mechanical devices, we would  		expect to see changes in the relation between limitations and disability  		(Manton et al., 1993). This would give an indication of the extent to which  		disability has been reduced (and might be further reduced) by direct  		interventions after the onset of physical impairment. A related analysis would  		be to compare trends using different constructions of disability measures from  		the same survey (i.e., measures that include the use of help or assistive  		devices versus measures that do not).</p>
<h3>4.2. Necessary New Data Collection in the United  		States</h3>
<p>A reason to continue existing data collection efforts is to develop more  		stable and precise estimates of trends - and to identify change in those  		trends. A continuation of existing surveys, with only necessary changes in  		sample design, instrument content, and field methodology will help minimize the  		effects of measurement artifact and short term "shocks" on the assessment of  		disability trends. For example, changes in the design of SOA-I and SOA-II make  		any inferences about changes in disability using those surveys very complex.  		While the SOA-II interviews were conducted with the NHIS interviews, the SOA-II  		interviews were conducted after the NHIS - over a period of up to 29  		months.</p>
<p>Future waves of the Health and Retirement Survey/AHEAD will provide rich  		information on the health, care-giving arrangements and economic status of the  		population over 50 and will include linked data from the Medicare and Social  		Security programs. The study is longitudinal in design and will replenish as  		new cohorts age into the target population and will add cohorts to fill in  		between the original HRS (ages 51-61 in 1992) and AHEAD (age 70+ in 1993)  		cohorts. Assuming that disability measures are consistently gathered in the  		future, this study has the potential to contribute to policy discussions about  		population aging.</p>
<h3>4.3. Data Collection Efforts Outside the United  		States</h3>
<p>Nationally representative longitudinal surveys of disability in elderly  		populations outside the U.S. are sorely lacking. Conducting such surveys with  		designs that are broadly similar to one another would allow analysts to gain  		some real understanding of cross-national differences in disability rates and  		trends and also to see how disability trends are affected by different  		socio-economic, cultural and medical conditions.</p>
<p>For such cross-sectional comparisons to be valid, consistency across  		surveys in design factors is important. For comparisons with US trends derived  		from the NLTCS, for example, we argue that certain fundamental design factors  		are essential:</p>
<p>Using samples of individuals from administrative lists of elderly  		persons. This would ensure that (i) the rate of follow-up of individuals would  		be high due to the use of a list sample, and (ii) that persons in all types of  		community and institutional residence would be followed.</p>
<p>Asking about ADL, IADL and physical performance measures separately. All  		measures should also include a criterion for chronicity (e.g. 90+ days) and an  		assessment of the modes of acute and LTC services used to address those  		needs.</p>
<p>Following all persons in the sample over time. This is so that  		disability improvements as well as documents can be assessed. In certain cases  		a screening survey will be the most cost-effective design, in which case  		persons who are disabled and receive a detailed interview must continue to  		receive that interview and persons who screen out as nondisabled must be  		rescreened for chronic disability in later surveys.</p>
<ul><li>Ensuring cross-sectional, as well as longitudinal, national  		  representation. This requires that a replenishment sample of persons "aging in"  		  be drawn from the primary list sample sources.</li>
<li>Permitting varying periodicity (time between surveys) so long as the  		  period can be collapsed or grouped for cross-national trend comparison. For  		  example, if one is interested in short term individual changes in disability  		  the appropriate sample interval might be one year. If shifts in the population  		  distribution of disability are of greater concern then a longer interval (e.g.  		  five years) is acceptable and more cost effective.</li>
<li>Linking survey records to administrative data on health services used  		  and mortality.</li>
<li>Keeping interviews relatively short. Duration should be 15 minutes or  		  less for screens, and 50 minutes or less for detailed interviews of disabled or  		  institutionalized persons. For disabled elderly persons an in-person interview  		  is necessary given the potential effects of disabilities on responses.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion">5. CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>There have recently been moderate to large declines in chronic  		disability in the elderly in many countries. In countries where no decline has  		been observed there is little consistent recent evidence of chronic disability  		increases after adjusting for population age composition and trends in the rate  		of institutionalization.</p>
<p>With respect to the future, we recommend that national longitudinal  		surveys of similar sample design and instrumentation be done in a number of  		developed countries. Such an approach will yield valid cross-national  		comparisons of change in chronic disability in the elderly population. Such  		cross-national comparisons can help both in the design of new policies and in  		monitoring differential effects of disability on the national economics of  		major developed countries. Such studies could be of particular value in regions  		where market integration is being implemented, e.g., what effect would these  		differences have in the European Union; in trade zones in the Americas.</p>
