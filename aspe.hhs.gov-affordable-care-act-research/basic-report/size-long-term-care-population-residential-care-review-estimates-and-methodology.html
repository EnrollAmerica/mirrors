<p>In recent years, a number of trends in care for those with a disability,  		particularly the elderly, point to a shift from nursing homes to other care  		settings. States, which determine Medicaid eligibility and benefits, have  		devoted resources to community-based care to contain nursing home spending and  		to address the preference of beneficiaries for noninstitutional alternatives.  		Since the 1990s, there also has been independent growth of residential care  		alternatives serving primarily an older private pay clientele, as a supportive  		environment for those no longer able or willing to perform activities needed  		for independent living at home.</p>
<p>A result of this movement toward alternatives to care at home and to  		traditional institutional settings has been a blurring of the demarcation  		between private households and residential care places and between  		noninstitutional and institutional settings. This blurring has made it less  		likely that survey data with samples based on historical concepts of housing  		units and group quarters deriving from definitions used in the Decennial Census  		fully represent the populations of interest for studies of persons with  		disability. The result is increased uncertainty about where the disabled are  		receiving care, the size of the population in various accommodative settings,  		and the characteristics of those receiving care in these settings. This type of  		information is critical to the ability to quantify this vulnerable population  		and to monitor care arrangements and quality both for public policy purposes  		and for consumer information.</p>
<p>This report is part of a project that will attempt to better understand  		the source of differences in estimates of the older population in residential  		care by analyzing key national surveys. It presents results of a review of  		existing estimates of the number of alternative residential care settings and  		nursing homes and the number of persons residing in them. It has three  		aims:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>To describe the data that have been used in recent years to generate  			 estimates and summarize the range of existing estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To identify methodological issues that contribute to differences  			 among estimates, focusing on those that can be investigated using available  			 national surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To identify surveys that appear to offer the best opportunity for  			 analysis to provide a better understanding of the size and characteristics of  			 the residential care population and insights into how collection of data on  			 residential care settings can be improved.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Alternative residential care settings encompass a variety of places and  		care arrangements that provide both housing and services outside of a nursing  		facility for those who are unable or unwilling to live independently. Beyond  		that very broad description, there appears to be no consensus on criteria for  		identifying or distinguishing between these settings. They include such places  		as small foster care homes, board and care or personal care homes, congregate  		housing, and assisted living facilities. In the past decade, state licensing  		practices have changed to keep pace with an evolving residential care industry,  		but these changes have done little to bring consistency to terminology or  		criteria for alternative residential care settings. Changes in state licensing  		may also have affected nursing home estimates, although certification under  		Medicare provides a more clear cut foundation for identifying nursing  		homes.</p>
<p>Lack of consistent definitions and differences in methodology used by  		the Decennial Census and other national surveys to classify and identify  		settings affect whether alternative residential settings are captured well or  		at all in surveys that target either the noninstitutional or institutional  		population, but not both, and reduce the comparability of estimates across  		surveys that represent both populations. For example, methodology used in the  		2000 Census classifies assisted living and congregate care in the broad  		category of housing units, so that no Census estimate of such settings can be  		made.</p>
<p>Sources of estimates we examined fall into three general categories:</p>
<ul><li>private provider-based data from industry, association, or other  		  sources;</li>
<li>provider-based estimates from public sources; and</li>
<li>individual- or household-level survey data, including data from the  		  Decennial Census.</li>
</ul><h3>Range of Existing Estimates</h3>
<p>For nursing homes, despite differences in methodology, there was greater  		consistency in estimates of both the number of facilities (15,000 to 18,000 in  		all years) and the number of older residents (1.2 million to 1.56 million) than  		in estimates for residential care alternatives. The estimates appear to show a  		mild upward trend in the number of nursing homes prior to 1997 and a mild  		downward trend thereafter. The trend for residents appears to have been  		slightly downward in the late 1990s but lack of consistent published estimates  		makes the trend since then unclear.</p>
<p>For residential care alternatives, estimates suggest a stronger upward  		trend throughout our period of observation, but the range of estimates for both  		the number of places and the number of residents is greater than for nursing  		homes and residents. Differences between estimates of the number of alternative  		residential care settings ranged from 14,000 to nearly 40,000, depending on the  		year. Estimates of the number of residents also differed to a greater degree  		than for nursing homes, but the most recent estimates, which allow  		identification of both community and institutional or facility settings,  		suggest a population in these alternative settings on the order of 800,000.</p>
<h3>Key Methodological Issues </h3>
<p>In our review we identified five key methodological issues contributing  		to differences across estimates that are most amenable to empirical  		investigation using existing surveys: </p>
<ul><li>age of the population examined (i.e., all persons versus persons age  		  65 or older);</li>
<li>method used to assigning individuals to the facility or  		  institutional population (and conversely, the community  		  or noninstitutional population);</li>
<li>method used to identifying nursing homes (e.g., self-identification,  		  certification); </li>
<li>method used to identifying type of alternative residential care (e.g.  		  named type or services offered); and </li>
<li>sample representation and weighting (e.g. cross-section or annual  		  users).</li>
</ul><h3>Data Sources for Analysis</h3>
<p>The key features of data best suited for analysis of these five issues  		are the following:</p>
<ul><li>population representation, so that all elements of the population of  		  interest--older persons with disabilities--are represented;</li>
<li>the ability to determine how settings in which individuals reside are  		  identified;</li>
<li>the ability to apply different criteria more similar to those used in  		  comparison surveys; and </li>
<li>extensive documentation of survey methods.</li>
</ul><p>Four national surveys are recent and meet all or most of these criteria:  		The 1999 National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), the 2002 Medicare Current  		Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) Access to Care file, the 2002 MCBS Cost and Use file,  		and the 2002 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS)/Assets and Health of the Oldest  		Old (AHEAD).</p>
<p>The first three surveys, the NLTCS and the two MCBS files, meet all  		criteria. They are population-based surveys that either are or can be limited  		to the Medicare population age 65 or older, and data elements are available  		that allow some potential for investigating more consistent alternate  		definitions of residential care. All identify residential care by named type of  		setting and identify services provided for some or all of those identified as  		living in residential care. In addition, comparisons across the three surveys  		offer information about the importance of sample representation because they  		represent, respectively, a cross-section of the Medicare elderly, those always  		enrolled during the survey year, and those ever enrolled during the survey  		year. </p>
<p>The HRS/AHEAD, which is a community survey, meets all criteria except  		full population coverage. A strength of the HRS/AHEAD is that, unlike the other  		three surveys, it does not rely on named types of settings, but rather screens  		all persons not in traditional freestanding households for services available  		and received. Comparison of estimates from the HRS/AHEAD with those from the  		surveys representing the full population also has may shed light on the  		implications of Census-based rules for identifying the excluded institutional  		population for residential care estimates.</p>
<p>All four surveys contain detailed information about the characteristics  		and particularly the disability of respondents. This detailed information  		provides the opportunity to understand what subpopulations are being served by  		different types of residential care, as well as confirming whether different  		methods of identifying residential settings are capturing similar populations.  		</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In recent years, a number of trends in care for those with a disability,  		particularly the elderly, point to a shift from nursing homes to other care  		settings. With the introduction of Medicaid funding in 1965, nursing homes and  		related facilities became the most common institutional settings for persons  		with disabilities, primarily because of eligibility rules and benefit packages  		skewed toward institutional care. More recently, however, states, which  		determine Medicaid eligibility and benefits, have devoted resources to  		community-based care for several reasons. Perhaps the most compelling is a  		desire to contain nursing home spending. States, however, also are attempting  		to address the preference of beneficiaries for noninstitutional alternatives.  		In 1999, the Olmstead Decision, which mandates that reasonable alternative  		accommodations be available to prevent institutionalization of those who prefer  		other settings, added impetus to state efforts (Fox-Grage, Folkemer, and Lewis  		2003; Rosenbaum 2000). Since the 1990s, there also has been independent growth  		of residential care alternatives serving primarily an older private pay  		clientele, as a supportive environment for those no longer able or willing to  		perform activities needed for independent living at home. </p>
<p>A result of this movement toward alternatives to care at home and to  		traditional institutional settings has been a blurring of the demarcation  		between private households and residential care places and between  		noninstitutional and institutional settings. For instance, some settings,  		notably assisted living and other senior housing where residents may occupy a  		private apartment even though they receive or have access to supportive  		services, may be difficult to distinguish from any other private residence.  		</p>
<p>This blurring has made it less likely that surveys with samples based on  		historical concepts of housing units and group quarters deriving from  		definitions used in the Decennial Census fully represent the populations of  		interest for studies of those with disability. In addition, even within surveys  		that represent the full population, representation of formerly unconventional  		settings may be small, and differences in how the different types of  		residential settings are identified may lead to different conclusions about the  		size of the population in residential care as well as its characteristics. The  		result is increased uncertainty about where the disabled are receiving care,  		the size of the population in various accommodative settings, and the  		characteristics of those receiving care in these settings. This type of  		information is critical to the ability to quantify this vulnerable population  		and to monitor care arrangements and quality both for public policy purposes  		and for consumer information. </p>
<p>This report is part of a project that will attempt to better understand  		the source of differences in estimates of the older population in residential  		care by analyzing key national surveys. In it we present results of a review of  		existing estimates of the number of residential care settings, generally  		divided into nursing homes and alternative residential care settings, and the  		number of persons residing in them. The review has three purposes. First, we  		describe the data that have been used to generate estimates and summarize the  		range of estimates. Second, we identify methodological issues that contribute  		to differences among estimates, focusing on those that can be investigated  		using available national surveys. Finally, we identify four surveys that appear  		to offer the best opportunity to conduct such an investigation and to provide a  		better understanding of the size and characteristics of the residential care  		population and insights into how collection of data on residential care  		settings can be improved. </p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>Before the 1990s, the line between the community and institutional  		populations and between housing units and long term care settings was  		relatively simple to define in the Census and in other surveys. Gray areas of  		supportive residential settings that might be inadequately covered by either  		household and person-based surveys or nursing facility surveys could reasonably  		be assumed to be small enough to ignore and, in fact, too small to measure well  		or analyze. Only in the last 5 years or so have national data collection  		efforts made more purposeful attempts to adjust to growth in the number and  		variety of long term care settings and the potential gap between the  		traditionally defined community and institutional settings. </p>
<p>This adjustment has been primarily the addition of data elements in an  		attempt to define residential settings more carefully in surveys of the older  		population, for whom these settings are most common. These efforts are  		complicated, however, by a lack of consensus on quantifiable characteristics of  		such settings that would allow them to be identified operationally and by  		difficulty in assuring adequate coverage and representation in survey samples.  		For example, oversampling to improve the precision of estimates requires the  		ability to set criteria for identifying the population to be oversampled. To  		date no frame of such places exists, although a project is underway, sponsored  		jointly by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the Agency for  		Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Department of Health and Human  		Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE),  		to develop a provider Inventory of Long-Term Care Residential Places that would  		complement the provider frame used for the National Nursing Home Surveys  		(NNHS). </p>
<h3>What Are Alternative Residential Settings?</h3>
<p>Alternative residential care settings encompass a variety of places and  		care arrangements that provide both housing and services outside of a nursing  		facility for those who are unable or unwilling to live independently. Hallmark  		services generally include assistance with independent living activities such  		as meals and housekeeping (instrumental activities of daily living or IADLs)  		and personal care activities, such as bathing and dressing (activities of daily  		living or ADLs). Beyond that very broad description, there appears to be no  		consensus on criteria for identifying or distinguishing between these settings.  		They include such places as small foster care homes, board and care or personal  		care homes, congregate housing, and assisted living facilities. Which settings  		are included in an estimate and what labels are placed upon them often depends  		on the purpose of the estimate. For example, the intent may be to identify all  		places where a vulnerable population receives care, to define settings for  		state licensure, or to develop a marketing approach for senior housing, each of  		which may result in a different set of inclusion criteria. </p>
<p>Both "board and care" and "assisted living," have been used both  		popularly and in state licensure to refer to a range of settings from small  		supervised homes serving a largely Medicaid clientele in private or shared  		rooms to large luxury facilities serving a well-to-do private pay clientele in  		private apartments. Assisted living appears to have become the more popular  		terminology, supplanting board and care as a blanket term for alternative  		residential care. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, some, including the assisted living industry and its trade  		associations, believe that the term should be reserved for settings adhering to  		a specific model with a consumer-centered philosophy that emphasizes  		independence, dignity, privacy, decision-making, and autonomy (Mollica 2002).  		In 2001, the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging formed the Assisted Living  		Workgroup (ALW), to consider specific criteria for facilities representing the  		assisted living model. The ALW defined assisted living as facilities that  		provide 24-hour supervision, provision and oversight of personal and supportive  		services, health related services, social services, recreational activities,  		meals, housekeeping and laundry, and transportation services (Han, Sirrocco,  		and Remsburg 2003). </p>
<p>In the past decade, state licensing practices have changed to keep pace  		with an evolving industry, but these changes have done little to bring  		consistency to terminology or criteria for alternative residential care  		settings. The number of states with a licensing category or statute using the  		term "assisted living" has grown in the past few years, from 19 states in 1994  		(Mollica 1995) to 32 states and the District of Columbia in 2002 (Mollica  		2002), but the facilities so designated vary from state to state. Some states  		have chosen to adopt "assisted living" as a distinct category of residential  		setting, while others have chosen to consolidate disparate categories under a  		general set of "assisted living" rules that include a range of settings such as  		board and care, elderly residential housing, congregate housing, adult foster  		care, in addition to assisted living facilities (Mollica 2002). For example,  		the District of Columbia added "assisted living" as a new category in addition  		to the existing category of "community residence facility" (Mollica 2002), and  		Arkansas established a separate licensing and regulation process for assisted  		living, allowing facilities previously licensed as residential care facilities  		to either retain their residential care licenses or become licensed as assisted  		living (Devore and Tanner 2003). Colorado and Texas adopted assisted living as  		a broad licensing category that includes personal care homes (Mollica 2002).  		</p>
<p>As mentioned, the most comprehensive effort to date to identify criteria  		that would allow construction of a comprehensive provider frame for long term  		care settings is the Inventory of Long-Term Care Residential Places project  		(Han, Sirrocco, and Remsburg 2003). The project collected current state  		regulations on licensed long-term care residential places, which were used to  		develop a typology of licensed residential settings that house older adults and  		provide assisted living services as defined by ALW. The typology consists of  		five categories (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#table1">Table 1</a>) ranging from small group homes  		to continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), based on the type and number  		of residents served, the types of settings/living arrangements (e.g., shared  		rooms, private apartments), the types of services and care provided (e.g.,  		personal care or limited nursing), meal preparation and arrangement (e.g.,  		kitchenette in quarters or congregate meals), resident ratio per bath and  		toilet, free or restricted ability to leave the facility, and whether a  		facility was freestanding. The typology excludes nursing homes, hospitals,  		facilities for the mentally ill, mentally retarded or developmentally disabled  		(MR/DD), military housing, federally subsidized housing, senior citizen  		cooperatives, naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs), commercial  		retirement communities, and other independent living places (Han, Sirrocco, and  		Remsburg 2003). </p>

</tr></table><p>A comparison of facility types identified from regulations in the 50  		states and the District of Columbia and matching categories in the typology  		shows a wide variation in naming conventions for similar facilities (Han,  		Sirrocco, and Remsburg 2003). For example, Category 3 in the typology is  		typically labeled as assisted living facilities with apartment units, and  		includes freestanding facilities with private apartments including baths and  		kitchenettes, direct access from the outside or through a common hall and  		serving a primarily frail older population. A sampling of the state  		designations of these settings indicates a variety of different terms for this  		category of facility, including residential care facilities, personal care  		homes, housing with services establishments, and congregate housing services  		programs. In 22 states, small boarding homes (the typology's Category 1) would  		be included in the same designation as Category 3 assisted living facilities,  		and although 42 states licensed the type of facilities in Category 3, only  		about half of those used the term "assisted living." All 51 jurisdictions  		licensed some type of facilities, but only 34 of the 51 licensed Category 1  		small boarding homes, and only 29 licensed Category 2, described as board and  		care facilities or large group homes, characterized by dorm or ward-style  		rooms, and shared bathroom facilities. Thus, although it may represent the best  		single source for building a complete and consistent frame of long-term care  		places, even state licensure does not provide comprehensive identification of  		relevant settings. </p>
<p>Changes over time in state licensure also may affect the comparability  		of estimates even within established provider sample frames. Rhoades (2000)  		notes that as states expanded licensing of community residential alternatives  		in the 1990s, some state licensed nursing and related care homes that were not  		Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing facilities moved to the new licensing  		categories. Rhoades argues that this was responsible in part for a reduced rate  		of nursing home use found in the 1995 NNHS. Because the NNHS relies on a  		provider frame built in part from state licensing lists, its estimates are  		sensitive to licensing changes that simply reclassified residents and beds in  		these facilities to community residential care categories. Although each of the  		five categories of residential care settings described in the typology project  		is defined as providing non-medical supportive services, facilities in each  		category also may provide some skilled nursing, although not 24-hour nursing  		care. </p>
<h3>Sampling and Survey Coverage</h3>
<p>Lack of a consistent definition and difficulties in discriminating  		between settings affect whether alternative residential settings are captured  		well or at all in surveys that target either the noninstitutional or  		institutional population, but not both. Very similar residential care settings  		may be found in either population. Some residential care facilities,  		particularly facilities with private apartments as in Category 3 of the  		typology, may be difficult to distinguish from private housing units. In fact,  		such settings are likely to meet the criteria used in the Decennial Census for  		a housing unit as opposed to some form of group quarters. Methodology reports  		from the Census, which provides the definition of the noninstitutional  		population used to identify the universe for sampling in major national  		surveys, document difficulties in the 2000 Census in delineating between  		different types of group settings and housing units and duplication of persons  		counted in both settings (Abramson 2003). </p>
<p>Surveys of the noninstitutional population, such as the National Health  		Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household  		Component (MEPS-HC), include noninstitutional group settings, but their  		relative rarity and factors such as differences in how surveys determine  		whether a setting is in scope or out of scope may result in incomparability  		across nominally similar survey samples. Such differences may have  		inconsequential impacts on the general representativeness of the samples but  		large impacts on representation of alternative residential settings. </p>
<p>Surveys based on a frame of providers, such as the National Nursing Home  		Surveys (NNHS) and the MEPS Nursing Home Component (MEPS-NHC), include both  		settings certified as nursing facilities by the Medicaid or Medicare programs  		and those licensed by states as nursing homes. However, while certification is  		a relatively stable definition, as discussed, there is wide variation across  		states in licensing practices and definitions, and these definitions have  		changed over time as states have added licensing categories covering  		alternative residential care settings. Such factors and changes in or  		correction of survey frames may not only lead to different conclusions about  		the trend in the number of nursing homes and residents in the NNHS and the  		MEPS-NHC (Rhoades 2000), but also may contribute to apparent growth in  		alternative residential care. </p>
<h3>Identification of Residential Care</h3>
<p>The size and comparability of estimates also are affected by how well  		and how consistently the Decennial Census and surveys that cover the full  		population in all noninstitutional and institutional settings--and thus  		nominally have no gaps in coverage --identify alternative residential settings.  		Differences in definitions used to identify facility or institutional settings  		and differences in information collected to identify residential settings both  		may contribute to conflicting estimates of the population in supportive  		settings. For example, the Decennial Census includes both congregate care and  		assisted living facilities as housing units but does not identify them, so no  		estimate of these settings can be made from the Census. Nearly 2 million  		persons age 65 or older are in settings identified by the Census as group  		quarters, which are settings not considered housing units, 1.56 million in  		nursing homes, as defined by the Census, and another 420,000 in "other  		institutions" or "noninstitutional group quarters" (U.S. Census Bureau 2000).  		</p>
<p>Examining differences in data collection methods and their  		implementation in different surveys as well as approaches to identifying and  		categorizing living arrangements and long-term care service use also may help  		explain why estimates of the number of persons in certain residential settings  		vary widely even in population-based data. For example, based on the 1998  		Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), which identified alternative  		residential care only in places meeting that survey's criterion of a facility,  		about 417,000 persons age 65 or older lived in these settings (Spillman, Liu,  		and McGilliard 2002). The 1999 National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) attempted  		to identify such settings in both the community and institutional populations  		and found about 811,000 persons (Manton and Gu 2001). In addition, because  		there are no uniform naming conventions for alternative settings in the  		community, question structure and wording may affect estimates. For example,  		more general questions about the type of residence and services available may  		be more effective in locating all long term care settings than questions that  		identify settings by name, such as "assisted living," but also may lack  		information to distinguish between types of settings. </p>
<h2><a name="sources" id="sources">DATA SOURCES FOR EXISTING ESTIMATES</a></h2>
<p>We conducted a search for published estimates of the number of providers  		and residents in both alternative residential care settings and nursing homes  		to identify both the range of existing estimates and prospective data sources.  		We included estimates from various sources and estimates that include  		nonelderly as well as elderly residents, although data analysis in the next  		phase of this project will be limited to national surveys and to persons age 65  		or older. Sources of data we examined fall into three general categories:  		private provider-based data from industry, association, or other sources;  		provider-based estimates from public sources; and individual- or  		household-level survey data, including data from the Decennial Census. Details  		about all sources of data and estimates we examined are summarized in  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#table2">Table 2</a>. We did not include estimates for which we were  		unable to obtain sufficient technical documentation. </p>
<h3>Private Provider-Based Data</h3>
<p>Data in this category for the most part are produced for those in the  		industries involved, investors, marketers, or consumers. For example, the  		National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL) is part of the American Health Care  		Association (AHCA), a trade organization of for-profit and nonprofit long-term  		and related care providers. The National Investment Center for the Seniors  		Housing and Care Industry (NIC) serves developers and investors in senior  		housing. Firstmark, Inc., Billians Health Data Group, and InfoUSA collect  		contact information on a variety of entities, including health and long-term  		care providers, primarily for sale to marketers. CareScout is a private company  		that provides consumer information about "eldercare" and operates a network  		that offers discounts covering a variety of providers, including nursing homes,  		assisted living facilities, home care providers, and independent living  		"accommodations." Both the Firstmark and CareScout estimates used in this study  		were compiled from a report on existing sources of data on residential  		long-term care providers produced by Social and Scientific Systems (SSS) under  		contract to ASPE. Also included in this group is the congressionally mandated  		Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the  		21st Century, which relied on interpolations from private data for its  		estimates. </p>

</tr></table><p>For the most part, because of the purpose and type of data collected  		these sources provide estimates of facilities and sometimes numbers of "beds"  		or "units." Given the lack of consensus on the definition of "assisted living"  		and "supportive housing," it is difficult if not impossible to determine the  		exact definition of settings included in such estimates. Because the focus of  		those producing such estimates is generally on the most current information, it  		is often difficult to determine changes in methodology that may have occurred  		over time when entities have produced estimates for more than one year. Where  		estimates of residents are included, they are typically computed from occupancy  		rates collected or obtained from external sources or by using assumptions about  		the number of persons or beds per unit, so that they rely fundamentally on the  		number of facilities identified. In one case (NCAL) occupancy rates collected  		from an internally conducted survey were applied to a publicly funded estimate  		of the number of facilities. </p>
<p>Some estimates rely on interpolations using assumed growth rates and/or  		intervening estimates from other sources or statistical models to generate  		estimates over time. In the case of NIC, data produced by ProMatura, a private  		research firm, was based on a purposeful sample of 102 counties. Regression  		techniques and mathematical modeling were used to produce a national estimate  		of facilities. The Commission on Affordable Housing used this projection, plus  		"indicators" of occupancy rates from the NIC study, and assumptions about  		occupancy rates, persons per unit, and the proportion of residents who were age  		65 or older, so that it appears to contain no independent estimates. </p>
<p>The data included in this category generally are intended to capture  		places serving an older population. However, because they are provider-based  		and use different ages to define "older," the population coverage is not  		well-defined. </p>
<h3>Provider-Based Data from Public Sources</h3>
<p>These data include studies that were either publicly funded or conducted  		data collections from the provider perspective or funded by private nonprofit  		organizations not related to the industries involved. They include surveys of  		state licensing agency lists, data collected and maintained by the Centers for  		Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for administrative purposes, and survey  		data that draw from provider frames. </p>
<p>Mollica (2002) and Harrington (Harrington, Swan, and Wellin 1999)  		collected data from state licensing agencies for their estimates of residential  		care settings. As discussed, variation in state terminology and licensing  		categories, as well as the number of agencies with licensing responsibility  		contribute uncertainty about the population served and types of facilities  		included in the estimates. Mollica produced an initial 1998 estimate for ASPE  		and two subsequent updates funded by the National Academy of State Health  		Policy. The intent was to capture all residential care facilities serving an  		elderly or disabled population in need of supportive services, regardless of  		the age of the clientele. Facilities serving primarily a MR/DD population were  		not included. Harrington's work was funded by CMS and the U.S. Department of  		Housing and Urban Development. Separate estimates were made for facilities  		licensed as nursing homes and those licensed as residential care facilities for  		the aged and/or adults and nursing facilities. Whether MR/DD facilities are in  		a given state's estimate depends on what the state chose to include them in  		that category (Harrington, personal communication). A third estimate of  		alternative residential care settings based on state provider lists was  		produced by SSS as part of the inter-agency project to develop a comprehensive  		frame of "long-term care residential places." </p>
<p>The Online Survey, Certification and Reporting System (OSCAR) is an  		administrative database maintained by CMS that includes data from all nursing  		facilities or units certified as skilled nursing facilities (SNF) or nursing  		facilities (NF) by Medicare or Medicaid. Thus, by definition these data provide  		a narrower range of facilities than surveys such as the NNHS, conducted by  		NCHS, and the MEPS-NHC, conducted by AHRQ, which sample from a frame that also  		includes nursing facilities licensed by states. Both the NNHS and the MEPS-NHC  		use a two-stage sampling design, first selecting a sample of facilities and  		then sampling residents within each facility. Included facilities are places or  		units certified as a SNF or NF and places or units with three or more beds that  		are licensed as nursing homes by states. In these surveys, facilities serve  		residents of all ages, but because data is collected on resident  		characteristics, including age, estimates for the elderly can be produced. </p>
<p>The only survey focusing solely on alternative residential care places  		was conducted by Hawes and colleagues for ASPE (Hawes, Rose, and Phillips  		1999). For the study, a frame was constructed drawing on various sources, and  		then a sample meeting inclusion criteria was drawn. Criteria were that  		facilities either identified themselves as assisted living facilities or  		offered 24-hour oversight, housekeeping, at least two meals per day, and help  		with at least two activities among medications, bathing, or dressing. The  		sample was limited to facilities with more than 10 beds primarily serving an  		elderly clientele, so that estimates from the survey would be expected to be  		lower than estimates including smaller facilities or facilities serving a  		broader population. </p>
<h3>Census and Individual or Household Survey Data</h3>
<p>The data sources in this group are the Decennial Census and three  		national surveys from which estimates of residential care have been made. The  		surveys are the Asset and Health Dynamics Study of the Oldest Old (AHEAD),  		which represents the older community, or noninstitutional, population, and the  		MCBS and NLTCS, which draw their samples from the universe of Medicare  		beneficiaries regardless of residential situation. Because about 95 percent of  		the population age 65 or older is enrolled in Medicare, the NLTCS sample, which  		is limited to beneficiaries age 65 or older, is roughly representative of the  		entire elderly population. We also examined but do not discuss further the  		Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which is a survey of the  		noninstitutional population of all ages that includes a limited set of  		questions about senior housing and services used by residents. We could find no  		published estimates of residential care using the PSID, and the sample of older  		respondents (about 1,500) was small relative to the three surveys reviewed  		here. </p>
<p><b><i>Decennial Census</i></b></p>
<p>The Decennial Census is important not only as a source of estimates, but  		also as the source of definitions that determine the universe for survey  		sampling from the noninstitutional population, such as the AHEAD. It also  		provides the foundation for intercensal population estimates used as control  		totals in sample weights for most national person-based surveys, including both  		the AHEAD and the NLTCS. Two overlapping designations, "institution" and "group  		quarters," are important for understanding the population representation of  		noninstitutional surveys and the implications for their coverage of alternative  		residential settings. They are shown graphically in <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure1">Figure  		1</a>. The primary identifying characteristic of an institution as defined by  		the Census is that "patients or inmates" are supervised and have limited  		ability to leave. The definition includes correctional institutions, although  		the correctional population is not included in the universe covered by the  		surveys included here. Nursing or other medical supervision is not a Census  		criterion for institutions, although nursing homes, defined broadly by the  		Census to include settings such as "rest homes" and "homes for the aged," are  		the largest category of institutions, particularly among the elderly. All  		institutions are group quarters, as distinct from <i>housing units</i>, which  		are defined as quarters (including a single room) in which occupants live and  		eat separately from others and have direct access to the outside of the  		building or access through a common hall. However, <i>group quarters</i> as  		defined by the Census also include noninstitutional settings, which are places  		that are neither housing units nor institutional quarters. Noninstitutional  		group quarters include places such as group homes that provide care and  		supportive services. </p>
<p>Several issues relating to measurement of residential settings are  		evident in <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>. First, alternative residential  		settings may be housing units, noninstitutional group quarters, or  		institutions, and differentiating among them may be difficult (Abramson 2003).  		Second, the delineation between institutional and noninstitutional settings is  		not concrete, which may affect the comparability of community samples drawn to  		represent the noninstitutional population. Third, while most community, or  		noninstitutional, surveys include those in noninstitutional group settings in  		the universe from which their samples are drawn, they necessarily omit some  		"institutional" settings that are not substantively different from included  		settings. Thus, they cannot provide a complete picture of alternative  		residential care. Finally, even within population-based surveys that include  		persons in all settings, identification of types of places that have no  		clear-cut identifier such as Medicare or Medicaid certification is not  		straightforward. </p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and AHEAD</i></b></p>
<p>The AHEAD survey began in 1993 with a sample of community-residing  		persons age 70 or older in households. The survey design used a dual frame  		consisting of an area probability sample and a supplementary probability sample  		of persons age 80 or older drawn from Medicare enrollment files. The AHEAD is a  		companion survey to the HRS, which began as a panel study of community  		residents ages 51 to 61 years old in 1992. In 1998 the two surveys merged and  		expanded to represent the noninstitutional population ages 51 and older in that  		year. Persons originally sampled in the community are followed if they are  		institutionalized, but have a zero cross-sectional weight for any wave in which  		they are in an institution. </p>
<p>Because it is a community survey, the HRS/AHEAD includes both housing  		units and noninstitutional group quarters, but excludes similar places that are  		designated as institutional. Thus, it necessarily provides a limited  		representation of alternative residential settings. In the initial 1993 AHEAD  		survey, respondents who reported that their residence was part of a building or  		community for persons over age 60 were asked whether the place offered a list  		of services and whether it charged extra for the services. Included services  		are group meals, help with bathing, dressing, or eating, nursing care, and a  		special residential facility for those needing nursing care. </p>
<p>Since the survey was merged with the HRS, all respondents who report  		that their residence is in a retirement community, senior housing, or other  		housing providing services, are then asked about services available, whether  		they are included in housing costs, whether the respondent actually uses the  		services, and whether the respondent could continue to live there if they  		needed "substantial care." Included services are group meals, housekeeping,  		transportation, help with ADLs (bathing, dressing, or eating), emergency call  		button, nursing or a special resident facility for those who need nursing care.  		The type of living situation is identified only by the type of services  		available, rather than by name (e.g., assisted living). </p>
<p><b><i>MCBS</i></b></p>
<p>The MCBS is a probability sample drawn from all Medicare beneficiaries  		that began in 1992 and is conducted annually. Participants are interviewed over  		a four-year period. The annual sample includes an over-sample of persons age 85  		or older (Adler 1994; Laschober and Olin 1996; Liu and Sharma 2002). A  		supplemental sample is drawn and interviewed in each fall round (September  		through December) to replace respondents being retired from the sample,  		replenish cells depleted by refusals and death, and correct for coverage errors  		in the initial frame (Liu and Sharma 2002). Since 1994, the supplemental sample  		has been representative of persons alive and eligible on January 1 of the  		survey year. </p>
<p>Two files are released each year, the Access to Care file, which  		includes Medicare claims data but no survey reported use or expenditure data,  		and the Cost and Use file, which additionally includes Medicare use and cost  		data reconciled with survey reports. The first available is the Access to Care  		file, which contains survey information on about 18,000 persons representing  		those who are continuously enrolled during the year. Thus persons who die and  		those who enter the program during the year are not represented. The second  		file released is the Cost and Use file, which includes about 13,000 persons and  		represents all persons ever enrolled during the year, including decedents and  		new entrants, as well as reconciled survey and Medicare program data on use and  		cost of health services. The Cost and Use file is designed to provide estimates  		of annual Medicare spending by all beneficiaries eligible any part of the year,  		rather than to represent a true cross-section of the Medicare population. </p>
<p>A strength of the MCBS is that all settings are included. Respondents  		are interviewed wherever they are on the interview date, using either a  		community or a facility questionnaire, depending on whether the respondent is  		in a facility as identified by MCBS criteria, and are followed as they make  		residential changes. The Cost and Use file includes a complete residential  		timeline identifying where respondents reside throughout the survey year. </p>
<p>Through 2000, the MCBS collected information on residential care only in  		long-term care facilities, which the MCBS defines as places with three or more  		beds and either Medicare or Medicaid certified or state licensed, or providing  		24-hour caregiver supervision, or providing supervision of medications or help  		with ADLs or IADLs. Facility type, including nursing home, assisted living, and  		various other types of residential care, is determined from the facility's  		self-designation in a facility screening questionnaire. </p>
<p>In 2001 for the first time, the Access to Care file includes data from a  		new housing supplement that also collected information about residential  		setting from all persons in the community. Respondents were asked whether their  		residence was in a retirement community, senior citizens housing, an assisted  		living facility, a continuing care community, a staged living community or  		retirement apartments and could specify another type. Those reporting any such  		special setting were asked whether services were available, whether services  		cost extra, and whether they would have to move out or to another part of the  		community if they needed "substantial care." Specific services are more limited  		than in the HRS/AHEAD and include no ADL or personal care items. Services  		included are assistance with meals, housekeeping, transportation, medication,  		and recreational activities. </p>
<p><b><i>NLTCS</i></b></p>
<p>The NLTCS, which is conducted by the Census under the direction of the  		Center for Demographic studies at Duke University, is a national sample of  		Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older weighted to represent the complete  		elderly population. It is designed to identify those who are chronically  		disabled, as defined by ADLs or IADLs, in a screening interview, and to collect  		detailed data on their disability, service use, family support, health and  		demographic characteristics and a wide range of other characteristics of their  		living situation. When the survey began in 1982, only community residents were  		eligible to receive a detailed interview. The survey was repeated in 1984 and  		1989 with detailed interviews for disabled persons in the community and  		residents of "institutions" as defined by the NLTCS. In 1994 and 1999, samples  		of nondisabled community residents also received the detailed interview, so  		that complete information is available in those two years for the full Medicare  		population age 65 or older. </p>
<p>The samples are drawn from Medicare enrollment files and are refreshed  		in each wave with a new sample of persons who turned 65 since the previous  		survey, so that both longitudinal and cross-sectional estimates can be made. In  		1994 and 1999, a supplemental sample of those aged 95 or older was added to  		increase precision of estimates for the very old. About 21,000 respondents were  		screened in 1984, 16,000 in 1989, and 17,000 in 1994 and 1999, resulting in  		samples of about 7,600 detailed respondents in 1984, and about 6,000 in the  		remaining years. </p>
<p>Information on residential setting is elicited on an instrument called  		the Control Card, which is administered just prior to the detailed interview to  		collect information about the individual's living situation and family and to  		determine whether an individual receives a community or institutional  		interview. An institutional setting is defined in the NLTCS as either a  		facility or a residential setting with three or more unrelated persons,  		provided that there is a health professional on duty every day. Thus, in  		addition to nursing homes, such places as facilities for the mentally ill or  		mentally disabled and some alternative residential care settings are included.  		The institutional questionnaire then identifies places by self-identified type,  		and, in all years except 1994, by whether the facility reports having beds that  		are certified by Medicare or Medicaid.<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Persons receiving the community questionnaire are also asked late in the  		detailed interview whether their residence is in a retirement community or is  		another type of residential care setting, including retirement home, boarding  		home, group home or community residential facility. In 1994 for the first time,  		assisted living was offered as an explicitly named choice, and in 1999,  		assisted living was also added as a separate category on the residential screen  		on the Control Card. Persons whose residence was identified as assisted living  		on the Control Card were asked whether they received meal preparation,  		housekeeping, help with eating or moving around, or "substantial nursing care  		of any kind" from the assisted living community. The latter question was used  		to determine whether assisted living residents received the community or  		institutional interview, rather than the more general question about health  		professionals on duty daily used for residents in other settings. Additional  		persons who identify their residence as a retirement community or other  		residential care setting only later in the community questionnaire are not  		asked about services available through their residence. </p>
<p><b><i>Common Issues among Surveys</i></b></p>
<p>Some issues are common to all three surveys reviewed. Population-based  		surveys in theory are better suited to identifying the universe of residential  		care settings than provider-based samples. Because group quarters are  		relatively rare, however, population or household-based surveys generate small  		samples of persons in these settings in the absence of oversampling, and it is  		not clear how well area probability sampling plans can achieve representation.  		Surveys like the HRS/AHEAD that include only noninstitutional settings also may  		be affected by the increasing difficulty in delineating the relevant universe  		from which to sample the target "community" population, as illustrated in  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>. Provider-based surveys have larger samples and  		thus more precision in estimates of characteristics of the population in the  		specific types of settings they target, but are dependent on the ability to  		construct a complete frame. </p>
<p>Weighting strategy and representation of the sample in population-based  		surveys also are important issues for comparability of estimates. Weights for  		all three surveys reviewed here are post-stratified to control totals. In the  		case of the MCBS, the Access and Use file is weighted to represent full-year  		Medicare enrollees, while the Cost and Use file represents all persons ever  		enrolled during the year, including both those who die and new enrollees. Thus,  		unlike the HRS/AHEAD and the NLTCS, neither survey provides true cross-section  		estimates when survey weights are used. Although the NLTCS sample is drawn from  		Medicare enrollment, which represents about 95 percent of the population age 65  		or older,<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note2">2</a></font></sup>  		post-stratification is to Census projections of the complete noninstitutional  		and institutional populations age 65 or older. The soundness of this  		post-stratification depends on correct identification of segments of the sample  		that correspond to Census definitions of institutional and noninstitutional.  		Three different decisions have been made in survey-provided weights since the  		NLTCS began (Spillman 2004). Finally, the HRS/AHEAD, which uses area  		probability sampling to draw the majority of its sample, is designed to  		represent the noninstitutional population and weighted to population control  		totals for the relevant age group from the Current Population Survey, which  		represents the noninstitutional population as defined by the Decennial Census.  		</p>
<h2><a name="comparison" id="comparison">COMPARISON OF EXISTING ESTIMATES</a></h2>
<p>We limited our review of estimates of the number of nursing homes and  		alternative residential care places and residents to the period 1994 to the  		present for nursing homes, and 1993 to the present for alternative residential  		care settings. <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2a">Figure 2a</a>, <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure  		2b</a>, and <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2c">Figure 2c</a> for nursing homes and residents  		and <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure3a">Figure 3a</a> and <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure3b">Figure 3b</a> for  		alternative settings show the results graphically. In cases where there are  		multiple estimates from a particular data source, estimates are identified by  		data source and first author, for example, OSCAR/Harrington. Where estimates  		from the same data source appeared to be duplicative, so that estimates  		essentially lay on top of each other, we included only one source in Figures 2  		and 3, and we excluded estimates that appeared to be entirely derivative of  		other included estimates.<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> We begin with nursing homes and residents  		before turning to the more complex issue of alternative residential settings.  		</p>
<h3>Nursing Homes and Residents</h3>
<p>There is a reasonable consistency among existing estimates of nursing  		homes and residents, reflecting the relatively greater consensus about what  		constitutes a nursing home. Differences, particularly in the number of nursing  		homes, generally are consistent with differences in the definition of nursing  		home used, but also may reflect changes in frames that are not easily  		quantified. For estimates of residents, comparisons are complicated by whether  		estimates are available for the elderly or only for all residents, by  		methodological issues, and differences in representation and measurement. </p>
<p><b><i>Number of Nursing Homes</i></b></p>
<p>Focusing first on <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2a">Figure 2a</a>, estimates are in  		the range of 15,000 to 18,000 nursing homes in each year. Differences in  		estimates generally are consistent with differences in facility  		definition--Medicare or Medicaid certified facilities only, or more inclusive  		facility definitions. Methodological differences appear to be responsible for  		the notable exception to this observation--the two sets of estimates  		(Harrington et al. 2001, 2002, 2003 and CMS 2001) that provide long trends from  		OSCAR data. These data include only certified nursing facilities and thus would  		be expected to be somewhat below more inclusive estimates. Harrington's  		estimates are roughly within the range of 15,000 to 15,700 facilities over the  		entire period, whereas the CMS estimates indicate about 1,500 to 1,900  		additional facilities in each year. Both series indicate a mild increase  		through 1997 and a similarly mild decrease thereafter. Additional OSCAR  		estimates for 2002 and 2003 (AHCA 2003) appear consistent with the higher of  		the two trends. A review of the methods used to produce these estimates  		suggests that the CMS estimate is based on an OSCAR file of nursing homes  		created in March of each year, whereas Harrington uses the most recent survey  		within the calendar year (Harrington et al. 2003, CMS 2001). In addition,  		Harrington's estimate excludes ICF/MR facilities, while there is no mention in  		documentation of whether intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded  		(ICF/MRs) are excluded from CMS estimates (Harrington et al. 2003, CMS 2001).  		Duplication of facilities also may contribute, although only between 30 and 167  		facilities per year were removed because of duplication within the sample used  		in Harrington et al. (2003). </p>
<p>Examination of the remaining estimates from other sources suggests that  		the CMS estimates may overstate, and the Harrington estimates understate  		certified facilities. For example, the 1996 MEPS-NHC estimate (Rhoades and  		Krauss 1999) and the 1995 and 1997 NNHS estimates (Gabrel and Jones 2000a,  		2000b) both are based on the same broader sample frame including licensed as  		well as certified facilities, yet both lie slightly below the CMS estimates,  		which reflect a more restricted definition. NNHS estimates restricted to  		certified facilities lie about halfway between the OSCAR estimates from CMS and  		Harrington prior to 1999. Harrington's 1998 estimate from state data  		(Harrington, Swan, and Wellin 1999), which, like the MEPS and NNHS estimates,  		includes licensed as well as certified facilities, is nearly identical to the  		CMS estimate for that year. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the NNHS sample frame also may play a role in the  		discrepancy between the NNHS estimates and the CMS OSCAR estimates of certified  		facilities. After frame updates that began in 1997, the 1999 NNHS estimates of  		both licensed or certified facilities (18,000) and certified facilities only  		(17,500) (Jones 2002), are higher than the CMS OSCAR estimate. Although we  		cannot investigate further using published data, this may reflect NNHS sample  		frame updates in 1997 and 1999 that relied on CMS data, presumably from OSCAR,  		and data from unspecified "other national organizations" (Jones 2002). </p>
<p>Interestingly, estimates from the Administration on Aging's Ombudsman  		program, also ostensibly representing licensed or certified facilities (AoA  		2004) identify about 1,000 more facilities than the MEPS-NHC and the NNHS in  		1996 and 1997, respectively, but nearly match the NNHS estimate for 1999 and  		remain essentially constant thereafter. It is possible that the different  		methodology behind the Ombudsman program estimate (Ombudsmen reports of  		facilities for which they provide services) contributes to the differences.  		</p>
<p>The remaining estimates for 1999 and later are all above the higher of  		the two OSCAR estimates, reflecting a broader facility definition not  		conditioned on either licensing or certification. This is especially true for  		the estimate from the 2000 Census of 21,051 nursing homes (Jonas 2003). The  		Census definition, as discussed, is quite broad, including, for example, "homes  		for the aged," some of which might be considered alternative residential care  		rather than nursing homes in state licensing data and some of which might not  		be licensed at all. We were not able to determine criteria used to define these  		settings from publicly available documentation. Documents that are available  		indicate that prior to the 2000 Census, homes for the aged "with or without  		nursing care" were included as nursing homes (U.S. Census Bureau 1992), whereas  		in 2000, some available documentation specifies homes for the aged "with  		nursing care" (U.S. Census Bureau 2003). The apparent change is not mentioned  		in a detailed section on comparability with the 1990 Census, although other  		relevant items, such as removing the designation of 10 or more unrelated  		persons living together as living in group quarters, are listed. </p>
<p><b><i>Number of Nursing Home Residents</i></b></p>
<p>In <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure 2b</a> and <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2c">Figure  		2c</a>, we have limited estimates to residents age 65 or older in all cases  		where we had estimates for that age group. To simplify the discussion and the  		figures, we present estimates first from provider-based surveys in  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure 2b</a> and then present estimates from  		population-based data in <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2c">Figure 2c</a>. </p>
<p><i><b>Provider-Based Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The relatively large differences in the number of facilities seen in  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2a">Figure 2a</a> do not appear to result in large differences  		in estimates of residents across surveys (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure 2b</a>),  		with estimates generally in the range of 1.3 to 1.5 million residents. This is  		likely because the additional uncertified facilities included in the NNHS and  		MEPS-NHC estimates tend to be relatively small (Rhoades 2000). The very small  		difference between the NNHS trends for residents of certified facilities only  		and residents of all facilities supports this conjecture. Although Harrington's  		OSCAR estimates include the nonelderly, they lie slightly below the NNHS  		estimates for certified facilities, which are restricted to residents 65 or  		older. Again, this may suggest that the Harrington estimate is an underestimate  		of residents in certified facilities, potentially owing to the facility  		selection method. The presence or absence of the age restriction is not in  		itself very important because at least 90 percent of the nursing home  		population is elderly. </p>
<p>The OSCAR data show a slight downward trend in the number of residents  		since the mid 1990s, while the NNHS shows a slight upward trend since 1995,  		consistent with the NNHS trend in the number of facilities seen in  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2a">Figure 2a</a>. The outlier CMS estimate of more than 2.5  		million residents age 65 or older is constructed from Minimum Data Set  		assessments and apparently is an annual user estimate rather than a  		cross-section of residents comparable to the other estimates. </p>
<p><i><b>Population-Based Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>Population-based estimates of nursing home residents are available from  		the 2000 Census and from two surveys, the NLTCS, and the MCBS, which have in  		common full population coverage of the Medicare elderly (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2c">Figure 2c</a>). They differ, however, in sample definition,  		with the NLTCS designed as a cross-section and the MCBS designed to represent  		either those ever enrolled during the survey year (Cost and Use) or  		continuously enrolled during the survey year (Access to Care). All MCBS  		estimates are constructed from the Cost and Use file, except the 2001 estimate  		(Chulis and McCormick 2002), which is from the Access to Care file. Considering  		first the two estimates from the NLTCS cross-section for 1999, these estimates  		illustrate the importance of weighting decisions for estimates. The higher of  		the two estimates (1.42 million) uses a weight post-stratified to Census  		control totals, according to specifications used in prior survey years  		(Spillman 2004). The lower estimate of 1.2 million elderly nursing home  		residents reported in Manton and Gu (2001) uses a weight in which the NLTCS  		institutional sample was not post-stratified to an external control but rather  		allowed to generate an independent estimate.<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> Both estimates are well below the estimate of  		1.56 million from the 2000 Census. As noted, the Census definition of nursing  		home appears to be broader and may or may not be conditioned on nursing care.  		Both estimates are also below the NNHS estimate of 1.47 million from  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure 2b</a>, by about 40,000 and nearly 300,000,  		respectively. </p>
<p>The MCBS illustrates a number of methodological challenges for  		comparison with estimates from other data. The first is sample definition.  		Because the Cost and Use file, which is used in the MCBS estimates for 1994  		through 1999, is designed to study annual spending and utilization patterns  		rather than to represent an accurate cross-section of the beneficiary  		population, the sample is selected and weights are constructed to be  		representative of all persons ever enrolled during the year, including both new  		enrollees and enrollees who die during the year. A residential timeline is  		provided covering the survey year for each sample member. The most common type  		of nursing home estimate produced using the data is an annual user estimate of  		all persons with at least one stay during the survey year, reflected in the two  		series of estimates labeled "annual users." These annual user estimates would  		be expected to be and are far higher than cross-sectional estimates from either  		the NLTCS or the provider-based estimates. </p>
<p>However, there is an additional issue of a change in the survey  		treatment of SNF stays between the 1996 and 1997 surveys that has substantial  		effects on the use estimates, illustrated by the discontinuity in the series of  		estimates labeled "Spillman -- annual users." Prior to 1997, only some SNF  		stays were counted because SNF stays were not identified separately on the  		residential time line. Thus, SNF stays were captured only if they occurred at  		the time of interview, and even then, they were not distinguished from other  		nursing home stays, so that they can neither be completely included nor  		excluded without claims analysis. Beginning in 1997, SNF stays were added as a  		category on the timeline. The Spillman estimates include these stays in 1997  		and 1998 while the Potter estimate for 1999 excludes them, resulting in a  		discrepancy of roughly 1 million persons between the estimates. Tabulations  		from published MCBS estimates posted on the CMS web site confirm that this is  		roughly the annual number of persons age 65 or older whose only facility use  		was a SNF stay between 1997 and 1999.<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> For illustrative purposes, estimates  		constructed by subtracting SNF stays from the 1997 and 1998 estimates and  		adding SNF stays to the 1999 estimate are shown as open circles in  		<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2c">Figure 2c</a>. </p>
<p>The final data series from the Cost and Use file, labeled  		Spillman--point in time, is a point in time estimate of nursing home use by  		persons surviving to the fall interview, from a study of the characteristics of  		nursing home and assisted living residents (Spillman, Liu, and McGilliard  		2002). The fall interview was selected in order to use disability and other  		information collected in that interview. Because they are constructed at a  		point-in-time, these estimates are much less sensitive to the treatment of SNF  		stays. However, they also may be an underestimate of true cross-sections of  		elderly nursing home residents at a point in time. Medicare elderly population  		estimates corresponding to these point-in-time estimates understate Medicare  		enrollment by 1 to 2 percent depending on the year. </p>
<p>In fact, the point in time nursing home resident estimates appear to be  		low relative to other cross-sectional estimates only for 1997 and 1998, when  		estimates are 1.39 and 1.35 million, respectively, compared with estimates of  		1.47 million from the 1997 and 1999 NNHS (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure 2b</a>).  		The point in time estimates for 1995 and 1996 of 1.42 million and 1.46 million,  		respectively are much closer to cross-sectional estimates from the  		provider-based survey estimates, matching the NNHS estimate for 1995 and  		slightly higher than the 1996 MEPS-NHC estimate of 1.43 million (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure2b">Figure 2b</a>). It is possible that the lower point-in-time  		estimates from the 1997 and 1998 MCBS reflect changes in the identity of  		marginal settings as the result of changes in state licensure options, as  		described by Rhoades (2000). In fact, between 1992 and 1998, the percent of the  		elderly population in alternative residential care rose according to MCBS  		estimates, so that the combined percent of the elderly population in  		<i>either</i> nursing homes <i>or</i> alternative residential care remained  		literally unchanged at 5.3 percent (Spillman, Liu, and McGilliard 2002). </p>
<p>The final estimate, from the 2001 Access to Care file, is 1.26 million  		residents<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> and is well  		below all estimates except that of Manton for 1999. Two methodological issues,  		one of which would cause an overestimate and the other an underestimate of  		elderly residents, complicate comparisons with other estimates. First, the  		Access to Care estimate includes the nonelderly, which should produce a  		somewhat higher estimate than if limited to the elderly. Second, and presumably  		more important, because the Access to Care estimate represents the  		always-enrolled population it understates a true cross-section of the  		population. The total Access to Care Medicare population was 37.5 million in  		2001 (Chulis and McCormick 2002). This is about 2.5 million, or 6 percent,  		below Medicare enrollment in July of 2001. Finally, as discussed, changes in  		state licensing over time also may contribute to the lower estimate. </p>

</tr></table><h3>Alternative Residential Care</h3>
<p>Estimates of alternative residential care settings and their residents  		generally support the widespread belief that this type of care arrangement is  		growing. Facility estimates appear to illustrate most clearly the uncertainty  		produced by the lack of a consistent definition of what constitutes alternative  		residential care. As with nursing home estimates, estimates of the number of  		residents in alternative care settings appear to indicate several areas where  		imposing more consistent methodology may be able to narrow differences. </p>
<p><b><i>Number of Alternative Residential Care Settings</i></b></p>
<p>While the general trend appears to be upward, the range of estimates of  		alternative residential care settings is much larger than seen for nursing  		facilities--from roughly 14,000 to nearly 40,000, depending on the year (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure3a">Figure 3a</a>). Within the sets of estimates providing a  		series, the range is narrower, although still substantial, at 10,000 to nearly  		20,000 facilities depending on the year. </p>
<p>The estimates labeled NCAL and Mollica can be taken as roughly a single  		series because the NCAL estimates rely heavily on Mollica's survey of state  		licensing data, using internal information on opening dates to extrapolate  		backward and assumptions about growth rates to interpolate intermediate points.  		Taken as a single series, the estimates suggest that the number of facilities  		slightly more than doubled in the seven years between 1995 and 2002, from about  		16,000 to about 36,000. As seen for nursing homes, the AoA Ombudsman data from  		reports of facilities for which ombudsmen provide services identify  		substantially more facilities, even though both series ostensibly represent  		licensed facilities. Estimates for 1999 from the NIC, which appears to be more  		narrowly defined and for 2000 from Care Scout, which includes places Care Scout  		identified specifically as "assisted living" but may also include some other  		settings (SSS 2003) lie roughly along or between the higher and lower trends,  		roughly consistent with their apparent inclusiveness or exclusiveness. </p>
<p>Remaining estimates are outliers in one direction or the other. The  		Hawes estimate of about 11,500 entities is the result of a purposeful attempt  		to exclude all facilities not meeting the assisted living model and is limited  		to facilities with more than 10 beds that either call themselves assisted  		living or offer a minimum set of services. Because of these exclusions, it is  		predictably below the Mollica estimate of nearly 25,000 facilities. Hawes  		(1999) notes, however, that only 27 percent of facilities in the frame  		constructed for the survey met the definition, so that an unrestricted estimate  		presumably would be about 42,000 facilities, almost identical to the 1998  		Ombudsman estimate. Both the outliers on the high side--Harrington for 1998 and  		SSS, Inc., for 2000--were constructed, like the Mollica estimates, from state  		licensing data. The final two estimates, both for 2002 from Firstmark, which is  		a marketing database, differ only in construction, with the higher of the two  		double counting entities that identified themselves as having more than one  		relevant type of residential care setting, while the lower estimate counts such  		places only once. Because a campus may include more than one type of care  		setting, these estimates in theory bracket a count of unique settings. </p>
<p><b><i>Number of Persons in Alternative Residential Care  		Settings</i></b></p>
<p>There also appears to be a clear upward trend in the number of persons  		living in alternative residential care settings, at least through 1999 (<a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#figure3b">Figure  		3b</a>). Methodological differences make it impossible to discern what has  		happened since that year. As with the nursing facility estimates, the small  		facilities that probably account for the discrepancies in the number of  		facilities appear to account for a relatively small number of residents.  		Notably, the Hawes estimate of 521,000 residents in 1998 is based on a far  		smaller number of facilities but is very much in line with the other survey  		estimates of residents in that year. The MCBS Cost and Use file, which over the  		period covered by our review was limited to residential care settings  		identified as facilities, according to the survey's protocol, provides the only  		series of estimates. As with the nursing facility estimates, two different  		types of Cost and Use estimates are shown, with the higher estimates  		representing annual users and the lower representing residents at a point in  		time near the fall interview (Spillman, Liu, and McGilliard 2002). </p>
<p>Both estimates labeled Spillman include a small proportion of persons  		who were living in the community with at least two unrelated persons and were  		disabled in ADLs as an attempt to capture community residential care not  		identified in the MCBS prior to the 2001 Access to Care file. The group so  		identified was very small, less than 0.2 percent of the population in all  		years, and became smaller over time, accounting for less than 0.05 percent of  		the population by 1998. Over the same period, both the number of persons in  		alternative residential care facilities and the list of facility types  		identified on the survey grew, suggesting the possibility that respondents may  		have been increasingly more likely to be designated facility residents as the  		identification of facility settings in the survey evolved with experience. </p>
<p>The difference between the annual user and point estimates is much  		narrower than seen for the nursing facility estimates but seems to widen  		slightly over time with annual users increasing from about 350,000 in 1993 to  		about 570,000 in 1998, and users at a point in time growing from about 260,000  		to 420,000 in the two Spillman series. Both series show an average annual  		growth rate of about 10 percent. The additional Cost and Use file estimates for  		1996 through 1999, labeled MCBS/CMS, are annual user estimates like the higher  		of the two Spillman trends. They are puzzling for two reasons. First, the 1996  		estimate is nearly identical to the Spillman 1996 <i>point-in-time  		estimate</i>, but in 1997 and 1998 the CMS estimates are virtually the same as  		the Spillman annual user estimates for those years. The implied growth rate  		between 1996 and 1997 for the CMS series is 60 percent, which is implausibly  		high compared with an average annual growth rate of about 14 percent between  		1997 and 1999. Second, the CMS data series includes the nonelderly, while the  		Spillman estimates do not. A third Cost and Use file annual user estimate, the  		1999 estimate labeled MCBS/Potter estimate, attempts to exclude the nonelderly  		from the CMS estimate by assuming that the elderly make up a proportion of the  		alternative residential care estimate similar to their representation among all  		full year and part-year institutional residents (about 13 percent) (DEB Potter,  		personal communication). The result is an estimate of 532,000 elderly residents  		during 1999, slightly below the Spillman annual user estimate for the same age  		group in 1998. </p>
<p>Two estimates, both point in time estimates, are shown from the 2001  		MCBS Access to Care file estimates: residents of combined community and  		facility residential care (labeled MCBS/Chulis--all), and residents of  		facilities only (labeled MCBS/Chulis--facilities only).<sup><font><a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> As with the Access to Care nursing facility  		residents estimates, comparisons are difficult because the Chulis estimates  		include the nonelderly but also represent only the continuously enrolled  		population, which should understate a cross-section of Medicare enrollees. As  		noted earlier, the total Access to Care Medicare population estimate is about 6  		percent below Medicare enrollment in July of 2001. This may partially explain  		why the 2001 Access to Care file estimate of 761,000 persons of all ages in  		community and facility alternative residential care settings is slightly below  		a 1999 estimate of 810,000 <i>elderly</i> residents from the NLTCS, which is  		the only other national population-based survey from which it is possible to  		estimate the residential care population in both community and facility  		settings. The Access to Care estimate is also similar, however, to NCAL's 2000  		estimate of 789,000 residents of all ages, although the latter is not a direct  		estimate. It was constructed using Mollica's 2000 estimate of licensed  		facilities and assuming an average 24 residents per facility based on a 2000  		NCAL survey (NCAL 2001). The much higher NCAL estimates of residents in 1997  		and 1998 were based on an estimate of 40 residents per facility from an earlier  		NCAL survey (NCAL 1998). </p>
<p>The 2001 Access to Care estimate of 532,000 persons in residential  		<i>facility</i> settings, about 70 percent of the estimated 761,000 residential  		care population, is virtually identical to Potter's 1999 Cost and Use <i>annual  		user</i> estimate for the elderly, even though it would be expected to be  		lower. Manton and Gu (2001) report that only about 200,000, or 25 percent, of  		the 810,000 total assisted living residents in the 1999 NLTCS estimate were in  		facilities as defined by that survey. This points to the potential importance  		of focusing on survey definitions of "facility" and "community" in assessing  		the comparability of estimates. </p>
<p>The final estimate and the only estimate from a community survey is the  		1993 AHEAD survey estimate of about 543,000 persons age 70 or older in  		community residential care settings (Spector et al. 2000), only slightly fewer  		than the roughly 600,000 found in the 1999 NLTCS. Because a very small  		proportion of persons between age 65 and 70 are in such settings, the age  		difference should not be consequential in comparisons with other estimates for  		the population age 65 or older. As discussed, the AHEAD survey does not  		identify facility types by name, but rather queries for services among all who  		report any type of housing other than a traditional private residence. This is  		presumably a broader net that would capture more persons in residential care  		settings, but also might capture without distinguishing some persons in  		settings such as naturally occurring retirement communities, where services may  		evolve because of a critical mass of older residents. Interestingly, 64 percent  		of alternative residential care residents in the AHEAD reported no IADL or ADL  		disabilities (Spector et al. 2000). Manton and Gu report a similar finding that  		about two-thirds of 600,000 community residents in assisted living settings on  		the 1999 NLTCS were not disabled. </p>

<p>Our review of existing estimates confirms that there are substantial  		differences in estimates of both the number of residential care facilities and  		the number of residents. In many cases differences are consistent with known  		differences in underlying methodology. These methodological differences also  		complicate attempts to discern trends. Uncertainty about the number and  		characteristics of persons receiving care in various settings reduces the  		ability to target resources well and develop effective public policy to address  		the needs of the long term care population. Better understanding of these  		settings and the population they serve is important both to inform public  		policy and to assist consumers in their choices. </p>
<p>Many of the methodological differences we identified can be analyzed  		empirically to develop better estimates of the distribution of the older long  		term care population across settings, to begin to quantify the importance of  		various methodological issues for observed discrepancies, and to inform  		recommendations for improvements in how data are collected. In this final  		section, we summarize our conclusions with respect to the magnitude of  		discrepancies, the key methodological issues that may be addressed by analysis  		of existing data, and the most promising data for the purpose. </p>
<h3>Magnitude of Differences in Estimates</h3>
<p>For nursing homes, despite differences in methodology, there was greater  		consistency in estimates of both the number of facilities (15,000 to 18,000 in  		all years) and the number of older residents (1.2 million to 1.56 million) than  		in estimates for residential care alternatives. The estimates appear to show a  		mild upward trend in the number of nursing homes prior to 1997 and a mild  		downward trend thereafter. The trend for residents appears to have been  		slightly downward in the late 1990s but lack of consistent published estimates  		makes the trend since then unclear. </p>
<p>For residential care alternatives, estimates suggest a stronger upward  		trend throughout our period of observation, but the range of estimates for both  		the number of places and the number of residents is greater than for nursing  		homes and residents. Differences in estimates of the number of alternative  		residential care settings ranged from 14,000 to nearly 40,000, depending on the  		year. Estimates of the number of residents also differed to a greater degree  		than for nursing homes, but the most recent estimates, which allow  		identification of both community and institutional or facility settings,  		suggest a population in these alternative settings on the order of 800,000.  		</p>
<h3>Key Issues and Data Sources for Analysis</h3>
<p>The five key methodological issues identified in our review that are  		most amenable to empirical investigation using existing data sources are the  		following: </p>
<ul><li>age of the population examined;</li>
<li>methods for assigning individuals to the "facility" or  		  "institutional" population (and conversely, the "community" or  		  "noninstitutional" population);</li>
<li>methods of identifying nursing homes;</li>
<li>methods of identifying alternative residential care settings;  		  and</li>
<li>sample representation and weighting. </li>
</ul><p>The key features of data best suited for analysis of these five issues  		are population representation, so that all elements of the population of  		interest--older persons with disabilities--are represented, the ability to  		determine how settings in which individuals reside are identified, the ability  		to apply different criteria more similar to those used in comparison surveys,  		and extensive documentation of survey methods. Our review of potential data  		sources indicates four national surveys that are recent and meet all or most of  		these criteria: The 1999 NLTCS, the 2002 MCBS Access to Care file, the 2002  		MCBS Cost and Use file, and the 2002 HRS/AHEAD. Relevant characteristics of the  		four surveys are summarized in <a href="size-long-term-care-population-residential-care-review-estimates-and-methodology.html#table3">Table 3</a>. </p>
<p>The first three surveys, the NLTCS and the two MCBS files meet all  		criteria. They are population-based surveys that either are or can be limited  		to the Medicare population age 65 or older, and data elements are available  		that allow some potential for investigating more consistent alternate  		definitions of residential care. Both identify residential care by named type  		of setting and each identifies services provided for some or all of those  		identified as living in residential care. In addition, comparisons across the  		three surveys offer information about the importance of sample representation  		because they represent, respectively, a cross-section of the Medicare elderly,  		those always enrolled during the survey year, and those ever enrolled during  		the survey year. </p>
<p>Although it represents only the noninstitutional population, the  		HRS/AHEAD meets all other criteria. The strength of the HRS/AHEAD is that it  		has the potential to provide additional insights into the importance of how  		residential care settings are identified because it does not rely on named  		types of settings, but rather screens all persons not in traditional  		freestanding households for services available and received. Comparison of  		estimates from the HRS/AHEAD with those from the surveys representing the full  		population also has the potential to shed light on the implications of  		Census-based rules for identifying the excluded institutional population for  		residential care estimates. </p>
<p>All four surveys contain detailed information about the characteristics  		and particularly the disability of respondents. This detailed information  		provides the opportunity to understand what subpopulations are being served by  		different types of residential care, as well as confirming whether different  		methods of identifying residential settings are capturing similar  		populations.</p>

The Spillman (2004) estimate identifies nursing home residents as  			 persons receiving the institutional questionnaire and (1) identified on the  			 institutional questionnaire as being in a SNF, intermediate care facility, or  			 noncertified nursing home or (2) identified on the control card as living in  			 "Resident's unit in nursing, convalescent or rest home, or home for the aged,"  			 and not identified on the institutional questionnaire as being in a hospital,  			 an MR/DD facility, a mental facility, or "other" facility. Manton and Gu (2001)  			 do not specify the construction of their estimate.</p>

<p><a name="note5" id="note5">The</a> 1999 NNHS also estimates that the number of  			 discharges of elderly persons with Medicare as their expected payment source  			 was roughly 1 million between October 1998 and September 1999.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">The</a> estimate represents residents of facilities  			 specifically identified as a "nursing home" (Chulis and McCormick  			 2002).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">The</a> "facilities only" estimate includes  			 residents in settings identified as assisted living, continuing care/retirement  			 community, adult/group home, personal care facility, board and care, retirement  			 community, domiciliary care facility, and rest home/retirement home. In  			 addition to these facility types, the "All" estimate includes community  			 residents in settings identified as assisted living facility, staged living  			 community, and continuing care community (Chulis and McCormick 2002).</p>
