</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The proportion of American mothers with preschool children who are  		employed has more than tripled since World War II. By 1988, 56 percent of U.S.  		women with children under the age of 6 were employed. (Zill, 1989). This rise  		in mothers' rates of employment has led to a watershed in public opinion and  		policy. Increasingly, the role of the welfare system crafted in the 1930's to  		assist mothers to stay home with their children has come to be questioned as  		the majority of mothers have moved into the labor force. Work incentives have  		been part of the program since the 1960's, but now the system has been reformed  		by the Family Support Act of 1988 so that the primary goal of the program is to  		assist AFDC parents, usually female single parents, to become economically self  		sufficient.</p>
<p>Chief components of the new AFDC program (Aid for Families with  		Dependent Children) are the required participation of mothers with children  		over 2 years of age in employment programs and the-guarantee of child care for  		AFDC mothers who participate in the newly established Job Opportunities and  		Basic Skills program or other approved education and training activities as  		well as to mothers who go to work. States have the option to reduce the age  		cutoff so that mothers with children over 1 year: of age are required to  		participate in employment programs. A further provision of the Act is that all  		parents who exit from the AFDC program because of earnings are guaranteed 12  		months of transitional child care assistance on a sliding scale fee basis. For  		many states these new requirements have lead to large scale planning efforts as  		they have geared up to expand child care opportunities for welfare  		families.</p>
<p>A fundamental precept of the regulations governing the new child care  		guarantees is that parents reserve the right to chose their own child care  		arrangements (Federal Register, 1989). Yet very little is known about the child  		care choices of AFDC mothers. The last time data were collected about child  		care of recipients was in 1979 when the AFDC Recipient Survey found that 60  		percent of AFDC mothers employed full time did not use available child care  		subsidies (Hofferth and Sonenstein, 1983). Consequently, States efforts to  		expand child care options for AFDC parents have proceeded in the absence of any  		information about what these parents would prefer.</p>
<p>This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the child care  		arrangements made a by sample of AFDC mothers over a 14 month period starting  		in September 1, 1983. We have limited our discussion to mothers with children  		under the age of 6 for two reasons. The child care needs and options for  		preschool-age children, including those in half day kindergarten programs,  		typically differ from children who are in school (grades 1-6). Also until  		recently, AFDC mothers with children under the age of 6 were exempt from  		registering for the WIN program. A key element of welfare reform is the  		expectation that mothers with younger children work. In light of this policy  		shift, information about the current care arrangements made by AFDC mothers  		with children under the age of 6 becomes critical to projections about the  		types of child care needed by these mothers.</p>
<p>First we describe the most recent care arrangements used by mothers for  		their youngest children. We also examine how these child care arrangements vary  		in terms of objective characteristics (cost and hours of the day) and the  		mother's subjective assessment of the quality of the arrangement measured along  		a number of dimensions. Then we examine how these dimensions of quality  		contribute mother's overall satisfaction with her child care arrangement.  		Finally the policy implications of these findings for children on welfare are  		explored.</p>
<h2><a name="child" id="child">THE CHILD CARE AND SELF SUFFICIENCY STUDY</a></h2>
<p>A major problem regarding child care for welfare mothers is the general  		lack of information about the types of child care arrangements they use. The  		Child Care and Self Sufficiency Study was initiated to fill these gaps in  		knowledge. Its objectives were to describe the child care arrangements made by  		AFDC mothers who work and to examine whether certain types of arrangements and  		subsidies enhance the ability of welfare mothers to get off welfare and stay  		off welfare.</p>
<p>The sample consisted of 554 AFDC mothers with children under age 10  		randomly drawn from welfare rolls in Boston, Charlotte and Denver. The sample  		was stratified so that half the mothers had earnings in August 1983 and half  		did not. Since approximately 5 percent of the AFDC caseload was employed at any  		single point in time in 1982 (Weder, n.d.), working recipients were heavily  		oversampled. However sampling weights are applied to make the results  		descriptive of all mothers with children under 10 on the AFDC caseloads in  		these 3 cities. Our analyses in this paper are limited to the 382 mothers in  		the sample with children under the age of six; 296 of these mothers reported  		using child care at some time in the 14 month period.</p>
<p>Two sets of interviews were conducted with these mothers. The first set  		took place 8 months after the sample was selected in August 1983, the second  		was conducted 6 months after that. In the two interviews retrospective  		information was gathered in a life events format about the respondent's  		employment, training, school participation, job search and child care  		arrangements across the 14-month period. In addition, AFDC case record data  		were abstracted for the 14-month period.</p>
<h2><a name="afdc" id="afdc">AFDC MOTHERS' USE OF CHILD CARE</a></h2>
<p>Over the 14 month period 63 percent of the sample reported that they  		used a child care arrangement for their youngest child at least once. To obtain  		this information mothers were first asked about any episodes of working,  		looking for work, or going to school or a training program during this period.  		If they had participated in any of these activities they were then asked  		whether anyone looked after their youngest child while they engaged in them.  		Our definition of child care is therefore tied to arrangements made for the  		youngest child while the mother worked, went to school or a training program,  		or looked for work; babysitting for other activities that the mother might  		engage in is not included.</p>
<p>Over the course of 14 months 43 percent of mothers obtained employment  		for some period of time. (See <a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table1">Table 1</a>) Another  		group--about 12 percent--sought employment but not find work. Twenty-four  		percent participated in training programs or went to school. Only 36 percent of  		the mothers with children under age 6 did not engage in a job, job readying or  		job search activities. Since these data were gathered before states began to  		mount their "welfare to work" demonstrations in earnest, they indicate the  		amount of effort mothers on welfare in the 3 cities were making without  		specialized programs.</p>
<p>Work effort did not vary by the age of the youngest child. Mothers with  		infants were just as likely to work as mothers with older preschool children.  		Interestingly, mothers of infants were more likely to look for work without  		success compared to mothers with older children. Twenty-one percent looked for  		work but found nothing compared to 8 percent of mothers with slightly older  		children. This may imply that these mothers are more motivated to enter the  		labor force but may be encountering barriers in terms of arranging care for  		infants.</p>
<p><a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table2">Table 2</a> shows the type of arrangement used for the  		youngest child. This table is a picture of the most recent main child care  		arrangement reported by the mother, usually in the first interview. By main  		child care arrangement we mean the one used for the most number of hours. The  		predominant form of care is care by relatives. Over half the infants and  		toddlers and over 40 percent of 4-5 year-olds were cared for by relatives,  		primarily grandparents. Formal care in centers, early childhood programs and  		schools is not common for children under age 2, but its use increases with the  		age of the child. Ten percent of children under 2 years of age are in day care  		centers, but by ages 4 and 5 one-quarter are in centers as a main arrangement.  		Head Start is not utilized much as a main care arrangement for these children  		on welfare even though they would be a prime target group for the program.</p>
<p>Relatives are the predominant caregivers for preschool children no  		matter what the mother's activity is--employment, looking for work or  		school/training (see <a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table3">Table 3</a>). For employed mothers, the  		most common form of care after relatives was family daycare homes, care outside  		the home by nonrelatives. Only 14 percent used group care, a category combining  		care in centers with nursery school or Head Start arrangements. For mothers in  		school and training, group care was just as common as relative care. Almost  		half of the youngest children of these mothers were in group care. Possibly,  		training and school programs that mothers are attending provide access to group  		care; access that is apparently not as available to working AFDC mothers.</p>
<h2><a name="mother" id="mother">MOTHER'S DIFFERENTIAL RATINGS OF CARE  		ARRANGEMENTS</a></h2>
<p>The interview was designed to obtain the mother's assessment of her most  		recent main child care arrangement on a number of objective and subjective  		measures of its quality, convenience, and cost. In addition she was asked about  		her satisfaction with her child care arrangement. A full list of variables is  		available in <a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table4">Table 4</a>. We have compared mother's ratings  		of their care arrangements to see whether certain types of arrangements are  		associated with better ratings. <a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table5">Table 5</a> compares  		different types of arrangements on these dimensions. Care arrangements have  		been grouped into five categories: relatives providing care in the child's  		home; relatives providing care outside the child's home; care in someone else's  		home who is not a relative-sometimes referred to as family day care; care by a  		nonrelative in the child's home--sometimes called in-home babysitting; and care  		in a group setting such as a center, a nursery school, a Head Start program or  		school. Care provided by the mother while she is employed have been excluded  		from these analyses. The table shows the mother's assessment of care varied  		significantly by the type of care that she used.<sup><a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#note1"><font>1</font></a></sup></p>
<p>Two objective indicators of the quality of care that are often used to  		measure the quality of child care for licensing purposes are the ratio o  		children to adults and whether or not the care giver has received specialized  		training in child development (Ruopp et al, 1979). These two indicators were  		cornerstones in the federal government's attempts to regulate child care in the  		seventies (Nelson, 1982). Mothers in our sample reported the number of children  		cared for together in their youngest child's most recent arrangement as well as  		the number of adults who were always present. Using these data we calculated a  		child to adult ratio for each youngest child's main arrangement. Respondents  		also indicated whether or not their child care provider had received special  		training in caring for children.</p>
<p>Group care had a significantly higher mean child to adult ratio, 5.28,  		than all the other forms of care. Care provided by relatives either in or  		outside the child's home had the lowest ratios at 1.58 and 1.65 respectively.  		Care by non-relatives either inside or outside the child's home had child to  		adult ratios that were slightly higher than relative care situations, at 2.56  		and 2.62. By this criterion, group care had the poorest rating. However on the  		second criterion, child care training, care givers in group care were  		significantly more likely to have had special training than those in other  		settings.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting objective characteristics of their child care  		arrangements, the mothers were asked to assess other dimensions of its quality:  		her provider's experience in caring for children, her child's opportunities to  		learn new things, and the level of supervision, discipline and safety provided  		in her arrangement There were significant differences between the types of care  		on three of these dimensions. Mothers reported that their children had more  		frequent opportunities to learn new things in group care than in the other  		types of care. Care provided by nonrelatives either in or outside the child's  		home had the poorest rating on this dimension; care provided by relative fell  		in between. Related caregivers and caregivers in group settings were reported  		to have approximately the same levels of experience caring for children and to  		have significantly more experience than nonrelated caregivers. A similar  		pattern emerged for mothers' reports of the safety precautions taken by the  		caregiver to prevent accidents. Related caregivers and caregivers in group  		settings were rated as significantly more care u t an nonrelated caregivers.  		These data indicate that mothers in the sample rated the quality of care  		provided by relatives and group care as significantly better than care by  		nonrelatives on several dimensions.</p>
<p>Another dimension of the mother's assessment of her youngest child's  		care situation is her perception of the child's feelings. Mothers in the sample  		were asked to rate their youngest child's happiness with the care arrangement  		and their child's feelings about the person caring for them. On both these  		aspects of care, care provided by nonrelatives got significantly poorer scores  		than other types of arrangements. Children in family day care or babysitting  		arrangements were reported to be significantly less happy with the care  		situation and less loving towards the caretaking person than children in group  		care or cared for by relatives.</p>
<p>Care arrangements also varied significantly in terms of the mothers'  		perceptions of their convenience of hours and location. Care by relatives  		outside the child's home was consistently rated less convenient in terms of  		hours and location than other forms of care. Care by nonrelatives out of the  		home came in second from the bottom on convenience of hours and location.  		Related to this assessment of convenience ate the actual number of hours and  		the time of day that care is required. Youngest children spent significantly  		more hours per week in group programs and in family day care arrangements than  		they spent in relative care or in non-relative in-home care. On average  		children were in group care or family day care for 30-31 hours per week in  		contrast to 24-25 hours per week for the other arrangements.</p>
<p>Children cared for by relatives spent significantly more hours in care  		after 6:00 pm and before 7:00 am on weekdays than children in other  		arrangements. The average hours per week was 8.7 for relative out-of-home care,  		6.4 for in-home relative care, 5.2 for out-of-home non-relative care, 3.6 for  		non-relative in-home care and 2.2 for group care. Indeed a substantial  		proportion of children in all forms of care except group arrangements required  		care outside of business hours. While only 21 percent of children whose main  		arrangement was a center or school needed evening or early morning care, the  		range was 40-56 percent of children in the other forms of child care. There  		were no significant differences between the types of care on weekend care  		requirements.</p>
<p>The dependability of the child care arrangement can also be very  		important to the AFDC mother who is trying to maintain a job or participate  		regularly in an education or training program. The mothers were asked two  		questions about the number of days lost from work, school or training in the  		last 8 months because (1) the youngest child was sick or (2) the regular child  		care arrangement was not available. Mothers using group care reported a  		significantly higher number of days lost because of the child's sickness than  		mothers using other forms of care. On average mothers with children in group  		care lost 5.6 days over the 8 month period compared to between 1.3 and 2.6 days  		lost when children were in other forms of care. Mothers with children in  		nonrelative in-home care lost the fewest days because of a child's illness.  		There were no significant differences between the different kinds of  		arrangements on days lost because the arrangement was not available. All forms  		of care appeared equally reliable.</p>
<p>The cost of care can be another component of the mother's assessment of  		her youngest child's care. However, the proportion paying for care varied  		widely by the type of care. Only 28 percent of the care provided by relatives  		in the child's home was paid for compared to 78 percent of the care provided  		outside the home by a nonrelative. In between, 46 percent of group care, 60  		percent of nonrelative care inside the home and 44 percent of relative care  		outside the home involved an out-of-pocket cost. These data indicate that child  		care by relatives is not necessarily free care, especially if this care is  		provided outside the child's home. Neither does care by relatives necessarily  		carry a lower unit cost when it is paid for. Although in-home care by relatives  		is one of the cheapest form of care at $.74 an hour, out-of-home care by  		relatives costs more per hour on average ($.90) than out-of home care by  		non-relatives ($.75) or group care ($.69). For those paying for care the  		average weekly cost could be as high as $40.83 for nonrelative in-home care or  		$25.49 for nonrelative out-of home care and as low as $13.23 for group care.  		The average weekly costs of care by relatives fell in between these two poles  		at $19.03 for in-home care and $21.82 for out-of-home care. Mothers who paid  		for care were asked whether they considered the cost of their most child care  		arrangement very reasonable, reasonable, somewhat reasonable or too expensive.  		The care arrangements that cost the most per week, care by non-relatives in or  		out of the home, were rated significantly less reasonable than the other  		arrangement types.</p>
<p>The mothers were also asked two questions which provide measures of  		their satisfaction with care. One simply asked the mothers to rate their,  		satisfaction with their child care arrangement for their youngest child; the  		second asked mothers to indicate what type of child care arrangement would be  		their first choice for their youngest child if they could chooser any at all.  		Answers to this question asked early in the interview could be compared to the  		actual child care arrangement of the child to indicate whether the respondent  		was actually using an arrangement which was her first choice. The results of  		comparisons across care types on these two measures show parallel patterns. In  		terms of the satisfaction measure, mothers using group care were significantly  		more satisfied than mothers using other forms of care. Conversely nonrelative  		care either in or out of the home received the lowest satisfaction ratings. On  		the second measure, the data indicate that with the exception of mothers using  		group care, very few of the respondents had a child care arrangement that was  		their first choice. While over half (53%) of mothers using group care had an  		arrangement that was their first choice, only one third of mothers using  		in-home relative care, and one quarter of mothers using out-of-home relative  		care had their first choices. The proportions were even smaller for the users  		of non-relative care; it was 6 percent for out-of-home users and 10 percent for  		in-home users.</p>
<h2><a name="character" id="character">CHARACTERISTICS OF CARE PREDICTING MOTHER'S  		SATISFACTION WITH ARRANGEMENT</a></h2>
<p>Mothers' ratings of types of care varied substantially on various  		dimensions of child care quality, but it was not clear which of these  		dimensions were most important to mothers. To examine this question, we  		analyzed which ratings contributed the most to mother's reported satisfaction  		with her child care arrangement. The original list of variables had used the  		professional literature on child care quality to identify salient dimensions of  		quality; the subsequent analyses focus on what appears to be important from the  		AFDC mother's perspective.</p>
<p>We used an ordered logistic multiple regression specification (Walker  		and Duncan, 1967) to fit separate models of mother's reported satisfaction with  		child care when her youngest child is 0-2 years old and when her child is 3-5  		years old. In these analyses satisfaction levels were coded 0 for "not very or  		not at all satisfied," 1 for "somewhat satisfied," 2 for "mostly satisfied,"  		and 3 for "completely satisfied." Initially full models were specified  		containing the dimensions of child care "quality" described in  		<a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table4">Table 4</a> in addition to other variables anticipated to  		affect mother's satisfaction with child care. These other variables included  		demographic descriptors of the mother (race, education level, the number of  		children under 9 years old that she had, and her city of residence),  		descriptors of the child care arrangement (type, number of arrangements she had  		simultaneously, hours and time of day in main child care arrangement) and  		descriptors of her main activity when she used this care arrangement ( working  		versus looking for work or going to school). Subsequently the models were  		reduced to incorporate the predictors contributing most to variation in the  		dependent variable.</p>
<p>The reduced models of mothers' satisfaction with child care are  		displayed in <a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table6">Table 6</a>. They show that many of the  		significant independent predictors of mothers' satisfaction with care for 0-2  		year-olds are quite different from the predictors of satisfaction with care for  		3-5 year-olds. A Likelihood Ratio Test confirmed that the models of  		satisfaction for the two age groupings should not be pooled.</p>
<p>When a mother's youngest child is under 3, her satisfaction with her  		child care arrangement appears to be most strongly related to the child's age  		in the negative direction and positively associated with and her perceptions  		that the location and hours of care are convenient and that the amount of adult  		supervision is adequate. There are also significant site differences in  		satisfaction levels with mothers from Boston reporting higher levels of  		satisfaction than those in Charlotte or Denver. In addition the more children  		there are in the arrangement relative to adults, the less likely it is that she  		will be satisfied. Other factors positively associated with satisfaction at the  		.10 significance level are mother's education level and her employment status  		(working versus being in school or looking for work). Factors negatively  		associated with satisfaction at the .10 level are the weekly cost of care, the  		need for care on Saturdays or Sundays, and care provided by relatives in the  		child's home (versus care provided by non-relatives).</p>
<p>When a mother's youngest child is 3 to 5 years old, the factors emerging  		as strong predictors of mother's satisfaction with child care are the age of  		her child (in the negative direction), living in Charlotte (versus Denver), her  		employment status (working versus being in school or looking for work), the  		number of non-business hours care is required, and her perceptions of how happy  		the child is with the arrangement, how frequently the child gets to learn new  		things, how adequate is the level of adult supervision and how convenient are  		the hours of arrangement. Two other strong negative predictors of mother's  		satisfaction are the total number of hours care is required and her perception  		of how experienced her provider is in caring for children.</p>
<p>Common to both models of mother's satisfaction are the negative effects  		of the child's age, and the positive effects of the mother's perception that  		the hours of care are convenient and that the level of supervision is adequate.  		In addition the significant negative effects of weekend care found among  		mothers with children under 3, is mirrored among mothers with children 3-5  		years old but just fails to reach significance at the .10 level. These  		commonalities suggest that for children in both age groupings, the convenience  		of the hours of care and the adequacy of adult supervision are considered to be  		important child care characteristics by their mothers.</p>
<p>Beyond these common concerns about child care among AFDC mothers with  		preschool children of all ages, several dimensions of child care quality appear  		salient only at particular stages of childhood. Most notably mothers with  		children under the age of three are significantly more satisfied with their  		childcare if its location is judged to be convenient and if the child to adult  		ratio is lower. Convenience of location is not a significant predictor of  		mother's satisfaction when children are older. The child to adult ratio is also  		not a significant predictor of satisfaction for the older age group. Moreover,  		the sign for the coefficient is no longer negative for mothers with older  		children, suggesting a positive relationship between the child to adult ratio  		and satisfaction. The importance of location for mothers with very young  		children appears intuitively correct given their need to carry very young  		children and their various paraphernalia--bottles, diapers, and changes of  		clothes. Similarly, the importance of a low child to adult ratio for mothers  		using care for very young children appears to be consistent with the greater  		dependency of these children. As children become older, we can speculate that  		parents become concerned that their children have playmates.</p>
<p>Mothers with children between the ages of 3 and 5 are significantly more  		satisfied with their child care when they think that their child feels happy  		about the arrangement and has an opportunity to learn new things. They are also  		more satisfied with their care when they think the caregiver has <b>less</b>  		experience caring for children, These dimensions of care are not significant  		independent predictors of mothers' satisfaction with care for children under 3.  		While the first two findings appear consistent with the developmental growth of  		children, the finding about the negative effect of a caregiver's experience  		seems counterintuitive. Perhaps caregiver's experience is masking the effect of  		an unmeasured variable like enthusiasm, but we can only speculate why this  		unusual pattern emerges.</p>
<p>Once measures of mothers' objective and subjective assessments of child,  		care characteristics are entered into the satisfaction models, only in-home  		relative care as a child care type (contrasted to non-relative care remains a  		significant independent predictor of dissatisfaction for children under age 3.  		A similar pattern occurs for children between the ages of 3 and 5, but the  		significance level was .16. This finding suggests that even after controls are  		entered for mother's characteristics, employment hours, and the objective and  		subjective characteristics of the care arrangement, some unmeasured dimensions  		of in-home care by relatives continue to exert an independent influence on  		mother's reduced satisfaction with this arrangement.<sup><font><a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>We have presented results for a sample of AFDC mothers drawn in 1983  		from the caseloads of three cities. As such the results can only be  		extrapolated to these three caseloads for the time frame of August 1983-October  		1984. Yet, given the general absence of information about childcare in  		relationship to welfare, we are drawn to speculate about the possible policy  		implications of the results for a wider population.</p>
<p>We would like to comment first on the amount of productive activity  		among sample mothers over the 14 month period. At a time predating the full  		scale implementation of welfare to work initiatives, 43 percent of the mothers  		with children under age 6 had a job during the period; 24 percent went to  		school or a job training program; 12 percent looked for work without sucess;  		and only 36 percent did not participate in any of these activities. Moreover  		mothers with a youngest child under age 2 were just as likely to work as  		mothers of 2-5 year-olds, and they we re more likely to have looked for work  		without success. Our sample represents cross-sections of the AFDC caseloads of  		the 3 cities; long term welfare recipients are therefore over-represented  		because of length biased sampling (Cox and Isham, 1980). Cumulatively sample  		mothers had been on welfare for over 5 years, on average, since their first  		applications. Even so, the data show that almost two-thirds of them looked for  		jobs, got jobs, or participated in job readying activities over a 14 month  		period. This high level of activity belies stereotypes and program assumptions  		about welfare recipients. It is clear that the majority of these recipients  		voluntarily got jobs, or tried get work or get ready for work. These high  		levels of activity without special programs suggest that the employment,  		training and child care provisions of the Family Support Act will find a  		receptive audience.</p>
<p>When they engaged in these productive activities, AFDC mothers in our  		samples relied heavily on relatives, and on grandparents in particular to  		provide child care. This pattern of reliance on relatives for care in our AFDC  		sample is similar to national data for non-married employed mothers gathered in  		1984-1985 in the SIPP survey (see <a href="parents-child-care-preferences-patterns-among-welfare-mothers.html#Table2">Table 2</a>). A nagging  		issue in the public debate about child care is the lack of attention to care  		provided by relatives as a piece of the puzzle. In the mid-seventies Woolsey  		(1976) drew attention to this gap, suggesting that many parents prefer that  		relatives take care of their children. Our analyses suggest that although in-  		home care by relatives gets high ratings from welfare mothers on some of the  		dimensions that appear related to satisfaction with care--convenience of  		location and hours, low child to adult ratio, and child's happiness, when these  		factors are controlled, use of this form of care results in reduced  		satisfaction (compared to non-relative care). In the same analyses, care by  		relatives outside the child's home does not have the same negative effect.  		Perhaps in-home care by relatives carries hidden interpersonal costs or implies  		lack of real choice, problems that may not emerge when out-of-home relative  		care is used.</p>
<p>What are the attributes of care that contribute to higher levels of  		mothers' satisfaction with the arrangement? The AFDC mothers using child care  		in our samples appeared to be concerned with the adequacy of adult supervision  		and the convenience of the hours of care. Mothers with youngest children under  		the age of 3 are also concerned about the convenience of the location of the  		arrangement and lower child to adult ratios. Mothers with older preschool  		children are concerned about whether their children are happy in the  		arrangement and whether, they get the opportunity to learn new things. These  		characteristics of care appear more powerful than child care type (group care,  		non-relative care, relative care) in explaining mother's satisfaction with the  		arrangement. Indeed when the same models of satisfaction were run without the  		child care type variables the results were essentially the same except that the  		training of the child care provider emerged as a predictor of mother's  		satisfaction for children under the age of 3 (p=.07).</p>
<p>These findings suggest that certain characteristics of care--convenient  		hours and location, adult supervision, child to adult ratios, learning  		opportunities, and child's happiness--are more important to parents than the  		care type itself in explaining their satisfaction with care. Policies aiming to  		maximize parental choice and satisfaction should therefore foster approaches  		that will enhance all types of child care on these important dimensions. Some  		of these care characteristics readily lend themselves to policy interpretation.  		For example, a large proportion of the mothers in the sample worked hours that  		are not part of the regular business day, before 7:00 am and after 6:00 pm.  		Other mothers worked on weekends. Since convenient hours are an important  		factor in parents satisfaction, targeting efforts to expanding the availability  		of child care in the "off hours," early morning and evening would provide care  		that might be more responsive to parents' needs. Similarly efforts could be  		targeted to improve the geographic accessibility of infant care, reduce child  		to adult ratios for infant care, and improve the learning opportunities in care  		for older preschool children.</p>
<p>Our findings support the expansion of a diverse range of child care  		options for AFDC mothers as the child care guarantees of the Family Support Act  		are implemented. Just focusing on expanding the traditional service system of  		centers and family day care will not be enough. Some parents use and prefer  		care by relatives and friends. Concentrating on increasing the supply of child  		care during regular business hours will only be a partial solution. Many  		parents work other hours. If AFDC parents are to be empowered to choose their  		own child care arrangements, new approaches are needed to enhance the existing  		care system so it is more responsive to the preferences of these parents.</p>
