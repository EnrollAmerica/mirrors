<div class="report-abstracttitle">Abstract</div>
<div class="report-abstract">      In 2009 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funded a project designed to better understand how to support parents throughout children’s development in order to ultimately promote positive long-term outcomes; in particular, positive adolescent development and reductions in risky behavior.  A major task of the project was a literature review that examines what is known about parenting across the developmental stages of childhood and adolescence, how different parenting dimensions or behaviors relate to outcomes for adolescence, and what is known about the strategies and effectiveness of interventions to improve parenting practices. The review draws on two linked research literatures: theoretical and empirical research on children’s development and the role played by parental and other influences on that development and on outcomes in adolescence; and evaluative research on programmatic approaches to improving parenting. The report was prepared under contract by Abt Associates.    </div>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The current literature review was prepared as part of a  project entitled <i>State of the Science and Practice in Parenting  Interventions across Childhood</i> that was funded by the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services.  The project focused on providing a better  understanding of how to support parents throughout children’s development in  order to promote positive adolescent development and reduce risky behaviors in  adolescence, particularly sexual risk behaviors. A major task of the project was  a literature review that examines what is known about parenting across the  developmental stages of childhood and adolescence, how different parenting  dimensions or behaviors relate to outcomes for adolescence, and what is known  about the strategies and effectiveness of interventions to improve parenting  practices. The review draws on two linked research literatures: theoretical and  empirical research on children’s development and the role played by parental  and other influences on that development and on outcomes in adolescence; and  evaluative research on programmatic approaches to improving parenting. </p>
<p class="AbtHeadA"><a name="_Toc332628641" id="_Toc332628641">Theoretical and Research Framework  for the Review</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Parenting  is a developmental process; it is formulated over time and amid a   system of changing relationships”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Managing  to Make It, pp. 103-4</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This section of the report reviews what the theoretical  and empirical research literature tells us about the links between parenting  behavior and adolescent risk-taking behavior. We recognize, at the outset, that  many different factors influence the decisions that adolescents make about  their lives. The child is born into and grows up surrounded by a web of  influences that interact with each other and with him or her. Parental  influence, so central in the child’s early life, retains its importance as the child  moves through school and into adolescence, but must contend with competing  influences. Other elements, such as friends and peers, the media, and a variety  of environmental factors, as well as the child’s own genetic and biological  make-up exert considerable influence and interact with each other.  Nevertheless, some of the aspects of parenting that were supportive and  protective earlier in the child’s life continue to shape the adolescent’s  decisions and actions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One question posed for the review was “How do early  parenting practices relate to later parenting practices and adolescent  outcomes?” In this review, we will discuss evidence that supports the argument  that the aspects of parenting and family relationships and interactions that  are critical to children’s well-being in early life continue to be important as  the child moves through childhood to adolescence, although the <b><i>expression  </i></b>of them may change to adapt to children’s developmental needs. We  consider the ways in which the characteristics of the child, the parent (or  significant adult), the family and the social and economic environment affect  youth wellbeing both directly and through their effects on parents’ behavior  and interactions with the child; and consider evidence that supports the view that  there may be critical periods in the child’s life when the actions and behavior  of parents (or parental figures) have the potential to be most significant. </p>
<p>    <b><span></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Adolescent Risk Behaviors as a Public Health  Issue</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Among the many changes that  take place as youth move from childhood to adolescence is an increase in  risk-taking and sensation-seeking behavior. For reasons that are not yet  completely understood, risk-taking behavior increases in adolescence and  decreases as youth move into adulthood. Behaviors such as binge drinking,  smoking and drug use, driving recklessly or under the influence of alcohol,  engaging in violent and antisocial behavior, and engaging in risky sexual  behaviors (sex with multiple partners, casual sex, unprotected sex) pose  immediate and longer-term threats to the health and well-being of youth, as  well as to others who may be affected by their behavior. Although the rates of  some types of risk-taking behavior have dropped, their prevalence remains high  and, taken together, they represent a major public health challenge (Steinberg,  2008). The CDC reports that, in 2011, nearly 40% of high-school-age youth did  not use a condom the last time they engaged in sexual intercourse and, in the  last 30 days, one-quarter rode in a car driven by someone who had been  drinking, nearly one-quarter reported multiple episodes of binge drinking, and six  percent were regular smokers  (CDC 2012). More than 25% of a  nationally-representative sample of adolescent girls aged 14-19 had a sexually  transmitted infection, according to a second CDC report (Forham et.al., 2008,  cited in Coley et al., 2009). Rates of teenage pregnancy and births to teen  mothers are also higher than in other developed countries, and are especially  high for some minority groups and in areas with high concentrations of poverty.  Steinberg (2008) uses evidence from AddHealth to argue that these problems have  not been ameliorated by widespread exposure to school-based educational  programs designed to reduce smoking, drinking, drug use and unprotected sex. </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>It seems plausible that  interventions to reduce risk behavior would be more effective if based on a  clear understanding of the trajectories that lead youth to these behaviors and  the characteristics of young people, their families and their surroundings that  protect against risky behavior (or, alternatively, place youth at risk). While  research has helped our understanding of the precursors of some risk behaviors  (violent and anti-social behaviors, for example), the early warning signs and predictors  of others, such as risky sexual behavior, are not well understood. By contrast,  a substantial body of research exists on the aspects of youth and their  environments that are protective against risk behaviors that threaten their  well-being (although the interactions among these factors are also not  well-understood).</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>What Characteristics of Adolescents are  Associated with Avoidance of Risk Behaviors?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While adolescence is a time of change and exploration and,  for many, increased risk-taking, not all youth engage in the kinds of reckless  behaviors that pose threats to their future well-being and to the health and  safety of others. A number of researchers have attempted to identify the  characteristics of young people that armor them against these behaviors. Brody  et al., (2004) identify five factors that protect against early alcohol use and  initiation of sex: “a planful future orientation; resistance efficacy; negative  attitudes toward alcohol use and sexual activity, negative images of drinking  youths; and acceptance of parental influence”. These factors emerge from social  control theory, social development theory, problem behavior theory and  self-control theory and have empirical support. Although Brody’s own work  establishes resistance efficacy and acceptance of parental influence as more  narrowly protective against alcohol and substance abuse among rural  African-American youth (Brody et al., 1998; Brody et al., 2000), a wide range  of empirical research supports the hypothesis that the five factors (or similar  factors) are protective across ethnic groups.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></a>  Adolescents who plan for the future and set goals for themselves, even those  who are growing up in high-risk environments, are less likely to experience  social and psychological problems (Werner and Smith, 1982, 1992). They are more  likely to plan and monitor their own behavior, less likely to abuse alcohol or  drugs (Keough, Zimbardo, and Boyd, 1999). The ability to resist pressure from  peers, acceptance of parental influence, and negative perceptions of deviant  behavior have been identified as protective against both early alcohol use and  sexual activity (see, among others, Bogenschneider et al., 1998; Jessor and  Jessor, 1997; Lee and Stall, 1993). Similarly, strong theory and empirical  research link youths’ adjustment to and engagement with school and motivation  to succeed academically with both achievement and behavior (Hawkins and Weis,  1985; Andrews and Duncan, 1997; Barber and Olsen, 2003). Youth who are  unmotivated and disengaged from school are more likely to drop out of school  and/or engage in antisocial and risky behavior (Andrews and Duncan, 1997).</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628642" id="_Toc332628642">Parenting to Reduce Adolescent Risk  Behavior and Promote Positive Outcomes</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although, as we noted earlier, parental influence on  children’s behavior diminishes somewhat with the onset of adolescence, a  substantial body of research supports its continued importance in shaping the  behavioral decisions that youth make. This influence manifests itself in a  cluster of parent behaviors, parent-child and family interactions and  transactions. Although some research (and programming influenced by it) has  focused on specific behaviors, such as “parent-child communication”,  “consistent, positive discipline”, there is increasing recognition that a  specific behavior is only effective in the context of other behaviors and  interactions. At the core of effective parenting of adolescents is a  relationship between the parent and child that is warm, trusting and  supportive. Parent-child connectedness and positive involvement in children’s  lives has been shown to be protective against early sexual initiation, and  alcohol and cigarette use (Blum, 2002).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"><span><sup>[2]</sup></span></a>  Similarly, Miller (1998), in a synthesis of the research on family influences  on adolescent pregnancy, found that the quality of the relationship between the  parent and adolescent influences adolescent sexual risk behavior – positive  relationships were associated with reduced risk of teen pregnancy. While  offering support for the notion that parental closeness and support influence  both adolescents’ attitudes towards sex and their sexual behavior, Longmore and  colleagues argue that it is parenting strategies (supervision, monitoring) that  lay the basic foundation for adolescent decision-making and influence dating  and sexual behavior in adolescence(Longmore et al., 2001).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><span><sup>[3]</sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A pattern of behavior that is both demanding and  responsive, characterized by Baumrind (1991) as “authoritative” and by Brody et  al. (2004) as “involved-vigilant” is, in both paradigms, viewed as the most  effective way to parent children in middle childhood and adolescence. A warm  and trusting relationship, positive communication and appropriate styles of  regulation and control are important factors in parents’ ability to instill  beliefs and values, foster motivation and help children develop social and  intellectual skills (Baumrind, 1989; Steinberg, 1990; Steinberg et.al., 1991).  Although many of the early studies of authoritative parenting were based on  samples of White middle-class youth, the last of these studies provided  convincing evidence that, across ethnic groups, social classes and different  family structures, adolescents whose parents demonstrated this pattern of  parenting were more successful in school, more self-reliant, reported less  anxiety and depression and were less likely to engage in anti-social behavior.  Steinberg’s operationalization of authoritative parenting demonstrates the  challenge that parents face; in the context of an involved and accepting  relationship, they must balance firm and clear control with support for the  increasing autonomy that is essential to adolescent development and for a  democratic approach to family decisions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Different theoretical frameworks suggest the mechanisms  through which parental emotional warmth, responsiveness and support combined  with clear communication (of information, rules, values and expectations),  non-punitive discipline, monitoring of youth activities and involvement in  joint activities encourage the development of prosocial and self-regulation  skills that, in turn, help youth to avoid sexual and other problem behaviors.  The absence of these skills increases the likelihood of early alcohol use,  early sexual activity and other risk behaviors (Jessor and Jessor, 1977;  Patterson et al., 1989). Empirical research offers support for these  propositions. Authoritative parenting practices have been shown to protect  adolescents from problem behavior and to support the development of social  competence, adjustment to school and school performance (see, among others,  Baumrind, 1991; Simons-Morton and Haynie, 2002; Steinberg et al., 1994;  Steinberg, 2001). Brody and his colleagues, in their work with African-American  youth specifically, have demonstrated that involved-vigilant parenting  practices protect African-American youth from engagement in antisocial activity  and promote their development of self-regulation skills (Brody et al., 1999;  2002). Across ethnic and socio-economic groups, research has shown that parents  need to be involved with their child, to monitor his or her activities and  behavior and to provide effective and consistent discipline (Gorman-Smith et  al., 1999; Patterson, 1982; Paterson et al., 1992). Continued emotional support  from parents is a strong protective factor and its absence is linked to adolescent  substance use and early initiation of sex, among other risk behaviors (Wills et  al., 1996; 2004). By itself, parental emotional warmth and support reduces the  relationship between cumulative risk factors and negative outcomes for youth  (Ackerman et al., 1999). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Coley and her colleagues offer a different perspective on  the interaction loop between parents and youth, citing transactional models of  problem behavior in which youth, as they begin to engage in problem behavior,  disengage from parents. As a consequence, parents become less involved and more  negative, possibly leading to escalating problem behavior. However, their  research, as well as that of others, does not support the bidirectional models,  though it does provide support for the influence of parent involvement in  children’s lives, through joint activities and routines. Their analysis of  growth trajectories of both youth sexual risk behavior and parenting practices,  which allowed them to trace the direction of influence, supports the hypothesis  that involved parenting and regular family activities are protective against  sexual risk behavior in adolescence (Coley et al., 2009).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The aspects of parenting behavior that theory and research  have identified as effective and protective in adolescence have their  foundation in parenting behavior and interactions in early childhood. in two  ways. The connections and interactions established in early childhood influence  children’s responses in later childhood. When parents have established a warm  emotional bond and provided clear and consistent messages about rules and  expectations, the strong attachment created motivates children to respond  positively to later parental rules and demands, even faced with external  pressure to behave in other ways (Furstenberg et al. 2004). In the next  section, we discuss what theory and research tells us about the foundational  role of parenting in the early lives of children.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628643" id="_Toc332628643">Parenting in Early Childhood</a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In infancy, the role of the caregiver is to establish  routines, patterns of interaction and patterns of communication. From the  earliest moments of the child’s life, attachment theory tells us, the emotional  warmth and responsiveness of the parent or primary caregiver is the prime  contributor to the child’s development of trust, of a sense of self, and of the  capacity to engage in future healthy relationships. The theory is supported by  decades of research that links maternal verbal and physical responsiveness to  secure attachment and accelerated development (see, for example, Bakeman and  Brown, 1980; Barnard et al., 1988, Clarke-Stewart, 1973, Ramey et al., 1979,  Sroufe, 1985, Yarrow et al., 1975). Even in high-risk families (low  socioeconomic status, low social support), the mother’s ability to engage her  child in positive and stimulating interactions seems to operate as a protective  factor (Spieker and Booth, 1988). In the absence of such emotional support,  children experience anxiety, which disrupts development (Mahler et al., 1975;  Winnicott, 1975; Bowlby, 1969). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, researchers have linked the child’s early  emotional experiences and social and behavioral adjustment to school success  and to later cognitive development, including the development of complex  capacities such as reality testing and judgment (Greenspan, 1994; 1996). The  psychological research is supported by the work of by neuroscientists like  Antonio Damasio on the function of the prefrontal cortex and the consequences  of damage to it (Damasio, 1994).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A harbinger of parents’ later ability to communicate clear  behavioral expectations, rules and boundaries can be found in parents’ ability  to provide clear cues to their infant and young child about what they are doing  and what they want the child to do, and to perceive and respond to cues from  the child about his or her needs (Barnard, 1982). Positive communication moves  from gestural and language cues in infancy to clarity about expectations,  boundaries, and values in early childhood.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">From cognitive developmental theory comes Vygotsky’s  proposition that parents (along with teachers and others later in the child’s  life) promote children’s cognitive development by actively supporting and  scaffolding activities that lead the child to think and learn (Vygotsky,1978).  Support for learning moves from language and encouraging exploration of the  environment in the early years to include supporting the increasing autonomy  and decision-making ability that adolescents need as well as for school  attachment and educational achievement that can protect against risk behavior</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The final element that foreshadows later parenting  behavior is so taken for granted that it is seldom mentioned. The vigilance or  monitoring behavior that is seen as important in later childhood and  adolescence is crucial in infancy and early childhood. The parent or primary  caregiver must constantly monitor the child’s state and activity, as well as  his or her immediate surroundings to determine whether he or she is too hot,  too cold, hungry, thirsty, tired, unwell, needing a diaper change or toileting assistance,  in a dangerous situation or struggling with a task beyond their ability to  complete.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628644" id="_Toc332628644">Parenting in Interaction with  Characteristics of the Child</a> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The discussions in the preceding sections suggest some  convergence on the elements of parenting that provide support for positive  development and protect against risky behavior from early childhood through  adolescence. While, as we have seen, there is some support for the idea that  these elements are important across different ethnic groups, socio-economic  strata and family types, we should acknowledge that their relative importance  and emphasis may be influenced by characteristics of the child himself or by  aspects of the environment. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although, from Bronfennbrenner’s work, we recognize that  parental behavior not only shapes but is also shaped by the child’s cues or  responses, other research suggests in more detail the ways in which this may  happen and some implications for parenting strategies. At the most basic level,  the science of behavioral genetics has led some researchers to speculate that  the emotional and cognitive dispositions that children are born with interact  with elements of their environment to enhance or undermine their development  (IOM, 2002). Greenspan (1997) argues that the interaction of inborn  neurological deficits with environmental stresses and certain types of  parent-child relationships increases the likelihood of antisocial behavior. He  gives one example of children who crave sensation because they are  “underreactive to touch and sound and insensitive to pain” (The Growth of the  Mind, p.145). Later, they seek stimulation in risk-taking, but the thrills can  result from positive experiences such as exploring or adventure, or negative  ones such as gang activity or robbery, depending in large part on the family  and community in which the child lives. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Greenspan proposes that these children, as well as active,  aggressive children, need a different and more intense type of parenting than  other children, beginning in early childhood. The basic elements remain:  emotional warmth, but even more of it; limits applied lovingly but very firmly;  intimate communication to help the child name feelings, consider consequences  and develop compassion for others; and help in controlling physical energy or  channeling it into constructive activity. Greenspan proposes four other  personality types in addition to the two described here: the highly sensitive  child, the inner-focused child, the strong-willed child and the child with  attention difficulties. For each, he suggests that some or all of the elements  of effective parenting described earlier must be tailored to meet the needs of  the child. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As well as adaptation to the child’s personality, the  expression of these basic behaviors changes in response to the child’s  developmental needs. As the child develops, parents must balance vigilance and  monitoring and the child’s need to explore his environment and gradually  establish independence. At times of rapid change in the child’s development (as  a toddler, and then in late childhood/early adolescence), the parent’s ability  to adapt his or her behavior may be slow to catch up with and adapt to the  changes, and the result is conflict between parent and child because of the  lack of “developmental fit” (Eccles et al., 1993). </p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628645" id="_Toc332628645">Environmental Moderators of Parenting  Effectiveness</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The focus of this review is on parenting behavior and its  links to adolescent behavior. However, other factors influence children’s  development both directly and indirectly through their influence on parents’  behavior. Bronfennbrenner’s developmental-ecological theory (1979) tells us  that individual development is influenced by characteristics of the  environments that the child experiences as well as by their interaction with  one another. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Characteristics of the family unit and the way it  functions, that may be beyond the parent’s control, affect the child directly,  but also constrain the parent’s ability to be effective. Low levels of  emotional warmth and cohesion among family members, the absence of clear family  roles, responsibilities and boundaries and little or no recognition of the  importance of family are associated with adolescent risk behavior and  delinquency (Farrington, 1994; Gorman-Smith et al., 1996). Parental education  levels and financial resources can constrain parents’ ability to support their  children’s learning and education. Lareau (1989) argues that working class and  poor parents are at a loss when it comes to interacting with schools and being  effective advocates for their children and lack resources to provide  educational and cultural experiences outside school.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There is increasing emphasis on the effect of neighborhood  and community on both children and their families (Chase-Lansdale and Gordon,  1996; Furstenberg, 1993; Furstenberg et al., 1999; Jarrett, 1995). In  high-risk, dangerous neighborhoods, effective parenting may include a higher  level of behavioral control than would be necessary in other contexts. Brody et  al. (2004) cite pervasive racism as a contributing factor in substance abuse,  and compromised psychological functioning that leads to low educational  aspirations and the abandonment of life goals among African-American youth. For  these youth, effective parenting includes teaching children about the reality  of racism while emphasizing the need to strive for success.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Even more significant, for the purpose of this review, is  the research evidence on the interactions among community characteristics,  family functioning and parenting characteristics, and the effects of these  interactions on delinquency and risk behavior. Gorman-Smith and her colleagues  investigated these questions in their analysis of data from the Chicago Youth  Development Study, a longitudinal study of serious delinquent behavior among  adolescent African-American and Hispanic males living in 17 inner-city  neighborhoods (Gorman- Smith et al., 2000). They found that, while the  protective effect of strong family functioning and consistent parenting  remained, the effect was lower in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods.  Effective parenting practices and cohesive and organized families could reduce  but not eliminate the negative effects on youth of stressful neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628646" id="_Toc332628646">Parenting During Critical Periods in  the Child’s Life</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As decades of research have made clear, the earliest years  of life are a critical developmental period, in which parents or parent  surrogates play an essential role. Parental behavior and interactions with  their children in the earliest years of life lay the foundation for later  emotional and cognitive development, healthy relationships and life success.  More recently, attention has focused on transitional periods, most notably the  move to middle school, a time when children’s school engagement and motivation  declines, along with educational achievement. Eccles and her colleagues  speculate that the poor fit between the middle school environment,  characterized by rules, control and discipline, and the developmental stage of  early adolescence, in which youth need to experiment with and assert their  individuality may reduce student attachment to school and motivation to succeed  academically (Eccles et al. 1996, Roeser and Eccles, 1998). Reduced engagement  with school and motivation to succeed makes youth more likely to drop out of  school or engage in antisocial and risky behavior (Andrews and Duncan, 1997;  Steinberg and Avenovoli, 1998, among others). Effective parenting might  ameliorate this effect but, unfortunately, because children are experiencing  simultaneous physical, psychological, emotional and cognitive changes, there is  often also a poor fit between parenting practices and children’s rapidly  changing needs. This is typically not the period in childhood on which parent  interventions or empirical research has focused, so we have little information  about it, but it is perhaps the last chance we have to improve the adolescent  experience in a meaningful way. Even parents who have navigated the early  childhood years successfully may struggle to address children’s developmental  needs and help ease the transition to adolescence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Recently, attention has focused on adolescence itself as a  critical period in children’s development, although there is no consensus on  how parental behavior and interactions with teens can affect that development.  Steinberg (2008), summarizing over a decade of research on brain development,  describes continuing significant changes in brain structure and function that  continue through adolescence and into young adulthood that seem to have  consequences for adolescents’ engagement in risk behavior. These changes are  not synchronized: that is, the changes in the brain’s socio-emotional system in  puberty that are believed to lead to increased risk-taking (reward-seeking)  precede changes later in adolescence in the brain’s cognitive control system  that are linked to improvements in the capacity for self-regulation.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like others he argues that adolescent engagement in risky  behavior is not the result of “ignorance, irrationality, delusions of  invulnerability, or faulty calculations” (Reyna and Farley, 2006).  Rather, the  conclusion he draws from the research is that “heightened risk-taking is likely  to be normative, biologically driven and, to some extent, inevitable”.  (Steinberg, p.100).  This conclusion leads to some pessimism about the likely  effectiveness of interventions that seek to prevent or ameliorate adolescent  risk behavior by changing parental awareness and behavior with their children.   He acknowledges the link that his own research as well as that of others has  established between “authoritative” (warm but firm) parenting and lower levels  of adolescent anti-social and risk behaviors. However, the mediating factor may  not be increased levels of self-regulation, as many researchers have  hypothesized, but external constraints (imposed by parental vigilance) on  teens’ access to risky situations and harmful substances<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"><span><sup>[4]</sup></span></a>.  While  Steinberg goes on to argue that public policy might be better focused on  strategies to limit the harmful consequences of risky behavior (raising the  price of cigarettes, vigilantly enforcing the laws prohibiting sales of alcohol  to minors, expanding access to mental health and contraceptive services), he also  highlights our ignorance about the effects of changing the context in which  adolescents function on their development of self-regulatory capacity.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628647" id="_Toc332628647">Discussion</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The evidence that there are parent behaviors and  interactions that are important for healthy development from early childhood on  seems to hold across socioeconomic and ethnic groups, although it is  increasingly clear that they are individualized and responsive to children’s  temperament and environmental threats. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>The research discussed  above supports the idea that the basis for effective parenting across  developmental stages is a <b><i>warm</i></b></span><b><i> and supportive  relationship</i></b> that lays the foundation on which mutual trust and  acceptance can be built. On the parent’s part, this means acknowledging and accepting  the child’s individuality early in life, accepting and supporting the growing  child’s need for both autonomy and inclusion, and responding positively to the  child’s efforts. As the child moves into adolescence, this foundation allows  him or her to acknowledge and accept parental influence and authority, and to  play a role in family decision-making. Within this context, <b><i>communication</i></b>  is important. Parents communicate rules, values, expectations, and behavioral  consequences, provide information and explanations, and encourage questions.  The extent and content of the communication may change over time as the child  grows, beginning with the effort to help the young child make sense of the  world and moving to helping the pre-adolescent make informed and positive  decisions. <b><i>Consistent, positive discipline</i></b> that is  developmentally-appropriate is a third element of effective parenting over  time. A fourth element, <b><i>monitoring </i></b>the child’s behavior and  activities, focuses on protecting the child’s physical well-being in early  childhood and expands to include monitoring of friendships and activities that  could pose a threat to other aspects of the child’s well-being as the child  spends more time away from home. Vigilance about associations with anti-social  peers and activities may continue to be protective through the adolescent  years. A final element is <b><i>involvement in joint activities, </i></b>including  daily routines, family meals and recreational and other activities. Exhibit 1  is a visual representation of parental and other influences and the  interactions among them and with the child him or herself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The guidance offered by this research for interventions  with parents is less clear. The research does not provide conclusive answers to  some questions and does not address others. For example, are all elements of  parenting amenable to improvement or only some? Are parenting strategies  flexible over time for most parents?  Can we improve some aspects of parenting  but not others, and does changing a single aspect of parenting by itself affect  outcomes for children and youth?  To change outcomes for youth, is it necessary  to intervene with others in addition to parents – teachers, other adults or the  children themselves?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the absence of clear evidence of the superiority of one  strategy over another, programs fall back on theoretical models and test a  variety of strategies. In the remainder of this review, we examine a collection  of program models that all feature parent training either by itself or as an  important component of a larger intervention and that intervene with parents  (and often with their children) at different points in the child’s development.  From their evaluations we hope to derive answers to some of the questions posed  above. </p>

<p class="AbtHeadA"><a name="_Toc332628648" id="_Toc332628648">Interventions to Improve Parenting</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The next step in the review was to identify programs or  interventions that work with parents to improve parenting strategies, with the  goal of preventing or reducing risk behavior in children and youth. Building on  the central role that parents and family play in the healthy development of  children, many programs and interventions have been developed to support  parents’ roles in healthy development and in protecting against later negative  outcomes for youth. Interventions and programs for parents begin in the  prenatal stages and progress to early childhood, early adolescence and  middle-childhood, and continue into young adulthood. These interventions vary  in many ways: in the types of families served (e.g., parents of children with  identified behavior problems, low-income families at risk, parents with  children at risk for engaging in high-risk behaviors); emphasize different  content (e.g., knowledge of child development, communication, behavior  management strategies); and use different settings to deliver the program  (e.g., clinics, community agencies, schools, churches, families’ own homes).  This heterogeneity presents a challenge for any efforts to comprehend or  summarize the universe of programs and the extent to which they are able to  meet their goals. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our mandate was not to conduct a meta-analysis or even a  comprehensive program-by-program review. Rather, the goal was to conduct a review  that would allow us to understand the different strategies and approaches that  have been used in intervening with parents and the results associated with  those strategies. Therefore, while our search of the literature was broadly  encompassing so as not to miss important programs or strategies, it did not involve  the level of rigor one would expect from a meta-analysis or more in-depth  review. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The first step in conducting the scan of the literature  was to define as clearly as possible the parameters of the search, so that the  universe of programs/interventions included was also well defined. There is a  significant body of research on parenting interventions/education conducted  prior to 1999, much of which has been included in meta-analyses or other  reviews. Rather than re-reviewing those individual studies, we limited our  review to research and evaluations published between 1999 and 2009, the year the  review began. In addition, the search was confined to programs that focused on  changing parent behaviors, not just attitudes or knowledge; and included  programs regardless of the age of the child at the time of the intervention.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although we were interested in identifying programs that  had at least some evidence of effectiveness for closer examination, the review  was not designed as a meta-analysis in which the quality of the evidence would  be systematically evaluated. For the initial stage of the review, we included  programs without regard to their demonstrated effectiveness, but noted  statistically-significant outcomes when reported, or the fact of inclusion on  one or more of the lists of “effective programs” that have been developed to  help practitioners and others interested in implementing a program in their  community. These lists include the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs  and Practices (NREPP), the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention’s (OJJDP) Model Programs Guide, Blueprints for Violence Prevention,  and the Promising Practices Network. Many of the programs appeared on more than  one of these lists. </p>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText"><span>For entirely pragmatic reasons, the  review excluded home visiting programs. At the direction of ASPE, programs that  rely almost entirely on home visiting, such as the Nurse-Family Partnership,  Parents as Teachers, HIPPY or Healthy Start, were excluded from the review,  since HHS was simultaneously conducting a thorough review of this research literature.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"><span><sup>[5]</sup></span></a> No other  restrictions were placed on the search.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The scan of programs yielded a total of 108 programs (15  of these were adaptations of existing programs to meet the needs of a specific  ethnic group, or to make a treatment model appropriate for a lower-risk  population). Once this set of programs had been identified, our review  proceeded as follows. First, we systematically extracted information on all the  programs identified, to allow us to make some broad generalizations about their  characteristics and approaches. This description, offered in the next section,  provides a background and context for the second step -- a closer examination  of a subset of programs, discussed later in the review. </p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628649" id="_Toc332628649">Overview of Parenting Interventions</a>  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To describe the range of programs that have intervened (or  are currently intervening) with parents to prevent negative outcomes for  children, we extracted information on the following programmatic  characteristics:</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Theoretical basis for the program;</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Program goals (i.e., changing parenting behavior as an end goal  or as an intermediate step to improved outcomes for the child);</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Timing of intervention (i.e., the period in the child’s life when  the program elected to intervene with parents);</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Setting(s) for the intervention;</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Targeting strategy (universal vs. “specific groups”);</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Service strategy (intervention directed at parents only vs.  parents and children and/or others);</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Evidence of effectiveness (evaluation or inclusion on “effective  practices” list; and </p>
<p class="BulletsLast"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Program impacts (statistically-significant outcomes).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Theoretical Basis for Parenting Programs</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Two kinds of theories shape a program’s decisions about  when, with whom, and how they will intervene. The first deals with how children  develop and the influences on that development. The second kind of theory deals  with how individuals (adults and children) learn. More than half of the  programs reviewed cite one or more developmental theories as a <b><i>framework</i></b>  for their intervention. These include: Bronfenbrenner’s ecological theory of  children’s development; social development theory; attachment theory; and  general theories of child development. The second type of theory is more likely  to shape decisions about how to intervene. Most commonly, programs identify  social learning theory (27%) or cognitive behavioral theory (26%) as the  foundation for their intervention strategy. Social learning theory posits that  individuals learn new behaviors by observing the behavior of others and the  outcomes associated with that behavior, but does not necessarily imply changes  in behavior as a consequence. Cognitive behavioral theory takes social learning  theory a step farther by positing change in cognition as a mediator of  behavioral change.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Program Goals</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All of the programs included in the review had to have the  goal of changing parenting behavior. We were interested in understanding what,  if any, additional goals were articulated, since we assume that changes in  parenting are intended to have impacts on children’s behaviors. Indeed, a  majority (though not all) of programs described one or more goals in addition  to changing parents’ behavior. More than half (54%) of the programs aim to  reduce problem behaviors in young children (externalizing, emotional disorders,  conduct disorders). Almost 60 percent focus on reducing high-risk behaviors  later in the child’s life, although only one-quarter of these focus  specifically on sexual risk behavior. A substantial proportion (44%) establish  positive goals for children and youth, including improved academic achievement.  Programs vary greatly in the narrowness or expansiveness of their goals, and  this is reflected in the program’s scope. At one extreme, an abstinence  education program (<i>Managing Pressures Before Marriage</i>) seeks to increase  communication between parent and child, about pressures to have sex and  parental values, through homework assignments linked to a curriculum for  children in middle school. <i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</i> has a similar,  narrowly-focused goal. At the other extreme is a program (<i>Positive Action</i>)  that aims to increase parent-child bonding, improve family interactions,  improve academic achievement and attachment to school, and decrease a range of  problem behaviors in children and youth across a wide range of ages through a  comprehensive intervention with multiple components working directly with  parents.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Timing of the Interventions</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Because parents face different developmental issues and  behavioral challenges at different stages in the child’s life, it seemed likely  that programs would develop interventions that focus on a relatively narrow  child age-range. To the contrary, and supporting the contention made earlier in  the paper that a core set of behaviors and interactions constitute effective  parenting across the developmental span, programs generally targeted a wide age-range  of children. Of the programs that we reviewed, almost one-third (31%) provide  the intervention to parents of children ranging in age from 12-18 years. About  half intervene with parents of children across even wider age ranges. A  minority of programs target more narrowly – parents of children ages 0-5 years  (10%) and parents of elementary school-age children (6%).<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"><span><sup>[6]</sup></span></a> Programs  that address issues across a wide range of child ages usually develop modular  curricula, with age-specific content.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Setting for the Interventions</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Program services are delivered in a variety of settings,  as we anticipated, including schools, community agencies, hospitals and  clinics, churches, families’ homes, parents’ workplaces, among others. Many  programs do not specify a setting for the program but rather suggest that  program services could be delivered in different settings, depending on the  needs of families in the community. One-quarter of the programs do specify a  single setting for the program, most commonly schools or individual homes.  Programs with multiple components often deliver them in different settings –  for example combining services in schools or community agencies with visits to  families’ homes. Just over 10 percent of programs are delivered in hospital or  clinic settings. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Target Populations</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Programs have three choices about targeting services: they  can offer a program to all comers, regardless of socio-economic status; they  can provide services to parents and families that are considered high-risk  (because of poverty, family structure, parental age, immigrant status etc.); or  they can target families and children with a specific presenting problem. These  three approaches are designated, respectively, “universal”, “selected” and  “indicated”. In the programs reviewed, the largest group (41%) targeted  “indicated” populations. Programs in this category serve families in which a  child has been identified as having a specific problem (conduct disorders,  aggression, mental health problems or chemical dependency). The remaining  programs are almost equally divided between “selected” (31%) and “universal”  (28%) targeting strategies. Those programs that offered services to “selected”  populations, i.e., those considered high-risk, often define the risk in terms  of neighborhood poverty, racial or ethnic characteristics, or high rates of  problem behavior such as gang activity. One program defined the “selected”  population as divorced parents of children between the ages of three and 17  years. Another focused on families living in areas with high rates of gang  activity. Universal programs assume that all parents could use some help  managing children’s behavior effectively or supporting prosocial behavior.  However, in practice, many universal programs are implemented only in poor neighborhoods,  where a greater proportion of families may be at risk for adverse child  outcomes. One exception to this is the Triple P program which, by design,  offers services at all three levels and believes that parenting help offered  universally establishes norms for parenting behavior that enable parents with  more specific needs to reach out for additional help.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span>Which Family Members are Targets of Program  Services?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although the focus of this review is on “parenting  programs”, it is important to recognize that this is not necessarily the way  that programs view themselves. While an important subset of programs deliver  services only to parents, and can be considered “pure” parenting interventions,  in most of the programs reviewed, the parent training or education component is  one of two or more program components, and not necessarily the most intensive  or important.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of the programs we reviewed, the largest single group  (29%) provide services for parents only, with no other program components,  while almost half (46%) deliver a parenting component as one of two or more  components. The remaining programs, which offer services for parents and their  children together are most often clinical, family therapy-based programs, which  sometimes work with children alone as well as in combination with parents and  other family members, but rarely if ever meet only with parents. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In almost half of the programs reviewed, children are the  major focus of program services, but there is a separate component for parents  (40%) and, in almost half of these latter, a third component in which children  and their parents work together on joint activities.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While the programs themselves, and the research literature  on them often say little or nothing about the rationale for these different patterns  of service provision, we feel that the patterns reflect slightly different  hypotheses about the levers of change in families and children. For this  reason, we return to this issue in the next section of the review, which  focuses on a subset of the programs in our sample.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The description of programs provided above, while it  faithfully reflects the universe of programs that met the search criteria, is  of limited value for two reasons. First, it includes many programs that no  longer exist and that may only have existed as part of a research project. A  later task in this project is to obtain more detailed operational information  about programs in the review – information that might assist program planners  and other decision makers. This would clearly not be possible in cases where  the intervention was implemented only in the context of a research project.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Second, the sample is skewed by the inclusion of a number  of programs that are clinical, therapy-based <b><i>treatment</i></b> programs,  rather than prevention programs. The most prominent models are Brief Strategic  Family Therapy (BSFT) and Multisystemic Therapy (MST), designed to address  severe behavior problems, diagnosed substance addiction, and delinquency.  Together with their adaptations, they are disproportionately represented in the  literature, given the necessarily small numbers of families they can serve, and  we believe they are not relevant to the policy issues that the review is  intended to address. For a more in-depth examination of prevention strategies  and their effectiveness, we eliminated these two types of programs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A final screen was applied to the  remaining sample of programs. To be most useful to program planners and  decision makers, a program needs to have some evidence about the kinds of  effects it might be expected to achieve. As we noted earlier, in our initial  scan, we included programs whether or not there existed evidence of their  effectiveness, but noted it when it was present. For this more in-depth review,  we included only programs that had some evidence of effectiveness, as  demonstrated by their inclusion on one or more lists of “effective practices”.  This is not a very stringent criterion; the standards of evidence required for  inclusion on these lists vary greatly in their rigor.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadA"><a name="_Toc332628650" id="_Toc332628650">Review of Program Strategies</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For the more in-depth review of programs, one that  includes an examination of the activities and strategies they use to achieve  their goals and the impacts they achieve, we focused on a subgroup of the  programs in our initial sample, using the exclusion and inclusion criteria  described above to select them. No further selection was made, once these  screens had been applied.</p>
<p class="MsoCommentText"><span>The  group of programs thus identified is quite heterogeneous, varying in the ages  of the children that the program focuses on, the settings for program  activities, the family members and others who are the target of services, among  others. In theory, any of these could be used as a way to group programs for  analysis and discussion. In practice, as we showed earlier, the age-range of  children whose parents may receive services is often quite broad, often more  than one setting is used, and programs are often flexible about the setting for  services. As we noted earlier, the selection of family members and others as  targets for services was intriguing to us because it seemed to embody an  hypothesis about how to achieve program goals, though this was only sometimes  articulated. We therefore opted to group the programs and interventions in  terms of the most basic aspect of their strategy—whether the parenting  intervention constituted the entire program or was one of two or more  components of a program. </span></p>
<p class="MsoCommentText"><span>The  discussion that follows looks across programs and considers the strategies used  by programs in each group to achieve their goals and the outcomes associated  with those goals. More detailed information on the programs discussed here can  be found in the profiles contained in Appendix B</span>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We first consider programs that offer services to parents  only – “pure” parenting interventions – and then go on to consider programs  that serve children and/or other family members and significant adults in  addition to offering services for parents. In some cases, these other programs  really have children as their primary target but include components for parents  and other adults. </p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628651" id="_Toc332628651">Programs Serving Parents Only</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One strategy programs use to address the health and  development of youth is to focus their efforts solely on parents. These  parenting education efforts are intended to assist parents in developing skills  to meet their children’s needs effectively. This may take the form of providing  information to parents, providing role models and opportunities to practice new  skills, and emphasizing child-rearing techniques appropriate to the developmental  stage of the child. By improving parenting practices, either through changing  attitudes, beliefs, or practices, programs address factors that research has  related to early outcomes for children and that in turn have been shown to be  predictive of longer-term well-being. The assumption that seems to underlie  these programs is that working with parents is by itself sufficient to achieve  the positive child outcomes they are hoping for.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Programs targeting parents differ in focus, intensity and  the specific parent behaviors and child outcomes that they are attempting to  change. Programs may target specific parenting practices that the literature  suggests may operate as protective factors, such as positive involvement in the  child’s life, or effective monitoring and supervision or may try to change  specific ineffective parental behaviors and interactions, such as negative  reinforcement, exchanges of aversive behavior, or lack of communication. These  programs, often more universal in nature, may be offered to the general  population of parents or a narrower group of parents and children who are  considered at-risk. Other programs target families who are at even higher risk,  such as foster parents or parents who are recently separated or divorced. They  aim to improve specific behavioral outcomes for children by addressing parent  management strategies. Indicated programs target parents of children who  exhibit aggressive behaviors or who have presented with other behavioral  problems. These programs have all placed their bets on changing parenting  behaviors as the path to improved outcomes for children. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This section includes a brief review of the following  programs that serve parents only:</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Active Parenting Now</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Parenting Wisely</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Saving Sex for Later</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Family Matters</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Helping Encourage Affect Regulation (HEAR ) now Pathways to  Competence in Young Children</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Parenting Through Change</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported)</p>
<p class="BulletsLast"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Positive Parenting Program (Triple P)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The first five of these programs are “universal” programs,  that is, they do not target a specific at-risk group, although they are  frequently used with at-risk groups. Notably, all but one of the programs can  be self-administered in the home by parents themselves, and all but one use electronic  media to deliver the curriculum. <i>Active Parenting Now </i>and <i>Parenting  Wisely </i>deliver education and training to parents through videos, in the  first case, and interactive, computer-based programs that incorporate videos in  the second. Both programs are aimed at parents across a wide range of child  ages (5-12 year-olds, and 3-18 year-olds). Both use video enactments of family  situations and interactions to illustrate ineffective and more effective ways  to handle the situation, highlighting specific parenting skills. The content of  the two programs is quite similar, emphasizing communication, effective  discipline and behavior management. The intensity of the interventions is  somewhat different. <i>Active Parenting Now </i>offers 12 hours of video  instruction, while <i>Parenting Wisely</i> can be completed in 2-3 hours. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The next three “universal” programs target parents of  pre-adolescents (<i>Saving Sex for Later</i>) and adolescents (<i>Family  Matters</i> and <i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</i>) but use quite different  strategies to communicate their message, focus on different aspects of youth  risk behavior and stress somewhat different aspects of parental behavior. <i>Saving  Sex for Later</i> and <i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</i> both focus on  preventing adolescent sexual risk behavior, using three brief (30-minute) audio  CDs in the first case, and reaching out to parents in the workplace through  eight lunchtime workshops in the second. The audio CDs emphasize the importance  of communicating values and expectations to children, setting household rules  and monitoring children’s activities, through stories and scripts that use  drama and humor to deliver the messages. The workplace sessions engage parents  in discussions that focus on communication, monitoring and remaining involved  with adolescent children<i>. Family Matters </i>addresses the issue of  adolescent smoking and alcohol use in a series of health booklets which are  sent to the parent at home and combines information on parenting behaviors such  as monitoring activities and behavior and communication with suggestions for  activities that parents can engage with their children. A health educator makes  follow-up calls to each parent, to answer questions and provide additional  information. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The advantages of the use of electronic media and booklets  are obvious: they make the fewest demands on parent time, allow parents  flexibility in where and when they view or read the materials, and ensure that  every parent targeted has at least an opportunity to participate. One  disadvantage is that parents will usually if not always miss an opportunity to  discuss the materials and messages with other parents. <i>Active Parenting Now </i>attempts  to address this by setting up group discussions on the Internet, but it is not  clear how many parents are interested in or comfortable using this technology.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The next three programs in this category (<i>HEAR,  Parenting Through Change, and KEEP) </i>are not intended for all parents but  are intended to provide information and improve skills for parents whose  children exhibit aggression and other behavior problems. The first, <i>HEAR</i>,  designed for parents of preschool-age children, offers 30 hours of group  sessions led by a clinical psychologist, that combine information on children’s  developmental stages from infancy through adolescence, with role-plays and  other exercises to improve parent-child interactions and parental confidence.  Parents are given assignments to be completed at home. <i>Parenting Through  Change</i> and<i> KEEP </i>are designed for specific groups of parents or  parent surrogates, the first for recently separated parents of boys ages 6-8,  the second for foster and kinship parents of children ages 4 to 12. The  assumption underlying both programs is that the life circumstances of children  in both groups place them at high risk for internalizing or externalizing  behavior and place particular strain on parenting skills. Both programs use  weekly small group sessions (14 in one case, 16 in the other) led by  professional or trained facilitators and employ videotapes to illustrate  challenging situations and demonstrate effective parent responses. The programs  both emphasize limit-setting, effective discipline techniques, understanding  children’s behavior, and managing parents’ own stress. Both use role-plays and discussion  to encourage parental problem solving and sharing of ideas.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The final program, <i>Positive Parenting Program (Triple  P),</i> is similar to the other programs in that it serves parents only, but is  different in that it offers differing levels of intervention that correspond to  gradually narrowing population targets and increasing intensity of services.  The first level, Universal Triple P, is intended to provide information on  child development and effective parenting to a wide range of parents through social  marketing and dissemination of information through community-wide media  outlets. Other levels of the intervention provide for progressively greater  levels of direct interaction with program staff or health professionals,  depending on the needs of parents and the behavioral problems of children. The  assumptions underlying the program are: all families can benefit from  information about effective parenting strategies; some families need more  assistance, but not all of them need the same level of assistance; and service  provision should be efficient, i.e., no family should be given more than is  needed. Reflecting these assumptions, in addition to the tiering of services,  there is considerable flexibility in how the program is delivered within each  level.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628652" id="_Toc332628652">Programs That Target Parents and  Include a Family Activity</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The three programs described here also focus on parent  education and training, but add a secondary component that usually involves  children or youth but does not directly train or educate them. Two are  universal programs although, like most of the other universal programs  described in the report, they are widely used with low-income families. The  third targets families with children who are identified by school staff as  at-risk for mental health problems. The programs are:</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>R.E.A.L. Men;</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Familias Unidas; and</p>
<p class="BulletsLast"><span>·<span>         </span></span>F.A.S.T. (Families and Schools Together)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>R.E.A.L. Men</i> is unique in its focus on male parents  of adolescent boys. The program is designed to delay sexual initiation and  prevent sexual risk behavior through the active involvement of fathers in their  son’s sexual health education. It is delivered in seven two-hour small group  sessions, six of which are attended by fathers only; for the seventh meeting,  fathers and sons attend together. Dinner is served at each session. During the  sessions, fathers are presented with information about adolescent development  and sexuality and the importance of monitoring their sons’ activities and  communicating positive values, practice communication through role-plays and  games, engage in discussions, establish personal goals, and are given take-home  activities. In a final session, sons join their fathers in a game designed to  generate discussion about issues in adolescents’ lives, watch a videotape on  the same topic and celebrate reaching the end of the program.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Familias Unidas</i> targets Hispanic parents of  adolescents in 6th, 7th and 8th grades of school and is built on the assumption  that involved and positive parenting, parent-youth communication and family  support will promote healthy adolescent development and prevent substance abuse  and unsafe sex. The major component of the program is one-hour parent group  meetings, held weekly over a nine-month period.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7"><span><sup>[7]</sup></span></a>   The program moves from building an engaged and supportive parent group to  providing information about adolescent functioning and behavior, with  opportunities for discussion, to active practice of parenting skills such as  communication, monitoring and effective discipline. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the third stage of the parent sessions, school  counselors make home visits to facilitate interaction and discussion between  parents and their adolescent children and to connect families more closely to  the school world. Finally, the program organizes joint activities that promote  positive interactions between parents and children and expose parents to their  children’s peer networks.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Families and Schools Together (</i> <i>F.A.S.T.)</i>,  the third program in this group, targets parents with children in the early  school grades who are identified by teachers as exhibiting behavior problems or  being at-risk for mental health problems. Like the other two programs, it  combines an educational activity for parents with an activity that joins  parents with children and, in the case of <i>F.A.S.T</i>., with other family  members. Unlike the other two, <i>F.A.S.T.</i> treats the family activity as  equal in importance to the parent education component. It differs in several  other ways from the first two programs and, indeed, from many of the programs  described in this report. First, it has no set curriculum. Parents select a  topic for discussion at each of the 8-10 weekly group meetings. Second, it  builds incentives for full participation into the design of the program (aside  from meals, other programs do not as a matter of course offer the kinds of  incentives for participation that are often offered in experimental research on  the program). Unlike many programs that are flexible about the setting in which  the program may be delivered, <i>FAST</i> is planned as an after-school program  in the school setting and a school staff member is part of the team that  facilitates the weekly meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At the same time, it has some commonalities with other  programs described in this review. It is influenced by some of the same  theoretical and empirical research as well as more idiosyncratically by work on  adult education and social capital. It uses the strategy of the family group  meeting to encourage positive interactions among family members. And it seeks  to build protective factors in young people by creating links between parents,  between parents and their children, and between parents and schools, and by  encouraging parental support for learning.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The three programs in this group use the parent-child  activity for somewhat different purposes. <i>R.E.A.L. Men</i> uses the final  session as a way to jump start discussion of sexual issues through an activity  that fathers and sons can engage in together. <i>Familias Unidas</i> staff  organize activities that link parents to their children and their children’s  friends, but the type, form and number of activities is unspecified. In <i>F.A.S.T.</i>,  by contrast, the joint activity that precedes the parent group meeting at each  weekly session is carefully scripted and follows the same routine every week:  families (not just a parent and child) sit together at their own table to share  a meal, after an opening ritual. After the meal, family members play games and  engage in joint activities intended to promote positive communication. Like the  parent component in <i>F.A.S.T</i>., the joint activity is more about building  resilience through a network of positive relationships, than about educating or  training parents.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628653" id="_Toc332628653">Combining Parenting Education with an  Intervention for Youth</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The programs in this group are heterogeneous in several  ways. To begin with, they place different emphases on the two program  components: some place greater emphasis on addressing issues with children or  youth, adding a parent component in support of the youth intervention; others  begin with the parents or family and add services for youth; and a third group  places roughly equal emphasis on both components. For the most part, the  programs deal with parents and youth in groups. However, to a greater extent  than we have seen thus far, some programs in this group tailor the intervention  in response to individual needs. The group includes universal and selected  models as well as programs that offer three levels of services, depending on  family needs.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Program discussed here include:</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>STARS for Families</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Focus on Youth</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Coping Power</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>SAFEChildren</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Adolescent Transitions Program; and</p>
<p class="BulletsLast"><span>·<span>         </span></span>PATHS with Fast Track</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>STARS</i> (<i>Start Taking Alcohol Risks Seriously)</i>  <i>for</i> <i>Families</i>, the only universal program in this category, is a  health promotion model intended to reduce the initiation of alcohol among  middle and high school youth. Designed to be implemented in schools, the  intervention is offered over two years and incorporates three main activities.  In the first year, students 11-15 years old participate in a consultation with  the school nurse, who delivers a brief health lesson on how to avoid alcohol  use. Prior to the intervention, an initial assessment of the individual  student’s stage of alcohol initiation and readiness for change is conducted.  This allows the consultation and subsequent outreach to parents to take into  account individual differences in the student’s stage of initiation into  alcohol consumption. Over a 5-10 week period, parents are sent postcards that  provide guidance on how they can help their children avoid alcohol. In the  second year, students participate in a follow-up consultation with the nurse.  In the third activity, weekly take-home lessons provide activities that parents  and children complete together. Like many of the universal interventions, this  is relatively “light touch”, even though it extends into a second year.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The next three programs all serve a “selected” population  but differ in the focus of the intervention, the ages of children and youth who  are the targets of the intervention, and the intensity of the parent component.  <i>Focus on Youth</i> is the only one of the three to focus specifically on  sexual risk behavior (as well as substance abuse) in high-risk adolescents. The  program for youth is delivered in 8 small-group sessions, in community-based  settings, and focuses on decision-making and prevention strategies. A single  90-minute session for parents is conducted in the home, with the adolescent  present, and focuses on parental monitoring and communication about sexual  risk. A video on these topics is used as the starting point for a discussion  between the parent and the adolescent. As with <i>R.E.A.L. Men, </i>the  assumption underlying the session seems to be that communication needs to be  jump-started in the presence of a facilitator who can help guide the  conversation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Coping Power </i>targets a different population and a  different problem -- pre-adolescent boys who are displaying aggressive behavior  in the school setting and who are referred by classroom teachers to the  program. The program seeks to improve school behavior and reduce the risk for  later substance abuse, as well as covert and overt delinquent behavior, by  increasing youths’ social competence and ability to regulate their behavior and  by supporting parents’ positive involvement with their children. Delivered over  15 to 18 months, the program consists of a youth component and a parent  component. For youth, the program offers 33-34 small-group sessions, each  lasting 40-60 minutes, usually delivered in the school setting. The sessions  deal with behavior regulation and anger management, problem-solving, resistance  and refusal skills and personal goal-setting. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The parent component consists of 16 small-group sessions,  held over the same 15-18 month period, in community settings and at times that  are convenient for parents. The presentations and discussions focus on  appropriate and effective discipline and behavior management, and clear  communication of rules, expectations and consequences. For both parents and  children, the group sessions are augmented by regularly scheduled, brief <b><i>individual  </i></b>contacts with children and parents.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The third of the “selected” interventions, <i>SAFEChildren,  </i>enters children’s lives at a much earlier stage and with a very different  focus than the other two programs. Targeting families in low-income, inner-city  neighborhoods, the program combines an academic tutoring program for children  entering first grade with a parent-focused intervention that recognizes the  role of inner-city neighborhoods in heightening the risks that families and  children face. The program begins as children enter first grade and involves 22  weeks of intervention. For children, the program provides 30 minutes of  individual, phonics-based tutoring in reading, twice weekly, over 22 weeks.  Group meetings for parents are held weekly, for 22 weeks. The sessions, which  combine information, skills practice and group problem-solving, deal with:  children’s development, parenting skills, family relationships; developing a  support network of parents; working with schools; and coping with neighborhood  and community problems.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The last two of the programs in this category,<i> Adolescent  Transitions Program </i>and<i> PATHS with Fast Track, </i>take a quite  different approach to risk prevention. Both begin with the assumption that all  families (in the case of <i>ATP</i>) or all children (in the case of <i>PATHS  with Fast Track) </i>can benefit from some assistance, but perceive the  necessity to augment the basic intervention with additional assistance for  “selected” and “indicated” families. As we noted at the beginning of this  section, programs do not necessarily begin at the same point. <i>ATP </i>focuses  on the parents of youth 11-13 years of age who are making the transition to  adolescence and to high school, and sees parents’ ability to manage family  interactions and youth behavior effectively as the key to prevention of  antisocial and other risk behavior in youth. To this end, for all parents with  children in a middle school, the program offers a Family Resource Center, where  parents can view videotapes that illustrate effective parenting techniques. At  the same time, parents are offered the opportunity to complete a  self-assessment, on the basis of which they may be offered individualized help  and can work with a program staff member to develop a plan of action. At the  “indicated” level, the program provides direct professional help to families  who need additional services. The services may be group meetings for parents,  family therapy, services for the adolescent, case management or any combination  of these for up to a year.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>PATHS with Fast Track </i>begins with a classroom-based  intervention for children in grades 1 through 10, delivered to all children in  a school by a classroom teacher. In the early grades, the program’s emphasis is  on developing social and emotional competence, ability to self-regulate and  social and problem-solving skills. In later grades, the emphasis shifts to  decision making and resistance and refusal skills. The curriculum is delivered  two to three times a week in the elementary grades and is most intensive at  transition points (entry to school, transition to middle and high school).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For families identified as high-risk on the basis of a  screening conducted in kindergarten with both teachers and parents for conduct  problems at home and/or at school, <i>Fast Track</i> offers additional  components. In elementary school, families participate in 2-hour family group  meetings, held weekly for 22 weeks in first grade, and less frequently in the  remaining elementary school grades. At these sessions, parents and children  meet in separate groups for 90 minutes and then participate in 30 minutes of  joint activity. The parent groups focus on developing positive school-parent  relationships, and effective communication and discipline skills and  strategies. The child groups focus on social skills development, including  friendship and play, self-regulation, managing anger, and interpersonal  problem-solving. Families at the highest risk (“indicated”) are offered  individualized services, including:  home visits to help parents develop  problem-solving and family management skills; academic tutoring for children;  and classroom-based peer pairing to promote friendships. In first grade, all  families receive the same level of individualized services; in subsequent  elementary grades, the amount of the three components provided reflects the  family’s needs and level of functioning. </p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628654" id="_Toc332628654">Adding Group Family Meetings to  Parent and Youth Components</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The strategy of bringing family members (a parent and  child at a minimum) together with other families to share a meal, practice  skills and engage in joint activities, before or after adults and children meet  in separate sessions to work on family and youth issues is grounded in a variety  of theories that link parental influence and interactions with children to the  development of protective factors and the reduction of risk behaviors in youth,  some of which were cited earlier in the report. They include a theory of social  development described by Catalano and Hawkins, itself based on theories of  social control and social learning. To illustrate this approach, we have  identified three program models:</p>

<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Iowa Strengthening Families Program; and </p>
<p class="BulletsLast"><span>·<span>         </span></span>The Strong African-American Families Program. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All three programs are universal, target similar age-groups  (pre-adolescent to adolescent), and use a similar format. Youth and their  parents attend weekly group meetings (5-7, depending on the program) which  include time spent in joint activities and separate sessions for youth and  parents. <i>Parents Who Care (PWC)</i> begins each meeting with a light meal  and joint activities, followed by separate sessions and ending with a second  joint session; the other two programs begin with separate sessions and end with  a joint activity. All three programs have as their ultimate goal the prevention  or reduction of risk behaviors such as substance abuse or antisocial behavior  and, in the case of the<i> Strong African-American Families Program, </i>sexual  risk behavior.<i> </i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To accomplish this goal, all three endeavor to build  protective factors in youth both directly, through teaching them decision making,  goal-setting, and resistance skills, and indirectly, by teaching parents  effective supervision, monitoring, communication and discipline strategies. The<i>  Strong African-American Families Program </i>adds to these topics, for both  parents and youth, a focus on the unique challenge posed by racism. For  parents, the program discusses strategies to help children understand their  racial identity and successfully confront the challenge of racism. For youth,  the program teaches strategies to counter racism. The joint sessions offer  parents and youth an opportunity to practice the skills they have learned in  the separate sessions. All of the programs use videotapes to illustrate  curriculum topics, demonstrate family interactions and prosocial behavior, as  well as role-plays, games and other activities that allow parents and youth to  practice skills and encourage family bonding.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628655" id="_Toc332628655">Working with Youth, Parents and  Others to Prevent Risk Behavior</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While the programs described earlier provide services for  parents only or for parents and youth (separately and/or as a family unit), all  but one the programs described below begin with a youth-focused intervention  and add multiple components (for parents, families, teachers and/or community  entities) to strengthen the effect of the youth intervention. The group  includes universal programs as well as programs that target youth at high-risk  for negative outcomes and includes one program that can be implemented either  as a universal or targeted program. The programs vary in the point in the  child’s life when the intervention takes place; some target elementary school  age children and address the issue of aggressive behavior in the early school  years; others address specific risk behaviors (alcohol use, alcohol, violence)  in youth transitioning to adolescence. Rather than focusing on risk, four  programs set out to develop resilience and social competence as universal  outcomes. In this section, we discuss the following programs:</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Positive Action</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Raising Healthy Children (Seattle Social Development Project)</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>LIFT</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Project Northland</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>CASASTART</p>
<p class="Bullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Early Risers Skills for Success</p>
<p class="BulletsLast"><span>·<span>         </span></span>The Incredible Years</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The first four of these programs are universal  interventions, based in schools, but differ from each other in a number of  ways. The first three, <i>Positive Action</i>, <i>Raising Healthy Children</i>  and <i>LIFT</i>, begin early in the child’s school life and emphasize the development  of values, skills and behaviors that will support healthy development and  protect against risk behavior later. <i>Project Northland</i> focuses more  narrowly and later in the child’s school life to reduce adolescent alcohol  abuse.  While both <i>Raising Healthy Children</i> and <i>Positive Action</i>  are multi-year interventions that begin in first grade and continue on (through  the elementary grades in the case of <i>Raising Healthy Children</i> and  throughout the child’s school life, in the case of <i>Positive Action</i>), the  <i>LIFT </i>intervention begins and ends in first grade.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Positive Action </i>has five major components: a  classroom curriculum for grades K-12; school climate development; counseling  for individual children, small groups, and classes; parent and family classes;  and a community involvement and outreach component. The program allows schools  a great deal of flexibility in the selection of components: it is possible to  select a curriculum for grades K-6 only for example, and then combine it with  one or more other components. The program provides classes for parents and  other family members aimed at helping them understand and support positive  actions in their children.  <i>Raising Healthy Children</i>, which is  implemented in the early elementary school grades, has three components: a  youth curriculum, delivered in first, second grades and sixth grades, aimed at  helping children identify and solve social problems through collaboration and  cooperation with their peers. In 6<sup>th</sup> grade, the curriculum trains  students to resist peer pressure to engage in antisocial or risky behavior.   Teachers in all the elementary grades and parents of children in 2<sup>nd</sup>,  3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> grades are trained in  positive behavior management strategies and skills needed to support children’s  academic progress. For the later grades, parents are offered five sessions on  how to reduce their child’s risk for substance abuse. <i>LIFT</i>, the briefest  of the three, delivers three components to first grade children, to parents,  and with teachers and children on the playground. The youth curriculum is  delivered in the classroom, in 30-minute sessions offered two or three times  weekly for 10 weeks, and focuses on social and problem-solving skills,  self-regulation and group cooperation. The parent component is delivered to  groups of parents in 90 minute sessions, weekly over a 6-week period. In the  classroom component, teachers observe the children during recess and points are  awarded for good behavior and subtracted for negative behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Project Northland</i>, the fourth of the universal  programs, targets adolescent alcohol use and is delivered in two phases. In  both phases, a classroom-based curriculum is augmented with parent education  and community outreach. In Phase 1, when students are in grades 6-8, the  curriculum for youth deals with communication skills (talking with parents  about alcohol), norms for alcohol use, and strategies for effecting changes in  programs and policies related to alcohol in their community.  Parents receive  information and advice on communicating with youth, as well as other parenting  skills, through newsletters and homework assignments with scripted activities.   Although there is a classroom curriculum for students in grades 10-12, in this  phase, the program primarily targets the social acceptability and availability  of alcohol in the community.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Two programs, <i>CASASTART</i> and <i>Early Risers Skills  for Success, </i>target youth who are at risk for violence, antisocial and  other risk behaviors in adolescence, either because they live in high-risk  neighborhoods and manifest one or more individual risk factors (<i>CASASTART</i>)  or because they manifest aggressive behavior in early childhood (<i>Early  Risers</i>). While <i>CASASTART</i> is school-based, it is not curriculum-based  and has no specified set of services. Rather, it is a highly-individualized  program for youth 11-13 years old and their families, in which services are  tailored to the specific needs of individual families and delivered in a  variety of settings including the home. Services for youth include academic  tutoring and after-school/summer activities. Services for parents and families  include parenting education classes, community events for parents and family  therapy.  Case managers meet regularly with students, and separately, in the  home with parents, to discuss service needs, develop a service plan and monitor  progress. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By contrast, <i>Early Risers</i> is a carefully-scripted  intervention that targets children 6-10 years old who are exhibiting  aggressive, disruptive or oppositional behavior. The program works with the  children themselves, parents and teachers over a period of two to three years  to effect positive change in children’s academic competence, self-regulation,  social competence and in parental investment in their child. The program has  multiple components: a six-week summer program for children, followed by an  after-school program during the school year; a component that links family  advocates and teachers which begins soon after the beginning of the school year  and runs throughout the year; a family program, with separate sessions for  parents and children, during the school year, and a family support program,  delivered through six or more home visits. The design of the program calls for  participation by children and parents over two or more school years.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Both the parent and youth groups use components of <i>The  Incredible Years</i> program to address (in the case of parents) effective  parenting practices, support for learning, parent stress management and  communication and problem-solving skills and(in the case of the children)  emotional regulation, conflict resolution, making friends and problem-solving,  among other topics.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The last program in this group, <i>The Incredible Years </i>presents  a challenge to efforts to classify it. It can be a universal or targeted  intervention. Unlike the other interventions described here, it is not a single  program but rather a set of components each of which can be used in conjunction  with one or more of the others, or as a stand-alone intervention. Within the  components there is also flexibility: the child training programs can be used  by classroom teachers or by therapists working with small groups of children;  the parent training programs are intended to be delivered in small groups, but  can be adapted for home visits; and the teacher training programs are suitable  for classroom teachers or therapists and are also available for self-study.  This flexibility has enabled many programs to use one or more of the components  to supplement their own programming. The child training curriculum <i>(Dina  Dinosaur</i>), in particular, has strongly influenced the development of a  number of other curricula for similar age-groups.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Intended for children ages 0-12 years their parents and  teachers, <i>The Incredible Years</i> has three major components: a parent  training intervention; a child social skills curriculum; and a teacher training  package. Overall, the parent component is designed to teach parents the importance  of monitoring, how to use effective discipline and behavior management skills,  encourage competent and confident parenting and promote involvement in the  child’s school experience. Each of the age-specific curricula is designed to be  presented in weekly, small-group sessions, each lasting about two hours; the  number of sessions varies, depending on the specific curriculum used. The <i>Dina  Dinosaur</i> curriculum is intended for children 4-8 years old and designed to  improve peer relationships and reduce aggressive behavior at home and in  school. The curriculum includes 120 lesson plans and is delivered 2-3 times a  week during a 15-20 minute circle time discussion, which is followed by small  group activities to practice the skills learned. Teachers are trained to  deliver the classroom curriculum, to weave the activities throughout the school  day and to send home suggestions for activities parents can do with their  child.  An additional part of the teacher training component is designed to  strengthen classroom management strategies and to help teachers promote  children’s prosocial behavior and reduce aggressive behavior. </p>
<p class="AbtHeadA"><a name="_Toc332628656" id="_Toc332628656">Achieving Outcomes</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All the programs described earlier share a common goal: to  improve aspects of parenting behavior that have been linked theoretically and  empirically to more adaptive behavior and fewer risk behaviors in youth. Beyond  this basic commonality, programs vary greatly on a number of dimensions. The  grouping of programs in the last chapter reflects the most basic of these differences  – the choice of which family members are targeted by the intervention. As we  have seen, some focus only on the task of changing parents’ knowledge, skills  and behavior, while others address directly children’s knowledge, skills and  behavior as well as the interactions among family members and the behavior of  other significant adults, such as teachers. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Beyond this major difference in strategy, programs vary  greatly on a number of dimensions, including: the extent to which services are  directed at families with specific risk factors, as opposed to more general  populations; the age-range of children whose families are targeted; the format  and setting chosen for the intervention (self-administered, small group, large  group, in-home, clinic, school or community setting); the intensity (or  intended dosage) of the services; and the specific outcomes that the program  seeks to achieve (protective factors such as the parent, child and youth  knowledge, skills and behavior that predict or mediate youth risk behaviors,  and the risk behaviors themselves). All of this variation would seem likely to  influence the outcomes actually achieved both in terms of their range and the  extent of the program’s effect on them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While the intent of this report is not to engage in a close  examination of the research that supports these programs, we are interested in  understanding the linkages within and across program types and the extent to  which programs with different foci and strategies produce similar or different  outcomes. </p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628657" id="_Toc332628657">Programs that Focus Solely on Parents</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As we noted earlier, our review includes both program  designed for parents only and programs in which a parent component represents  one important part of a larger program. This first group of programs, for which  parents are the sole focus, includes programs aimed at a general population  (universal), those that target specific groups (selected)<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8"><span><sup>[8]</sup></span></a> , and one  tiered program that offers services to parents at several levels. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Universal Programs. </i></b>The universal programs,  which include <i>Active Parenting Now, Parenting Wisely, Saving Sex for Later,  Family Matters</i> and <i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</i>, focus on parent  behaviors in response to normal development in children and, with one  exception,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9"><span><sup>[9]</sup></span></a>  deliver information through videotapes or booklets with little or no contact or  follow-up by program staff. Two of the programs are offered across a broad age  range (3-18 for <i>Parenting Wisely</i>, 5-12 for <i>Active Parenting Now</i>)  while the remaining three target parents of preadolescents and youth in early  adolescence. For the first two, program goals focus on improving aspects of  parental behavior: communication (setting limits, clear expectations about  rules and consequences); support for children’s positive development;  supervision and monitoring; and effective discipline and problem-solving. In  addition, they seek to reduce problem behaviors in children. The programs for  parents of older children focus more narrowly on communication about and  monitoring of adolescent risk behaviors: smoking and alcohol use, in the case  of <i>Family Matters</i>, and sexual risk behavior in <i>Saving Sex For Later</i>  and <i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</i>. <i>Family Matters and Saving Sex for  Later</i> also cite reductions in youth risk behavior as goals. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All five programs have had modest success in achieving  some of their goals, at least immediately after the program ended. Only two, <i>Saving  Sex for Later and Family Matters</i>, directly assessed the impact of the  program on youth. Both have demonstrated impacts on youth that are sustained  for a period of time post-intervention (3-12 months), measured through youth  self-report. <i>Saving Sex for Later</i> showed impacts on aspects of youth  behavior that are seen as mediators of sexual risk behaviors (for example,  associations and behaviors disapproved of by parents); <i>Family Matters</i>  demonstrated impacts on the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use and on the  initiation of smoking. <i>Saving Sex For Later</i>, together with <i>Talking  Parents, Healthy Teens</i> demonstrated effects on the parent behaviors that  the program targeted: communication with teens about sexual risk behaviors  (increasing the amount and the quality of the communication); increased support  from parents as well as increase in the number of rules; and, in the case of  Talking Parents, Healthy Teens, direct parental instruction to youth in the use  of condoms. Youth reports on these outcomes echoed the parents’ reports. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"> The two video-based programs, <i>Active Parenting Now</i>  and <i>Parenting Wisely</i>, measured outcomes immediately post-intervention,  through parent report only. Though both show modest effects on parental  knowledge, attitudes and reported behaviors, the specific behaviors affected  differ across studies. (For example, one study of <i>Active Parenting Now</i>  found more positive attitudes toward children, one reported increased knowledge  of parenting, and better problem-solving skills, another found improved  attitudes toward physical punishment; studies of <i>Parenting Wisely</i> show  similar variation in outcomes.)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Programs for “selected” or “indicated” parent groups.  </i></b>Unlike the universal programs discussed above, which have quite diverse  approaches, the group of programs designed for “selected” groups (KEEP--foster  parents, and <i>Parenting Through Change</i> --recently separated mothers with  young sons, both at high risk for behavior problems in the children they care  for) and an “indicated” group (<i>HEAR</i> – parents of children actually  exhibiting aggressive behavior), share a common approach, as well as common  goals. All three aim to reduce behavioral problems in children by improving  parenting skills. All bring parents together in small groups for weekly  sessions (number of sessions varies from 14-16 and sessions last 90 minutes to  two hours). All three use videotapes, role-plays, games, group exercises and  group discussions. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Both <i>KEEP</i> and <i>Parenting Through Change</i>  improved parenting skills, specifically by increasing positive reinforcement  and decreasing negative disciplinary strategies. For participants in <i>KEEP</i>,  there was a corresponding reduction in foster parents’ reports of child  behavior problems. In addition, children in the <i>KEEP</i> group had higher  rates of reunification with birth parents and fewer placement disruptions than  children in the control group. There were no direct effects on children of <i>Parenting  Through Change</i>. <i>HEAR</i> was able to demonstrate significant effects on  parents’ understanding of child development, satisfaction with and perceived  effectiveness in the parenting role, increased involvement with and  understanding of her child, effectiveness in setting limits for the child and  general feeling of being in control as a parent. There were no significant  effects on children’s behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Because we are interested in understanding the extent to  which parenting interventions have effects that are sustained beyond the  intervention, it is important to note that only one of the eight programs  discussed here gathered information on outcomes beyond those gathered at the  end of the intervention. It is possible that, in some cases, if the changes in  parental behavior were sustained over time, these might result in positive  behavioral changes in children. In addition, many studies had sample sizes that  were almost certainly too small to detect small to moderate effects.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Tiered Program</i></b>. The <i>Triple P</i> program  presents challenges to any attempt to summarize its effects, since studies have  focused on different levels of the tiered intervention and assessed different  outcomes. Evaluating the effects of community-wide television series or media campaign  in isolation from the other levels of intervention has not so far been  undertaken, with the exception of some pre-post studies in Australia. At the  next level, however, in which families self-refer for services to address  perceived behavior problems in their children, <i>Triple P</i> was found to  reduce significantly parent-reported levels of dysfunctional parenting and  parent-reported levels of child behavior problems. The program also had  positive and significant effects on parental mental health, marital adjustment  and levels of parental conflict about childrearing issues. To date, various  levels of the program have been subjected to evaluations that use RCT designs  and have consistently shown significant positive effects on these same outcomes  across a variety of different populations.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of the more than 100 studies of the program, the most  ambitious<i> </i>is the evaluation of a trial of the program as a  population-based intervention with five levels of services, designed to reduce  the incidence of child maltreatment. The outcomes used to measure the program’s  success were three independently-derived community-level indicators-  substantiated child maltreatment, out-of-home placements of children, and child  maltreatment injuries. The program had large effects on all three. The program  developers argue that official data on child maltreatment represent only the  tip of a much larger iceberg, citing data from anonymous telephone surveys of  parents in North and South Carolina that indicate a rate of abuse 40 times greater  than official reports, and similar across socioeconomic boundaries, unlike  official reports. In this view, it is likely that the different levels of the  program work to reduce the number of potential or actual occurrences of abuse  that go undetected, as well as to reduce the use of harsh disciplinary  techniques that may or may not rise to the level of abuse but that may have  adverse consequences for children’s healthy development.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628658" id="_Toc332628658">Programs That Target Parents and  Include a Family Activity</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although the three programs in this group add a family  component to their core program for parents, in two of them parents and their  children are brought together once, for a dinner at the end of the program <i>(R.E.A.L.  Men)</i> or occasionally, as part of an organized social activity <i>(Familias  Unidas)</i>. In the third, <i>F.A.S.T.</i>, the group family meal is a central  part of the program and, ideally, takes place after every parent group session.  <i>Familias Unidas</i> and <i>F.A.S.T. </i>have an ambitious array of goals.  Both wish to increase parental investment in their children, improve academic  achievement through parental involvement with school and reduce problem  behaviors in children. In addition, <i>Familias Unidas</i> seeks to prevent  substance abuse and unsafe sex. <i>R.E.A.L. Men</i>, by contrast, has more  narrowly focused goals: to increase fathers’ involvement with their sons and to  increase communication about sex between male parents and their sons, with the  hope that, as a result, youth would delay sexual initiation and more sexually  active youth would use condoms. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of the three, <i>R.E.A.L. Men</i> came closest to  achieving its goals: both fathers and their sons reported increased  communication about sex, and the program reduced the rate of sexual initiation  at a three-month follow-up. However, the effect on youth faded at the six-month  follow-up. Parents who participated in <i>Familias Unidas</i> reported  increased involvement with their children but the program had no impacts on  youth outcomes. (However, when paired with <i>PATH</i>, a program aimed  specifically at youth, the program demonstrated impacts on tobacco and drug use  and on sexual risk behaviors.)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>F.A.S.T. </i>is a widely adopted program and has been  the subject of many small-scale evaluations and at least one large-scale  experimental evaluation. The impact of the program varies by study – sometimes  parents report lessened social isolation or more involvement with their child.  Most frequently, parents report more involvement with their child’s school –  not surprisingly, since the program is held in the school and a school staff  member, usually a teacher, co-facilitates the sessions. Like <i>Familias Unidas</i>,  the program has been unable to demonstrate strong evidence of impacts on  children; although one study found effects on academic competence, measured by  teacher report, two more rigorous studies that used more objective measures of  achievement (standardized test scores, report card grades) found no effect of  the program.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These findings suggest that the parent-child or family  activity made little contribution to the effects the program hoped to achieve,  although, as a social event, it may have helped to attract parents to the  program (and, in the case of <i>F.A.S.T.</i>, may have kept them involved over  the eight-week period.)</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628659" id="_Toc332628659">Combining Parenting Education with an  Intervention for Youth</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Unlike the programs in the first two groups, the programs  in this category begin with an intervention for youth and add a parenting  component. <i>STARS</i> is a universal program; the populations targeted by the  other three are “selected” or “indicated”, in that two (<i>SAFEChildren</i> and  <i>Focus on Youth with ImPACT</i>) serve high-risk youth and their families,  and the third <i>(Coping Power)</i> intervenes with youth who are displaying  aggressive behavior. The intensity of the parenting component varies  considerably across the four programs; for <i>Focus on Youth with ImPACT</i>,  the parenting component is a single session; in the case of <i>STARS</i>,  postcards are sent to the home over a period of five to ten weeks and, later,  youth are given take-home assignments to complete with their parents. <i>Coping  Power’s</i> parent component is a substantial one, with about half as many (16)  sessions for parents as for youth. In <i>SAFEChildren</i>, the parent component  is as intensive as the youth component; both take place each week over a  22-week period. Both <i>STARS</i> and <i>Focus on Youth</i> aim squarely at  outcomes for youth; in the first case, reducing the initiation of alcohol use  and, in the second, reducing adolescent truancy, substance abuse and sexual  risk behaviors. Both hope that parents will reinforce the program message. By  contrast, <i>Coping Power</i> and <i>SAFEChildren</i> aim to effect positive  youth outcomes by intervening directly and by using parents as change agents,  bringing about positive change in parenting that will move youth in the same  positive direction. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>STARS</i> was able to demonstrate an effect immediately  after the intervention: it changed students’ intentions with respect to future  alcohol use and decreased heavy alcohol use at the end of the first year. The  effects were not sustained after the end of the intervention. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In a study of <i>Focus on Youth</i>, youth in the program  group reported less alcohol and tobacco use than control group youth (who  received only the youth program) six months after the program ended.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10"><span><sup>[10]</sup></span></a>  Two years  after the program ended, they had lower rates of school suspension, use of  tobacco and other drugs, were less likely to carry a weapon and more likely to  know if a sexual partner had used a condom. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>SAFEChildren</i> demonstrated overall positive effects  on children’s academic performance (reading ability) and on parent involvement  with school (involvement with school declined significantly in the control  group parents but remained stable in the program group). As we will see in the  results from studies of other programs, the program had significant additional  impacts on youth at higher risk, notably on problem behaviors (aggression),  attention and social competence. Impacts were measured six months after the  intervention ended.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like <i>Focus on Youth</i>, <i>Coping Power</i> has been  tested experimentally with and without a parent component and has demonstrated  a similar pattern of effects, albeit on a different set of outcomes. Without  the parent component, the program produced lower rates of covert delinquent  behavior and of parent-rated substance abuse one year after the program ended.  The addition of the parent component significantly strengthened the impact of  the program on these two outcomes. The program effected small behavioral  improvements in boys (rated by teachers), an effect largely influenced by the  youth component. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>The Adolescent Transitions Program (ATP)</i>, which  combines a classroom-based intervention for a general population of 6th  graders, with more intensive services for higher-risk students and their  families, elected to study program impacts only on the 25% of students and  families that availed themselves of the additional services – the Family  Check-Up and other services - (and their matched controls). Compared with  students in the matched control group, adolescents whose parents engaged in the  Family Check-Up (selected), some of whom received additional services  (indicated), showed less growth in the use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco  and exhibited fewer problem behaviors between the ages of 11 to 17 and were at  reduced risk for diagnosed substance abuse or arrest by age 18.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Fast Track</i> offers two levels of prevention  activities (universal and indicated) to promote competency in parents, children  and teachers and reduce the prevalence of conduct disorders in early and middle  childhood. The evaluation of the program included parents and children at both  program levels, and their control group counterparts. After completion of the  first grade portion of the program, there were a number of positive impacts on  parents and their children. Participant parents were less likely to endorse  physical punishment for problem behaviors; mothers were more involved in school  activities, used more effective disciplinary techniques, and demonstrated more  warmth toward and involvement with their children. Children exhibited less  aggressive, disruptive and oppositional behavior at home and in the classroom  (as measured by parent and teacher ratings and classroom observations) and were  less likely to identify classmates as aggressive, more likely to identify  classmates they liked than those they disliked.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628660" id="_Toc332628660">Adding Group Family Meetings to  Parent and Youth Components</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If we compare the findings for the first three groups of  programs, it is hard to escape the conclusion that impacts are stronger and  more lasting when the program addresses both parents and children directly and  indirectly (i.e., with strong interventions for both youth and parents). For  the next two program groups, we are interested in looking at whether continuing  to add components increases program impacts. Of course, there are many reasons  why it might be difficult to answer the question. Programs with different  strategies may serve different populations with different levels and types of  risk. They may add components such as a family meal or activity for reasons  other than its effect on outcomes of interest – to reduce social isolation or  to motivate families to participate, for example. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All three of the programs in this group have the dual  goals of building protective factors in youth and reducing the likelihood of  risky behaviors in adolescence. All are universal prevention programs and all  enlist parents as partners in the effort to achieve the program goals. The  intervention strategy is remarkably similar in intensity and content; all three  deliver the program across seven weekly sessions, all provide similar  information to parents and their children and use a family meal for joint  learning and practice. In all three, the strategy implies a partnership model,  in which youth and parents work together on similar issues to achieve positive  outcomes. <i>Parents Who Care</i> and the <i>Strengthening Families Program</i>  <i>(SFP 10-14)</i> intervene as a child is crossing the threshold into  adolescence; the <i>Strong African-American Families Program (SAAFP)</i> is  designed for youth and their families earlier in the child’s development,  before the transition to adolescence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Two years after the end of the intervention, <i>Parents  Who Care</i> produced significant overall effects on attitudes toward drug use  (though not on attitudes about other risk behaviors). However, the program  significantly reduced violent and delinquent behavior and delayed initiation of  substance abuse and sex among African-American youth. Interestingly, a  self-administered version of the program (workbook, video and telephone support  from program staff) was almost as effective in producing these outcomes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The effects of <i>SFP10-14</i> were assessed two and six  years after the intervention ended, when students were in 8th and 12th grades  respectively. The intervention had positive impacts on several parenting  competencies – communication, anger management and setting limits, rules. In  addition, there were positive impacts on youth refusal skills. Later impacts on  school engagement and academic achievement were indirect and mediated by  earlier outcomes, making these findings weaker than the earlier findings.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>SAAFP</i> focused narrowly on building protective  factors that would reduce alcohol use in African-American adolescents. A  follow-up study conducted two years after the program ended demonstrated that  the program was successful in preventing the initiation of alcohol use and in  slowing the increase in use over time among those who used alcohol. Increases  in protective factors such as future orientation, negative attitudes towards  alcohol and drinkers, and resistance and refusal skills were associated with  the effects on alcohol use.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628661" id="_Toc332628661">Programs that Work with Youth,  Parents and Others</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This is the largest of the program groups and includes  programs that are universal <i>(Project Northland, LIFT, Positive Action, and  Raising Healthy Children – formerly the Seattle Social Development Project)</i>,  selected <i>(CasaStart)</i> and indicated <i>(Early Risers), </i>as well as the  hard-to-categorize <i>The Incredible Years. </i>Some address specific risk  behaviors, such as alcohol use, and aggressive behavior and violence; others  focus on healthy development as protective against a host of behavioral risks.  The age-range of children targeted is wide, from the early school years through  adolescence. All bring into the effort to improve child outcomes other actors  or environments that influence the child’s behavior, usually teachers and other  school staff, but sometimes other members of the community.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Across a variety of school settings, and using  school-level data, <i>Positive Action</i> has replicated earlier evaluation  findings of positive and often large impacts on academic performance and on  behavior in school that leads to disciplinary referral or suspension, including  violence, absenteeism and truancy. These effects are found in the face of probable  variation in implementation, which was neither controlled nor examined. Effects  found in other, more controlled, studies include reductions in drug, alcohol  and tobacco use, overt delinquent behavior, school drop-out, and gang  involvement. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Raising Healthy Children (SSDP)</i> is at the other end  of the spectrum, with respect to studies of its effectiveness. Although  replications of the program are underway, evidence of its effectiveness is  derived from a single, rigorous longitudinal study using a quasi-experimental  design that tracked outcomes for children and youth over a span of many years  (from 2nd grade to age 27), with measurements at regular intervals across that  time. In grade 5, parents in the program reported better family management  practices, communication and attachment of family members to the family. Fewer  students had initiated alcohol use or engaged in delinquent behavior, and more  were attached and committed to school. At the end of grade 6, high-risk youth  in the program, compared with their counterparts in the control group, were  more attached and committed to school and less likely to be involved with  antisocial peers. Close to the end of high school, students who had  participated in the program were less involved in violent delinquency and  sexual activity, less likely to be drinking heavily, and less likely to drive  after drinking. By age 21, participants in the program had significantly fewer  sexual partners and, among females, a significantly lower likelihood of both  becoming pregnant and giving birth. Single adults were significantly less  likely to have contracted an STI and more likely to use a condom during  intercourse. This outcome was strongest for African-Americans. The study  measured 8 different outcomes at age 24 and again at age 27, finding  significant effects on educational attainment beyond high school and household  income, civic involvement, mental and sexual health. No sustained effects on  substance abuse and criminal activity were found.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Project Northland</i> and <i>LIFT</i>, though also  universal, aimed to reduce specific risk behaviors – in the first case, alcohol  use and in the second, antisocial and aggressive behavior. The original study  of <i>Project Northland</i>, conducted in Minnesota found significant  reductions in the onset and prevalence of alcohol use, linked to changes in  peer norms (negative views of underage drinking), parent-child communication  about the acceptability of underage drinking, and resistance skills. These  outcomes, measured at the end of the intervention, when students were in grade  8 were not found at a subsequent follow-up in grade 10 after a two-year period  without intervention. A final follow-up in grades 11 and 12, after  community-level intervention to restrict access to alcohol by underage youth  and to change community norms about underage drinking, was effective in  reducing the growth rate of alcohol use, in reducing binge drinking and in  restricting access to alcohol. Unfortunately, an adaptation of the program for  an urban, disadvantaged community did not replicate the effects found in the  original study, although a significant effect was found when use of alcohol,  marijuana and tobacco was combined.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>LIFT</i>, which like <i>Positive Action</i> and <i>SSDP</i>  engaged teachers as well as children and their parents in the intervention,  demonstrated effects on parent and child behaviors at the end of the  intervention in first grade, as well as sustained effects on youth in 5th  grade. At the end of the intervention, coercive parenting practices decreased  and positive and effective parenting increased. At the same time, children’s  classroom and playground behavior (rated by teachers) improved, with reduced  aggression and fewer problems with peers. In fifth grade, program participants  were significantly less likely to have engaged in patterned alcohol use or to  have been arrested. Program effects were strongest for children already  exhibiting aggressive and antisocial behavior in first grade, and for their  parents.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>CASASTART</i> seeks to prevent substance abuse and  violence among youth, and to improve school grades, attendance and behavior  through a multi-component, multi-service strategy. The program had positive  impacts on both mediators of youth risk behaviors (participation in positive  activities such as sports, school clubs, religious groups, and organized  community activities; participation in a drug and alcohol prevention program;  more positive peer support; less association with delinquent peers; less  pressure from peers to engage in antisocial behavior) and on youth outcomes  (use of gateway and/or serious drugs, selling drugs, violent crime) in the year  after the program ended. The program looked for “spill-over” effects, since  risk behaviors are often clustered, but found no effects on sexual activity,  pregnancy or parenthood, dropping out of school or gang membership.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Early Risers</i> targeted children with early onset  aggressive behavior, and is the only indicated program in the group. Reflecting  its view that early childhood aggression begins a path that leads to serious  antisocial behavior and substance abuse, the program intervenes early in the  child’s life and employs a variety of strategies to achieve its goals. After  two years of the program, there were positive effects on children’s academic  achievement. An effect on self-regulation was found for highly aggressive  children; children in the control group declined in their ability to  self-regulate while children in the program maintained at the baseline level.  After three years, the program demonstrated an effect on children’s social  skills and academic achievement and on parental discipline practices. The  program achieved a significantly greater impact on academic outcomes for mildly  aggressive children compared with highly aggressive children and greater  impact, albeit not statistically significant, on impulsivity and aggression.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11"><span><sup>[11]</sup></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The authors of the two studies make an interesting and  important observation: in both the intervention and control groups, children  who exhibited mild to moderate levels of aggression improved similarly so that,  at the end of the intervention, both groups fell within the normal range. This  creates some tension with the underlying assumption that intervention is best  undertaken early in the child’s life. If that is true, then an intensive  program such as Early Risers might be better applied only to those children who  exhibit highly aggressive behavior early, since the less aggressive majority  seem to have exhibited temporary aggression, perhaps in response to the  dislocation of school entry, and then to have moved over a short space of time,  into the normative range of behavior. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As with tiered programs, the flexibility of the <i>Incredible  Years</i> presents a challenge for a summary of its effects. Its components can  be used separately or in combination (although they are designed to be used in  combination), across a variety of settings, and for universal, selected, or  indicated populations. The many studies of the program are notable for their  use of multiple methods to assess outcomes, including parent report (using  validated measures), teacher report (also with validated measures), and  classroom and home observations of child behavior by independent trained  observers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Across a wide range of studies, the program has  demonstrated positive significant effects on parent competence and discipline  practices, on parent-child attachment, and on teachers’ classroom management  skills. Across the same wide range of studies, the program has shown positive  significant effects on children’s social-emotional competence, school readiness  skills, and has reduced aggressive and disruptive behavior. In indicated  samples, the program has reduced externalizing behavior and internalizing  symptoms. This program is notable for the number of randomized studies that  have used experimental designs to evaluate the effects of separate components  and of different combinations of components.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadA"><a name="_Toc332628662" id="_Toc332628662">Considerations for Decision-makers</a>  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As this discussion makes clear, the assessment of program  effectiveness is complicated by multiple factors, ranging from the quality of  the studies designed to assess effectiveness, the strength and reliability of  the measures, what is known about the durability of the effects, and the number  of studies of any single program. It is also important to note that programs  may have a small number of positive outcomes because they chose to focus the  intervention narrowly or because they failed to achieve the goals they set for  themselves. These two scenarios have different implications for how one might  view the program and its effectiveness. As individuals and organizations  consider program models for adoption, they need to be aware of factors that  might affect their judgment about the program’s likely success. In this final  section, we discuss some of these considerations.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628663" id="_Toc332628663">Quality of Study Design</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Most but not all of the findings described here come from  experimental or strong quasi-experimental program evaluations. The various  lists of “evidence-based programs” on which the programs appear ensure that  some quality criterion has been applied, although these vary by list. However,  some of the programs make larger claims about outcomes that are based on much  weaker studies, or on flawed analyses of post hoc subgroups. We have avoided  citing the most obvious examples of outcomes where this applied, but it remains  true that the strength of the evidence varies a good deal. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It is important to note that, even in the case of very  well-designed studies, the age of the study and the size and characteristics of  the population studied should cause us to view the reported outcomes with some  caution. We cannot be sure that outcomes achieved more than 10 years ago could  be replicated today; we are even less sure that outcomes for an all-White  population of rural Iowan two-parent families can be generalized to any other  group.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12"><span><sup>[12]</sup></span></a>   </p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628664" id="_Toc332628664">Measuring Outcomes</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of more concern than the quality of the research design is  the dependence on self-report measures to assess outcomes. While some studies  use measures that have been validated and repeatedly tested, others use  measures developed specifically for a single study to report on similar  outcomes. The problem with these measures is that they may be weak enough to  obscure the impact of a program; in other cases they may overestimate the  effects. In a few cases, researchers have added structured observations to  supplement parent and/or youth report. In others, they have used school records  and administrative data to supplement teacher report. We can have more  confidence in findings derived from multiple or reliable measures.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628665" id="_Toc332628665">Tracing Paths to Outcomes</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There is considerable variation across the studies in the  choice of what to measure. Some studies measure only mediators such as parent  attitudes or behaviors; others move directly to measuring the child or youth  outcomes and omit measures of parenting. A few describe a hypothesized pathway  leading through parent and youth mediators to outcomes, measure each of the  elements in the pathway and, after analyzing and reporting on outcomes, go on  to trace the linkages between mediators and outcomes. While these linkages must  be viewed as correlational rather than causal, if enough studies used this  strategy, we could, over time build an evidence base to support some mediators  and eliminate others.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628666" id="_Toc332628666">Timing of Measurement</a></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While a majority of studies included at least one  post-intervention measurement point, a number measured outcomes only at the end  of the intervention. If we accept the logic of most programs that changes in  parenting (as well as some intermediate changes in children) precede and  influence positive changes in youth behavior, it would seem to be essential to  measure child outcomes at some reasonable temporal distance from the  intervention, in those cases where the program demonstrates an impact on parent  behavior. Some studies that found impacts on parenting but none on child  behavior may have underestimated impact solely because of the timing of measurement.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628667" id="_Toc332628667"><span>Discussion</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we place programs in the context of the framework  described earlier, which draws from both theory and empirical research, we see  that, regardless of the characteristics of families targeted or the strategies  selected, the assumptions that underlie their efforts can be found within that  framework. The organizing principle that parents exert a critical influence on  their children from infancy through adolescence together with the specific  aspects of parent behavior and interactions that the framework suggests are  essential for healthy development are reflected in program goals and  strategies. Clearly, not all programs set out to change every aspect of  parenting that is seen as important for development but, to a remarkable  degree, there is agreement on what those aspects are: parental warmth,  responsiveness and involvement; clear communication of rules, boundaries,  expectations and consequences; avoidance of harsh discipline, effective and  positive behavior management and support for children’s development.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Beyond the basic assumptions, almost all programs face a  similar set of linked dilemmas:  how to engage parents in the program; and how  much of the “treatment” could be considered sufficient or meaningful.</p>
<p class="AbtHeadB"><a name="_Toc332628668" id="_Toc332628668">Engaging Parents</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The challenge for programs begins with recruiting parents.  Although we know little about how many parents refuse the offer of services in  real-world settings, we have some information from research studies of the  programs. For these studies, parents are either offered services or, in the  case of an experimental study, the chance of services and, almost always,  monetary and other incentives for participation in the study. In the studies  reviewed here, between 30 percent and 77 percent of parents contacted agreed to  participate.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" id="_ftnref13"><span><sup>[13]</sup></span></a>  While the programs that placed the least demands on parents (i.e., sent home  booklets or videos, or offered a single session to view a videotape) view these  strategies as likely to reach more eligible parents, the evidence from the  studies is equivocal on this point. For example, less than two-thirds of the  parents recruited for <i>Saving Sex for Later</i> agreed to participate; almost  the same percentage of foster parents agreed to participate in <i>KEEP</i>,  which made considerably greater demands on parents, and 77 percent of Head  Start parents contacted agreed to participate in The <i>Incredible Years</i>  Parent Training program, which involved attending 12 group sessions. We do not  know how agreement to participate in a research study relates to acceptance of  services in normal program operations – rates of acceptance could be higher or  lower.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" id="_ftnref14"><span><sup>[14]</sup></span></a>  What is clear is that in research studies, as in ordinary operations, most  programs have no way of understanding the difference between the families they  are serving and the families that are rejecting services, either implicitly, by  not responding to outreach efforts, or explicitly, by refusing the offer. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once parents have agreed to participate, programs face the  challenge of keeping them actively engaged and ensuring that they attend as  many sessions as possible. Programs are sensitive and ingenious in their  response to this challenge. Most commonly, they reimburse transportation  expenses, provide child care and light meals. Some add a monetary incentive or  raffle. Others develop strategies that acknowledge that, even with these  supports, parents may face barriers to regular participation. One solution, as  we have seen, is to send the materials to parents; indeed, one program (<i>Parents  Who Care</i>) that compared effects of parent and youth participation in group  meetings with the effects of a self-study curriculum with telephone support  found similar impacts for both strategies. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another approach is to take the program to parents’  workplace, as in <i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens. </i>Participants in this  program attended an average of 7 (out of 8) sessions, a higher rate of  participation than was reported for any of the other programs we reviewed.  Other programs, such as <i>KEEP, </i>make home visits to parents who miss a  session, offer individual make-up sessions in person or by phone, or offer an  opportunity to attend a different session (<i>Parenting Through Change</i>).  Other ways used to encourage attendance include: choosing a wide variety of  locations across a community for meetings, to minimize travel time for parents;  and grouping parents with existing friends, so that they can provide mutual  encouragement to attend sessions. In spite of all these efforts, across  different program types, about one-quarter of parents never attend a session  and, on average, parents attend slightly better than half of the sessions.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" id="_ftnref15"><span><sup>[15]</sup></span></a> Researchers  have hypothesized different reasons for dropout or partial attendance, but  there is ambiguous evidence on the subject. Webster-Stratton (2002) finds that  parents with poor parenting skills or with mental health problems are no more  likely than other parents to drop out or attend sporadically. In <i>Parenting  Through Change, </i>lower-SES mothers and more coercive mothers were more  likely to drop out of the program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Given that a small percentage of parents attend most or all  of the program sessions, programs (and the researchers who study them) have  made efforts to determine what level of participation constitutes “meaningful”  participation, a term that can mean different things. For some programs,  meaningful participation is the level of attendance that represents commitment  to what the program is trying to achieve. For most, it represents their best  guess about the number of sessions that might be required to produce an effect.  The issue of whether session content is more critical than number of sessions  is typically not addressed. Nor, for the most part, is the number of sessions  based on strong empirical evidence; although researchers continue to link level  of participation with impacts, they have not found a way to eliminate selection  bias. There might be ways to address this issue that involve natural  experiments. Although the number of sessions is not experimentally manipulated,  many entities (schools and others) that choose to implement a program elect to  deliver fewer sessions than the program recommends. If a program were to  systematically gather data on implementation and outcomes from the wide variety  of full and partial replicators, we might begin to accumulate evidence about  how many sessions and what content is essential to make a difference in outcomes.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b> </b></p>
<p>    <b><span></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Appendix B: Program Profiles</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Active Parenting Now</i></b> is a video-based  educational program model that targets parents of 5-12 year olds who want to  improve their parenting skills. Delivered in two-hour sessions over six weeks,  the program includes information on: parenting styles; communication and how to  handle behavior problems, effective discipline techniques; understanding  misbehavior and how to handle aversive situations; how to develop character,  courage and self-esteem; and parent involvement. The program uses a video that  contains scenes of typical family situations depicted by professional actors.  Each scene illustrates how different parenting techniques fail to handle a  situation and then suggests how the situation might be handled differently,  highlighting a specific parenting skill. The program is attempting to affect  parenting competencies including knowledge, skills, and beliefs, parent-child  relationships.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">An accompanying Parent's Guide contains information  covered in the videos. It also includes additional resources, practice  activities, and homework assignments that provide information and opportunities  for practicing the skills. The program is widely used and has been adapted for  a variety of populations, including Hispanics, foster parents, and parents and  teenagers. It has been delivered to parents in school districts, community  settings, and clinics. The program is now available online, combining video,  reading and group discussion all administered over the internet. The program  website provides additional information on the multitude of settings and  populations for which the program has been provided.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <b><i>Adolescent Transitions Program (ATP)</i></b> is  a multi-level, school-based program for the families of youth, 11-13 years of  age, who are moving into adolescence and preparing to make the transition to  high school. The program is based on the assumption that the best way to reach  families who are at-risk because of parents’ difficulties with family  management and consequent conflict among family members is to base services in  the school and to embed them in a program that reaches out to all parents.  There are three program levels—universal, selective and indicated—and each of  the latter two levels builds on the previous level. The goals of the program  are: to prevent the development of antisocial behavior and substance abuse in  adolescents by improving parents’ ability to manage family interactions and  children’s behavior. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For all parents with children in the school, the program,  in collaboration with school staff, provides a Family Resource Center. A  videotape helps parents to identify observable indicators of risk and  illustrates effective and ineffective strategies for managing children’s  behavior, including: positive discipline techniques, the importance of  monitoring behavior, limit-setting, and relationship and communication skills.  Parents are encouraged to complete a simple rating of their own relationship  and family management skills. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At the “selected” level, the program offers the Family  Check Up, which provides assessment and professional support for at-risk  families. These may self-refer or may be parents of children who have been  identified by classroom teachers as demonstrating problem behaviors. The  school-home liaison visits the family in their home, meets with parents and  children and conducts a 60-minute interview with them. Parents are asked to  complete a brief questionnaire and the liaison videotapes the interactions  among family members. After examining the child’s adjustment to school, to  determine whether this contributes to family conflict or is a strength upon  which to build, the liaison formulates a tentative plan of action, reviews it  with the family and works collaboratively with family members to decide what if  any services are needed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At the “indicated” level, the program provides direct  professional help to families, in accordance with the plan developed on the  basis of the Family Check Up. Depending on need, parents may: attend a series  of 12 group meetings (approximately 10 families in the group; meet individually  with program staff up to three times; participate in family therapy once or  twice a week for a period of time as short as one month and as long as one  year; receive services for the adolescent;<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" id="_ftnref16"><span><sup>[16]</sup></span></a>  receive services to address school-specific problems; and/or receive case  management services to integrate program services with other needed services.  The parent group sessions follow a curriculum, focus on improving family  management and communication skills, and use group exercises, videotapes,  role-plays, and discussion, as well as home practice assignments. Individual  meetings focus on issues and challenges unique to the family. Family therapy  sessions emphasize motivation to change and collaboration.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>CASASTART</i></b> is a school-centered  multi-component program model aimed at preventing substance abuse and violence  among youth and at improving school attendance, grades and behavior. The  program targets neighborhood, peer group, family, and individual risk factors.  The model is built on a framework that includes an integrated set of services  such as: case management, family services, education services  (tutoring/homework assistance), out-of-school/summer activities, mentoring,  morale-building incentives, community policing and enhanced enforcement, and  criminal and juvenile justice intervention (Harrell 1999). Services are locally  developed, providing the ability to tailor services to local needs and cultures  and to leverage existing community resources. Broader program goals include  fostering partnerships among health and social services agencies, schools, and  law enforcement; helping to improve youth relationships with their families;  and facilitating family involvement with schools. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program was originally developed and tested with youth  11-13 and their families in five high-risk communities. To be eligible for the  program, youth had to exhibit risk in at least one of 3 domains: school,  family, or personal. Each student has a case manager who meets with them  regularly—to identify risk and protective factors across multiple environments.  Case managers also meet with their families at least once a month and make  regular home visits to address the family context and assess what additional  services may be needed. Services for families vary, but could include parenting  education classes, organized community events for parents, therapeutic  services, and other skills training. According to the <i>CASASTART </i>website  the program is now operating in 121 schools in 49 cities and counties.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Coping Power</i></b> is based on research findings  that youth who display early aggressive behavior are at risk for later poor  school adjustment, substance abuse and more serious antisocial behavior. (The  research applies specifically to boys; there is little research on the  developmental trajectories of girls who display early aggression.) Targeting  pre-adolescent boys who are displaying aggressive behavior in the school  setting, the program seeks to improve school behavior and reduce substance  abuse, as well as covert and overt delinquent behavior, by increasing youths’  social competence and ability to regulate their behavior and supporting  parents’ positive involvement with their children. Developed as a school-based  program, Coping Power has been adapted for delivery in mental health settings. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program is delivered over 15 to 18 months in its full  form and includes a youth component and a parent component. For youth, the  program consists of 33-34 group sessions, each lasting 40-60 minutes, usually  delivered in the school setting. Groups of 4-6 boys, screened and referred by  teachers, meet with two co-facilitators to address and discuss topics that  include: behavioral and personal goal-setting; distraction and relaxation  strategies to manage anger; organizational, social problem-solving and study  skills; dealing with peer pressure; and refusal skills. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The parent component consists of 16 group sessions, held  over the same 15-18 month period, with 4-6 single parents or couples, in  community settings and at times that are convenient for parents. Topics covered  in the parent groups include: identifying targets for children’s positive and  negative behaviors; appropriate and effective discipline techniques and reward  strategies; clear communication of expectations, rules and consequences for  violating them; and maintaining communication through weekly family meetings.  For both parents and children, the group sessions are augmented by regularly  scheduled, brief individual contacts with children and parents.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The <b><i>Early Risers Skills for Success</i></b> program  begins with the assumption that aggression in early childhood leads to serious  and chronic antisocial behavior and substance abuse in adolescence. The program  targets children aged 6 -10 years who exhibit aggressive, disruptive or  oppositional behavior, and is designed to alter the hypothesized negative  developmental trajectory of these children by effecting positive change in four  domains: academic competence; self-regulation; social competence; and parental  investment in the child. The program has multiple components: a six-week summer  program for children, followed by an after-school program during the school  year; the Check and Connect program which begins soon after the beginning of  the school year and runs throughout the year; a family program, with separate  sessions for parents and children, during the school year, and a family support  program, delivered through six or more home visits. The design of the program  calls for participation by children and parents over two or more school years.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Program for youth. </u>The summer program for youth  runs four full days a week for six weeks and can begin as early as the summer  after the kindergarten year. Each day includes: formal academic instruction in  reading, language arts, math and computer education; educational enrichment  experiences (dance, music, nature and wildlife); social skills training using a  “buddy system” which pairs aggressive children with non aggressive peers for  activities to promote development of social skills); creative arts, drama and  sports activities; and large-group recreation and CORE also includes an  after-school program one day a week and a staff-mentoring program during the  school year. The program uses behavioral modification techniques across all  activities to help children self-regulate their behavior (point system, daily  report card).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the school year, the after-school program meets  once a week in groups of 9 to12 children for 45 minutes of formal social skills  instruction, 30 minutes of guided homework help, and 15 minutes of fun  activities. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Check and Connect</u>. During the school year, family  advocates work with classroom teachers to track the progress of individual  children in four domains (academic; relations with peers; behavior in the  classroom; and emotional regulation), to identify student needs in any of these  domains; and to develop individual intervention plans.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Program for families</u>. During the school year,  parents and children are invited to attend a series of bi-weekly evening  meetings(12 in each of the first two years and six in the third year) that  begin and end with a family activity (a meal, at the beginning, and a  parent-child activity at the end) and feature separate, concurrent sessions for  parents and children. The parent sessions draw on the Incredible Years  Parenting Series and cover topics such as effective parenting practices (rules  and limit setting, nonviolent discipline, using praise and rewards, playing  with your child), support for learning, parent stress management, communication  and problem-solving skills. The child program follows the Incredible Years  Dinosaur curriculum and addresses topics such as emotional regulation, conflict  resolution, making friends, understanding school rules, and social problem  solving through the use of interactive video modeling, fantasy play with  puppets, and role-plays.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The final element of the family program involves home  visits by family advocates over the school year, with the number and duration  of home visits determined by need. Depending on the level of need, family  advocates provide emotional support and assistance in collaborative  problem-solving, linking to community resources and goal-setting, as well as,  for needier families, assistance with basic living issues, crisis management  and referrals for more serious health and domestic needs.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Familias Unidas</i></b> is a parent-centered program  that targets Hispanic parents of adolescents in 6th, 7th and 8th grades of  school and is built on the assumption that involved and positive parenting,  parent-youth communication and family support will promote healthy adolescent  development and prevent substance abuse and unsafe sex. The goals of the  program are to increase parental investment in their children, reduce  adolescent behavior problems and promote attachment to school and academic  achievement, with the ultimate goals of preventing substance use and unsafe  sex.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The major component of the program involves one-hour  parent group meetings, held weekly over a nine-month period.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="" id="_ftnref17"><span><sup>[17]</sup></span></a>  The  intervention occurs in three stages: in the first stage, program staff work to  ensure that parents are engaged and understand the purpose of the program, and  to build a cohesive and supportive parent group. In the second stage, parents  are introduced to the three worlds that adolescents inhabit (family, peers and  school) and are encouraged to discuss their concerns about them. In the third  stage, parents learn parenting skills appropriate for the challenges of each of  the worlds: within the family, positive parenting and involvement with the  child and effective behavior management; within the world of school,  communicating with school staff and monitoring homework; and, within the peer  world, monitoring adolescents’ social activities and establishing connections  with parents of peers. The sessions for parents promote parent involvement  through problem posing and participatory exercises. Group discussion helps  parents understand their importance in protecting their child from harm. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the third stage of the parent sessions, school  counselors make home visits to facilitate interaction and discussion between  parents and their adolescent children and to connect families more closely to  the school world. Finally, the program organizes activities that expose parents  to their children’s peer networks, encourage supervision and promote positive  peer associations. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Families and Schools Together (F.A.S.T.)</i></b> is  a program that targets families with children in the early elementary school  grades. Unlike many programs that are flexible about the setting in which the  program may be delivered, <i>FAST</i> is planned as an after-school program in  the school setting. The program combines interactive sessions for parents with  a family meal and activities.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program assumes that families are stressed and need  support. It uses the strategy of the family group meeting to encourage positive  interactions among family members. And it seeks to build protective factors in  young people by creating links between parents, between parents and their  children, and between parents and schools, and by encouraging parental support  for learning.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Children who could benefit from FAST are identified by  school staff who screen children for mental health problems and may also be  asked to identify bullies, troublemakers or children who are hard to teach.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="" id="_ftnref18"><span><sup>[18]</sup></span></a> The  program begins with a home visit to recruit the family, followed by 8-10 weekly  family group meetings (up to 12 families). Each weekly group meeting lasts  about 2.5 hours and follows a standard agenda, beginning with an opening  tradition and 45 minutes of a family meal and structured communication  activities and games. Each family occupies a table (unlike most programs, <i>FAST</i>  encourages the presence of multiple family members, including older and younger  children, as well as parents and adult relatives). This is followed by a  one-hour parent meeting, in which parents select the topics for discussion and <i>FAST</i>  staff guide the discussion. Developmentally-appropriate activities are provided  for children during the parent meeting. After a brief (15-minute) period for  one-on-one coaching in parent-child communication, in the context of play (for  younger children) or a discussion (for middle-school children), the session  ends with a closing ceremony. <i>FAST</i> promotes full participation through a  fixed lottery in which every family wins a prize in the course of the 8-10  weeks, and the winner is announced at the closing ceremony.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After graduating from <i>FAST</i>, families are invited to  join <i>FASTWORKS</i>, a school-based collective of former <i>FAST</i> parents  that meets monthly for two years, and is intended to sustain the supportive  relationships developed during the earlier <i>FAST</i> sessions. While some  elements of the <i>FAST</i> program continue during this period, for the most  part families plan the content of the sessions to meet the needs of the group.  Rather than rewarding individual families for attending,<i> FASTWORKS </i>provides  a small monthly budget ($100) and the group decides how it should be spent.  Across the two elements of the program, it is estimated that approximately 40%  of program content is specified (and fidelity of implementation is assessed);  the remaining 60% is decided by parents and staff of individual programs.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Family Matters</i></b> is an intervention intended  to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking and alcohol use among adolescents  ages 12-14. It is intended for use with a broad range of parents and can be  delivered in the home. Parents receive a series of health booklets, delivered  successively through the mail, and follow-up telephone calls from health  educators. Each booklet contains information and activities to be completed by  the parent with their child. The content of the booklets is based on social and  behavioral theories, and includes a combination of information on: parenting  skills, such as supervision, communication, and monitoring; the importance of  family and family influences; rule setting; and peer and media influence. The  booklets suggest activities to be completed by the parent and child together.  Follow-up phone calls by a health educator are intended to ascertain the status  of completion of each booklet and to answer questions or provide additional  information about the program.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Focus on Youth</i></b> is a risk reduction program  model that is part of the CDC’s DEBI (Diffusion of Effective Behavioral  Interventions) project.

<p class="MsoBodyText">The <b><i>Helping Encourage Affect Regulation (HEAR)</i></b><i>  </i>program (currently available as the Pathways to Competence for Young  Children) aims to reduce aggression and behavior problems in preschool-age  children (already exhibiting such behaviors) by providing parents with  information and skills to enhance a number of developmental capabilities in their  young children. In group sessions led by a clinical psychologist, parents  receive instruction on development, starting in infancy and progressing through  adolescence. Social and emotional topics covered include: development, body  image, attachment, play and imagination, language and communication,  self-regulation, morality and a sense of conscience, emotion regulation,  concentration and problem solving, and social competence, empathy and caring  behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program is designed to be offered over 15 weeks in  which parents attend 2-hour group meetings each week. Activities include  role-plays with other adults, group exercises, and assignments to be completed  at home. The program aims to reduce the incidence of behavioral problems among  children, increase parenting knowledge and competencies, and improve attitudes  toward parenting and their children. The program specifically targets parental  perceptions and interactions with their child, emphasizing parent-child  relational differences and not just improved parenting knowledge and  confidence. Designed for parents of aggressive and noncompliant children, the  program has also been used with parents suffering from depression, parents  involved with child protective services, and parents who have experienced spousal  abuse. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>The Incredible Years</i></b> is not a single program  but rather a set of components each of which can be used in conjunction with  one or more of the others, or as a stand-alone intervention. Within the  components there is also flexibility: the child training programs can be used  by classroom teachers or by therapists working with small groups of children;  the parent training programs are intended to be delivered in small groups, but  can be adapted for home visits; and the teacher training programs are suitable  for classroom teachers or therapists and are also available for self-study.  This flexibility has enabled many programs to use one or more of the components  to supplement their own programming. The child training curriculum <i>(Dina  Dinosaur</i>), in particular, has strongly influenced the development of a  number of other curricula for similar age-groups.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Begun as a parent training program, its goals have  expanded to include: </p>
<p class="CAREERBullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Develop competent and confident parents;</p>
<p class="CAREERBullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Promote children’s emotional and social competence; </p>
<p class="CAREERBullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Prevent, reduce and treat children’s aggression and uncooperative  behavior;</p>
<p class="CAREERBullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Strengthen teachers’ classroom management strategies; and </p>
<p class="CAREERBullets"><span>·<span>         </span></span>Promote collaboration between parents and schools to encourage  involvement and consistency between home and school.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Intended for children ages 0-12 years, the Incredible  Years has three major components: a parent training intervention; a child  social skills curriculum; and a teacher training package.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Parent training. </u>There are four versions of the  parent training component: BASIC, for parents of children below three years of  age; BASIC for parents of 3-6 year olds: BASIC for elementary school children  (6-12 years); and Advanced for the latter age group. Overall, the component is  designed to teach parents the importance of monitoring, how to use effective  discipline and behavior management skills, encourage competent and confident  parenting and promote involvement in the child’s school experience. For parents  of very young children, parent training teaches them to observe and interpret  the child’s cues, provide nurturing and responsive care as well as physical and  verbal stimulation. Parents of toddlers learn the importance of child-directed  play and participation in it, how to encourage language development, how to  provide social and emotional coaching, praise and encouragement, positive  discipline, how to set appropriate behavioral limits; and how to manage  behavior problems. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For parents of school-age children, the BASIC curriculum  teaches parents how to strengthen children’s social skills and ability to  regulate their behavior, and how to help them get ready for and participate in  school. How to play with children, the use of praise and incentives and  positive discipline techniques continue to be emphasized. The Advanced  curriculum for parents of children 6-12 deals with effective communication,  anger management, problem-solving and teaching children to solve problems. Each  of the curricula is designed to be presented in weekly, small-group sessions,  each lasting about two hours; the number of sessions varies, depending on the  specific curriculum used. The format of the sessions is the same: skills are  introduced, then practiced. Videotaped vignettes that demonstrate aspects of  parent-child interaction are viewed and discussed. Parents engage in role-play  and receive feedback. Since not all parents can attend group sessions, a home  visiting option is provided.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Child social skills training</u>. The <i>Dina Dinosaur</i>  curriculum is intended for children 4-8 years old and designed to improve peer  relationships and reduce aggressive behavior at home and in school. The  curriculum includes 120 lesson plans and is delivered 2-3 times a week during a  15-20 minute circle time discussion, which is followed by small group  activities to practice the skills learned. Puppets, videos and games are used  to illustrate: making friends and learning school rules; understanding and  managing feelings; problem-solving; communicating with peers and friends;  social skills (taking turns, trading, asking, ignoring, sharing, helping,  complimenting), and how to do your best in school. Teachers are trained to  deliver the classroom curriculum, to weave the activities throughout the school  day and to send home suggestions for activities parents can do with their  child.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The curricula are also designed to be delivered by a  therapist in small-group sessions held weekly for 18-20 weeks, and are meant to  be offered in parallel with the parent training.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Teacher training</u>. The Teacher Classroom Management  Program is designed to strengthen classroom management strategies and to help  teachers promote children’s prosocial behavior and reduce aggressive behavior.  Sessions deal with: the importance of attention, encouragement and praise;  motivating children through incentives; preventing problem behavior; reducing  inappropriate behavior; promoting children’s problem-solving skills and helping  them to build positive relationships. The training is also available for  therapists working with small groups of children.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">What is remarkable about the three components is the  consistency of the messages and skills taught: parents learn positive  strategies to manage their own and their child’s behavior; teachers learn  positive techniques to manage their own behavior and that of children in the  classroom; and children learn to manage their own behavior and to interact  positively with their peers, using the techniques of encouragement and positive  reinforcement that adults are trained to use with them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported)</i></b>  provides 16 weeks of training, supervision and support in behavior management  to foster and kinship parents of children ages 4-12 years. The goal of the  intervention is to reduce child problem behaviors through strengthening foster  parents’ skills, reduce placement disruption, and increase positive placement  changes (reunification or permanent adoption). Groups meet weekly for 60-90  minutes (in groups of 6-10). The groups are led by trained facilitators who  lead discussions and provide instructions on specific skills. Topics covered  during the group sessions include: cooperation, understanding behaviors, limit  setting, discipline techniques, avoiding power struggles, promoting school  success, promoting positive peer relations, and managing stress.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Videotaped examples are included to illustrate key  concepts and particularly challenging situations. There are opportunities for  role-plays and skills practice with feedback from the group, and there are home  practice assignments in which parents implement behavior management methods  discussed and practiced in the group. Facilitators call parents once a week to  check in and obtain information on youth behaviors and parents’ level of  stress. If parents miss a meeting, the facilitator delivers the material during  a home visit. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>KEEP</i> is a less intensive version of the  Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) program, which has been used with  foster care providers caring for adolescents referred by juvenile justice as an  alternative to placement in group or residential care. MTFC has also been  adapted for use with children with severe mental health disorders who are being  discharged from inpatient psychiatric care and with high-risk preschoolers in  foster care.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>LIFT</i></b> is a multimodal preventive intervention  that aims to address antisocial behavior and subsequent delinquency. It is  intended to be a universal intervention, delivered to first grade students in  school settings. The intervention targets social interactional processes  related to child antisocial behavior through components delivered to young  children, parents, and on the playground. These settings (school and home)  provide the best opportunities for working with multiple agents (parents and  teachers) who are involved with children and have opportunities to interact in  a way that may or may not reinforce coercive behaviors. The three components,  designed as separate interventions, are intended to be complementary. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Students in first grade receive training in social and  problem solving skills focused on listening, emotion recognition and  management, and group cooperation. The classroom curriculum is delivered in  group settings in 30 minute sessions offered two times a week for 10 weeks. As  part of the class, students are divided into small groups of 4 or 5 students.  Students participate in the classroom activities together as a group. Each  session includes direct instruction, group discussions, and individual skill  practice within a small and large group. Linked to the child training is a  playground intervention delivered during school recess. This intervention (a  version of the <i>Good Behavior Game</i>) immediately follows the classroom  curriculum. During recess, group members have opportunities to earn points  toward both a classroom and group reward through display of appropriate  behavior (such as sharing, cooperating) and limited aversive behavior (hitting  or pushing). Teachers distribute points through observation, and at the end of  the period points are counted—points for displays of negative behavior are  subtracted from points earned for good behaviors. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The parent management training component is designed to  improve parent skills in consistent and effective positive reinforcement,  discipline, and monitoring. The curriculum is designed for delivery to parent  groups during weekly sessions of 90 minutes over 6 weeks. Meetings were offered  in neighborhood school classrooms and intended to emphasize the importance of  parent to parent and parent to teacher communication. A phone and answering  machine installed in each intervention classroom encouraged non-threatening  communication (teachers could leave daily messages about homework and class  activities). Parent and teacher communication was also encouraged through the  use of weekly newsletters that teachers sent home summarizing the specific LIFT  program that week and providing suggestions for complementary parent-child  activities.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Parents Who Care</i></b> is a 5- or 6-session  universal prevention program, developed for older youth aged 12 -16 and their  families. The program’s goals are: to build protective factors in youth by  teaching parents strategies for positive engagement with their children, for  offering opportunities to participate in and contribute to their families and  for using rewards and recognition to promote family cohesion. At the same time,  <i>PWC</i> is intended to reduce risk behavior by teaching parents effective  supervision, monitoring and discipline strategies, and by teaching youth  resistance, goal-setting and decision-making skills. Intended outcomes include  changes in: parent and sibling drug use; parental attitudes toward drug use;  family management practices; family involvement, communication and conflict;  family bonding; and youth association with antisocial peers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program sessions, which are 2-2.5 hours long, are held  weekly. Youth attend the sessions with one or both of their parents and a light  dinner is served. Family members stay together for the first part of the  session to view a videotape component of the seven-unit curriculum. Parents and  children separate into different groups to practice specific skills, then meet  together in the larger group to engage in structured family interactions.  Families are given homework and receive the curriculum workbook and videotapes.  Program managers are encouraged to offer financial aid for child care and  transportation. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The content of the curriculum offered to both youth and  parents includes: knowledge and understanding of both risk and protective  factors and strategies for reducing one and developing the other;  problem-solving strategies; effective parenting and communication; anger  management; supporting and encouraging children’s struggle to become  independent; contributing to the family; setting clear family policies on  health and safety issues and consequences for prohibited behaviors; appropriate  supervision and monitoring; refusal skills; and how to ask for help. Session  leaders, who work in pairs, have prior experience conducting workshops for  parents or teens.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program has also been tested as a self-administered  curriculum with weekly telephone support from program staff. Families received  written instructions about how to use the workbook and videos, as well as a  checklist of 62 activities to complete as a family. A family consultant  contacted families once a week to discuss completed activities, motivate  parents, and help solve problems that parents encountered in implementing the  program with their adolescent children. Family consultants had prior clinical  experience with families with adolescent children. Although this model produced  outcomes similar to those found in the original model (see discussion of  outcomes below), it does not appear to be disseminated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Parenting Through Change</i></b> is an intervention  to address internalizing and externalizing conduct behaviors and associated  problems and to promote healthy child adjustment through changes in parenting  behaviors and interactions. Recently separated mothers who have sons in grades  1-3 participate in 14 weekly group sessions led by professionals to learn  effective parenting practices including skill encouragement, limit-setting,  problem solving, and positive involvement. The program also includes a  30-minute videotape depicting families using effective parenting practices to  help their children adjust to the divorce transition. The sessions address  parenting practices such as discipline, monitoring, contingent encouragement  and problem-solving, together with other issues relevant to divorcing women  (including managing interpersonal conflict and emotions). Participants are  taught specific skills and provided opportunities to apply them using classroom  examples. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Parenting Wisely</i></b> is a set of interactive,  computer-based training programs for parents of children ages 3-18. Based on  social learning, cognitive, behavioral, and family systems theories, the  programs aim to increase parental communication and disciplinary skills. The  program addresses parenting skills such as monitoring, communication, problem  solving and conflict resolution, discipline practices, and reinforcement. These  practices have been shown to be effective in improving child behaviors.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Parents view the self-instructional program on either an  agency’s computer or laptop or at home on a personal computer. During each of  the sessions, users view a video enactment of a typical family struggle and  then choose from a list of solutions representing different levels of  effectiveness, each of which is portrayed and critiqued through interactive  questions and answers. The whole program can be completed in 2-3 hours. There  are also workbooks containing program content and exercises to promote skill  building and practice. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program has been used in a variety of settings,  including: family-centered substance abuse services, community health care clinics  (inpatient and outpatient), community substance abuse treatment services, and  school-based programs. It has been used internationally as well, including with  youth offender teams, mental health centers and community health centers. The  various populations receiving the program include substance-abusing parents and  their children, low-income ethnic minority families (Portuguese, Hispanic,  Asian, African American, African Caribbean), and juvenile offenders.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies)  with</i> <i>Fast Track</i></b> merges an intervention designed for an indicated  population <i>(Fast Track)</i> with a universal classroom-based curriculum (<i>PATHS</i>)  to produce a three-tiered school-based prevention program. The program is  designed to run from first through 10th grade, most intensively at transition  points in the child’s school life (entry to school, transition to middle school  from elementary school). The hypothesis that underlies the program is that  improving children’s social, emotional and academic competence, parents’  effectiveness, the school and classroom environment and communication between  home and school will help to prevent antisocial behavior in adolescence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In elementary school, the universal intervention (<i>PATHS</i>)  consisted of a curriculum delivered by classroom teachers two to three times a  week in grades one through five. The goal of this component is to increase  children’s social and emotional competence. The curriculum focuses on emotional  awareness and understanding, self-regulation, peer social skills, and social  problem-solving. In the early school grades, the emphasis is on adaptation to  school rules and routines as well as developing positive relationships with  peers. The later grades emphasize decision-making, study, resistance and problem-solving  skills. Initial training and ongoing support for teachers are designed to  enhance the effect of the curriculum by helping the teacher to create a healthy  and supportive classroom environment in which children can effectively utilize  the skills they have learned.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For families identified as high-risk on the basis of a  screening conducted in kindergarten with both teachers and parents for conduct  problems at home and/or at school, <i>Fast Track</i> offers additional  components during the elementary, middle and high school years. In elementary  school, at the standard indicated level, families participate in 2-hour family  group meetings, held weekly for 22 weeks in first grade, biweekly for 14  sessions in second grade, monthly for 8 sessions a year in grades 3-5. At these  sessions, parents and children meet in separate groups for 90 minutes and then  participate in 30 minutes of joint activity. The parent groups focus on  developing positive school-parent relationships, and effective communication  and discipline skills and strategies. The child groups focus on social skills  development, including friendship and play, self-regulation, managing anger,  and interpersonal problem-solving. The joint sessions are intended to provide  opportunities for parents to practice skills they have learned, with guidance  from program staff.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At the third intervention level, families are offered  individualized services, including:  home visits to assist parents’ development  of problem-solving and family management skills; academic tutoring for  children; and classroom-based peer pairing to promote friendships. In first  grade, all families receive the same level of individualized services; in  subsequent elementary grades, the amount of these three components provided  reflects the family’s needs and level of functioning. In grade 4, a mentoring  component is added to support the child’s identity development.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In grades 6-10, <i>Fast Track</i> continues to provide  both standard group and individualized services to high-risk families, although  youth group activities are de-emphasized. Curriculum-based parent and youth  group sessions are offered in grades 5-7 to assist youth in the transition to  middle school, but the major focus of the program in this phase is on  individualized services that reflect the family’s needs.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Positive Action</i></b> is a multi-year school-based  character education program, based on theories of self-concept, learning  behavior, and school ecology, and designed to achieve the goals of positive  character development, improved academic achievement and prevention of problem  behavior. The program has five major components: a classroom curriculum for  grades K-12; school climate development; counseling; family; and community.  Supplementary modules on conflict resolution and drug education are also  available for use in schools. The program allows schools a great deal of  flexibility in the selection of components: it is possible to select a  curriculum for grades K-6 only for example, and then combine it with one or  more other components. The expected outcomes are reduction in disruptive  behaviors and other disciplinary problems, decreased substance use, violence  and suspensions, and improved academic achievement.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Classroom curriculum</u>. The curriculum consists of a  series of scripted 15-20-minute lessons to be delivered almost daily (over 140  lessons per grade), that use different teaching strategies to accommodate a  variety of learning styles. Through stories, role-play, modeling, question and  answer, games, music, posters and manipulatives, students learn how to use  positive actions, to manage their thoughts actions and feelings, and to treat  others the way they themselves wish to be treated. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>School climate development. </u>This component, which  the school principal oversees, is designed to reinforce the classroom  curriculum by engaging the entire school population in a variety of positive  actions and activities that promote improved behavior and academic performance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Counseling</u>. The school counselor is encouraged to  play a critical role in school-climate change, and to teach and reinforce  Positive Action concepts with individual children, small groups, classes,  parents and community members.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Parents and Families</u>. Through classes for parents  or for the whole family, the program teaches about positive actions and their  effects on self-concept, behavior and achievement. A Family Kit allows families  to learn positive actions together at home.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Community</u>. The community component suggests ways  for students and school staff to engage in community-wide positive actions as  well as ways to reach out and engage groups such as businesses, local  government, social service agencies and media outlets.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Positive Parenting Program (Triple P</i></b><i>)</i>  targets families with at least one child, from newborn to twelve years (it has  recently added services for families with teenaged children), and offers five  tiered levels of intervention to address families’ differing needs, with the  goal of improving parenting practices, preventing child maltreatment, and its  negative effects on children’s development. The five levels of intervention  correspond to gradually narrowing population targets and increasing intensity  of services. The assumptions underlying the program are: all families can  benefit from information about effective parenting strategies; some families  need more assistance, but not all of them need the same level of assistance;  and service provision should be efficient, i.e., no family should be given more  than is needed. Reflecting these assumptions, in addition to the tiering of services,  there is considerable flexibility in how the program is delivered within each  level.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Level 1: Universal Triple P. </u>At this level, the  program employs health promotion and social marketing strategies to disseminate  as widely as possible information that can help parents understand their  child’s development, their own role in supporting and encouraging development,  and how they might respond effectively to common behavior problems, many of  which are part of normal development. The strategy is intended to normalize  parenting difficulties and eliminate any perceived stigma attached to seeking  help with them. Information can be disseminated through community-wide media  outlets, through public service announcements on TV and radio, newspaper  columns, interviews, current affairs programs. A telephone information line can  offer additional information for parents and, like all the other sources,  suggest where parents might go to receive additional help.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Level 2: Selected Triple P.</u> At this level, the  program is designed to offer information and advice for parents with a specific  concern about their child’s behavior. Professional staff in primary care  services (defined as services and programs that operate community-wide, have  regular contact with parents, are easily accessible to them, and are seen as  credible and have no stigma attached to them) have periodic discussions with  parents about how to manage specific childrearing problems, offer parenting tip  sheets and/or videos and suggest resources if parents need additional help.  These discussions may be with individual parents, or may take the form of  presentations to a group of parents, or a mix of both. The group seminars  consist of three 90-minute presentations: The Power of Positive Parenting;  Raising Confident, Competent Children; and Raising Resilient Children.  Professional staff are present at the seminars to offer additional help if  needed. A similar seminar series is offered for parents of teens.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Level 3: Primary Care Triple P.</u> This level of  services is for parents who require active skills training in addition to the  information offered at the prior levels. Brief individual counseling sessions  (four 15-30 minutes) combine practical advice about managing behavior problems  with skills coaching. This involves identifying the history and nature of the  problem, collaborative development of a parenting plan, modeling responses to  the behavior, having parents rehearse responses and then evaluate their  response. A similar intervention is offered for parents of teens.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Level 4: Standard, Group and Self-Directed Triple P. </u>This  level of services is for parents of children with more severe behavioral  problems who require intensive training in positive parenting skills. The  individual or standard version involves 10 sessions, each lasting about one  hour, in the home or in a clinic, in which professional staff provide  information, model positive parenting techniques, have parents practice them,  observe the interaction and provide feedback, encourage goal-setting and  self-evaluation of progress, and suggest homework tasks. Variations are: eight  group sessions with 8-10 parents; and self-directed study by individual parents  using a self-help workbook. Either approach may be supplemented with periodic  telephone contact and consultation. Group sessions may be provided for parents  of teens.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Level 4 Specialist Services: Stepping Stones Triple P</u>.  Specialist services provide positive parenting information and skills training  for parents of pre-adolescent children with a disability through 10  individualized sessions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Level 5: Enhanced Triple P</u>. Services at this level  are designed to help families with concurrent child behavior and family  problems such as parent depression or parental conflict, who are at risk for  child maltreatment. Delivered as an intensive, individually-tailored set of up  to 11 sessions in the home, the program addresses not only the positive  parenting skills that are the focus of the four levels that precede this one,  but also includes three sessions that help parents identify dysfunctional  thinking patterns and learn personal coping skills, such as relaxation. For  two-parent families and develop plans for personal coping strategies.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Project Northland</i></b> is a multi-component  multi-year intervention intended to reduce alcohol use among adolescents. The  program addresses the social, environmental, and intrapersonal factors  associated with alcohol use among adolescents through multiple phases. Phase 1  includes: a curriculum delivered in school to students in grades 6-8; parent  involvement programs; peer leadership opportunities; and community task forces.  During Phase 2, when the student cohort is in grades 11-12 there is a  curriculum delivered in the class, parent education, print media, youth development,  and community organizing. The content and structure of these activities are  designed to be consistent with the developmental stage of the adolescents. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As part of Phase 1, students receive education on skills  to communicate with their parents about alcohol, to deal with peer influences  and normative expectations about alcohol, and to understand methods that bring  about community-level changes in alcohol-related programs and policies. To  support these efforts, factors in the social environment are also addressed  through parenting education (focused on communication and other parenting  skills through the use of newsletters, homework assignments, and scripted  activities to be completed with youth); peer education (in which peer leader  and teacher-led sessions address peer influences and social norms); and  community norms (through community task force engagement in local alcohol  related ordinances and broader awareness efforts). Phase 2 is essentially a  community level intervention that targets the social acceptability and  commercial availability of alcohol. This phase of the intervention relies  heavily on the media and community to reinforce the earlier messages delivered  primarily in the schools to youth.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Raising Healthy Children (formerly the Seattle  Social Development Project)</i></b><i> </i>is a universal, multi-component  intervention for children in the elementary school grades. The program is  guided by the social development model set forth by Catalano and Hawkins  (1996), which itself is grounded in social control and social learning  theories. The model suggests that schools and families that offer supportive  environments and opportunities for active involvement, promote the acquisition  of skills and competencies, and encourage effort produce youth who are strongly  attached to these social units, and that these strong bonds protect youth  against risky and socially unacceptable behavior in adolescence. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program is designed to intervene early in the child’s  school life in order to increase prosocial bonds, strengthen children’s  attachment and commitment to school and, in adolescence, improve school  achievement and reduce delinquency, violence and risky sexual and other  behaviors. The program has three components: a curriculum for children in  grades 1 and 6; teacher training for all classroom staff in the elementary  school; and parent training when their children are in grades 1,2, 3, 5 and 6.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Youth component</u>. In first grade, children receive a  cognitive and social skills curriculum, which teaches them the skills needed to  identify problems, then to generate, choose and implement a solution. The  curriculum promotes collaboration and cooperation among children through  involvement in small learning groups and other social activities. In 6th grade,  students receive training in resisting peer pressure to engage in antisocial or  problem behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Teacher component</u>. Although children receive a  specific curriculum in only two grades, teachers in all grades receive five  days of in-service training in positive classroom management; interactive  teaching; and cooperative learning. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><u>Parent component. </u>When children are in 1st grade,  parents are offered seven sessions dealing with the skills they need to manage  children’s behavior positively. In 2nd grade, and again in 3rd grade, parents  are offered four sessions on the skills they need to support children’s  academic progress. In 5th and 6th grade, parents are offered a five-session  curriculum on how to reduce their child’s risk for substance abuse.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>R.E.A.L. Men</i></b> is an HIV-prevention program  for fathers of adolescent boys. The program’s goals are to delay sexual  activity and increase condom use among sexually- active youth by encouraging  fathers to communicate with their sons about sexual issuesgoals are to delay  the initiation of sexual intercourse and to increase condom use among  sexually-active youth. To achieve these goals the program seeks to promote  fathers’ involvement in their sons’ sexual education and increase communication  on sexual topics.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program is delivered in seven two-hour sessions, six  of which are attended by fathers only; for the seventh meeting, fathers and  sons attend together. Dinner is served at each session. During the sessions,  fathers are presented with information through lectures and videotapes, practice  behavior through role-plays and games, engage in discussions, establish  personal goals, and are given take-home activities. Topics covered in the  sessions include: fathers’ role in educating their sons about sex; adolescent  development; HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention; and the importance of  parental monitoring. Later sessions deal with communication with youth, how  fathers can talk to their sons about puberty, peer pressure, values, and  general sexual topics. In the final session, sons join their fathers in a game  designed to generate discussion about issues in adolescents’ lives, watch a  videotape on the same topic and celebrate reaching the end of the program.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>SAFEChildren</i></b> combines an academic tutoring  program for children entering first grade with a parent-focused intervention  that recognizes the role of inner-city neighborhoods in heightening the risks  that families and children face. The program begins as children enter first  grade and involves 22 weeks of intervention, with the goals of: increasing  parenting knowledge and family cohesion; generating more positive attitudes  toward academic achievement and involvement with school on the part of both  parents and children; and improving children’s social competence and academic  achievement. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For children, the program provides 30 minutes of  individual, phonics-based tutoring in reading, twice weekly, over 22 weeks (the  phonics-based tutoring program used was developed for the <i>Fast Track</i>  intervention). </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Group meetings for parents are held weekly, for 22 weeks.  The sessions combine provision of information, skill practice and group  problem-solving exercises. Topics addressed include: parenting skills;  understanding and managing challenges presented by developmental changes;  family relationships; developing a support network of parents; working with  schools; and coping with neighborhood and community problems. Parents are given  homework assignments in the form of exercises to do at home to apply what they  learn in the sessions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Saving Sex for Later</i></b> is an intervention for  parents of pre-adolescents (10-13 yrs) intended to delay early sexual  initiation among youth. The program consists of three 25-minute audio CDs  designed to help parents identify “teachable moments” through role-model  stories. The messages emphasize communication with their sons and daughters  about values and expectations, setting household rules and responding  appropriately to their children’s development. The program is based on social  development theory, which underscores the role parents play in shaping  adolescent behavior. The videos include stories and scripts developed around  three families, one African American, one Hispanic, and one Caribbean, who  grapple with issues in stories that use drama and humor to address different  themes along a development progression (puberty, relationships, peer pressure).  Key messages are summarized and information about additional resources is  provided. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>STARS (Start Taking Alcohol Risks Seriously) for  Families</i></b> is a brief health promotion program intended to reduce the  initiation of alcohol among at-risk middle and high school youth. The model has  been tested in both urban and rural settings. This universal intervention is  offered over two years and incorporates three main activities. In the first  year, students 11-15 receive a health consultation with the school nurse who  delivers a brief health lesson on how to avoid alcohol use. Parents receive  corresponding postcards in sets of 1or 2 per week for 5 to 10 weeks. The cards  provide guidance on how parents can help their children avoid alcohol. In the  second year, students receive a follow-up consultation with the nurse. The  final activity is weekly take home lessons in which parents and children  complete prevention activities. These activities include a contract that  students sign for alcohol avoidance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This model, while a universal intervention, takes into  account individual differences of youth in terms of their stage of initiation  for consuming alcohol, allowing for prevention messages and strategies to be  tailored accordingly. Prior to the intervention, an initial assessment of the  individual student’s stage of alcohol initiation and readiness for change is  conducted. This assessment is based on data collected from the Youth Alcohol  and Drug Survey. This stage-based approach is informed by the Multi-Component  Motivational Stages (McMOS) prevention model (which is itself informed by the  Transtheoretical stages of change model), which acknowledges the role that the  media, interpersonal and environmental factors play in influencing behavior.  Youth progress through stages of initiation, and change is influenced by risk  and protective factors. This recognition allows for mapping the content and  strategies to the specific individual stage status. Parents receive messages  that are relevant to their child. The program is also available in Spanish, and  has been tested on rural, urban, and high risk families and youth.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>The Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and  Youth (SFP 10-14)</i></b> is a universal prevention program that targets youth  aged 10-14 years. The program’s objectives are to: improve parenting  competencies and youth social competencies as pathways to the ultimate goal of  reducing substance abuse and behavior problems during adolescence. Positive  impacts on these parental and youth mediating factors, and the subsequent  reduction of specific risk behaviors in later adolescence, are the intended  outcomes of <i>SFP 10-14</i>. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The program consists of seven weekly two-hour sessions, in  which the first hour is spent in separate youth and parent activities, and the  second hour in a joint session of supervised family activities. Four booster  sessions for youth and parents are held 6-12 months after the end of the  initial seven sessions. All parent sessions and some of the youth and family  sessions feature videotaped demonstrations of prosocial behavior. The  curriculum topics for parent groups include: nurturing youth; setting rules and  explaining consequences of breaking them; effective monitoring and discipline;  encouraging good behavior; and protecting against substance abuse. Later  booster sessions for parents deal with managing stress and parental  disagreement. Sessions for youth deal with: goal-setting; stress and anger  management; decision-making, communication and peer resistance skills. Booster  sessions address making good friends and handling conflict, as well as  reinforcing earlier lessons. In the joint sessions, parents and youth practice respectful  listening and clear communication. Games are used to promote empathy for each  other and develop problem-solving skills.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>The Strong African-American Families Program (SAAFP</i></b><i>)</i>  is a universal prevention program, built on existing models such as the <i>Strong  Families Program</i> and similar family-centered interventions, and tailored to  meet the unique challenges that face African-American families. The program’s  objectives are to promote positive family interactions, prepare youth for the  teen years and strengthen parents’ ability to help youth make a successful  transition to adolescence, with the ultimate goals of decreasing the use of  drugs and alcohol and postponing sexual involvement. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Like the other program models described here, the <i>SAAFP</i>  uses a set of seven two-hour weekly meetings to deliver its curriculum, through  a combination of family-, parent- and youth-centered sessions. The two-hour  sessions begin with separate, concurrent sessions for children and parents,  followed by a family session in which parents and their children practice the  skills they have learned. Sessions with parents deal with many of the same  topics addressed by other similar programs, including: authoritative and  affectionate parenting practices; monitoring and discipline strategies;  supporting youth goals and promoting independence; strategies for communicating  about sex; and the importance of establishing clear expectations about  substance abuse. Unique to this program, however, is parent training in how to  help their children understand their racial identity and successfully face the  challenges of racism. Leaders of the parents’ sessions use videotapes to  deliver information and illustrate family interactions, then guide discussion  in the group.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sessions for youth deal with: the importance of having and  following family rules; understanding their own strengths; strategies to use  when encountering racism; future goal-setting and planning; peer resistance  skills; and knowledge of and attitudes toward substance use. Videotapes are used  in some sessions to illustrate peer interactions but, for the most part, youth  are actively engaged in activities and role-plays related to the session  topics. In the joint family sessions, parents and youth practice positive  communication and engage in activities designed to increase family bonding.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Talking Parents, Healthy Teens</i></b> is an  intervention that reaches out to parents of 11-16 year olds in their workplace  and that specifically addresses adolescent sexual health. A series of 8 weekly  workshops are held during the lunch hour and include group instruction and free  lunch. Talking Parents, Healthy Teens aims to change parenting behaviors in  ways that will lead to changes in adolescent behaviors. The program addresses  skills (communication, monitoring, and involvement); intentions (to talk about  sex, monitor their activities and behaviors and stay involved); and  environmental barriers and facilitators (such as community norms) that  influence talking about sex.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During the sessions, participants engage in a series of  activities such as role-play, videotaped interactions, discussion, games, and  take-home assignments to be completed with their children. Program developers  realized that the inconvenience of traveling to other settings could be a  potential barrier to parent participation and that holding the meetings during  lunch accommodates busy parents.</p>

<div id="ftn3">
<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="" id="_ftn3"><span><sup>[3]</sup></span></a>  However, a number of other researchers suggest that continued monitoring  in adolescence is critical, citing relationships between low parental  monitoring of adolescents and high-risk sexual behavior and early pregnancy  (Dornbusch et al., 1985, Luster and Small, 1994.

<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="" id="_ftn6"><span><sup>[6]</sup></span></a>  This is partly a function of our search criteria, which do not reflect  earlier meta-analyses or reviews of early childhood programs. There are many  long established interventions with parents of younger children, specifically  pre-school age.

<div id="ftn10">
<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10" title="" id="_ftn10"><span><sup>[10]</sup></span></a>  In the original study, effects were found on condom use by sexually active  youth, but no other significant outcomes; adding the <i>ImPACT</i> parent  component appears to have strengthened the program considerably. In addition,  the study found significantly lower rates of sexual activity and increased  condom use. However, all of these outcomes were found for subgroups defined by  sexual activity at follow-up.</p>
</div>
<div id="ftn11">
<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="" id="_ftn11"><span><sup>[11]</sup></span></a>  The effect sizes for these variables were .31 and .37, suggesting that the  sample sizes may have been insufficient to detect significance at these levels.</p>

<div id="ftn12">
<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12" title="" id="_ftn12"><span><sup>[12]</sup></span></a>  Of course, some program developers/researchers are very clear about the  limits of their intervention: the authors of the studies of SAAF make it clear  that the program works for rural African-American families and may only work  for them. Dr. John Jemmott, in an article describing outcomes for an abstinence  intervention, suggested that the findings might only be generalized to urban  African-American youth willing to come to a class on Saturday mornings.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" title="" id="_ftn14"><span><sup>[14]</sup></span></a>Programs  offer a good deal of information on their websites, but information about  take-up and participation rates is not given, although it would be helpful for  agency staff and others contemplating the purchase of the program or  curriculum.</p>

<div id="ftn16">
<p class="MsoFootnoteText1"><a href="#_ftnref16" name="_ftn16" title="" id="_ftn16"><span><sup>[16]</sup></span></a>  It is worth noting that the services to youth are provided in conjunction  with services to parents and focus on self-regulation, social interaction and  communication skills.
