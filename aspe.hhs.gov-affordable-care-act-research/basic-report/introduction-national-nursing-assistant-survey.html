<p>The National Nursing Assistant Survey (NNAS) represents a major advance  		in the data available about certified nursing assistants and has the potential  		for numerous studies to improve our understanding of the direct care workforce.  		As the first national survey of certified nursing assistants working in nursing  		homes, this survey provides a framework for future evidence-based policy,  		practice and applied research initiatives to address the long-term care direct  		care workforce shortage. </p>
<p>The NNAS is sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE); its design and fielding were made possible  		through collaborations with two independent research organizations and a  		sustained partnership with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). As  		the first in a series of papers produced by ASPE and NCHS, this report  		highlights relevant research that led to federal interest in sponsoring this  		survey, provides a comprehensive overview of the procedures undertaken,  		describes the advantages of combining establishment and worker surveys, and  		highlights the potential uses of these data. Subsequent papers will report on  		survey findings to inform improved planning, decision-making and policy  		development.</p>

<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION TO THE NATIONAL NURSING ASSISTANT  		SURVEY</a></h2>
<p>Since the 1990s, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has  		made the long-term care workforce a major focal point of its policy research  		agenda. The largest and most visible of its research initiatives in this area  		is the National Nursing Assistant Survey (NNAS), the first national probability  		sample survey of nursing assistants employed in nursing homes. The NNAS was  		designed to provide an evidence base for understanding what draws individuals  		to careers as nursing assistants and to work in nursing homes, and what  		contributes to their satisfaction and likelihood of staying in their jobs. This  		report provides a historical perspective on the Federal Governments  		involvement in creating the NNAS as an example of the federal role in enhancing  		the direct service workforce availability and capability. Specifically, this  		report describes relevant research that led to federal interest in sponsoring  		this survey; introduces the NNAS, including the types of data collected, the  		methods undertaken, including the linkage between the NNAS and the 2004  		National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) the advantages of combining establishment  		and worker surveys, and the potential uses of these data; and highlights the  		expanded and improved NNHS.</p>
<p>The immediate antecedents of the NNAS can be found in Senate Report  		107-84, Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and  		Related Agencies Appropriation Bill. In fiscal year 2002, Congress requested  		that the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor identify the causes  		of labor force imbalances among frontline caregivers, including registered and  		licensed practical nurses, certified nurse aides and other direct care workers  		in long-term care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living and home  		health care. In addition, Congress requested that HHS and the Department of  		Labor (DOL) make comprehensive recommendations to the House and Senate  		Appropriations Committee to address the increasing demand of an aging  		population [Senate Report 107-84]. </p>
<p>The report, <i>The Future Supply of Long-Term Care Workers in Relation  		to the Aging Baby Boom Generation: Report to Congress</i>, is a product of  		collaboration between HHS and DOL in response to the requests from the U.S.  		Congress. One recommendation from this report was to support research  		activities to inform policymakers at all levels of government on the quality  		and availability of the long-term care workforce, including such issues as wage  		and benefits trends among frontline caregivers, understanding the effect of  		training and workplace culture on worker retention, and understanding how  		worker characteristics relate to recruitment and job satisfaction (HHS &amp;  		DOL, 2003).<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, ASPE contracted with an independent research organization to  		develop a series of design options for a national survey of paraprofessional  		workers in institutional and community-based settings. As work progressed, ASPE  		decided to fund one of the emerging design options, a National Survey of  		Certified Nursing Assistants in Nursing Homes. The objectives of the survey  		were to describe nursing assistants work experience and reasons for  		entering the field; to find out what changes in working conditions, wages,  		benefits, and career growth for nursing assistants would make the job more  		attractive; and to provide a better understanding of why nursing assistants  		leave the field. The survey of nursing assistants was fielded as a supplement  		to the 2004 NNHS at a sub-sample of nursing homes participating the NNHS.  		Ultimately, survey results will strengthen federal, state and provider efforts  		aimed at recruiting a qualified and committed workforce. ASPE is the sponsor of  		the NNAS; its design and implementation were made possible through  		collaborations with two independent research organizations, a national advisory  		group, private consultants, and a sustained partnership with the National  		Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  		(CDC). </p>
<h3>The Demand for Nursing Assistants</h3>
<p>The total number of Americans in need of long-term care is projected to  		more than double from 13 million in 2000 to 27 million in 2050 (HHS, 2003).  		Long-term care providers face tremendous challenges each day trying to provide  		high-quality care to clients. One of the greatest challenges is staff retention  		among direct care workers -- nursing assistants, personal care attendants and  		home health aides -- who provide hands-on services to clients. These frontline  		caregivers provide the majority of paid assistance to persons with disabilities  		(of all ages) in the formal long-term care delivery system (Stone &amp; Wiener,  		2001). Nursing assistants working in nursing facilities make up an estimated  		24.7% (593,490) of the over 2.4 million paraprofessional workers (AHCA, 2004;  		BLS, 2004). Since nursing assistants primarily provide hands-on assistance to  		clients with activities of daily living (ADLs), they are key players in  		determining the quality of paid long-term care.</p>
<p>Turnover among direct care workers is high and can reach rates of over  		100% in some organizations (GAO, 2001; Decker, Dollard &amp; Kraditor, 2001;  		Cohen-Mansfield, 1997).<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note3">3</a></font></sup>  		The nursing home industry, in particular, has been plagued for decades by an  		inability to recruit and retain nursing assistants (GAO, 2001). Long-term care  		providers are reporting national average nursing assistant turnover rates at  		71% and more than 52,000 vacant nursing assistant positions (AHCA, 2003). Gaps  		in staffing may disrupt the continuity of patient care (GAO, 2001), worker  		morale (Noelker &amp; Ejaz, 2001); worker safety (U.S. Bureau of Labor  		Statistics, 2002), and quality of care (Castle &amp; Engberg, 2006; Centers for  		Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2002; Kramer, Eilersten, Lin &amp; Hutt,  		2000; Harrington et al, 2000; Straker &amp; Atchley, 1999; Kayser-Jones &amp;  		Schell, 1997; Mercer, Heacock &amp; Beck, 1994; Bowers &amp; Becker, 1992).  		</p>
<p>Turnover of direct care workers has other repercussions as well: it is  		costly to the provider and to the payer (Seavey, 2004; NGA, 2004; Stone, 2004b;  		Noelker &amp; Ejaz, 2001; Straker &amp; Atchley, 1999; Pillemer, 1996). Both  		direct costs (recruiting, training new employees, and hiring temporary staff)  		and indirect costs (reduced productivity, deterioration in organizational  		culture and morale) associated with turnover can compromise the quality and  		continuity of clients care (Seavey, 2004; Noelker &amp; Ejaz, 2001).  		Further, costs for recruiting and training new direct care workers may be  		reflected in the demand for higher government reimbursement rates in order to  		maintain adequate care quality.</p>
<p>Turnover and high vacancy rates of direct care workers have implications  		for family caregivers as well. The inability to recruit and retain direct care  		workers places more pressure on informal (unpaid) family caregivers to provide  		care and exacerbates the challenge of arranging for formal care (Stone,  		2001a).</p>
<p>While the significance of the direct care workers role in the  		provision of long-term care has become more recognized by long-term care  		professionals and researchers, these workers experience stressful working  		conditions, little career mobility and are among the lowest paid workers in the  		health care field (NGA, 2004; Bowers, Esmond &amp; Jacobson, 2003; BLS, 2001;  		Stone &amp; Wiener, 2001; Callahan, 2001). Long-term care organizations,  		therefore, face considerable difficulty in recruiting and retaining direct care  		staff. As the demographics shift toward a larger aging population and greater  		demand for direct care workers, the recruitment and retention problem is likely  		to intensify. If left unaddressed, this emerging care gap could severely  		restrict the ability of providers to deliver adequate long-term care  		(Friedland, 2004; Stone, 2001b). </p>
<p>The ability to understand and replicate programs that reduce turnover  		can improve continuity of care while reducing the need for higher levels of  		reimbursement, yet evidence on what long-term care organizations and federal,  		state and local policymakers can do to reduce job turnover is quite limited.  		While wage and benefit increases have been deemed as possible solutions to the  		direct care worker turnover problem (HHS, 2002), impending Medicaid cuts render  		these solutions unlikely (NGA &amp; NASBO, 2005) and suggest the need for  		alternative solutions such as peer mentoring, career ladders, enhanced  		staff-family communication, alternative labor pools, multi-faceted initiatives  		(public awareness campaigns, career enhancements, quality improvement  		initiatives), and culture and managerial changes. These are the primary  		strategies currently being employed by providers and states (Harmuth &amp;  		Dyson, 2005; Stone, 2004a; Harris-Kojetin et al, 2004; McGuire et al, 2003).  		Moreover, supporting data to demonstrate the efficacy of the wage pass-through  		as a tool to reduce worker vacancies and turnover are lacking (PHI &amp; IFAS,  		2002).<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Adequate wage and benefit levels are important in recruiting and  		retaining committed and high-quality workers for direct care jobs (Howes,  		2006); however, increased benefits cannot, solely, resolve recruitment and  		retention problems (HHS, 2002). Studies have shown that factors other than  		wages and benefits can have an impact on intent to stay on the job and worker  		satisfaction (Harris-Kojetin et al, 2004; McGuire et al, 2003).</p>
<p>Employees attitudes about various aspects of their jobs, for  		example, affect their overall job satisfaction, their commitment and the  		likelihood that they will remain with their employer (Kuokkanen &amp;  		Katajisto, 2003; Burke, 2003; Laschinger, Finegan, &amp; Shamian, 2001). Survey  		research can reveal the most important drivers that positively or negatively  		impact job satisfaction, thereby informing targeted retention efforts in areas  		of supervision, skill development or advancement opportunities (Kiefer et al,  		2005). While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides employment  		estimates to monitor the labor force, no nationally descriptive information is  		collected directly from the paraprofessional workforce to evaluate what  		motivates individuals to choose careers as direct care workers in long-term  		care settings, and what contributes to the likelihood that they will continue  		in these positions based on their job satisfaction, environment, training, and  		advancement opportunities. Studies have collected such data from these workers,  		but they are state or community-specific (Brannon, 2005; Wyoming Department of  		Health, 2002; Onondaga County Department of Long-Term Care, 2001; Kopiec, 2000;  		Salmon et al, 1999), or focused on a specific segment of the workforce, such as  		older workers (Hwelek, 2005). </p>
<h3>The Move Toward Enhancing the Direct Service  		Workforce</h3>
<p>With widespread current shortages that are likely to increase as the  		demand increases, industry and policy leaders recognize the urgency that direct  		service workforce development plays for staffing the continuum of care outlined  		in the Presidents New Freedom Initiative (H.Con.Res.94, 2003;  		S.Con.Res.21, 2003; HHS, 2002). The goal of providing consumers with choices  		that maximize their independence can only occur if there are enough capable  		caregivers to provide such services. The DOL projections continue to list these  		jobs among those with the highest growth rate. The number of nursing  		assistants, orderlies and attendants are expected to increase by 22.3% (from  		1.455 million to 1.781 million); the number of personal and home care aides is  		expected to grow by 41% (from 701,000 to 988,000); and the number of home  		health aides is expected to grow by 56% (from 624,000 to 974,000) between  		2004-2014 (BLS, 2004). The community-based approaches that are supported by the  		New Freedom Initiative require many more direct services workers than are  		currently in the field. It is, therefore, critical that industry and policy  		leaders have access to information that is useful in improving the  		attractiveness of caregiving jobs and in reducing turnover. The NNAS provides a  		framework for future evidence-based policy, practice and applied research  		initiatives to address the long-term care direct care workforce shortage.</p>

<h3>Research Goal and Objectives</h3>
<p>The goal of the study is to provide industry and policy leaders with  		information that is useful for improving the attractiveness of long-term care  		paraprofessional caregiving jobs and in reducing turnover. In addition, the  		study sought to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Describe nursing assistants work experience and reasons for  			 entering the field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine what changes in working conditions, wages, benefits, and  			 career growth will make nursing assistants jobs more attractive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a better understanding of why nursing assistants leave the  			 field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a framework for future evidenced-based policy, practice and  			 applied research initiatives to address the long-term care direct care  			 workforce shortage.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The survey was conducted as a supplement to the 2004 NNHS. The 2004 NNHS  		is one in a continuing series of nationally representative sample surveys of  		United States nursing homes, their services, their staff, and their residents.  		The NNHS was first conducted in 1973-1974 and repeated in 1977, 1985, 1995,  		1997, 1999, and most recently in 2004. Although each survey has emphasized  		different topics, they all provide basic information about nursing homes, the  		services provided, their staff, and their residents. The nursing home survey  		was preceded by a series of surveys from 1963 through 1969, called the Resident  		Places Surveys.</p>
<p>Data for the NNHS are collected via on-site interviews with  		administrators and staff who are familiar with sampled residents and use  		facility and medical records to respond to the survey. For the NNAS nursing  		assistants were sampled from a subset of nursing homes participating in the  		NNHS.</p>
<h3>Participant Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<p>The target population for the NNAS is nursing assistants who work in  		nursing homes and assist residents with ADLs, including eating, transferring,  		toileting, dressing, and bathing. The nursing assistants must be paid to  		provide these services, must be certified by the state to provide  		Medicare/Medicaid reimbursable services (includes those currently in the  		process of certification and those who started working as a nurse aide prior to  		1987 when the certification process was implemented<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note5">5</a></font></sup>), and must be an employee of the  		nursing home. The nursing assistant can be either employed full or part-time,  		but must be working at least 16 hours per week. The survey instrument was  		translated into Spanish for nursing assistants who were unable to participate  		in English. </p>
<h3>Participant Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<p>The NNAS specifically excludes nursing assistants who are not certified  		(unless they are currently in the process of certification or started working  		as a nurse aide prior to 1987 when the certification process was implemented),  		are employed through contractual arrangements, and only provide assistance with  		instrumental ADLs, such as transportation, shopping, housekeeping, meal  		preparation, or medication administration. Nursing assistants who did not speak  		English or Spanish were excluded because providing interpretive services for  		other languages was cost prohibitive. Nursing assistants who worked less than  		16 hours per week were excluded from the survey to ensure that respondents  		would have had enough exposure and experience in the nursing home to accurately  		report on organizational culture and work policies. In addition, since the NNAS  		sample was selected from facilities participating in the NNHS, any workers in  		facilities excluded from the NNHS, were in turn excluded from the NNAS (those  		with fewer than three beds and not certified by Medicare or Medicaid or did not  		have a state license to operate as a nursing home). </p>
<p>Although the NNAS was designed to allow for a better understanding of  		organizational culture and how it relates to worker satisfaction, it is known  		that many nursing assistants hold down multiple jobs and may actually work in  		several nursing homes. To avoid potential confusion, contract workers and  		nursing assistants who worked less than 16 hours per week were excluded from  		the survey to ensure that respondents would have had enough exposure and  		experience in the nursing home to accurately report on organizational culture  		and work policies. Contract workers and those employed fewer than 16 hours per  		week may have different needs and work challenges than full-time employees.  		Moreover, facilities with a high percentage of these employees are likely to  		have a different work environment and organizational culture than those with  		fewer contract and part-time employees. </p>
<p>Only certified nursing assistants providing help with ADLs were eligible  		for the survey. Certified nursing assistants working in other roles, such as  		medication aides, or activity coordinators, and other non-certified direct care  		workers providing ADL assistance, such as feeding assistants, were ineligible  		for the survey. Undoubtedly, these workers face similar work challenges, yet  		the range of their workload, duties and responsibilities are fundamentally  		different than certified nursing assistants delivering help with ADLs.</p>
<h3>Sample Design</h3>
<p>The sample design for the nursing assistant survey was developed with  		the primary goal of preparing nationally representative and reliable estimates  		of nursing assistants. As such, the NNAS involved a stratified, multi-stage  		probability design in which nursing facilities were sampled and then nursing  		assistants were sampled within the facilities. The sample design allows for  		separate estimates to be calculated for workers by the Core Based Statistical  		Area (CBSA) geographical location of the nursing facility (metropolitan,  		micropolitan and neither), and for workers by tenure at the sampled facility  		(&lt; 1 year working at the sampled facility or <u>&gt;</u> 1 year working at  		the sampled facility). </p>
<p><b><i>Sampling Frame for Selection of Nursing Homes</i></b></p>
<p>For the 2004 NNHS, 1,500 nursing facilities were selected from a  		sampling frame of nursing homes in the United States. The sampling frame for  		the NNHS was drawn from two sources: (1) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS) Provider of Services (POS) file of nursing homes, and (2) state  		licensing lists compiled by a private organization. These two files contained  		approximately 17,000 nursing homes. The combined files were matched and  		unduplicated, resulting in a final sampling frame of 16,628 nursing homes.</p>
<h3>Sample Selection</h3>
<p><b><i>Selecting Nursing Facilities for the NNHS and NNAS</i></b></p>
<p>Each nursing facility was placed into a stratum comprised of bed-size  		category and CBSA status (metropolitan, micropolitan, neither). To permit  		implicit stratification within these broader sampling strata, nursing  		facilities were arrayed by certification status, hospital-based and  		non-hospital-based, ownership, geographic region, state, county, and zip code.  		Facilities were then selected using systematic sampling with probability  		proportional to their bed-size. 1,500 facilities were selected for the NNHS. A  		random sub-sample (n=790) of these selected facilities was then selected to  		participate in the NNAS. </p>
<p><b><i>Selecting Workers from Each Sampled Facility</i></b></p>
<p>At the time of the in-person interview with the facility administrator  		during data collection for the NNHS, the facility provided a list or lists of  		nursing assistants for sampling purposes. The interviewer cleaned and numbered  		the lists so that the nursing assistants were divided into the two tenure  		groups: (1) all nursing assistants employed by the facility for less than one  		year and, (2) all nursing assistants employed by the facility for one year or  		more as of midnight the day before the interview.<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> The interviewer entered the total number of  		nursing assistants employed for less than one year into a computer assisted  		personal interview system (CAPI); the CAPI program randomly selected up to four  		nursing assistants. The process was repeated for the nursing assistants  		employed for one year or more. </p>
<h3>Response Rate</h3>
<p>The response rate for the NNAS is a function of the response rate for  		nursing homes and the response rate among nursing assistants. For the 2004  		NNAS, a random sub-sample of 790 facilities was selected from the 1,500 nursing  		facilities selected for the 2004 NNHS. Of these, 21 facilities were determined  		to be out of scope.<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> Of  		the 769 eligible facilities, 164 did not participate in any aspect of the NNHS  		and 23 others elected not to participate in the NNAS portion of the survey.  		This resulted in a facility response rate of 75.7%. From the 582 eligible  		facilities that agreed to participate in the NNAS, 4,542 nursing assistants  		were sampled. Of these, 4,274 were eligible and 3,017 completed an interview,  		yielding a response rate of 70.6% among eligible nursing assistants, with an  		overall NNAS response rate of 53.4%<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table1">Table 1</a>). </p>
<p>Overall the major reason for non-response was inability to contact the  		nursing assistants. Although 74% of nursing homes provided contact information  		(e.g., home phone number and address), 22% of the eligible nursing assistants  		could not be located. Only 3% of contacted nursing assistants refused to  		participate in the NNAS. For refusals who returned their postcard,<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> the reason for refusal is  		unknown. Reasons for refusals among those contacted by phone included no time  		to do an interview, concern over confidentiality, compensation was not  		adequate, and/or poor English skills.</p>
<p>About 6% (n=268) of the cases were ineligible for the survey. Of the  		ineligible cases, 227 completed the screener questions and were determined to  		be ineligible for the NNAS; 41 were determined ineligible based on information  		obtained from the NNHS interviewer or the facility about a sampling error  		(i.e., were not nursing assistants or did not work at the facility at the time  		of the survey). The majority of those deemed ineligible were working less than  		16 hours per week, a criterion for exclusion. Other nursing assistants were  		deemed ineligible because they had not completed a formal nursing assistant  		course and passed a test in nursing assistant training.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Instrumentation</h3>
<p>The survey instrument was designed with input from ASPE and members of  		the technical advisory panel, as well as representatives from the National  		Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety and  		Health Administration and CMS. The NNAS was designed to measure job  		satisfaction and organizational culture, as well as to provide basic  		information on job history, family life, and intention to continue to work as a  		nursing assistant. </p>
<p>The final survey instrument, designed to be administered by telephone,  		consisted of ten primary sections: recruitment (7 items); education, training,  		and licensure (19 items); job history (17 items); family life (17 items);  		management and supervision (10 items); client relations (8 items);  		organizational commitment and job satisfaction (14 items); workplace  		environment (8 items); work-related injuries (14 items), and demographics (10  		items). Eligible nursing assistants who were no longer working at the facility  		when contacted were asked to complete a separate facility leaver section of the  		survey (11 items). <a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table2">Table 2</a> provides an overview of key  		subject areas on the NNAS questionnaire. A detailed listing of variables is  		located in <a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>. </p>
<p>Content validity of the final instrument was established by means of a  		technical advisory panel with expertise in survey methodology and sample  		design, long-term care paraprofessional workforce issues, health policy, and  		evaluation. Question formats that allowed for the survey to be conducted as  		expeditiously as possible were used (i.e., closed-ended questions, checklists).  		</p>
<p>The instrument was tested using a convenience sample of nursing  		assistants in English (n=9) and Spanish (n=8) for timing, basic comprehension  		and flow, and was refined based on the results. The interviews were completed  		in stages, with a few interviews being completed, followed by changes being  		applied for the next group of interviews. Telephone interviewers conducted  		these preliminary interviews. </p>

</tr></table><p>The approach used for translating and testing the Spanish-language  		version of the questionnaire utilized guidelines from the U.S. Census Bureau.  		Rather than back-translating, the Spanish instrument was <i>adapted</i> from  		English. This process of <i>adaptation</i> allowed for parts of a question to  		be altered from the source document in order to capture cross-cultural  		differences across languages. The translation team included translators,  		translation reviewers and translation adjudicators. Since this is a national  		survey, the translation was targeted to the general Spanish-speaking population  		of the United States, rather than to dialects from specific regions, such as  		Mexico, Puerto Rico, or South America. The final translation captured all items  		from the source document; no new or extraneous items were added (DesRoches,  		Santos &amp; Stapulonis, 2004). </p>
<p>Overall, both the English and Spanish interviews with nursing assistants  		were conducted with few problems. Respondents were able to understand the  		intent of the questions, and there were very few instances of item non-response  		due to question sensitivity. Interviewers displayed little difficulty in  		administering the questionnaire due to skip patterns or question wording; as a  		result, there was a limited number of missed skips and interviewer errors.</p>
<h3>Pilot Test</h3>
<p>A pilot was conducted from March through April 2004, to assess the  		effectiveness of advance materials and contact procedures; procedures for  		selecting the sample; instrument administration time and question wording, and  		the collection, quality and processing of contact information. The NNAS pilot  		test consisted of two phases: field interviewer training and data collection,  		and telephone interviewer training and data collection.<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> Nursing assistants for the pilot were  		defined in the same way they were defined for the national sample, and the  		pilot sample was also stratified by tenure (&lt; 1 year, <u>&gt;</u> 1 year). A  		sample of 63 nursing assistants was selected from eight facilities from a  		sample of 12 facilities which had also participated in the NNHS pilot test.  		While the nursing facilities used on the pilot test for the NNAS had also  		participated in the NNHS pilot test, the pilot data collection for the NNHS and  		the NNAS were not conducted at the same time. Of these eight facilities, only  		one nursing home administrator (12.5%) provided contact information for the  		sampled nursing assistants. Since the majority of nursing home administrators  		did not provide contact information for nursing assistants, improvements were  		made in the advance materials and a decision was made to create a stand-alone  		recruitment packet. To assist in developing these materials, two focus groups  		and two cognitive interview sessions were held in June 2004 with nursing  		assistants to elicit feedback on the various versions of advance materials  		proposed for the NNAS. Final advance materials were developed based on the  		feedback provided by the nursing assistants.</p>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p>This section describes the procedures used for to the NNAS data  		collection including those used for informing the facilities about the NNAS,  		selecting the sample, contacting the selected nursing assistants, and follow-up  		procedures to increase response rates. This section concludes with an overview  		of study limitations.</p>
<h3>Advance Materials for Facilities</h3>
<p>The NNHS facilities selected for the NNAS were informed about the survey  		as part of the advance contact materials sent to the nursing home administrator  		that included an advance letter, appointment call, appointment confirmation  		letter, and an appointment confirmation call. The appointment confirmation  		letter explained that up to eight nursing assistants would be selected in the  		facility and that contact information would also be collected. Facilities were  		asked to provide a list of nursing assistants employed by the facility with an  		indicator of whether their tenure was less than one year or one year or more at  		the time of the in-person interview at the facility. </p>
<p>In the appointment confirmation packet, the facility administrator  		received a copy of letters provided by three professional nursing assistant  		organizations endorsing the NNAS, including the National Association of  		Geriatric Nursing Assistants, the National Network of Career Nursing  		Assistants, and the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute. The appointment  		confirmation packet also included a NNAS flyer (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#exhibit1">Exhibit  		1</a>) and an advance letter (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#exhibit2">Exhibit 2</a>) for the  		administrator to present to all nursing assistants employed by the facility to  		provide information about the survey. The NNAS flyer was designed to be posted  		in an area of the facility where nursing assistants would most likely see it.  		It alerted the nursing assistants that the NNAS was coming and that they might  		be chosen to participate. The flyer incorporated the NNAS logo and color theme  		and addressed the purpose of the survey, the $35 incentive payment, the  		voluntary nature of the survey, that the interviews would be conducted by  		telephone, and assurance of the confidential nature of the survey. It also  		included HHS and CDC logos, the NNHS web site address, and the NNAS toll-free  		number. Each facility received two copies of the flyer. The NNAS advance letter  		contained similar information to the flyer. It was printed on NNAS letterhead  		designed to be distributed to all of the nursing assistants in the facility  		either with their paycheck or in a mailbox at work or whatever manner the  		administrator decided to use to distribute the letters.</p>
<h3>Activities to Contact Nursing Assistants</h3>
<p><b><i>Contact Information</i></b></p>
<p>During the on-site interviews for the NNHS, eight nursing assistants  		were selected to participate in the NNAS. The NNHS field interviewers then  		prepared packets (described below) for distribution by the facility. The  		interviewers also asked facility administrators to provide contact information  		for each of the selected nursing assistants. Contact information requested  		included the nursing assistants first and last name, home address, home  		phone number and other number (if available), and shift the nursing assistant  		usually worked. NNAS pilot test results indicated that fewer than 15% of the  		nursing homes provided contact information for the selected nursing assistants,  		therefore the primary strategy planned for contacting nursing assistants was  		through information packets distributed by the facility. These packets  		(described in more detail below) included a postcard nursing assistants could  		complete if they wanted to participate in the survey. The information packets  		were personalized by the NNHS field interviewers during the on-site interviews  		and distributed by a facility contact person designated by the facility  		administrator (e.g., the administrator, director of nursing, or staff from the  		human resource office). This individual signed a receipt form acknowledging  		receipt of the packets and was usually the person who was contacted later for  		follow-up activities.</p>
<p>Although the pilot test indicated that most facilities would not provide  		nursing assistant contact information, approximately 74% of facilities  		participating in the NNAS did provide contact information for the sampled  		nursing assistants. Having contact information proved extremely important.  		Telephone interviewers used this information as an additional means to contact  		nursing assistants to solicit participation in the survey. </p>
<h3><a name="NAinfopacket" id="NAinfopacket">Information Packets for Nursing  		Assistants</a></h3>
<p>The NNAS information packets were designed to provide information about  		the survey in a variety of formats, and to encourage the nursing assistants to  		open the packet and explore the materials (i.e., bright colorful logo on a  		large envelope that obviously contained more than just sheets of paper) (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table3">Table 3</a>). </p>

</tr></table><p>The advance materials detailed the purpose of the survey and its  		voluntary and confidential nature. Respondents were informed that the telephone  		interview would take about 40 minutes and would collect information on topics  		including training, supervision, job history, work setting, wages, education  		and benefits. In addition to the $5 prepaid incentive included in the NNAS  		information packet, nursing assistants were told they would receive a $30 check  		mailed after the interview was completed. </p>
<h3>Telephone Interviewer Training</h3>
<p>Survey staff involved in data collection for the NNAS participated in  		formal training sessions. Telephone Research Center (TRC) team leader, support  		staff and supervisor training included an introduction to the NNAS, an overview  		of the advance contacting procedures and materials for the NNAS, and detailed  		information on telephone contact procedures for the nursing assistants.  		Interviewers and TRC staff were shown the DVD which was included in the nursing  		assistant information packet to provide an overview of the importance of the  		survey. Interviewers participated in formal in-person training sessions on  		collecting the NNAS data using the computer-assisted telephone interview  		(CATI). In addition, two Spanish bilingual interviewers and team leaders were  		trained and participated in data collection using a Spanish version of the  		CATI.</p>
<p>The training program included a detailed overview of the NNAS, the  		survey purpose and importance, and the advance materials sent to nursing  		assistants. In addition, training sessions included lectures, interactive  		sessions and role-play. The interactive exercises were designed to familiarize  		interviewers with the screening process, the different interview pattern for  		nursing assistants who were no longer working at the sample facility, and how  		to record the nursing assistants job history. Interviewers were trained  		to read all questions verbatim to the respondent. Supervisors and team leaders  		also participated in the interviewer training sessions, providing coaching on  		interviewer telephone skills and use of the CATI. Team leaders monitored the  		interviewers throughout the field period for quality assurance (Edwards,  		Tourangeau, Branden, Lohr, &amp; Vincent, 2005). </p>
<h3>Nursing Assistant Data Collection Activities</h3>
<p>The telephone interviews began in September 2004, about one month after  		the NNHS data collection began and ended February 2005, approximately one month  		after data collection for the NNHS ended. To participate in the NNAS interview,  		nursing assistants either called in on the NNAS 800 toll-free line or were  		contacted by a TRC interviewer using the telephone number provided by the  		facility or information provided on the postcard nursing assistants completed  		and mailed. Some nursing assistants returned the postcard and called the  		toll-free number. If the nursing assistant could not complete the interview at  		the time they called the toll-free number or when the telephone interviewer  		contacted them, an appointment was set to complete the interview at a later  		time.</p>
<p>The telephone interviewers read a consent statement as part of the  		introductory script and at the beginning of the CATI interview to which NNAS  		respondents had to respond affirmatively to before the interview could  		continue. This consent statement adhered to the informed consent principles of  		the NCHS Institutional Review Board (IRB). To meet IRB guidelines for this  		project, the English version of the informed consent was written at an  		eighth-grade reading level.<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> Since the survey was judged to involve  		minimal risk, signed informed consent was not obtained.</p>
<p>Telephone interviews were conducted using a CATI instrument. Most of the  		TRC staff selected to conduct the NNAS interviews had previous CATI experience.  		Interviewers, reading from a computer screen, asked each question as it  		appeared on the screen. Interviewers entered responses directly into the CATI  		system. This process eliminated the need for separate data entry and  		automatically guided the interviewer through questionnaire skip patterns. The  		interviews were conducted during nonworking hours (Edwards et al, 2005). </p>
<p>Supervisors monitored approximately 10% of all interviewers work  		for adherence to the study protocol. Clarification of issues and problems  		identified during monitoring was provided to the interviewers and team leaders  		in memos. TRC supervisors were also available throughout the data collection to  		respond to interviewer questions or other issues that arose.</p>
<p><i><b>Follow-up Activities </b></i></p>
<p>There were three types of follow-up activities for participating NNAS  		nursing home facilities. The first, about one week after the NNHS visit, the  		NNAS facility contact was sent a cover letter and reminder letters to be  		distributed to the selected nursing assistants. The purpose of the reminder  		letters was two-fold: it served as a reminder for the nursing assistants to  		participate in the survey, and it served as a reminder to the NNAS facility  		contact to distribute the NNAS consent packets if he or she had not done so  		already. At this time, a few of the NNAS facility contacts reported that they  		were unable to deliver the NNAS information packets to a selected nursing  		assistant or reported a problem with the selection of a particular nursing  		assistant (i.e., a nursing assistant selected was not eligible for the survey).  		</p>
<p>The second follow-up activity was a call to the NNAS facility contact if  		none of the selected nursing assistants returned a postcard or called the NNAS  		toll-free number to participate in the survey within three weeks of when the  		facility interview was completed. The third follow-up activity was a call to  		the NNAS facility to get additional contact information for nursing assistants  		who were difficult to reach. This follow-up activity was implemented  		approximately two months after the survey began. Both TRC interviewers and  		field interviewers contacted facilities that had provided contact information  		for the selected nursing assistants to get additional contact information. If  		the facility could not provide any additional contact information for a nursing  		assistant, the interviewer requested that the NNAS facility contact nursing  		assistants to remind them about the survey and provide the toll-free number for  		the nursing assistant to call to participate.</p>
<p><i><b>Tracing Activities</b></i></p>
<p>Cases for which there was contact information, but either no telephone  		number or the telephone number provided was wrong, not in service, or no answer  		were traced by six specially trained NNAS TRC interviewers, supervised by an  		experienced TRC tracing specialist. Tracing activities were limited attempts to  		contact the selected nursing assistant or relatives of the selected nursing  		assistant and involved calling directory assistance and searching Internet  		databases. Cases that the TRC had difficulty reaching after eight call attempts  		or cases for which there was no viable telephone number were sent a letter if a  		mailing address was available. </p>
<p>Two months after the survey began, follow-up for pending tracing cases  		was initiated with facilities that provided contact information for the  		selected nursing assistants. If the facility was unable to provide new or  		additional contact information for the selected nursing assistant, the standard  		tracing activities were implemented for the case. </p>
<h3>Data Processing, Weighting and Survey Estimates</h3>
<p><i><b>Data Processing (Coding and Editing)</b></i></p>
<p>Data processing for the NNAS included coding of other  		specify text strings, open-ended items and self-reported occupational  		information; reconciling interviewer remarks, and calls to the telephone  		hotline from NNHS field interviewers regarding the NNAS; and periodic reviews  		of the database to identify skip pattern, valid range violations, and any other  		coding or keying anomalies. Data were verified and de-duplicated (as needed) so  		that each verbatim response coded was unique (coded only once).</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Other specify</b> responses were coded by assigning a code for  			 one of the established response categories when appropriate and by adding  			 additional codes for responses that did not fit into an established  			 category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Open-ended items</b> were coded by applying new codes  			 (categories) to the extracted responses. An electronic Classification Table was  			 established for each item, consisting of the pre-codes from the original  			 interview questions and any new categories established by the coding  			 supervisor. Coding was verified in monthly batches and reviewed in frequency  			 tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b> Self-reported occupation information</b> was coded using  			 standard industry and occupation codes. The jobs industry was coded using  			 the North American Industry Classification System industry coding  			 classification, assigning the full six digits, as published by BLS (BLS,  			 <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesnaics.htm">http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesnaics.htm</a>,  			 last accessed 3/14/06). For occupation coding the BLS Standard Occupational  			 Classification, October 2000, ISBN 0-934213-77-1 was used (BLS,  			 <a href="http://www.bls.gov/soc/home.htm">http://www.bls.gov/soc/home.htm</a>,  			 last accessed 3/14/06). The structure of this code is also six digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>Remarks</b> are comments, questions, and additional data keyed  			 as text into the CATI instrument by interviewers during the interview. These  			 entries were reviewed by coding staff, trained in the flow and content of the  			 NNAS, to determine if data entered in various fields required editing.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>For many of the NNAS items, editing occurred during data collection.  		Hard and soft range checks were built into the CATI system, as well as hard and  		soft consistency checks between multiple variables. Hard edits required the  		interviewer to fix the discrepant data before the interview could continue.  		Soft edits resulted in a prompt for the interviewer who could either correct  		the data or suppress the edit. All items were reviewed extensively to insure  		that individual responses were accurate, consistent, logical and complete. When  		necessary, records were reviewed to resolve inconsistencies, and in some cases  		responses were recoded (Edwards et al, 2005). </p>
<p><i><b>Survey Weighting Procedures</b></i></p>
<p>Because the NNAS is designed to produce national estimates for nursing  		assistants, the data must have weights to inflate the sample numbers to the  		national estimates. Each record on the data file has a weight for this purpose.  		By aggregating these weights, counts for national data can be obtained. </p>
<p>In order to create unbiased national estimates, statistics for nursing  		assistants are computed using a weight associated with each sampled nursing  		assistant. The weight is constructed to reflect the design of the sample: a  		multi-stage, probability proportional to size, systematic random design. The  		following are components to the weight: </p>
<ol><li>
<p>Inverse of the Probability of Selecting the Nursing Assistant</p>
<p>The probability of selection of a nursing assistant is a product of  			 the three selection probabilities: the probability of selecting a facility to  			 the NNHS sample; the probability a facility was sampled in the NNAS; and the  			 probability the nursing assistant was selected within the sample NNAS facility.  			 The inverse of the product of these probabilities is used in  			 weighting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjustment for Non-Response</p>
<p>The second component for calculating the weight is adjustment for  			 non-response. There are three types of non-response. The first two types are  			 facility level and the third is person level. The first type occurs when  			 in-scope facilities did not respond to the NNHS. The second type occurs when an  			 in-scope facility does not provide the number of nursing assistants employed.  			 The third type occurs when the individual nursing assistants sampled fail to  			 respond. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ratio Adjustment and Weight Smoothing</p>
<p>The final components of calculating weights involve ratio adjustment  			 and smoothing. Ratio adjustments are made within each of the groups defined by  			 region to adjust for over- or under-sampling of facilities reported in the  			 sampling frame. This adjustment is a multiplicative factor whose numerator was  			 the number of facilities in the sampling frame within each region and whose  			 denominator was the estimated number of facilities for that same group. Ratio  			 adjusted weights are smoothed only if there are disproportionally large  			 weights. In smoothing, totals are preserved.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><i><b>Survey Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>Since data are based on a sample, they will differ somewhat from data  		that would have been obtained if a complete census had been taken using the  		same instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error is primarily  		a measure of the variability that occurs by chance because only a sample,  		rather than the entire universe, is surveyed. The standard error also reflects  		part of the measurement error, but it does not measure any systematic biases in  		the data or other non-sampling errors. The chances are about 95 in 100 that an  		estimate from the sample differs from the value that would be obtained from a  		complete census by less than twice the standard error. Standard errors for this  		survey need to be computed using statistical software programs that take into  		account the complex survey design (e.g. SUDAAN and SAS and STATA) (RTI, 2005;  		SAS Institute, 2003; StataCorp, 2005). </p>
<h3>Confidentiality of Data</h3>
<p>Participation in surveys conducted by the NCHS is voluntary, and  		information on individuals and/or facilities is confidential. Strict procedures  		are utilized to prevent disclosure of confidential data in survey operations  		and data dissemination. The NNAS, was conducted as a supplement of the NNHS,  		which is authorized by Congress in Section 306 of the Public Health Service Act  		(42 USC 242K). In accordance with Section 308(d) (42 U.S.C. 242m) of the Public  		Health Service Act, no information collected in this survey may be used for any  		purpose other than the purpose for which it is collected. Such information may  		not be published or released in any form if the individual or establishment is  		identifiable unless the individual or establishment has consented to such  		release. The information provided by nursing homes and nursing assistants is  		used solely for statistical research and reporting purposes. </p>
<h3>Survey Limitations</h3>
<p>Insufficient sample sizes for items with low prevalence in the  		population is a limitation common to all sample surveys. For example, making  		accurate estimates of responses to many survey items for male nursing  		assistants may not be possible since the prevalence of male nursing assistants  		working in nursing homes is about 8%. Another limitation of the survey is the  		use of other specify response options for many of the questionnaire  		items. Although many of these open-ended responses could be back coded to  		established response categories or new response categories could be created  		when a sufficient number of nursing assistants provided the similar responses,  		many of the responses could not be coded into a meaningful category or were of  		low prevalence and hence will not produce reliable estimates. Although some  		information (e.g., demographic information and reason for termination) was  		collected on nursing assistants who reported that they terminated employment  		between the time they were sampled and the time they completed the survey  		(<i>Facility Leavers</i>),<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> use of this information is limited. First  		the sample size is small (n=120) limiting many analyses. Second, the cohort of  		facility leavers may not be representative of all leavers. The NNAS was  		designed to select a national probability sample of current workers and not of  		facility leavers. Collecting some information on facility leavers was judged as  		useful for future research efforts to understand nursing assistant  		turnover.</p>
<h2><a name="combine" id="combine">III. COMBINING ESTABLISHMENT AND WORKER  		SURVEYS</a></h2>
<p>This section focuses on the methodological benefits of combining the  		NNAS and NNHS. First the methodological benefits of combining establishment and  		worker surveys in general is presented, with specific examples from combining  		the NNHS and NNAS. Next an overview of the 2004 NNHS, including new content  		areas and data collection methods is presented. </p>
<h3>Advantages of Combining Establishment and Worker  		Surveys</h3>
<p>Developing a list or sampling frame of all eligible direct care workers  		is impractical and costly. Although some workers are self-employed, the vast  		majority are employed by nursing facilities, home and hospice care agencies and  		other alternative residential care facilities such as board and care homes or  		assisted living facilities. Surveying workers in various long-term care  		settings through the establishments where they work is an efficient way to  		construct a sampling frame and select a sample of workers. Moreover, combining  		the surveys increases the likelihood of getting contact information on the  		workers. In this case, contact information was secured from 74% of the  		facilities in a national survey where the two surveys were combined versus  		12.5% in the pilot survey where the two surveys were not combined. Using an  		established survey like the NNHS, reduces the time, effort and costs involved  		in reaching nursing assistants and soliciting their participation in the  		survey. </p>
<p>The direct care workforce consists largely of low-income workers.  		Low-income populations are among the most difficult groups to locate and  		interview, and they may be less motivated to participate in surveys compared to  		other income groups (Singer &amp; Kulka, 2002). They are extremely mobile. Many  		are suspicious of attempts to interview them because they associate the  		interview process with government and authority. They are more likely than most  		populations to be without a telephone; less likely to have established credit  		histories; and are seldom included in mailing lists and other databases that  		provide information to commercial locating databases. Hence, these populations  		are difficult to trace using conventional methods (Sinclair et al, 2003).  		Contacting workers through their employers could provide additional legitimacy  		for the survey and a way to follow-up with non-responders and workers who  		initially may be reluctant to participate. </p>
<p>Other advantages to combining a telephone survey of workers with an  		establishment survey of their employers include the ability to reduce field  		costs, reduce respondent burden, improve response rates, and increase the  		analytic potential of both surveys. The costs of contacting the nursing homes,  		recruitment activities, and travel to the facility to collect data could be  		covered by the establishment survey. Nursing home administrators would only be  		asked to participate in one survey. Many facilities are already working under  		constrained staffing conditions and are regularly expected to respond to  		extensive federal and state regulatory requirements. Pairing a survey of  		nursing homes and a survey of their workers could reduce respondent burden and  		improve response rates. Combining the two surveys eliminates potential data  		collection duplication that occurs if the surveys were conducted independently.  		Finally, by linking data collected from the workers to data collected on the  		establishment, the analytic potential of both surveys is enhanced. Linked data  		sets enable researchers to explore the relationship between facility practices,  		worker characteristics and perceptions, and resident outcomes.</p>
<h3>Expanded 2004 National Nursing Home Survey</h3>
<p>Like its predecessor surveys conducted periodically since 1973, the 2004  		NNHS uses a national probability sample of nursing homes to collect data on  		facility characteristics, including information about staffing and their  		residents. All nursing homes included in 2004, the most recent survey, had at  		least three beds and were either certified by Medicare or Medicaid or had a  		state license to operate as a nursing home. Based on interviews with the  		administrators and staff, the survey collects data on facility bedsize,  		ownership, staffing, number of residents, certification status, services  		provided, and basic charges. For residents, data are obtained on demographic  		characteristics, functional and health status, diagnoses, services received,  		and sources of payment. </p>
<p>The 2004 NNHS was redesigned and expanded to better meet the data needs  		of researchers and health care planners working to ensure that quality  		long-term care will be available for the nations growing senior  		population. New content areas include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Medications. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical, mental health, and dental services offered or  			 provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-of-life care and advance directives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education, specialty credentials, and length of service of key  			 staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turnover and stability of nursing staff, use of contract/agency  			 staff, overtime shifts worked, wages and benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facility practices for immunization, dining, and use of mechanical  			 lifting devices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For the first time, the survey was conducted using CAPI. The CAPI system  		makes it easier for respondents to participate in the survey and speeds the  		processing of data so that information can be released on a timely basis. The  		2004 NNHS also included a self-administered questionnaire sent to the facility  		prior to the on-site interview to obtain more in depth information on staffing  		characteristics. The NNHS currently provides information on nursing homes from  		two perspectives: the POS and the care recipient. The addition of the NNAS to  		the 2004 NNHS provides a new perspective, that of the direct care worker.</p>
<h2><a name="use" id="use">IV. USES OF SURVEY DATA AND DATA PUBLICATION</a></h2>
<h3>Potential Uses of the National Nursing Assistant  		Survey</h3>
<p>The NNAS represents a major advance in the data available about nursing  		assistants and has the potential for numerous studies to improve our  		understanding of the direct care workforce. One of the many benefits of the  		NNAS is that it allows researchers to focus on nursing assistants as a subset  		of the larger, broader group of long-term care direct care workers. Findings  		from this survey will be of great interest to a range of stakeholders,  		including federal and state policymakers, federal agencies, provider  		organizations, workforce experts and researchers, professional worker  		associations and labor market analysts. There are several topics addressed in  		the NNAS that will inform policy and practice (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table4">Table  		4</a>).</p>

</tr></table><p>The NNAS will provide the first estimates of the nursing assistant  		population based on a national probability sample of a cross section of  		certified nursing assistants employed in nursing homes. Results from this  		survey will create a framework for future evidence-based policy, practice and  		applied research initiatives to address long-term care direct care workforce  		shortages. Although the major focus of the NNAS is to provide descriptive data,  		the survey also has exploratory, confirmatory, and developmental aspects.  		Specifically, the NNAS is designed to:</p>
<ol><li>Support descriptive analyses of individual and workplace  		  characteristics of nursing assistants working in nursing homes; </li>
<li>Support analyses of relationships that exist between why individuals  		  enter or leave direct care work and what contributes to job satisfaction and  		  retention; </li>
<li>Examine patterns and effects of various independent  		  variables<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> on  		  recruitment, retention, job satisfaction and turnover; </li>
<li>Correlate facility characteristics with key policy and practice  		  issues of interest; </li>
<li>Identify where the nursing home industry has been successful in  		  addressing certain labor issues; and</li>
<li>Identify methods that are likely to be effective in reducing turnover  		  and increasing staff retention. </li>
</ol><p>Empirical research on nursing assistants has revealed associations  		between job satisfaction and turnover (Feldman, Sapienza &amp; Kane, 1990) and  		intent to leave (Parsons, Simmons, Penn &amp; Furlough, 2003); established  		linkages between job satisfaction and quality of care (Chou, Boldy, &amp; Lee,  		2002); staff turnover and quality (Castle &amp; Engberg, 2006 &amp; 2005); and  		human resource management and quality of care (Eaton, 2000).<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> Research has also revealed  		predictors of job satisfaction and turnover (Waxman, Carner &amp; Berkenstock,  		1984); established linkages between inadequate training and satisfaction and  		retention (Pillemer et al, 1998); and clarified the nature of working  		conditions (Tellis-Nayak &amp; Tellis-Nayak, 1989). Yet few seminal research  		studies have had large enough samples to sufficiently examine the recruitment,  		retention, job satisfaction and turnover of certified nursing assistants in  		greater detail. </p>
<p>The NNAS, in contrast, allows for testing of various assertions through  		both simple and complex analyses using a large sample of nursing assistants (n=  		3,017, which when weighted, represents 702,500 nursing assistants) (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table5">Table 5</a>). The survey allows for an in-depth description of  		nursing assistant characteristics and attitudes. Additionally, the sample size  		permits stratification by variables that may be confounders, thereby clarifying  		possible differences between subgroups of nursing assistants. For example,  		because both nursing assistants who have completed the OBRA<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> mandated training and nursing  		assistants who were grandfathered in were included in the survey, responses for  		both types of nursing assistants can be analyzed. In addition, separate  		estimates can be calculated by the CBSA location (formerly MSA status) of the  		nursing facility or by tenure (&lt; 1 year, <u>&gt;</u> 1 year).<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> It is also possible to examine factors  		associated with specific response categories, for example, the environmental  		characteristics that are associated with intent to leave, while controlling for  		other potential confounders such as wages.</p>
<p>Following are a few specific examples of how these data can be used. In  		many cases, the availability of linked data (detailed later in this section)  		will enhance the usefulness of the information highlighted here (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table5">Table 5</a>). </p>

</tr></table><h3>Potential Uses of the NNAS Data Linked with the NNHS and  		Other Data Sources</h3>
<p>A major advantage of using the NNHS as a vehicle to conduct a survey of  		nursing assistants is the ability to combine data from both surveys. Both  		surveys obtain data from probability samples, which means the data provide a  		comprehensive picture of United States nursing homes, residents, and the  		nursing assistant workforce. Combining data from the NNAS with data from the  		NNHS enables three types of analyses: </p>
<ol><li>Measures of association between the characteristics of nursing  		  facilities and nursing assistants perceptions and outcomes; </li>
<li>Measures of association between the characteristics of nursing  		  facilities, nursing assistant perceptions and outcomes, and resident outcomes;  		  and </li>
<li>Measures of association between facility and nursing assistant  		  responses on similar experiences (<a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#table6">Table 6</a>). </li>
</ol><p>The two surveys include measures of structure and process for the  		facility and outcome measures for nursing assistants and residents.<sup><font><a href="introduction-national-nursing-assistant-survey.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> Thus it is possible to look at  		relationships between facility characteristics and nursing assistant outcomes,  		and facility and nursing assistant characteristics and resident outcomes. For  		the purpose of the following description we broadened the definition of  		outcomes to include outcomes pertinent to nursing assistants, such as job  		satisfaction.</p>

Empirical studies have established linkages between these variables and quality  		of care (Chou, Boldy, &amp; Lee, 2002; Castle &amp; Engberg, 2006 &amp; 2005).  		Use of the linked NNAS/NNHS data sets will allow researchers to determine the  		role of these variables while controlling for other structural and process  		variables.</p>
<p>Because both surveys collect identical information from two  		perspectives, that of the facility administrator and that of the nursing  		assistant, such things as wages and benefits and the congruence of facility and  		nursing assistant responses can be compared as well. </p>
<p>Additional analyses are also possible, as the 2004 NNHS can be linked to  		other data sources such as the CMSs Minimum Data Set (MDS), facility  		quality indicator reports, the Online Survey and Certification Automated Record  		system, and Medicare claims files. These data sources provide additional  		information on clinical status and outcomes for residents, facility quality  		measures, facility characteristics, health services utilization and care costs.  		NNHS data can also be linked to the Area Resource File to provide information  		on market characteristics that can affect how nursing homes operate and the  		care they provide. </p>
<p>Survey data and administrative data can be useful by themselves in  		answering many policy questions. However, a much wider range of questions can  		be addressed by linking multiple data sets. For example, the use of large data  		sets in long-term care has the potential to be used to improve quality of care,  		both directly and indirectly. As Ryan and colleagues point out there is a  		critical need to design new methods and longitudinal experiments that bring  		together clinical and organizational (administrative) databases[large  		datasets offer the potential] to develop, test and explicate theory about the  		causal relationships between structure and process variables and related  		outcomes of long-term care (Ryan, Stone, &amp; Raynor, 2004, p.44). </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Facility Characteristics, Nursing Assistant Perceptions,  		Outcomes</i></b></p>
<p>Previous research demonstrates that various nursing home structural and  		process characteristics such as facility ownership and chain membership,  		staffing levels, top management and registered nurse turnover, staffing  		patterns, resident case mix, and Medicaid census influence nursing assistant  		perceptions of job satisfaction as well as nursing assistant turnover and  		retention (Castle &amp; Engberg, 2006; Burgio, Fisher, Fairchild, Scilley &amp;  		Hardin, 2004; Harrington &amp; Swan, 2003; Brannon, Zinn, Mor &amp; Davis,  		2002). Linking data from the NNHS and the NNAS can provide additional insight  		into how these and other structural and process variables such as membership in  		a union, benefits, use of advance practice nurses, use of contract/temporary  		staff, and overtime shifts may affect nursing assistants perceptions of  		their jobs, supervisors, work environment, and their intention to continue  		employment. </p>
<p>Nursing facility structural and process measures in the NNHS include  		ownership, certification, chain membership, facility size, and payer mix. The  		NNHS also contains numerous structural and process measures related to  		staffing, including wages, benefits and retention strategies for nursing  		assistants, nursing staff mix, use and percentage of staff who are contract  		workers, turnover, stability, specialty certification and specialization of the  		director of nursing and nursing staff, and use of mid-level practitioners. The  		NNHS includes measures of facility practices such as nursing assistant  		involvement in resident care planning, use of permanent assignments and the  		number of overtime shifts worked that provide additional information on nursing  		assistant work environment. By linking facility data to information from  		nursing assistants researchers will be able to identify structural and process  		characteristics that affect nursing assistant satisfaction, perceptions of  		their supervisors, adequacy of continuing education and their perception of  		their initial and ongoing training, for example. </p>
<p><b><i>Facility and Nursing Assistant Characteristics, Resident Outcomes,  		Quality of Care</i></b></p>
<p>Analysis of the linked surveys can also be useful in examining the  		association of facility and nursing assistant characteristics with resident  		outcomes and quality of care in nursing homes (Harrington, 2005; Ryan, Stone  		&amp; Raynor, 2004). Comparisons across important provider structural  		characteristics can be used to address issues that are of key concern to  		policymakers and providers, such as care outcomes and quality of care provided  		by nursing homes (Krichmaun, Pearson, Savik &amp; Mueller, 2005; Swagerty, Lee,  		Smitt &amp; Taunton, 2005; Adams-Wendling &amp; Lee, 2005; Burgio, Fisher,  		Fairchild, Scilley &amp; Hardin, 2004; Intrator, Zinn, &amp; Mor, 2004;  		Zimmerman, Gruber-Baldini, Hebel, Sloane &amp; Magaziner, 2002; Castle, 2001;  		Dellefield, 1999). Although previous studies have explored how nursing home  		structural and process characteristics affect resident outcomes and quality of  		care provided by nursing homes, these data sets have not included information  		from <i>the workers</i> who are providing care in the facility. The combination  		of information on the facility, their residents, and the characteristics and  		perceptions of the nursing assistants who provide care presents a unique  		opportunity to understand the role paraprofessional workers play in resident  		outcomes. </p>
<p>Resident outcome measures in the NNHS include the number of emergency  		department visits, hospitalizations, and pain management. Data from residents  		from the survey can be linked to MDS information to expand the range of  		outcomes available and to create episodes of care. Additional resident outcome  		information available by linking to the MDS includes restraint use, number of  		falls, weight changes and pressure sores. Descriptive information on residents  		can also be obtained from the MDS, including broader measures of cognitive  		functioning and disruptive behaviors which can be used to further understand  		how level of impairment affects caregivers and outcomes of care. In addition,  		linkages to other data sources such as Medicare claims data and the Area  		Resource File will allow exploration of how care costs, resource allocation,  		and local area market factors such as hospital bed supply affect care outcomes  		(Decker, in press; Konetzka, Norton, Sloane, Kilpatrick &amp; Stearns, 2006;  		Weech-Maldonado, Shea &amp; Mor, 2006; Castle, 2005). </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Facility and Nursing Assistant Responses</i></b></p>
<p>Linking nursing facility characteristics to nursing assistant responses  		about the facility provides a unique opportunity to explore the extent to which  		employer and employee experiences are similar. Data on staff turnover,  		immunization practices, wages and benefits, and availability of patient lifting  		devices were collected from both the facility participating in the NNHS and  		nursing assistants participating in the NNAS. Staff turnover in the nursing  		home can be compared to nursing assistants perceptions of high or low  		turnover and whether turnover is perceived as disruptive to caregiving. The  		extent to which nursing assistants are knowledgeable regarding the availability  		of benefits provided by the facility can be assessed as well. These types of  		analyses, for example, can inform providers on employee knowledge of benefits  		and reasons nursing assistants do or do not subscribe to various benefits. </p>
<p>Finally, the evidence on the use of mechanical patient-lifting devices  		indicates many lifting-related injuries in health care workers can be prevented  		(Engst, Chhokar, Miller, Tate &amp; Yassi, 2005; Chhokar, Engst, Miller,  		Robinson, Tate &amp; Yassi, 2005; Edlich, Hudson, Buschbacher, Winters, Britt  		et al, 2005; Hudson, 2005; Pellino, Owen, Knapp &amp; Noack, 2006). Although  		many nursing homes make these devices available to workers, the extent to which  		nursing assistants use them is largely unknown. Analyses in this area can  		reveal the extent to which nursing assistants experience injuries related to  		lifting residents.</p>
<h3>Data Publication and Availability</h3>
<p>Data from the NNAS will be available through public use files and  		analytical reports published by ASPE and NCHS. Publications and public use data  		files will be available on the ASPE (<a href="../index.html">http://www.aspe.hhs.gov</a>) and NCHS  		(<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs</a>) websites. Information will also be made available in  		journal articles and in papers presented at professional meetings. </p>
<p>The public use files will contain information from the NNAS, edited to  		ensure protection of confidentiality, and will include some variables on  		nursing home characteristics. Researchers who wish to link data from the NNAS  		to the facility or patient questionnaires of the NNHS will need to work through  		the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). The RDC allows researchers meeting certain  		qualifications, and under strict supervision, to access confidential  		statistical micro data files. To qualify, researchers must submit a proposal  		for review and approval. Researchers can use one of three access methods: </p>
<ol><li>direct on-site access;</li>
<li>a remote program submission system through which researchers can  		  submit work to be done in the RDC with the output returned by e-mail; or </li>
<li>programming services for outside researchers provided by RDC staff.  		  </li>
</ol><p>For additional information on the NCHS RDC and procedures for access to  		linked data files go to:  		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/GuidelinesRDC11-8-05.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/GuidelinesRDC11-8-05.pdf</a>.</p>

</ul><h2><a name="summary" id="summary"> V. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</a></h2>
<p>DOL projections continue to list direct care worker positions among  		those with the highest growth rate. While it is clear that turnover of formal  		(paid) caregivers is costly to the care recipient, the payer and the provider,  		evidence to date has been limited on what can be done to stabilize and improve  		the workforce within the reimbursement constraints that are likely to continue.  		It is critical that industry and policy leaders have access to information that  		is useful in improving the attractiveness of caregiving jobs and in reducing  		turnover. The NNAS represents a major advance in the data available about  		nursing assistants working in nursing homes and provides a framework for future  		evidence-based policy, practice and applied research initiatives to address the  		long-term care workforce shortages. </p>
<p>ASPE is currently building on the work of the NNAS to improve our  		understanding of another segment of the direct care workforce -- home health  		aides. ASPEs National Home Health Aide Survey (NHHAS) will provide the  		first national estimates of this population based on a national probability  		sample of a cross section of workers. The NHHAS will be fielded as a supplement  		to the 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey in partnership with the NCHS,  		CDC. Like the NNAS, the NHHAS has numerous benefits. Among these, the potential  		for future comparisons of worker characteristics, skills and training across  		settings to see if workers are similar and could be affected by similar  		initiatives in the future.</p>

<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Although</a> widely used in the research and policy  			 literature, the concepts of recruitment and retention have not been measured in  			 consistent ways making it difficult to compare the effects of interventions  			 designed to improve retention (Castle &amp; Engberg, 2005).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">A</a> recent study clarifies that the definition of  			 turnover can influence the relative difference in reported turnover rates by as  			 much as 47% (Castle, 2006).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">In</a> the 2002 study of 12 states that had  			 implemented wage pass-through programs: three had no impact on recruitment and  			 retention; three could not determine whether there was any measurable effect;  			 and four either had a positive impact or probably had some positive  			 impact.</p>

<p><a name="note12" id="note12">The</a> <i>Facility Leaver</i> section of the NNAS  			 (11 items) was designed to capture: whether nursing assistants were still  			 working as a nursing assistants; whether they were working in long-term care or  			 the health care field, reasons for leaving, and what, if anything, would have  			 encouraged them to stay at their job.</p>

<p><a name="note16" id="note16">Researchers</a> have speculated that average direct  			 care worker tenure in long-term care settings is bimodal, with a portion of the  			 workforce that turns over frequently and a portion of workers with a long  			 tenure (Brannon et al, 2005).
