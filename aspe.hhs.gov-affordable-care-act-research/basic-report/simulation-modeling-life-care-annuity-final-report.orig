</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>State and federal interest in methods of increasing private pre-funding  		of long-term care expenses continues to grow because of persistent gains in  		longevity and looming increases in the number of older Americans as the Baby  		Boom generation enters retirement. Despite recent research indicating declines  		in old age disability, growth in the number of persons surviving to advanced  		ages will increase the number needing long-term care. States and federal  		governments fear that without large expansions in private financing, the  		Medicaid program will incur much of the associated costs. </p>
<p>The most widely known and established vehicle for private pre-funding is  		long-term care insurance (LTCI). This type of insurance remains uncommon  		despite impressive improvements in the quality of LTCI products on the market  		over the last two decades. About 10% of Americans age 65 or older held LTCI  		coverage in 2002, and about 7% of persons age 55-64 (Johnson and Wiener 2006;  		Johnson and Occello 2005).<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> According to a recent report from Milliman,  		Inc., an independent actuarial and consulting firm, LTCI market developments  		since 2002 have been discouraging. The number of insurance companies selling  		stand-alone LTCI products is contracting, due to industry consolidation and  		strategic concerns, with the value of new paid LTCI premiums  		declining for four straight years through 2006.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>With low LTCI market penetration among older persons and high premiums  		for good quality coverage at older ages, and fixed retirement incomes among the  		elderly, recent attention has turned to ways that asset accumulations might be  		used to fund or pre-fund long-term care needs. LTCI is almost exclusively  		purchased through installment premiums and draws primarily on current income of  		purchasers. Examples of ways to increase the use of assets to pay for long-term  		care expenses include facilitating use of reverse mortgages to make it easier  		for consumers to draw on home equity, and other innovative mechanisms funded by  		asset accumulations rather than current income. In a 2001 study,<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> we examined one such asset-based mechanism--a  		single-premium annuity funded by retirement savings that provides a stable  		level of retirement income for life and a higher payout level if disability  		occurs. Several insurers are reported to be considering similar products and  		other new combination products that link annuities or life insurance with  		long-term care protection. Their interest arises in part because of provisions  		in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 that extend LTCI tax preferences to  		long-term care benefits in such combination products.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In this report, we examine the potential for asset-based pre-funding of  		retirement income and disability insurance through an annuity combining income  		and long-term care protection, in the context of increased interest in reverse  		mortgage financing. We first consider potential financial access among the  		older population. We compare their assets with the price of a combined annuity  		and their income and assets with published guidelines for  		affordability of LTCI. We also focus on the extent to which persons  		whootherwise would not be able to purchase pre-funded LTC protection could if  		they had access to their housing equity. Finally, we consider two other factors  		that may affect access to private pre-funding: medical underwriting for LTCI  		and the relaxed underwriting theoretically possible in a combined annuity; and  		alternate annuity designs that would reduce the annuity cost without reducing  		long-term care benefits.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>In our 2001 paper,<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> we simulated single lump-sum premiums paid in  		advance for a combined annuity to finance stable retirement income beginning  		immediately and an increased benefit level if disability occurs. This type of  		annuity is a disability-escalating single-premium immediate annuity (SPIA)--as  		distinct from variable and other types of annuities often marketed aggressively  		and sometimes inappropriately to retirees as investments.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> SPIAs insure a given level of  		income for the life of the contract. The disability-escalating SPIA we model  		continues for remaining life.</p>
<p>Such a disability-escalating annuity, in theory, could reduce adverse  		selection that increases the cost of income annuities and expand the proportion  		of elders medically eligible for long-term care protection. We demonstrated  		that there is a tradeoff between mortality and disability risks that would  		allow substantially relaxed medical underwriting and make it possible to offer  		long-term care coverage to a larger population than under current LTCI  		underwriting practices. A small pricing advantage also was demonstrated. The  		price of a combined income and disability annuity for the expanded risk pool  		was estimated to be about 5% lower than the price of the same products  		purchased separately under conventional LTCI underwriting.</p>
<p>In contrast to the annuity we examined, most of the few annuity-based  		products now on the market appear either to be limited to annuities with  		favorable withdrawal conditions if annuity payments are used for long-term care  		expenses, or to annuities that offer long-term care benefits as a rider  		purchased with additional periodic premiums, similar to those for conventional  		LTCI. At least one company in the United States offers a disability-escalating  		<i>deferred</i> annuity--with payments beginning a predetermined number of  		years in the future--based on research conducted by Christopherson.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Other potential advantages in a combined annuity like the one we examine  		may attract a more diverse risk pool than LTCI. By explicitly integrating  		long-term care protection with more general retirement security planning, a  		combination annuity may address often-cited consumer aversion to focusing on  		the risk of future frailty. The continuing decline in prevalence of  		conventional pension annuities through employment and rising prevalence of  		wealth accumulations in defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) accounts,  		also could increase demand for annuitization<i>per se</i> as a way to insure  		stable income throughout retirement. Policymakers also may have an interest in  		encouraging increased private annuitization in light of pressures on Social  		Security that may force limits on future growth in benefits.</p>
<p>The cash long-term care benefit in a combined annuity has the potential  		to simplify choices and reduce uncertainty about future benefits, two  		frequently cited reasons for the low market penetration of conventional LTCI.  		Most LTCI plans now on the market reimburse for allowed services used up to a  		periodic (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) maximum benefit, often with limits on  		the types of providers that may be used and lower maximum benefit levels for  		services received at home. Much of long-term care, however, involves less  		skilled care that can be provided by family members, friends, and other  		unlicensed providers and needs such as home modifications or assistive devices.  		Cash benefits reduce the level of consumer vigilance required to assure that  		the LTCI policy selected will be flexible enough to cover needs that actually  		arise and to accommodate future changes in the formal long-term care delivery  		system. Recently, policy and advocacy interest has turned to the advantages of  		cash benefits, fostered in part by the success of the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration, in which greater levels of service and consumer satisfaction  		were achieved--even at low benefit levels--when beneficiaries were able to  		manage a cash allowance in lieu of traditional agency-provided  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In our initial analysis of a combined annuity, we focused on the impact  		of relaxed underwriting and did not address how the distribution of income and  		assets among the older population would affect the potential reach of private  		financing through either a combined annuity or conventional LTCI. In this study  		we use more recent data and simulation methods to examine the potential role of  		financial resources in access to pre-funded long-term care protection. We focus  		particularly on housing wealth, in light of heightened interest in home equity  		as a source of long-term care financing.</p>
<h3>Reverse Mortgages and Home Equity Financing</h3>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted the use of reverse mortgages to help  		older persons use their home equity for long-term care needs. Reverse mortgages  		allow homeowners to borrow against their home equity while remaining at home,  		and repayment of the loan is deferred until they leave the home. Home Equity  		Conversion Mortgages (HECM) through the Department of Housing and Urban  		Development are by far the most common type of reverse mortgage sold to date.  		Proceeds may be received as a lump-sum, as a line of credit that earns interest  		on any unused amounts, or as guaranteed periodic payments over remaining life,  		depending on the type of reverse mortgage. An online calculator provided by the  		AARP indicates that consumers may be able to access roughly half their equity  		after deductions for expenses and loan interest as either a lump-sum or as a  		line of credit through a HECM loan.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Estimates of reverse mortgage potential vary considerably, however.  		Stucki<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> estimates that  		older homeowners have over $2 trillion in home equity and that a total of $953  		billion--on the order of half their total equity--might be made available  		through reverse mortgages. Merlis<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> estimates much smaller potential. He finds  		that a little over 40% of the 24 million households headed by an adult age 62  		or older would not qualify for a HECM because they lack home equity, do not  		meet age requirements, or because the maximum loan is insufficient to cover  		closing costs. After excluding 1.6 million potential borrowers with very low  		incomes and few financial resources other than their homes, and 3.8 million  		households in the top quartile by financial assets, he identifies about 8.8  		million households as the target population for reverse mortgage financing.  		Assuming these 8.8 million households qualified for and obtained a median loan  		of roughly $47,000 in 2000, the implied total would be approximately $413  		billion, less than half the total estimated by Stucki. </p>
<p>Other research casts doubt on the reach of reverse mortgage financing,  		at least in the short run. A recent Harris survey of homeowners aged 50 to 65  		found that only 6% of respondents planned to use their home equity for ordinary  		living expenses in retirement, with little variation by age.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Data from several sources  		indicate that few people had taken out reverse mortgages as of the first part  		of this decade, perhaps less than 1% of older homeowners.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> The National Council on Aging  		(NCOA) website indicates substantial growth, however, with the number of people  		taking out reverse mortgages growing from fewer than 6,000 in 2000 to more than  		48,000 in 2005.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> The  		NCOA website also notes, however, that while reverse mortgage proceeds have  		been used to pay for home repairs, and health and long-term care needs,  		 funds have been used to buy everything from a second car, an  		airplane or recreational vehicle, or taking a dream vacation. </p>
<p>High loan costs for reverse mortgages and limits on the amount of equity  		that can be taken out may partly explain their lack of appeal. The amount that  		may be obtained through a HECM loan is capped at the median home value in the  		county where the applicant lives and varies inversely with life expectancy. The  		general life tables used to determine reverse mortgage loan amounts, in  		addition, may reduce amounts available to borrowers with current long-term care  		needs because they overstate life expectancy for persons already experiencing  		disability.</p>
<p>Increased transaction costs when reverse mortgage financing is used to  		pay for LTCI also reduces the amount of equity actually available to pay for  		care. Merlis<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup>  		estimates that only 36 cents for every dollar of equity would be available for  		actual long-term care benefits because of the dual transaction costs of using a  		HECM loan to pay for LTCI. He estimates that medical underwriting would further  		limit this use of reverse mortgage funds, with only 6.4 million of the 8.8  		million households in his target market likely to pass underwriting. </p>
<h3>Primary Aims of this Report</h3>
<p>Our aim in this analysis is to revisit the potential for a combined  		income and disability annuity in light of the financial resources of the older  		population. We compare the proportion of the population potentially able to  		purchase a combined annuity or LTCI, and examine the importance of home equity  		in estimates of the proportion who could pre-fund long-term care needs through  		a combined annuity. </p>
<p>The primary research questions explored empirically in this project for  		simulated cohorts of retirees at age 65 and age 75 are the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What proportion of persons has the financial resources to purchase a  			 combined annuity or to meet published guidelines for conventional LTCI  			 affordability, and how is their wealth distributed between housing  			 and nonhousing assets? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What proportion of persons estimated to be able to purchase annuity  			 coverage can do so only because of their housing wealth?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What proportion of persons who do not meet affordability  			 guidelines for LTCI purchase has substantial housing wealth but insufficient  			 assets to purchase the combined annuity? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does medical underwriting affect conclusions about potential  			 access to pre-funded LTC protection?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do characteristics and lifetime disability experience differ  			 across groups defined by affordability guidelines?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent might different product designs that reduce the cost  			 of a combined annuity without reducing disability benefits affect  			 access?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Three aspects of our analysis are important to emphasize. First, we  		focus on ages at or after retirement, although many argue that expanding  		long-term care pre-funding depends on pushing the decision earlier during  		working years. Second, our primary analysis is limited to comprehensive cash  		benefits in the combined annuity and to LTCI policies with similarly  		comprehensive benefits. We do not address empirically the more general question  		of how many retirees could afford <i>any</i> LTCI policy, including policies  		with less comprehensive coverage, lower benefit levels, or shorter benefit  		periods, although we will discuss issues surrounding lower levels of protection  		that could reduce LTCI costs and increase access to LTCI in the conclusion.  		Finally, the analysis considers financial situation at the assumed age at which  		purchase is considered. Thus, it examines the potential capacity to privately  		pre-fund future long-term needs, not financial situation at the time when care  		is needed or among all persons age 65 or older.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA AND METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The data for our analysis are primarily from the 1993 National Mortality  		Followback Survey (NMFS), a nationally representative sample of persons age 15  		or older dying in that year. The survey is the most recent in a series of  		surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics to study causes  		of death and disease, demographic trends in mortality, and other health and  		health care issues. The next of kin or another knowledgeable respondent was  		asked to provide information about the decedents health history,  		limitations in physical and mental functioning, lifestyle (e.g., history of  		smoking, diet) and socioeconomic characteristics. These data, which include the  		timing of onset of conditions and functional limitations, provide the  		foundation for the projections of longevity and disability qualifying for  		benefits as well as our simulation of medical underwriting. Their strength is  		providing actual experience over the lifetime.</p>
<p>We analyze samples of 6,709 persons dying at age 65 or older and 4,728  		persons dying at age 75 or older. We use weights that adjust the longevity  		distribution within the samples to represent persons turning ages 65 and 75 in  		2000, with further adjustment for differential longevity by education to take  		into account higher educational attainment in more recent cohorts relative to  		the samples of decedents. This methodology allows us to use the life health and  		disability experience of recent decedents to simulate the experience of these  		two recent age cohorts over their remaining lifetimes.</p>
<h3>Financial Data</h3>
<p>Because the individual level income and asset data on the NMFS are for  		the last year of life, they are not suitable for estimating resources available  		at our selected purchase ages. We therefore use data from the 2000 Health and  		Retirement Survey (HRS) to simulate the characteristics of persons by financial  		situation at purchase age.</p>
<p>Detailed information about income and assets is a focus of the HRS/Asset  		and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old, making it a rich source of  		information about the financial status of the older population. Financial data  		are collected at the household level, defined as the respondent and the  		respondents spouse, if married. The wealth measures we use are net  		wealth, including the value net of debt of the primary residence, other real  		estate, vehicles, businesses, retirement accounts, financial assets, and other  		assets; net household wealth excluding the primary residence; and the net value  		of the primary residence. We do not include the present value of Social  		Security benefits, pensions, or private annuities. Thus, income derived from  		such assets is included in the income measure, but wealth measures include only  		assets that have not already been annuitized.</p>
<p>To link these data with the characteristics and experience of NMFS  		decedents, we compute the proportions of HRS respondents in cells defined by  		education, gender, and marital status at purchase age who would meet various  		affordability assumptions and merge these proportions onto the  		corresponding cells on the NMFS. We then estimate the characteristics and  		experience of, for example, persons with sufficient assets to purchase a  		combined annuity as a weighted average, where the weights are the proportion of  		persons in each cell who meet each affordability assumption. An important point  		to which we will return in the conclusion is that the NMFS data represent  		individuals, whereas the financial data represent the resources of the  		respondent and spouse. Thus, for married couples our estimates assess  		affordability of coverage for one spouse based the couples  		joint resources.</p>
<p>In order to have large enough cell sizes, we use samples of 5,651  		persons age 65-74, and 3,735 persons age 75-84 in 2000 to compute proportions  		by cell. We would therefore expect that our estimates are slightly conservative  		because some persons who would have met a given financial criterion at age 65,  		for example, may not at age74.</p>
<h3>Underwriting and Benefit Criteria</h3>
<p>We simulate conventional LTCI underwriting using methods developed in  		earlier work modified and updated to use the more recent 1993 NMFS  		data.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> Based on review  		of a variety of sources of information on industry underwriting practices, we  		identified seven conditions that are associated with greater likelihood of  		being rejected for LTCI. We then identified as failing conventional  		underwriting each person in our NMFS sample with any of the seven conditions at  		the prospective purchase ages. The conditions are: (1) activity of daily living  		(ADL) limitation; (2) cognitive impairment; (3) major illness (e.g., chronic  		obstructive pulmonary disease); (4) stroke; (5) recent heart attack or any  		heart attack complicated by other factors; (6) heavy alcohol consumption; and  		(7) obesity as an adult. The final condition (i.e., obesity as an adult) is not  		typically an explicit criterion used to screen out LTCI applicants, but is  		associated with conditions and health use often leading to rejection.</p>
<p>We estimated eligibility for LTCI benefits and disability benefits under  		the combined annuity for each individual as the age of onset of disability in  		any two of five ADLs, or cognitive impairment. This standard is similar to that  		used in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to  		define benefit eligibility for LTCI policies qualifying for tax deductions. The  		five ADLs are bathing, dressing, using the toilet, getting in and out of bed or  		chairs, and eating.</p>
<p>We model relaxed, or minimal, underwriting for the combined  		annuity as excluding only those already eligible for disability benefits at the  		time of purchase. Although our earlier results showed that risk pooling would  		remove the need for any underwriting in a situation of mandatory purchase, we  		assume that no insurer in a voluntary market would be willing to sell an  		annuity with disability-contingent benefits to persons already eligible for  		disability benefits.</p>
<h3>Premium Estimates</h3>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> provides our estimated premiums for the  		combined annuity as well as for LTCI coverage comparable to the disability  		benefits included in the combined annuity. We also provide sample market  		premiums for comparison with our estimates. The LTCI benefits we model are cash  		disability payments and have an unlimited, or lifetime, benefit period to make  		them comparable to the disability benefits in the combined annuity. Clearly,  		premiums for the comprehensive LTCI benefits we model are higher than premiums  		for policies with more limited benefits and/or a shorter maximum benefit  		period. Thus, our LTCI estimates are of the proportion who could purchase a  		comprehensive long-term care benefit, not the proportion who could afford more  		modest benefit packages.</p>
<p><i><b>Combined Annuity Premiums</b></i></p>
<p>The base annuity design we model is a single-premium income annuity that  		begins at purchase, coupled with a disability benefit that increases income if  		disability criteria are met. Lump-sum premiums for the combined annuity are  		computed as the present discounted value of benefits paid over remaining life,  		assuming a nominal interest rate of 6%, for persons passing minimal  		underwriting. The benefits are a $1,000 per month immediate income annuity  		continuing for life, with a $2,000 increase in the monthly payment if the  		annuitant becomes chronically disabled in at least two ADLs or cognitive  		impairment, and an additional $1,000 monthly at the four-ADL level. Thus, the  		disability benefits are similar to LTCI with a lifetime or unlimited benefit  		period. The maximum initial benefit level of $48,000 (including the income  		benefit), is roughly the average cost of a year of nursing home care in 2000,  		the base year of our analysis. The disability benefits are $66 per day at the  		two-ADL level and $98 per day at the four-ADL level. </p>
<p>We model inflation protection of 3% per year compounded for the income  		annuity and 5% per year compounded for the disability benefit, and expense and  		profit loadings of 3.5% and 18%, respectively, for the income and disability  		premiums. We do not, however, include any additional loading for other charges  		typically included in conventional LTCI pricing. These include agent  		commissions, expenses for administering periodic premiums, and adjustments for  		adverse selection and induced demand arising because insurance reduces the  		price of services to the consumer. The same methodology and assumptions are  		used to estimate premiums for three alternative annuity designs, which differ  		from the base design only in the level, configuration, and timing of benefits.  		</p>
<p>For comparison with immediate income annuities on the market, we also  		provide the premium for the portion of the base design combined annuity  		attributable to the income benefit in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, computed  		for persons passing conventional underwriting. Because of their greater  		longevity, we use this group as a proxy for annuitants.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> The market premiums for annuities with the  		same features and benefit level were estimated using online calculators  		available on the Internet for the federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and  		American International Group, Inc. (AIG) through Vanguard. Our estimated  		premiums are slightly higher than unisex premiums from the TSP, and slightly  		below the range of the gender-specific rates from Vanguard/AIG. The TSP uses a  		5.5% interest rate (compared with our 6% nominal rate), which would imply a  		higher premium. Lower costs in a large employment group may contribute to lower  		TSP premiums. The Vanguard/AIG annuity premiums are based on a 5% interest rate  		assumption, which would make them higher, all else equal. Different life  		expectancy assumptions also may contribute to differences, but we conclude that  		our estimates are reasonable approximations of market premiums for life  		annuities.</p>
<p><i><b>Long-Term Care Insurance/Disability Premiums</b></i></p>
<p>It is less straightforward to compare the lifetime disability benefits  		we model with conventional LTCI with an unlimited benefit period. The  		disability benefits are in one sense more generous because the full benefit is  		paid regardless of whether it is used to purchase services. In contrast, most  		conventional LTCI reimburses for covered services actually used up to a daily,  		weekly, or monthly benefit maximum. On the other hand, our two-tiered  		disability benefits rise only with disability level, not with the need for more  		costly services, such as nursing home care. Conventional LTCI commonly has  		service-based tiered benefits, reimbursing for home care at a rate below that  		for facility care, regardless of disability level--for example, 50% of the  		nursing home per diem.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In our previous work, we have compared lump-sum disability premiums  		under conventional and minimal underwriting to focus on the  		discount on premiums from relaxed underwriting in the combined  		annuity, rather than on replicating actual LTCI market premiums. LTCI premiums,  		however, most commonly are level periodic premiums, with waiver of premium when  		claims begin. Level premiums must be set at a level to assure that premium  		accumulations adequately pre-fund benefits for the pool of insured persons. To  		approximate a market LTCI premium for a similar benefit package, our estimated  		LTCI premiums in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> are level annual premiums with  		the same benefit structure, assumptions, and loading used to compute the  		lump-sum disability premium in the combined annuity. They are computed using  		the experience of the group passing conventional underwriting at each age as  		the premium at which the present discounted value of expected premiums paid in  		just covers the present discounted value of benefits, and then marked up by the  		18% loading to cover expenses and profit. Because we do not model policy  		lapses, our premium estimate is equivalent to one including an actuarially fair  		nonforfeiturebenefit.</p>
<p>Market premiums for policies with benefits as similar as possible to  		those we model are taken from three sources. The first source is an online  		premium calculator provided by the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program  		(FLTCIP), which would be expected to offer lower premiums because it is a large  		employment group plan. The second are estimates from Weiss Ratings,  		Inc.,<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> and the third  		is an online calculator provided by AARP for its LTCI plan. Details of the  		policies and sources are provided in footnotes to <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a>. At age 65, our estimated level periodic premium is within the range of  		market premiums for policies with reasonably comparable benefits. We would  		expect our premiums to be somewhat low because, as noted, we do not include  		additional charges typical in the private market, but on the other hand,  		neither the FLTCIP nor Weiss Ratings premiums include nonforfeiture benefits.  		At age 75, however, our estimated premium is low relative to all market  		premiums. It is within the range of premiums only for the FLTCIP policies,  		which do not include a nonforfeiture benefit. The FLTCIP premiums also would be  		expected to be lower than individual premiums owing to group rates. Thus, our  		estimates of the proportion of older persons who could purchase an LTCI policy  		with the features we model under the United Seniors Health Council and the  		National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) guidelines may be  		somewhat more generous at older ages than at least these individual market  		premiums would suggest.</p>
<h3>Financial Access Assumptions</h3>
<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> provides the financial access guidelines  		used in our estimates, based on two published affordability or  		suitability guidelines for LTCI. These guidelines arose out of  		concern that policies were being sold to consumers for whom the product did not  		make sense--persons with low income and assets who would quickly qualify for  		Medicaid if they had long-term care needs. Affordability is not, however, a  		clear-cut economic concept. Actual demand for LTCI--or for an annuity--depends  		on many factors not observable in our data, such as the array of prices and  		products available to an individual, individual aversion to risk, expectations  		about the likelihood of living a long time or becoming disabled, and, in the  		case of the annuity, the extent to which wealth is already annuitized. </p>
<p><i><b>Long-Term Care Insurance Guidelines</b></i></p>
<p>The most often-cited guidelines for LTCI purchase are those from United  		Seniors<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> and  		NAIC.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup> Both ignore  		housing wealth, but include rules of thumb for the minimum level of  		<i>nonhousing</i> assets at which purchase may be appropriate. Asset guidelines  		are rationalized both because protecting assets is an important motivation for  		LTCI purchase and as a cushion against future premium increases that might  		cause purchasers to allow their policies to lapse. United Seniors recommends a  		range of minimum income levels for singles and married couples--a minimum of  		$25,000 at age 65 and $35,000 at age 75--and at least $75,000 in nonhousing  		assets. The NAIC recommends that the premium be no more than 7% of income.  		Because it depends on the size of the premium, the NAIC guideline, as will be  		seen, is more restrictive than the United Seniors income standard when compared  		with both our estimated premiums and average premiums from other sources. The  		NAIC minimum nonhousingasset guideline of only $30,000, on the other hand, is  		substantially less stringent than the United Seniors asset guideline.</p>
<p><i><b>Combined Annuity Assumptions</b></i></p>
<p>Issues of pricing and affordability of the combined annuity  		differ from those for conventional LTCI. Premiums for the type of annuity we  		model are paid as a lump-sum at purchase age, rather than as periodic premiums,  		so that available assets are the key factor and must be high enough to cover  		the large initial investment. Because it includes a life annuity, providing a  		guaranteed income stream from purchase until death, the joint annuity is far  		more costly than even a lump-sum premium for conventional LTCI alone, although  		the disability portion of the annuity premium is lower than a lump-sum premium  		for a similar LTCI policy with conventional underwriting.</p>
<p>No established guidelines exist for annuities. Thus, estimating the  		proportion of persons who have the resources to purchase a combined annuity  		requires making assumptions about the proportion of assets the older population  		would be <i>willing to annuitize</i> in addition to assets already  		involuntarily annuitized through Social Security and employment pensions.  		Although the upward trend in defined contribution retirement plans suggests  		both larger available asset accumulations at retirement and potentially greater  		demand for private annuities to replace defined-benefit pensions, assumptions  		still rely primarily on theoretical models.</p>
<p>In the absence of accepted guidelines for annuitization decisions, we  		use two criteria for purchase of the combined annuity. The first is that the  		premium does not exceed total wealth not already annuitized, including housing  		wealth, and the second is that the premium does not exceed half of total  		nonannuitized wealth. These assumptions are meant to provide a threshold for  		the proportion of persons who possibly could convert their wealth to an annuity  		with the base design we examine, rather than to suggest a suitable  		level of wealth or annuitization for annuity purchase. The stricter threshold  		of assets at least twice the annuity premium identifies a high wealth group who  		could more easily purchase an annuity and retain substantial wealth outside the  		annuity. The less restrictive threshold including all who would have to convert  		up to 100% of all nonhousingand housing wealth defines a lower wealth group,  		some of whom might not be able to purchase with current limits on access to  		housing equity. It is important to note that we cannot model limits on the  		amount of equity that could actually be accessed by individuals through reverse  		mortgage financing because of transaction costs or local geographic and  		age-related restrictions on loan size. Thus, our estimates for complete  		annuitization of wealth overstate the proportion of persons who could actually  		access enough housing equity to purchase the combined annuity if they had to  		rely on reverse mortgage financing. </p>
<p>Complete annuitization is the optimal level of annuitization found in  		the theoretical literature under a variety of circumstances. Lower levels of  		annuitizationmay be optimal, however,</p>
<ul><li>if some of wealth is already annuitized, such as in Social Security  		  and pensions; </li>
<li>because of adverse selection in the annuity markets, which has been  		  estimated to increase income annuity premiums by as much as 10%;</li>
<li>for married couples; and</li>
<li>in the presence of health risks, such as the need for long-term care,  		  that increase the precautionary desire for liquidity.</li>
</ul><p>Because the combined annuity we model addresses the need for higher  		income in the event of disability, aversion to annuitization because of the  		risk of needing long-term care presumably would be less than for a conventional  		income annuity. </p>
<p>Both of our thresholds imply a substantially higher level of voluntary  		private annuitization than currently occurs in the United States. According to  		recent estimates of the extent of annuitization among the older population, the  		average level of annuitizationamong persons in the top 20% of the wealth  		distribution is 13% of wealth, including Social Security, pensions, and  		voluntary private annuities, and about half is accounted for by Social  		Security.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> For the  		next quintile, annuitizationamounts to 25% of wealth, with Social Security  		accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total. At the mean, under our 50%  		assumption, this would imply that combined annuity purchasers in these two  		quintiles would annuitize 63% and 75% of total wealth, respectively, although  		actual implied annuitization rates would be higher or lower depending on where  		an individual is in the wealth distribution within each quintile.</p>
<h2><a name="potential" id="potential">POTENTIAL FINANCIAL ACCESS TO THE COMBINED ANNUITY  		AND LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we provide our estimates of the proportion of persons  		meeting--and not meeting--the various financial thresholds in our assumptions  		and profile their income and wealth. These estimates rely entirely on the HRS  		samples and do not reflect the additional impact of medical underwriting, which  		will be examined in the next section. </p>
<h3>Combined Annuity</h3>
<p>For the combined annuity (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>), we show the  		proportion of the population for whom the combined annuity premium would  		represent no more than half of total wealth, and the marginal group for whom  		the premium would represent between 50% and 100% of wealth. For simplicity, we  		refer to these groups as the higher wealth and lower wealth groups,  		respectively. In both cases, wealth is defined as all wealth that is not  		already annuitized, including housing equity. Recalling that our estimated  		premium for the combined annuity is about $219,000 at age 65, the implied total  		wealth level is $438,000 or greater for the higher wealth group, and between  		$219,000 and $438,000 for the lower wealth group at age 65. The approximate  		thresholds at age 75 are $362,000 for the higher wealth group and between  		$181,000 and $362,000 for the lower wealth group. We report estimated mean  		household income and total, nonhousing, and housing assets. In the final column  		we report the percent of persons in each group meeting each assumption  		<i>only</i> if they can draw on their housing equity.</p>
<p>At both age 65 and at age 75, nearly one in four persons is in the  		higher wealth group and nearly one in five is in the lower wealth group. In  		all, 45% of persons have sufficient assets to at least cover the premium cost.  		Average income for persons in the open-ended higher wealth group, approaches  		twice the average for all persons, and their average assets are higher by a  		factor of three. In contrast, although the lower wealth group has income  		slightly above the mean for all persons, their assets are below average. There  		is a far higher degree of skewing in the high wealth group, with median income  		and wealth well below the mean, whereas medians are much closer to the mean for  		the lower wealth group.</p>
<p>Average nonhousing wealth exceeds average housing wealth for both wealth  		levels, but housing wealth is far more important for the lower wealth group. At  		both ages, the primary residence represents an average 20% of nonannuitized  		wealth for the higher wealth group, but 40% of wealth for the lower wealth  		group (not shown). Thus, it is not surprising that a far larger proportion of  		the lower wealth group would have to tap into housing equity in order to  		purchase a combined annuity. At both ages, only a small percentage of the  		higher wealth group would need to use housing equity, compared with more than  		two-thirds of the lower wealth group.</p>
<p>We noted earlier that by counting 100% of housing equity, our estimates  		overstate the proportion with sufficient assets to cover the cost of the  		premium if their only or best option for accessing housing equity is reverse  		mortgage financing. As a sensitivity test, we estimated the impact of assuming  		that all persons needing to use housing equity to purchase would have to obtain  		a reverse mortgage and would be able to obtain no more than half their equity  		because of caps on loan size, transaction costs, and their life expectancy. A  		50% yield is roughly consistent with equity amounts available through HECM  		loans, according to an online calculator provided on the AARP  		website.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> Using this  		crude test, our estimates of affordability would be reduced to  		about 37% of persons at each age, with about 16% needing to use some or all of  		their available equity. Not surprisingly, all of the excluded persons are in  		the lower wealth group. </p>
<p>We also provide estimates by marital status in <a href="#table3">Table  		3</a> because of the different implications for decisions to access home equity  		and different Medicaid treatment of the primary residence for married  		couples.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> Because the  		samples of unmarried persons are small, the estimates should be viewed with  		caution. Married persons have both higher income and asset levels and are more  		likely to meet the higher asset threshold, but there is no consequential  		difference by marital status in housing wealth as a proportion of the total or  		the likelihood of needing to tap into equity to cover the annuity premium cost.  		</p>
<p>In <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>, estimates focus on the distribution of  		housing wealth for persons who would have to draw on equity in order to  		purchase a combined annuity, and illustrate that only a small proportion of  		such persons have substantial equity to tap into. Persons in the higher wealth  		group who would have to rely at least in part on housing assets are less than  		2% of the population at each age, but all at age 65 and more than 90% at age 75  		have housing assets of at least $200,000. In contrast, the two-thirds of the  		lower wealth group who would have to draw on housing equity represent about 13%  		of the population at each age, and they are far less likely to have substantial  		housing wealth. Roughly three in four at each age have equity in their primary  		residence of at least $100,000, but only about 20% at each age have as much as  		$200,000 in equity.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Long-Term Care Insurance</h3>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> provides the estimated proportion of  		persons who would meet either and each of the two LTCI affordability guidelines  		and their estimated income and assets. Over all, 35% at age 65 and 25% at age  		75 would meet one or the other guideline.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p>It will be recalled that under the United Seniors guidelines the minimum  		suggested incomes are $25,000 for single persons and $35,000 for married  		persons. Our estimated LTCI premiums of $3,593 per year at age 65 and $5,045 at  		age 75 represent between 10% and 14% of these minimums at age 65 and between  		14% and 20% at age 75. The NAIC guideline that the premium not exceed 7% of  		income implies minimum incomes of roughly $50,000 at age 65 and $72,000 at age  		75. Thus, it is not surprising that significantly larger proportions meet the  		United Seniors guideline. About one-third of persons age 65 and one-quarter of  		persons at age 75 would meet the United Seniors guideline, compared with a  		little more than one in five at age 65 and a little less than one in five at  		age 75 meeting the NAIC guideline.</p>
<p>Income and all categories of wealth for persons meeting either guideline  		far exceed the average for all persons at each age, and, without exception,  		nonhousing wealth is far larger than housing wealth. Married persons tend to  		have higher income and assets in all categories than unmarried persons.</p>
<p>With the relatively high income standards and relatively modest asset  		standards in both LTCI guidelines--and the high correlation between income and  		asset levels--income is most often the binding constraint in whether  		individuals meet the guidelines. Even among well-to-do persons meeting the  		higher wealth threshold in the annuity analysis, nearly 20% at age 65 have  		income below the United Seniors guideline, and about twice that proportion do  		not meet the NAIC income guideline (not shown). Nearly 40% of the lower wealth  		group at age 65 has income below the United Seniors guideline, and more than  		two-thirds have income below the NAIC guideline. Given higher LTCI premiums at  		age 75, it is not surprising that the proportions with insufficient income  		relative to the guidelines are far larger (not shown). </p>
<p>The importance of these findings with respect to income is that they  		imply that for small but significant proportion of the older population--and  		particularly persons age 75 or older facing high age-rated premiums if they can  		still pass conventional underwriting--using assets to purchase a combination  		annuity might provide access to long-term care protection with minimal  		underwriting while also providing a higher standard of living than is supported  		by their asset accumulations without annuitization. </p>
<h3>Persons Meeting Neither Annuity Nor Long-Term Care  		Insurance Guidelines</h3>
<p>To examine the population facing actual or potential financial barriers  		to either a combined annuity or LTCI for financial reasons, we grouped persons  		at each age by whether their total assets were at least as great as the  		combined annuity premium (<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>). As seen in  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, 45% of the population at both ages has assets at  		least that great. We then subdivided this group potentially able to purchase a  		combined annuity into groups by whether they would need to tap into housing  		equity to do so. Most of the 25% at each age who could afford the annuity  		without using equity are in the higher wealth group from <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> for whom the premium represents no more than half of  		total assets. In fact, for 70% of the high wealth group, the annuity premium  		would be no more than half of <b><i>nonhousing assets</i></b> alone, and they  		would retain substantial liquidity even after purchase (not shown). Nearly half  		of the high wealth group has total assets of at least $800,000, and one-third  		has nonhousingassets that large. Conversely, nearly all of the group who would  		need to use housing equity arein the lower wealth group for whom the premium  		represents up to 100% of total wealth. </p>
<p>The remaining about 55% of persons at each age do not have enough total  		assets to cover the combined annuity premium, and nearly all also have income  		and/or nonhousingresources below the LTCI guidelines. <a href="#table7">Table  		7</a> focuses on the income and assets of this group with financial access  		problems either because of low income and wealth or because illiquid housing  		equity represents a large proportion of their wealth. At both ages, income and  		especially total wealth are well below the averages for all persons. Mean  		income is about $27,000 at age 65 and $19,000 at age 75, and average total  		assets are roughly $79,000 at age 65 and $66,000 at age 75. Contrary to our  		estimates for persons meeting the annuity and LTCI guidelines (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>), average housing  		equity in this group--including the small proportion who meet LTCI  		guidelines--exceeds average nonhousingassets. Few, however, have substantial  		housing assets that they might access. More than one-third at age 65 and 42% at  		age 75 have less than $25,000 in housing equity, and only 15% at age 65 and 13%  		at age 75 have as much as $100,000 in equity. Not surprisingly, since the  		combined annuity premium is $219,000 at age 65 and $181,000 at age 75, none  		have as much as $200,000 in housing equity. </p>
<h2><a name="other" id="other">OTHER ISSUES AFFECTING ACCESS</a></h2>
<p>In this section we consider two additional issues that affect  		conclusions about how many older Americans are potentially able to pre-fund  		their long-term care needs. The first is medical underwriting, which excludes  		persons with certain medical and physical conditions from purchasing long-term  		care protection. The second is design of a combined annuity. Alternate designs  		could reduce the cost and expand access. </p>
<h3>Medical Underwriting</h3>
<p>Financial barriers are, of course, only one potential obstacle to  		pre-funding long-term care needs. Insurers use medical underwriting to exclude  		applicants who they believe will be more costly. One promising aspect of a  		combined annuity is the theoretical viability of relaxed underwriting for the  		disability benefit when income and disability risks are pooled.  		<a href="#table8">Table 8</a> shows the expansion of access possible with  		minimal underwriting excluding only persons who would immediately be eligible  		to receive disability benefits. Under minimal underwriting, 97% of persons at  		age 65 and 94% of persons at age 75 could pass underwriting. This contrasts  		with 72% of persons at age 65 and 61% of persons at age 75 who would be likely  		to pass conventional underwriting. The reason why persons excluded by  		conventional underwriting could be included in the risk pool for the combined  		annuity but are excluded from LTCI is revealed by their longevity and  		disability experience. The three columns on the right of <a href="#table8">Table 8</a> show life expectancy, the risk of reaching the  		disability level at which disability benefits begin, and expected years of  		disability benefits.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for all persons at age 65 is 18 years, just under two  		years of which will be spent with chronic disability in at least two ADLs or  		cognitive impairment--the criterion for receiving disability benefits. For  		persons age 75, life expectancy is 11 years, and they also can expect to spend  		slightly less than two years with two or more ADLs or cognitive impairment. At  		both ages, the risk of experiencing this level of disability is approximately  		two in three. Consistent with the findings in our earlier work,<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> persons who could gain access  		to disability coverage only if minimal underwriting were available differ from  		persons passing conventional underwriting primarily in that their life  		expectancy is far shorter. Persons age 65 who are able to pass only minimal  		underwriting can expect to live another 13 years, about 7 years less than  		persons passing conventional underwriting. Similarly, persons age 75 passing  		only minimal underwriting will die on average about 5 years earlier than  		persons passing conventional underwriting. At both ages expected years with  		disability are similar for the two underwriting groups, but because of the  		shorter life expectancy of the minimal underwriting group, their disability  		would occur sooner.</p>
<p>The significance of this for LTCI is that installment premiums would  		have to be substantially higher to pre-fund the earlier claims. In contrast,  		timing is less important for the combined annuity premium because it is fully  		pre-paid and because of the reduction in income benefits in the expanded risk  		pool resulting from shorter average life expectancy. In fact, with proportional  		participation by persons passing conventional underwriting and persons passing  		only minimal underwriting, the combined annuity premium can be about 5% lower  		than in a pool restricted to persons passing conventional underwriting,  		primarily because of the reduction in expected years of income benefits. As  		shown earlier, income benefits account for about $191,000 (87%) of the $219,000  		combined annuity premium at age 65, and about $147,000 (81%) of the $181,000  		premium at age 75. </p>
<p><a href="#table9">Table 9</a> examines the risk profile by financial  		situation of the total pool of persons passing minimal underwriting--including  		both those who pass conventional underwriting and those who pass only minimal  		underwriting. Excluding persons who could not pass even minimal underwriting  		has little impact on the proportion of persons who would and would not have  		access to the combined annuity under our financial assumptions. For example,  		45% of persons at age 65 have assets sufficient to cover the annuity premium  		(<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>), and 44% both have sufficient assets  		<i>and</i>pass minimal underwriting. There is virtually no difference at either  		age in the risks faced or the likelihood of passing conventional LTCI  		underwriting by persons whose assets are sufficient to cover the combined  		annuity premium, regardless of whether they would have to draw on housing  		equity. In fact, persons who have total assets less than the premium also have  		similar expected years receiving benefits, although their life expectancy and  		disability risk are slightly lower. They also are slightly less likely to pass  		conventional underwriting at age 65, so that access to a product requiring only  		minimal underwriting would be somewhat more important in their ability to  		pre-fund long-term care expenses.</p>
<p><a href="#table10">Table 10</a> presents similar estimates to those in  		<a href="#table9">Table 9</a> broken out by marital status. Access to minimal  		underwriting is clearly important in expanding the proportion of both married  		and single persons with access to long-term care coverage, but the benefit to  		persons who are not married at age 65, less than two-thirds of whom would pass  		minimal underwriting, is far larger. This difference by marital status does not  		exist at age 75. As noted earlier, decisions about accessing home equity and  		Medicaid treatment of the primary residence are different for married couples  		than for singles. In addition, however, spouses are an important source of  		informal disability care. Whereas couples may have an incentive to pre-fund  		some level of care to support a spouse caregiver, singles may have a strong  		incentive to compensate for the lack of a spousal caregiver. In fact, the  		estimates in <a href="#table10">Table 10</a> highlight that there are  		inconsequential differences in longevity and disability risks by financial  		status, but that singles at both ages have somewhat higher expected years with  		at least two ADLs, and at age 75, their risk of reaching that disability level  		is also somewhat higher than for married persons. </p>
<h3>Alternate Combined Annuity Designs</h3>
<p>In this section we consider how three alternate product designs might  		affect the premium for a combined annuity and the proportion of persons who  		would have access to it, without reducing pre-funding of long-term care.  		<a href="#table11">Table 11</a> provides premiums for the three alternates, all  		of which reduce or defer the income benefit while maintaining the disability  		benefit. Because of the income benefits importance in the size of the  		premium, reductions have a large impact, but may have less adverse effect on  		the desirability of the combined annuity. On the other hand, reductions in the  		disability benefit might make the combined annuity less desirable, especially  		to persons who could pass only minimal underwriting and would have fewer  		expected years of income benefits. The percent reduction in premium relative to  		the base design used in the previous sections is provided below each premium  		estimate. In all alternate designs, as in the base policy, income benefits have  		a 10-year period certain payout, meaning that the insured or the estate  		receives at least 10 years of income benefits, even if death occurs within 10  		years. This feature improves the benefit to premium ratio for persons who can  		pass only minimal underwriting. </p>
<p>Alternate 1 reduces the income benefit to $500 per month from the $1,000  		in our base design, but increases the disability benefit at the two-ADL or  		cognitive impairment level to $2,500. Thus, the total income and disability  		benefit received for future disability would remain unchanged at $4,000, but  		income benefits preceding disability would be cut in half. This shift of  		benefits from the income annuity to the disability annuity would reduce the  		premium by 37% at age 65 and 34% at age 75. Alternate 2 leaves the income  		benefit at $1,000 but defers it for 5 years after purchase. This alternate  		would have a smaller impact on the combined annuity premium, reducing it by 25%  		at age 65, and 29% at age 75. Alternate 3 combines Alternates 1 and 2 to both  		reduce the income benefit and defer it 5 years and has the largest impact,  		essentially cutting the premium in half at both purchase ages.</p>
<p><a href="#table12">Table 12</a> shows the expansion of access to the  		combined annuity under each alternative design because of the lower premiums.  		Access for the base design is repeated for comparison. For all alternates, the  		percent of persons with potential access at each age reflects the combined  		impacts of financial criteria and minimal underwriting. As would be expected,  		the magnitude of the expansion in access increases with the magnitude of the  		premium reduction, with Alternate 3 providing the greatest expansion of access,  		and Alternate 2 providing the least. Under Alternate 3, about three in five  		persons at each age would have access to a combined annuity, compared with  		about two in five under the base design. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>Purchasing a combined annuity like the one we model is different from  		drawing on income or spending assets over time to pay for LTCI. In return for a  		lump-sum payment, the purchaser receives an immediate income annuity--insurance  		against declining income if assets are drawn down during retirement--and a  		flexible cash benefit if disability occurs. Encouraging annuitization coupled  		with long-term care protection may be a particularly constructive policy with  		the rise in defined contribution pension plans. Purchasers of combined  		annuities would be converting retirement savings into their own defined-benefit  		pension and gaining disability protection. There is some evidence that Congress  		is focusing on measures that would encourage annuitization. At least some in  		the annuity industry believe that provisions of the Retirement Security for  		Life Act of 2007, as introduced in the Senate and House in March, will boost  		the market for SPIAs as a retirement income vehicle, just as the Pension  		Protection Act is seen as a step in expanding the market for annuity  		combinations.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> If  		passed, the Retirement Security for Life Act would shelter up to $20,000 per  		year in taxable proceeds from SPIAs for annuitants and beneficiaries. </p>
<h3>The Potential for Asset-based Financing</h3>
<p>Our results suggest substantial potential for asset-based financing  		through a combined annuity or other vehicles to increase private pre-funding of  		long-term care needs, and that easier access to home equity could play an  		important role, particularly for persons with more modest wealth. However, at  		both age 65 and age 75, no more than 45% of the population has sufficient  		resources to cover the premium for our base combined annuity (about 30% could  		do so without using their housing equity). Our estimates are based on a perhaps  		unrealistic upper bound, assuming willingness and ability to use up to 100% of  		housing equity. Although there are other ways to gain access to home equity, to  		date the proportion of equity available to individuals through the most common  		type of reverse mortgage financing falls far short of 100% because of expenses,  		interest, and age-related or geographic limits.</p>
<p>About 25% of the older population at both age 65 and age 75 are in our  		higher wealth category and could comfortably afford a combined annuity, in most  		cases without using any housing equity and while retaining substantial  		liquidity. Persons in this high wealth group have the financial flexibility to  		choose among methods of providing for their future long-term care, including  		through self-insurance in many cases, and they are also likely to have other,  		less costly ways than reverse mortgages to access housing equity if they wish  		to do so. </p>
<p>Thus, almost all of the expansion in combined annuity access possible by  		facilitating easier and less expensive access to home equity would be among our  		lower wealth group, for whom the annuity premium would represent more than half  		of total assets. One in five persons at each age are in this lower wealth  		group, and more than two-thirds of this group could cover the annuity cost  		<i>only</i> if they could draw on equity. Most persons who would need to draw  		on equity have moderate amounts of equity--about one in four has less than  		$100,000, and only about one in five has as much as $200,000. The extent to  		which individuals are able and willing to draw on a high proportion of home  		equity, therefore, is a much more critical issue for this lower wealth group,  		as is the risk of spending down to Medicaid eligibility if long-term care is  		needed. </p>
<p>In fact, when all housing wealth is considered available, more older  		persons could purchase our base design annuity than meet the relatively high  		income standards and relatively modest nonhousing asset standards in published  		guidelines for purchase of a similarly comprehensive LTCI policy. Only 36% at  		age 65, and 26% at age 75 meet the LTCI purchase guidelines, but income, not  		nonhousingwealth, is most often the reason for not meeting the guidelines. This  		suggests that for a significant proportion of the older population, using  		assets to purchase a combination annuity could provide access to both  		pre-funded long-term care protection and a higher standard of living than is  		supported by their assets without annuitization. For persons age 75, such an  		option would be more valuable because they face higher age-rated LTCI premiums,  		and a larger proportion areunlikely to pass conventional LTCI underwriting.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Medical Underwriting and Alternate Designs</b></i></p>
<p>The relaxed medical underwriting possible, in theory, in a combined  		annuity product would significantly expand the proportion with potential access  		to long-term care coverage to 97% at age 65 and 94% at age 75. This expansion  		potential is similar for all persons who have sufficient assets to purchase a  		combined annuity, regardless of whether they would need to draw on housing  		equity, and disability risks also are similar. Slightly greater potential gains  		from relaxed underwriting would accrue, however, to persons who do not meet  		financial criteria for purchase of our base design annuity and to unmarried  		persons at age 65, regardless of financial situation, who also face higher  		disability risks than married persons.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the cost of a combined annuity could be  		substantially reduced--and access increased among those with insufficient  		wealth to purchase our base design annuity--by designs that reduce or defer  		income benefits without reducing disability protection. For example, a design  		that both shifted benefits from the income to the disability portion of the  		combined annuity and deferred the income benefit for 5 years could cut the cost  		in half and increase the proportion of persons that could purchase the annuity  		to about 60% at both purchase ages, assuming willingness to annuitize all  		wealth and access to 100% of housing assets. </p>
<p>We purposefully considered only alternate designs that maintained the  		level disability benefit. Clearly less comprehensive benefits in either a  		combined annuity or conventional LTCI would reduce the cost and further  		increase the proportion of persons who could pre-fund some portion of their  		long-term care needs. Premiums are lower for LTCI policies that have shorter  		benefit periods, longer waiting periods before benefits can begin, limits on  		providers that may be used, or no inflation protection. In some cases limited  		policies may be a reasonable choice for persons with modest financial  		resources--for example home care only policies for married persons wishing to  		remain at home as long as possible and protect resources to support a spouse.  		Reducing benefits enough to make them affordable for persons with  		modest income and assets, however, runs the risk of reducing their standard of  		living while providing insufficient protection both for purchasers and for  		public payers. Such concerns were the reason for development of the published  		guidelines for LTCI purchase used in this report. Some modest income purchasers  		may even be worse off than if they had not purchased LTCI, for example, if LTCI  		benefits are sufficient to make them ineligible for Medicaid but not enough to  		cover long-term care costs.<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Issues in Development of Asset-Based Vehicles</h3>
<p>Serious focus on ways to draw on assets, including home equity, to  		pre-fund long-term care is relatively new, prompted in part by the low take-up  		rate for conventional LTCI. Barring less expensive access to housing equity, a  		combination product like the one we model is likely to appeal to the same high  		income and wealth groups that have dominated the market for LTCI. In this final  		section, we discuss issues from the perspective of consumers, insurers, and  		public programs that remain to be considered carefully and addressed. </p>
<p><i><b>Consumer Perspectives</b></i></p>
<p>Couples face a particularly complex set of decisions with respect to  		retirement security. They include the adequacy of income for the lifetime of  		both spouses, the configuration of long-term care protection, and the use of  		housing equity when a spouse will need to be provided for in widowhood. One  		important limitation of our estimates is that they are based on data for  		individuals and therefore do not addressjoint decisions by spouses or potential  		price advantages for joint purchase. Our upper bound estimate of the percent of  		the population that could afford the combined annuity is based on  		the purchase of a single annuity by both married and unmarried individuals who  		would annuitize 100% of assets including home equity if necessary. Preserving  		the home for the surviving spouse is less of an issue for high wealth couples  		where drawing on housing wealth typically is not necessary to purchase a  		combined annuity, but a significant issue for our lower wealth group. Although  		married persons have higher income and asset levels and are more likely to be  		in our high wealth group, there is no consequential difference by marital  		status in housing wealth as a proportion of total wealth or the likelihood of  		needing to use equity to cover the annuity premium cost. </p>
<p>Annuitization combined with long-term care protection may be  		particularly valuable to single persons because of their lower likelihood of  		passing conventional underwriting at retirement age and their higher disability  		risks. They may also have a lower bequest motive, since they do not need to  		provide for a surviving spouse. Whereas couples have incentives to pre-fund  		long-term care to support the efforts of a potential caregiving spouse and to  		assure the financial future of the surviving spouse, single persons may see  		pre-funding through a combined annuity or LTCI as a way to provide for care in  		the absence of a potential spousal caregiver. Medicaid eligibility rules also  		are stricter for single persons, essentially requiring impoverishment, whereas  		they provide at least some protection for income and assets of spouses of  		beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Persons at older ages who are beginning to have physical problems and  		may see their health and financial situation more clearly than at earlier ages  		also may find the annuity concept more appealing. Older persons are generally  		able to obtain a larger proportion of equity through reverse mortgages because  		of their shorter life expectancy.</p>
<p>A large issue remains, however, of the efficiency and advisability of  		layering transaction costs for multiple products if reverse mortgage financing  		is used to pay for either an annuity or LTCI. As noted earlier, Merlisestimates  		that benefits from LTCI purchased with proceeds from a reverse mortgage may  		represent only 36 cents per dollar of equity, and United Seniors recommends  		reverse mortgage financing of long-term care only as an option for persons who  		cannot afford or cannot qualify medically for LTCI.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> A consumer brochure from the  		Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA), an independent  		standards-setting organization for life insurance, annuities and LTCI,  		specifically counsels against using a mortgage to purchase a standard annuity,  		although it does not address combination annuities or reverse mortgages and is  		not focused specifically on the older population.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup> Because reverse mortgages are not repaid  		until the borrower leaves the home, transaction costs may be less of an issue  		for purchase of a combination annuity that provides both increased income for  		life and long-term care protection.</p>
<p>For a sizeable proportion of the 55% of the older population who do not  		meet the thresholds we model for purchase of either an annuity or LTCI,  		however, using reverse mortgage proceeds to pay for long-term care needs  		directly if needed rather than pre-funding them may be the better course. The  		option to take reverse mortgage proceeds as an interest-earning line of credit  		and draw on them only as needed may make using home equity more appealing to  		many and may reduce total costs, but does not address large upfront costs. If  		housing equity is to make an important contribution to increased pre-funding of  		long-term care among persons with more modest means or to direct private  		payment of long-term care expenses, substantial reductions in loan costs for  		reverse mortgages and higher limits on the amount of equity that can be taken  		out almost certainly will be needed. </p>
<p>Finally, the relatively low level of financial literacy among the older  		population poses not only a potential barrier but also serious consumer  		protection issues, many of them arising from the fact that most annuities and  		most LTCI are sold in the individual market. The need for consumer protections  		is even greater for persons with more modest resources for whom mistakes may be  		financially catastrophic. As noted earlier suitability standards  		for LTCI purchase arose to protect modest income purchasers from unscrupulous  		sales practices. Choosing the right LTCI policy is a complex and sometimes  		bewildering process for consumers that has prompted some to call for policies  		to standardize benefits and policy language,<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup> but it is by no means the only demand on  		retirees financial resources and acumen. Even with nearly universal  		Medicare coverage, retirees pay almost half of their health costs out of  		pocket, and employers are becoming less willing to contribute toward or offer  		retiree health benefits, a trend that shifts both costs and the research  		required to identify appropriate and affordable coverage to retirees.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> The continuing shift from  		traditional defined-benefit pensions toward defined contribution plans has the  		effect both of shifting investment risks to retirees and increasing the  		financial literacy required to manage accumulations through retirement.  		Annuitization--with or without long-term care protection--can be one way to  		simplify the process and reduce risks, but making wise choices may require a  		level of financial literacy beyond many retirees, given the array of annuities  		on the market, their complexity, and the need for improved market  		oversight.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Insurer and Market Perspectives</b></i></p>
<p>The passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 is stimulating  		industry interest in combined products.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup> There are, however, significant barriers to  		the development and expansion of a private market for the type of combined  		annuity modeled here. One barrier is higher premiums for and insurer concerns  		about higher payout levels with cash benefits. Payouts for cash benefits are  		higher for any given benefit maximum because the full benefit is paid, whereas  		insurers expect lower payouts under reimbursement policies typical in LTCI,  		which pay only for allowed services.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup> Cash benefit policies are available at a  		higher premium, sometimes combined with a conventional reimbursement benefit.  		For example, premiums for hybrid home care policies paying a set  		percentage of the maximum benefit as cash or including a cash benefit as an  		add-on are 25%-70% higher than for a standard benefit.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Moral hazard in which insured persons use more services than  		if they faced the full cost--or are more likely to claim eligibility in the  		case of a cash benefit--also is a concern, but may be less important for  		pricing in a combination product. In our earlier work we simulated the impact  		of stylized scenarios assuming that individuals and the providers who certify  		their functional status have incentives to inflate disability levels in order  		to obtain benefits at lower disability levels, for disabilities that were not  		yet chronic, or upon entry into a nursing home. We found impacts of about 40%  		to almost 60% in the cost of the disability portion of the annuity. This  		translated, however, into only about a 4%-6% increase in the total premium for  		the combined annuity because of the dominance of the income benefit.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Long-term care insurers also have tended to be leery of fully pre-paid  		benefits because there is no possibility of future premium increases.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup> This places all the risks  		associated with assumptions about earnings and the level of benefit payouts on  		the insurer. Purchasers bear that risk in conventional LTCI with level periodic  		premiums. Although they are protected from premium increases as they age,  		premiums for a class of persons may increase if payouts exceed assumed levels  		used to set premiums. It is possible that a shift to an annuity base for cash  		disability benefits may reduce insurer aversion to prepayment, because annuity  		offerers are more accustomed to pre-paid insurance, but there is no evidence to  		date.</p>
<p>Even if insurers are willing to assume the potential risks associated  		with pre-paid premiums and cash disability benefits, other important barriers  		remain. If the type of combined annuity we examine is to be offered through  		qualified retirement plans, changes in current laws--or at least  		clarifications--also are needed.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup> Obtaining approval to market hybrid  		products, in addition, may be a significant challenge in many states given  		fragmented federal and state responsibilities for regulating different types of  		insurance.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Medicaid Perspectives</b></i></p>
<p>Current public efforts to expand long-term care pre-funding are  		motivated by a desire to control costs in the Medicaid program and prevent  		impoverishment among persons who could provide privately for their long-term  		care needs. The impact on Medicaid of developing a market for combined  		annuities or other asset-based vehicles is uncertain. Facilitating access to  		home equity by those with more modest resources is critical if this type of  		private financing is to be accessible to persons most likely to become eligible  		for Medicaid if they have substantial long-term care needs. However, home  		equity is routinely being promoted as a source of funding for college expenses,  		paying off debts, and other uses that conflict with the prospect that large  		amounts of unencumbered equity will remain to be tapped in retirement. To the  		extent that home equity is intact at retirement, with continued shifts away  		from employer-sponsored defined-benefit pension plans and retiree health  		coverage, health care and other routine expenses in retirement (e.g., home  		repairs, taxes) may compete with long-term care pre-funding as a use for this  		stored wealth. An even worse scenario for equity as a source of private  		financing or pre-funding of long-term care is if reverse mortgages grow in  		popularity as a vehicle for funding the purchase of expensive cars, boats,  		retirement travel, or second homes. </p>
<p>One way states can recoup Medicaid expenses is from the estates of  		beneficiaries in cases where there is no surviving spouse or other surviving  		dependent, such as a co-resident sibling or disabled child. Currently, states  		recover only between 0.01% and 2.09% of Medicaid long-term care  		expenditures.<sup><font><a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup>  		Typically, given the financial thresholds for Medicaid eligibility, most of the  		estate available for recovery is represented by the home, which remains a  		protected asset if there is a surviving spouse or any possibility of an  		unmarried person being able to return home.<sup><font><a href="#note42">42</a></font></sup> While many argue that the amount recovered  		from estates will increase with more aggressive state programs, if it becomes  		more common to draw down equity for long-term care or other uses the yield from  		more aggressive estate recovery efforts will be attenuated. Whether and how  		successfully states apply Medicaid asset transfer rules to home equity  		conversions remains unclear, in part because they are so far rare.<sup><font><a href="#note43">43</a></font></sup> The Deficit Reduction Act of  		2005 imposed new restrictions on transfers of assets to gain Medicaid and  		prohibits Medicaid eligibility for persons with housing equity of $500,000 or  		more ($750,000 at state option). It also, however, explicitly allows the use of  		a reverse mortgage to bring home equity below the new maximum levels but does  		not specify how proceeds may be used. Clearly the limit on equity would affect  		relatively few persons with modest levels of wealth, but uses of reverse  		mortgage proceeds for purposes other than pre-funding or paying for long-term  		care will not reduce or eliminate the need for Medicaid long-term care but will  		reduce the amount of equity available to be recovered from estates. </p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>The level of long-term care pre-funding through conventional LTCI  		remains low, despite more than 20 years of substantial product improvement and  		increasing--albeit modest--public incentives. Whether public policy to  		encourage innovative products and asset-based financing will be any more  		successful in bringing about more widespread pre-funding of long-term care  		remains uncertain. New laws enacted and under consideration are opening the  		door to a wider array of options for private pre-funding of long-term care, as  		well as focusing on improving retirement security in an era of defined  		contribution retirement plans. Nevertheless, significant barriers remain. These  		include insurer attitudes toward prepayment of premiums and cash disability  		benefits, which may be more appealing to consumers and more flexible in meeting  		their long-term care needs. Tax and regulatory issues relating to the use of  		defined contribution retirement accounts to purchase annuities also remain to  		be addressed.</p>
<p>A combined annuity like the one we model could add to the array of  		pre-funding options for long-term care, while also providing a vehicle for  		shielding retirement savings from investment risk and insuring a stable level  		of income over remaining life. Improved access to lower cost ways of using home  		equity could expand the population who could consider such a product. Access to  		home equity is particularly important for the roughly one in five individuals  		at age 65 and age 75 who have more modest resources than is typical for current  		LTCI purchasers and are most likely to become eligible for Medicaid should they  		experience a lengthy period of disability. The relaxed underwriting  		theoretically possible with a combined income and disability annuity means that  		few of these individuals would be precluded from buying this type of insurance  		because of their health. Alternate designs that reduce the income benefit in  		our base model without reducing the disability benefit preserve the pre-funding  		of long-term care, while substantially expanding the number of persons  		potentially able to purchase.</p>
<p>The combined annuity, however, is not a silver bullet  		solution for financing the long-term care needs of Americans, any more than  		LTCI has proved to be. Like LTCI, it is likely to appeal primarily to persons  		with substantial financial resources. We estimate that more than half of all  		persons at both ages have too few resources to purchase such an annuity under  		our assumption that 100% of housing equity is available. The share who could  		not purchase grows to almost two-thirds of all persons at both ages if only 50%  		of home equity can be accessed, an assumption more in keeping with limits on  		the most commonly used type of reverse mortgage on the market. Thus, it is  		clear that reverse mortgage costs and limits on the amount of home equity that  		can be accessed are likely to play an important role in determining the full  		potential of asset-based financing of long-term care among persons with modest  		financial resources--through either pre-funding or direct payment. Retiree  		attitudes toward using housing wealth also are critically important. Current  		elders tend to be averse to tapping into home equity, for any reason. Retirees  		in the near future may be much more comfortable using home equity, including  		for discretionary uses that reduce the amount potentially available to fund or  		pre-fund long-term care.</p>

<p><a name="note24" id="note24">Historically</a> the value of a primary residence,  			 whatever the value, is excluded from eligibility determinations for single  			 persons unless there is no expectation that the individual may return home and  			 for married persons if a spouse or dependent lives in the home. The Deficit  			 Reduction Act of 2005 excluded persons with "substantial" housing equity,  			 defined as more than $500,000 ($750,000 at state option), from Medicaid  			 eligibility except when a spouse or child with disability is residing in the  			 home. In the HRS sample, only 1.5% of persons reported housing equity that  			 great.</p>

<p><a name="note25" id="note25">It</a> should be recalled that our premium estimate  			 for 75 year olds, which includes nonforfeiture benefits, was similar to FLTCIP  			 premiums without nonforfeiture and well below the other external market  			 premiums used for comparison in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, implying that  			 our estimates of the proportion of persons meeting the LTCI guidelines are  			 generous. Premiums at age 65 are more similar to market premiums.</p>
