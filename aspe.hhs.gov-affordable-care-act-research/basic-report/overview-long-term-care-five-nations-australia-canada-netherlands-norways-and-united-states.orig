<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The International Collaborative Effort on Measuring the Health and  		Health Care of the Aging (abbreviated the ICE on Aging) was launched in late  		1988. Its sponsor was the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the  		Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health and  		Human Services. The purpose of the ICE on Aging is to support international  		experts in conducting research to improve the measurement of health and health  		care of the aging in addressing issues of concern among nations facing the  		challenges of an aging population. The international emphasis of the research  		is intended to permit the exchange of multiple perspectives, approaches, and  		insights. The ICE on Aging was launched with an international symposium in  		which multiple proposals for comparative research were developed in the areas  		of health care and health status.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Long term Care (LTC) was selected as a  		research topic because the growth of the older population forecasts an  		increasing need for such care. Papers concerning LTC at the international  		symposium focused on issues in measuring outcomes of nursing home  		care<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a>, <a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> and on descriptions of national systems of  		LTC.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a>, <a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The research project of the ICE on Aging chosen to focus on health care  		was measuring the outcomes of nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> This research has as its goals:</p>
<ul><li>improving the measurement of outcomes and characteristics of frail  		  older persons in nursing homes</li>
<li>strengthening the comparability of such data among collaborating  		  countries</li>
<li>disseminating the results of the research to encourage its  		  international application</li>
</ul><p>Strengthening measurement and understanding of nursing home outcomes in  		an international context can lead to greater understanding of approaches to  		improve outcomes. A team of experts in LTC from five nations was assembled.  		Each member had knowledge about and access to existing national data sets o  		nursing home care and its outcomes. Researchers were from Australia, Canada,  		the Netherlands, Norway and the United States (US).</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>After discussions about the possible approaches for conducting the  		international analysis, the research team concluded that the initial step in  		analysis should be to establish the <b>context</b> of the research on outcomes  		of nursing home care. The purpose of this report is to describe the context of  		nursing homes and their outcomes in each of the five nations under study. As  		such, the report provides a background for understanding the structural and  		cultural context within which LTC is provided. The goal of preparing this  		report was to ensure that comparisons made in subsequent research on nursing  		home outcomes would have a valid basis.</p>
<p>The context for research on nursing home outcomes in each nation is  		described by several types of variables:</p>
<ul><li>variables about the system of LTC services, such as kinds and mix of  		  LTC services, utilization and payment of nursing home care, and links to acute  		  care and home care systems</li>
<li>variables about the culture, such as demography, resources allocation  		  to LTC, and role of the family</li>
<li>variables about the service levels and populations served in nursing  		  homes.</li>
</ul><p>The descriptions about the service levels and populations served in  		nursing homes were important for identifying which types of nursing homes  		should be grouped for appropriate comparisons across countries. The year 1985  		serves as a focal point for this analysis because, when the research was  		initiated, it was the only year for which data were available in all five  		nations. Of course, in each of the nations, the LTC system has evolved  		considerably since then and continues to do so. However, a comparative analysis  		of the 1985 data highlighted some surprising similarities.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> The most surprising was the  		finding that the percent of persons aged 65 and older who were in nursing hones  		was very similar among the five nations. In four of the five countries  		(Australia, Canada, Norway, and the US), 4 to 5 percent of the elderly were in  		nursing homes providing the highest levels of care. The Netherlands was the  		exception: only 3 percent were in such nursing homes. A major reason for the  		lower rate is the higher percent of elderly who reside in supportive housing in  		the Netherlands.</p>
<p>After much analysis of this contextual data, the research teams  		concluded that comparisons should concentrate on the highest level of nursing  		home care provided in each nation.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> The major reason for this conclusion was that  		the goals, care provided, and resident characteristics in this group of LTC  		institutions were the most comparable across the five nations.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of nursing home outcomes in five nations is now  		underway. A basic question of the analysis is: What can be learned from other  		nations to improve the outcomes of nursing home care? The chapters in this  		report provide a context for addressing this question.</p>
<h2><a name="Australia" id="Australia">I. INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS OF LONG TERM  		CARE--AUSTRALIA</a><sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup></h2>
<h3>History and Evolution of Long Term Care</h3>
<p>Federal government support for nursing home care began in Australia in  		1963, and four phases have been distinguished in subsequent growth.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> These phases have been defined  		by major shifts in policy directions, with consequences for the rate of growth  		of nursing home bed provision and changes in patterns of utilization. As the  		baseline year for the comparison with other national studies, 1985 is  		particularly appropriate for Australia as it marks the commencement of a major  		reform strategy in aged care. Australia has a federal system of government akin  		to that of the USA and Canada; the terms Commonwealth and Federal Government  		are used interchangeably. There are six States and two Territories, but for  		convenience these are all referred to collectively as States. A major factor of  		the federal system that has shaped the development of long term care over the  		last thirty years is that while the Federal government has virtually full  		responsibility for planning and financing residential care, responsibility for  		community care is cost-shared between the Commonwealth and the States.</p>
<p>Another important feature of the context of residential care in  		Australia is the high rate of home ownership among the aged. At the 1986  		census, some 72% of the population aged 65 years and over were home owners (or  		purchasers). Some 7% were renters in the private sector, 5% were tenants in  		public housing, and another 5% had other tenure arrangements. The relatively  		low proportion of the aged population living in public housing reflects a much  		stronger policy emphasis on measures to foster home ownership in the early post  		war years in Australia than on the provision of public housing.</p>
<p>The distribution of the total population aged 65 years and over by  		living arrangements is summarized in <a href="#tableI-A">Table I-A</a>. Almost  		84% were living independently in the community. The 6% receiving assistance  		with home help or community nursing are concentrated in the very old age  		groups, and so account for only a small percentage of the total population aged  		65 years and over. While only some 8% of the total population aged 65 years and  		over is aged 85 years and over, the profile of clients of the Home and  		community Care Program shows that 23% of frail aged clients (aged 65 years and  		over) were in this advanced age group.</p>
<p>Some 10% were living in non-private dwellings, which include nursing  		homes (4.4%), hostels (2.4%) and other forms of sheltered accommodation and  		congregate housing (3.2%). The next level of care to nursing home care in  		Australia is provided in hostels, which provide congregate living and personal  		and social care, but not continuous nursing care. All hostels recognized for  		Federal funding were provided by the voluntary non-profit sector until 1991. As  		of mid 1985, the maximum subsidy attracted for hostel care was about 25% of the  		lowest level of benefit paid for nursing home care, and there were then half as  		many hostel beds as nursing home beds. A major policy concern since 1985 has  		been to change the balance between nursing home and hostel care. The measures  		taken to this end and their outcomes are major themes in current policy  		development.</p>

</tr></table><p>The level of support provided in other kinds of sheltered accommodation  		varies widely, from minimal support in boarding houses to care equivalent to  		hostels. Provisions were introduced in 1991 to enable residents in private  		sector facilities providing equivalent care to hostels to receive hostel care  		subsidies, subject to approval of the facility on the basis of defined outcome  		standards.</p>
<p>Acute hospitals are not regarded as providing long term care for the  		aged. Rates of admission to acute hospital care increase over the older age  		range from 316 per 1000 at age 60-64 years to 531 per 1000 at age 85 years and  		over, and average length of stay increases from 7 to 16.5 days. While some  		individuals do have protracted stays in acute care, they are exceptional, with  		the great majority of those requiring long term care being discharged to  		nursing homes after relatively short stays in acute hospitals.</p>
<p>A final note on the general context of residential aged care is that  		very little long term care is now provided in psychiatric hospitals or mental  		institutions. The decline in these facilities over the last 25 to 30 years  		parallels the growth of nursing homes over that time. In New South Wales, for  		example, the number of long stay beds in psychiatric hospitals fell from about  		12,700 in 1959 to only 2,680 in 1985; nursing home provision increased from  		10,000 in 1965 to 30,130 in 1985. Similar declines occurred in other States,  		and by the mid 1980s, the national ratio was about 15 nursing home beds for  		every long term care bed in psychiatric facilities.</p>
<p>The growth of nursing home care in Australia can be summarized on the  		basis of the four main policy phases and the years for which data are given in  		<a href="#tableI-B">Table I-B</a> have been selected to mark the turning points  		of these phases.</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>From 1963 to 1972</i></b></p>
<p>The payment of Commonwealth benefits for nursing home care began in  		1963. Prior to that date, long term care for chronically ill aged people was  		provided in a variety of public and private hospital facilities, in  		convalescent and rest homes, and as already noted, in long term psychiatric  		hospitals. At that time, the Pensioner Medical Service (PMS) provided public  		hospital care for those receiving the Age Pension and who met a means test for  		the PMS; just over 40% of the population of pensionable age (60 for women and  		65 for men) were eligible for the PMS. Those who were not eligible could only  		receive Commonwealth benefits for hospital care in private hospitals only if  		they also belonged to a private health insurance fund.</p>
<p>These funding arrangements were proving increasingly unsatisfactory for  		long term care on at least four grounds. First, those who did not take out  		private insurance, or could not afford to, but who did not qualify for the PMS,  		were faced with increasing costs for prolonged stays in hospital. Second, the  		private health funds imposed numerous conditions, such as maximum payments and  		maximum periods of payment, which effectively excluded long term cover even for  		insured patients; those who could not afford the full cost of continuing  		hospital care were discharged to a variety of convalescent and rest homes that  		were not recognized for health insurance purposes. While offering care at lower  		cost that hospitals, a third set of problems arose from the mounting costs and  		variable standards of care for those needing prolonged care. Finally, public  		hospitals were caring for increasing numbers of chronically ill pensioners who  		could be more appropriately cared for in other forms of accommodation.</p>
<p>To remedy these problems, the Commonwealth introduced Nursing Home  		Benefits which were paid irrespective of the individual's pension status or  		their participation in private health insurance. The benefits were paid to  		patients in facilities that were specifically approved as Nursing Homes. As  		well as long stay wards of public hospitals, many small private hospitals which  		essentially provided long term care switched from hospital funding to the new  		provisions and these also extended to some of the convalescent facilities which  		were not previously recognized. There was thus considerable variety in staffing  		and other aspects of the facilities initially approved to receive Nursing Home  		Benefits, and as approval was left to State Governments, there was further  		variation from State to State.</p>
<p>Having introduced Nursing Home Benefits, the Commonwealth took little  		other part in policy development. Reflecting this non-interventionist role, the  		period from 1963 to 1972 has been described as period of <i>laissez faire  		policy</i>, during which the Commonwealth did little more than pay benefits for  		residents in approved nursing homes. Approval of homes depended on Commonwealth  		acceptance of facilities which met State requirements. States also defined  		staffing levels and over time, considerable divergences developed between the  		states in the level of bed provision, staffing, fees and benefits. There were  		no controls over the growth or distribution of facilities, nor over admissions  		or the level of fee that could be charged above the benefit. By the late 1960s,  		concerns about standards of care and the overall operation of nursing home care  		were becoming widespread.</p>
<p>The result of this laissez faire policy approach was a rapid growth in  		provision, averaging almost 10% p.a. to 1972. Many existing facilities that had  		been small convalescent hospitals in the private and voluntary sectors were  		initially approved for benefit purposes, as were long stay wards in public  		hospitals. Almost as many new beds again were established over the next eight  		years. The growth of private and voluntary sector provision contrasted with the  		stagnation of provision by State governments, with the public sector declining  		from 36* of provision in 1964 to about 25% in 1972.</p>
<p><b><i>From 1972 to 1981</i></b></p>
<p>Commonwealth policy in this phase had three main concerns: to control  		the rapid growth of provision and expenditure of the preceding years, to gain  		some control over admissions, and to address the interstate variations in fees  		and benefit levels that had emerged. Several regulatory measures were  		introduced to control growth of beds, admissions and fees in this period of  		<b>policy by regulation</b>. These measures were largely administrative and did  		not achieve their intended outcomes, with fluctuations in growth over this time  		rather being due to other factors.</p>
<p>Thus, while the level of growth of provision fell substantially between  		1972 and 1977 compared to the earlier period, this outcome was not so much due  		to the success of the regulatory measures introduced but to the virtual  		cessation of approvals of new nursing homes during the three years of the  		Labour Government from 1972 to 1975, and the effect carried over the next few  		years. With the change of government in late 1975, approvals a higher rate of  		approval of new development resumed, and this growth became evident from 1977  		as homes came into operation. The scale of this rapid growth, combined with the  		collapse in 1981 of private health insurance coverage of insured nursing home  		patients which had applied from 1978, attracted considerable policy interest.  		Concurrently with the instigation of an inquiry by the Commonwealth Auditor  		General, a more concerted effort was made to limit growth from 1981.</p>
<p>One key measure that was introduced in 1974 was the differentiation of  		funding arrangements for the voluntary non-profit sector from those applying to  		the private for profit sector. This step was initially intended to assist in  		controlling expenditure by breaking the nexus between fees charged and benefits  		reimbursed, but at the same time allow for higher funding to preserve the  		standard of care that was seen to be offered by the voluntary homes. However,  		the new deficit financing arrangements lacked strong cost controls, and when  		combined with capital subsidies available to the voluntary sector, the outcome  		was a more rapid expansion in provision and payments to the voluntary sector  		than to the private sector.</p>
<p>The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a return to a higher rate of growth,  		but the impact on the Commonwealth budget was blunted by moves that required  		private health insurance funds to pay nursing home benefits for patients who  		had private insurance. These arrangements could not however be sustained and  		the return of full funding to the Commonwealth in 1981, compounded by  		escalation in costs due to rapid growth in provision, brought increased policy  		attention to long term care. The neglect of community care was equally  		apparent; a major factor inhibiting development was identified as cost-sharing  		arrangements between the Federal and State Governments.</p>
<p><b><i>From 1981 to 1985</i></b></p>
<p>This period saw a number of major inquiries into long term care in  		Australia. The level of concern is indicated by the bodies involved, which  		included the Commonwealth Auditor General, the House of Representatives  		Standing Committee on Expenditure and a Senate Select Committee.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives Inquiry reported in late 1982 and provided  		the basis of policies adopted by the incoming Labour Government in 1983.  		Implementation of these policies began in the 1984-85 budget and was  		consolidated in the report of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review which was  		undertaken by the then Department of Community Services to provide a response  		to the issues raised by the Senate Select Committee. That report provides a  		baseline account of the Australian residential care system as it was in  		1985.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A major program of restructuring residential care was commenced from  		early 1986, based on the following four principles:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Aged and disabled people should as far as possible be supported in  			 their own homes, in their own communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aged and disabled people should be supported in residential services  			 only where other support systems are not appropriate to their needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services should be provided in an atmosphere and using processes  			 which promote as far as is possible rehabilitation and restoration of function.  			 The manner in which services are provided should develop and enhance personal  			 freedom and independent functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services should be based on a recognition that for many people,  			 discharge to a less supported residential service or to a community based  			 support service will be a possible and desirable outcome.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>1986 to the Present</i></b></p>
<p>The major reforms in nursing home care implemented over the last five  		years have focused on five main areas:</p>
<ul><li>planning processes for development of residential care to control  		  growth of nursing homes and to foster hostel provision;</li>
<li>the introduction of pre-admission assessment by multidisciplinary  		  Geriatric Assessment Teams;</li>
<li>the development and application of a five category system of funding  		  of nursing home care, related to resident dependency;</li>
<li>attention to special needs in long term care, including provision for  		  dementia care, particularly in hostels, and the needs of particular groups such  		  as the ethnic aged and older Aboriginal people; and</li>
<li>the specification of outcome standards and implementation of  		  monitoring procedures.</li>
</ul><p>A major expansion and enhancement of community care has accompanied the  		restructuring of residential care, and the reform strategy reached its mid  		point in 1990-91, with overall goals expected to be achieved by 1995-96.  		Progress with the strategy and outcomes of the measures introduced to date have  		been assessed in a mid-Term Review of the Aged Care Reform Strategy, and many  		of the analyses presented below are drawn from this Review.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Overview of the Current System and Recent Trends</h3>
<p><b><i>Demography</i></b></p>
<p>Australia is experiencing rapid aging of its population over the decade  		from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s. The population aged 65 years and over is  		estimated to increase by 31% from 1986 to 1996, and the 80 years and over  		population by 56%. Thereafter, the increase in the population aged 65 years and  		over falls to 17% from 1996 to 2006. The three main factors contributing to the  		present rapid aging are: the large birth cohorts of the decade after the World  		War I; the influx of young adults who migrated to Australia in the years after  		World War II and who are now reaching old age, making the aged population  		increasingly diverse as well as increasing its size; and improvements in  		mortality at older ages.</p>
<p>The effects of changes in birth rates, mortality and immigration are  		taken into account in the population projections prepared by the Australian  		Bureau of Statistics with four sets of projections being prepared using  		different assumptions.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> The Series D projections are accepted as  		representing the most likely future, hence Series D figures are cited here. The  		assumptions in the Series D projections are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mortality to decline to 1996 according to short term rates of  			 mortality decline, and from 1996 to 2031 according to long term rates of  			 mortality decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fertility to decline to from 1989 rate to 1.66 children per woman in  			 1998, and remain constant thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overseas immigration at 125,000 annually to 1993/94, then declining  			 linearly to 80,000 per year by 1998/99 and maintained at that level  			 thereafter.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Notwithstanding the rapid increase in the aged population, Australia is  		relatively young by international standards. In 1990, some lit of the  		population was aged 65 years and this will reach 12% in 2001. Further figures  		in <a href="#tableI-C">Table I-C</a> show that dependency ratios remain  		relatively stable for some time. The baby boom in Australia was later and  		longer than in North America, and this generation will boost the workforce ages  		groups until well after the turn of the century. Declines in the birthrate and  		hence fewer young dependents offset the increase in old dependents, so there is  		very little change in overall dependency ratios.</p>
<p>The age structure within the aged population is affected by the more  		rapid increases in the older cohorts than in the younger cohorts. The  		proportion of the population aged 65 years and over that is aged 85 years and  		over increases from under 8% in 1990 to almost 11% in 2001. It is this rapid  		increase in the old old cohorts that has greatest implications for aged care  		services.</p>
<p>Life expectancies at older ages have increased in Australia in recent  		years. In 1971, life expectancy at age 60 was 15.5 years for men and 19.8 years  		for women; in 1986, these figures were 18.1 and 22.2 years respectively. Life  		expectancy at birth in 1986 reached 73 years for men and 79 years for  		women.</p>

<p>In 1985, the total of 71,500 beds gave a ratio of 44.4 beds per 1000  		aged 65 years and over. This total is nett of some 3,700 beds in homes that  		catered for younger disabled people, which in line with reforms in disability  		programs following on from the International Year of the Disabled Person in  		1981, were transferred out of the aged care program.</p>
<p>In recognition of the advanced age of nursing home residents, some two  		thirds of whom are over 80 years of age, age 70 was adopted for planning  		purposes in 1986. The ratio of provision on this basis was 67.2 beds per 1000.  		Together with hostel provision of some 33 places per 1000 aged 70 years and  		over, total residential care was 100 places per 1000. There was however  		considerable variation in nursing home provision between the States, the ratio  		varying from 53 per 1000 in Victoria to 74 per 1000 in New South Wales, Western  		Australia and Tasmania.</p>
<p>The distribution between sectors of provision in 1985 was 47% of beds in  		private-for-profit homes, 33% in voluntary nonprofit homes and 20% in public  		homes operated by State governments. The three sectors of provision vary in  		many aspects of their structure and functioning. In terms of size for example,  		State Government homes tend to be the largest; 65% of public beds were in homes  		of 100 beds or more. Many private homes fall in the 30 to 60 bed range; 75% of  		private beds were in homes with 80 or fewer beds and only 20% in homes of 100  		or more beds. Some 65% of beds in voluntary sector homes are in homes of 80 or  		fewer beds, but some 20% are in homes of 100 beds or more; voluntary sector  		homes also often operate in conjunction with other levels of care, particularly  		hostels. The sectoral pattern of provision has remained stable for the last  		five years, with a marginal decline in the public sector. All sectors are  		covered by Commonwealth funding, as described below.</p>
<p><b><i>Planning</i></b></p>
<p>Nursing home care in Australia is planned as a national program,  		administered by the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community  		Services. A central element in program planning is the needs-based planning  		process that controls the growth and distribution of facilities and the  		approval of provider organizations. Limited planning processes were introduced  		in 1972, but have since been elaborated and extended to hostel provision as  		well as nursing homes.</p>
<p>The principal means for controlling overall growth of nursing homes, and  		for changing the balance between nursing home and hostel provision, has been  		the establishment of planning ratios to guide residential care development over  		the next 20 years. The ratios were set to achieve 40 nursing home beds and 60  		hostel places per 1000 aged 70 years and over by around 2006, effectively  		reversing the balance existing in 1985. The figure of 40 nursing home beds was  		determined on the basis of the number of residents who were receiving the  		extensive care benefit. It was considered that the dependency of  		those who were receiving the "ordinary care" benefit did not warrant the level  		of care available in a nursing home and that such individuals would in future  		be cared for in hostels or in the community, as an expanded range and level of  		community services became available under the Home and Community Care  		Program.</p>
<p>The ratios are applied at a regional level and hence have a considerable  		impact on the distribution of facilities. The needs-based planning processes  		which incorporate the ratios are along the lines of Certificate of Need  		approaches and take account of a range of population characteristics and the  		availability of other services. These planning processes are central to the  		objectives of the reform strategy that are concerned to overcome the marked  		variations in provision between regions and between States which existed in  		1985. As most regions had more than 40 nursing home beds per 1000 aged 70 years  		and over in 1985, the main factor bringing about change has been the growth of  		the aged population. There have been only marginal additions to bed provision,  		and these have been concentrated in areas of very low provision. It is  		estimated that only some 6000 new nursing home beds will be required from 1986  		to 2006 to bring all areas up to the planning ratio. In contrast, there was  		considerable scope for expansion of hostel provision; further, largely due to  		the absence of any previous planning controls on hostel provision, regional  		variations were even more marked than for nursing home provision and new  		provision was to be distributed to overcome these variations. The outcome of  		these planning processes has been a decrease in the ratio of nursing home  		provision and an increase in hostel provision, in line with the objective of  		changing the balance between these forms of residential care. The actual ratios  		for 1985 and at mid 1991 are set out in <a href="#tableI-D">Table I-D</a>,  		together with the ratios projected for 1991 and 1996 made in Nursing Homes and  		Hostels Review; those projections were made with the objective of achieving  		ratios of 40 nursing home beds and 60 hostel places per 1000 aged 70 years and  		over, over a period of 20 years.</p>
<p>The nursing home ratio has fallen by 10 beds per 1000 aged 70 years and  		over. The actual ratio of 56.8 in 1991 was below the projected ratio of 59.2,  		due to a combination of greater than expected growth of the aged population,  		especially the population aged 80 years and over, and a relatively low level of  		provider interest in further nursing home development. In line with these  		trends, the ratio projected for 1996 should be easily reached, and may be even  		lower.</p>
<p>Hostel provision has grown more slowly than expected, largely due to the  		lag between approval, development and opening of hostels. The ratio of 36.5 in  		1991 was below the projected ratio, but if the level of growth reached in 1991  		is sustained, the ratio should come closer to reaching the future planning  		targets. The extent of change in the balance between nursing homes and hostels  		is seen in there being 1.6 nursing home beds for every hostel place in 1991  		compared to 2 to 1 in 1985.</p>
<p>Variation in provision between the States and between regions has also  		been reduced. Whereas 41 regions had more than 60 nursing home beds per 1000  		aged 70 years and over in 1984, only 24 had such high provision in 1990. Only  		three regions had less than 40 nursing home beds per 1000 aged 70 years and  		over in 1991.</p>

<p>In the past, substantial capital has been provided to the voluntary  		sector for the development of nursing homes under Commonwealth programs. In  		line with growth controls, only limited capital funding is now provided, and is  		targeted to special needs groups, such as the ethnic aged and Aboriginals, who  		face difficulties raising their own funds.</p>
<p>In 1985, different arrangements for Commonwealth recurrent funding  		applied to each sector of provision, and a differential of about 30% had  		emerged between sectors. There were also differentials between the States as  		Commonwealth funding then based on staffing levels set by the States. The  		Commonwealth related benefits to the concept of a standard fee, defined as the  		resident contribution of 87.5% of the Age Pension plus rental assistance.  		Benefits were set for each State to ensure that the standard fee covered the  		actual fees charged for 70% of beds in non-government homes, with the aim of  		ensuring access for residents whose only income was the Age Pension and rental  		assistance.</p>
<p>With benefits effectively making up the difference between the standard  		fee and fees charged, homes frequently sought to increased their fees and hence  		increase the benefits. In an effort to control these pressures, the  		Commonwealth moved to make approval of fee increases and justification of  		expenditure a condition of receiving benefits. While bringing some control over  		escalating costs, continuing problems arose from the widening gap between  		benefits and fees in the 30% of homes which were outside the standard fee  		arrangements. The substantial inequities that these differences represented  		were a major factor prompting reform of funding arrangements.</p>
<p>A single set of new recurrent funding arrangements covering all sectors  		has been introduced from 1987. All private and voluntary sector homes are now  		funded under these arrangements. The new arrangements comprise a Standard  		Aggregated Module (SAM) that covers infrastructure costs and a Care Aggregated  		Module (CAM) that covers costs of nursing and personal care. SAM is paid at a  		standard rate and hence gives incentives to contain these costs, while CAM is  		paid according to resident dependency and care provided, and hence creates  		incentives to admit more highly dependent residents. Funding under CAM relates  		to standard hours for nursing and personal care staff, set for the five  		categories of resident dependency determined on the basis of the Resident  		Classification Instrument.</p>
<p>Changes in funding of government homes is being negotiated between the  		Federal and State governments to bring these homes under the CAM/SAM funding  		arrangements. State Governments are currently responsible for funding the  		ancillary services that operate in conjunction with State homes, such as slow  		stream rehabilitation and respite care units, and which are not provided on the  		same scale in other homes under CAM/SAM. These services give government homes a  		somewhat different function vis-a-vis private for profit and voluntary  		homes.</p>
<p>The fee paid by residents has been standardized in all but a very small  		number of beds in "exempt" homes. As of July 1, 1991, no resident is required  		to pay more than 87.5% of the Age Pension plus rent assistance; the standard  		resident contribution amounted to $US 120 per week in mid 1991. The resident  		contribution covers about 25% of the total average weekly cost of nursing home  		care. Residents who receive only part pensions because their income exceeds the  		limit of the income test applied for the Age Pension must make up the  		difference between their part pension and the 87.5% amount. However, 80% of all  		residents are full pensioners, and only 6% have sufficient income to exclude  		them from receiving any pension. As the Age Pension is a Commonwealth social  		security benefit, the Commonwealth effectively meets a very large share of the  		total cost of nursing home care.</p>
<p>A small number of homes have been granted "exempt" status in regard to  		the standard fee setting procedures and resident contribution. These homes are  		not however exempt from other Commonwealth regulations, including outcome  		standards. Exempt homes may charge additional fees for services not covered  		under CAM and SAM, and the rate of Commonwealth benefit paid is reduced in  		proportion to the additional fees charged. Exempt homes account for only 1% of  		beds at present, with provision for up to 6% of beds to be granted exempt  		status. The present funding arrangements for nursing home care need to be set  		in the context of universal health insurance, also called Medicare in  		Australia, that covers medical and hospital services, and the Pharmaceutical  		Benefits Scheme that covers prescription drugs. Medicare reimburses medical  		services on the basis of a schedule of standard fees, and provides access to  		public hospital care free of charge. Private health insurance is available only  		for hospital care and gives access to both public and private hospitals for  		patients seeking private patient status which gives them choice of medical  		practitioner.</p>
<p><b><i>Care Services</i></b></p>
<p>All nursing homes in Australia are expected to provide the same kinds of  		care and funding is allocated on the basis of overall resident dependency.  		Staffing requirements are specified only in regard to the presence of a  		registered nurse on duty at all times. The total hours provided and mix of  		staff generated by CAM are notional only, and the Director of Nursing has  		considerable flexibility in deploying staff resources. In determining the  		notional hours, allowance is made for one hour of Director of Nursing time per  		resident per week, with the remaining hours distributed 32.5% to registered  		nurses, 59.5% to enrolled nurses or nurse assistants, and 8% for therapy.</p>
<p>Differences in the range and level of services are apparent in relation  		to size of facility and whether or not the nursing home operates in conjunction  		with other types of residential care, notably hostel care. Public sector homes  		especially offer more medical input and active rehabilitation rather than  		maintenance programs. These services in State nursing homes are funded by State  		Governments, usually as part of hospital budgets.</p>
<p>Some homes develop a particular emphasis in their services through  		specialization and resident selection. Three examples illustrate. First, some  		homes cater for special needs groups, such as ethnic groups or Aboriginals and  		Torres Strait Islanders; most of these homes are operated by relevant community  		organizations. Care practices are modified to recognize the culture of  		residents, with employment of staff of the same linguistic and cultural  		background being a critical factor. Some mainstream homes are moving to cater  		for ethnic communities in their locality by having a "cluster" of residents  		from a common background and making appropriate provision in care services.</p>
<p>Second, some homes have developed special psychogeriatric units. There  		are only a very small number of such units to date, and there is no special  		recognition in funding. These units are mainly for dementia care, and in the  		public sector, services may be provided in conjunction with State psychiatric  		services. Third, and again on a very limited scale so far, some homes  		specialize in palliative care, often in conjunction with community  		services.</p>
<p>The type of therapy provided in nursing homes is appropriately described  		as maintenance therapy in comparison to post-acute rehabilitation, which in  		Australia is provided in a variety of hospital settings in Australia. Geriatric  		units in the public hospital system are major providers of slow stream  		rehabilitation for elderly patients, often following on from more intensive  		therapy. The therapy staff hours in nursing homes cover physiotherapy,  		occupational therapy, diversional therapy, hydrotherapy and podiatry. Some  		homes also offer programs of music therapy and programs for dementia sufferers  		including reality orientation and validation therapy. The expansion of these  		therapies is being promoted through education and training initiatives.</p>
<p><b><i>Outcome Standards</i></b></p>
<p>The Federal Government exercises on-going control over nursing home care  		through setting and monitoring outcome standards. While taking account of  		individual resident records and well-being, these outcomes are facility based  		and assessed for the home rather than for each resident. The 31 outcome  		standards cover seven areas: health care, social independence, freedom of  		choice, homelike environment, privacy and dignity, variety of experience and  		safety. The outcome standards are monitored by Standards Monitoring Teams that  		visit each home at least once every two years, and where shortcomings are  		found, recommendations are made for remedial action. Sanctions can be imposed  		by way of suspending payment of benefits for new residents, effectively  		precluding admissions to fill vacancies, and hence incurring a loss of income,  		but still maintaining funding for remaining residents. The Federal Government  		also operates complaints units and advocacy services as part of a User Rights  		strategy which includes a Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities, a  		formal Agreement between the operator and resident, and community visitors  		schemes.</p>
<p>State government involvement in the administration of nursing homes is  		limited to registration and licensing, some standards monitoring and the  		application of guardianship legislation as required by individual residents.  		There is considerable variation in each of these areas from State to State.  		States have control over registration and licensing of nursing homes, these  		provisions generally being consistent with other health facilities under State  		control. These provisions cover the registration of the licensee and principal  		administrator as "fit and proper persons", and the construction and maintenance  		of buildings. State Governments and Local Governments also have control over  		landuse planning and so can affect the exact location and design of a nursing  		home.</p>
<p>It is in their approaches to setting and monitoring of care standards  		that the States vary most widely, and also vary from the Federal approach.  		State approaches generally focus on inputs while the Federal standards are  		outcome oriented. In moving towards more outcome oriented approaches, some  		States have integrated the Federal standards with their own and carry out joint  		monitoring. Other States have "left the running" in the area of standards to  		the Federal Government and could be said to be in the process of vacating this  		area.</p>
<p>As a result of this uneven development of State standards, and varying  		approaches to complaints, sanctions and appeals, there is some scope for  		tension and conflict. Problems arise less from overlap and duplication of  		specific regulations than from the consequences of their interpretation in  		terms of outcome standards; for example, the federal system accepts State  		regulation in areas such as fire and safety provisions and urban planning, but  		a facility that met all the State requirements in these areas could fall short  		of providing an environment that was judged homelike according to the Federal  		outcome standards.</p>
<p><b><i>Monitoring and Data Sets on Nursing Home Care</i></b></p>
<p>The development of information systems has been a major adjunct to  		improved planning and program monitoring over the last five years.  		Administrative systems now generate large scale routine data sets on many  		characteristics of nursing home residents and their use of nursing home care.  		An annual statistical overview is published covering details of admissions,  		current residents and separations; these data can be also be analyzed by  		admission cohort. These data cover demographic characteristics, dependency and  		utilization of nursing home care in terms of length of stay and mode of  		separation, and are available by sector of provision and by State. The  		Geriatric Assessment Program is also closely monitored, with evaluation units  		established in each State for this purpose. Nursing homes were covered in the  		1981 and 1988 surveys of disability conducted by the Australian Bureau of  		Statistics. Results of these surveys enable comparisons to be made between the  		population of residential care facilities and those living in the community,  		but are less useful for detailed analysis of the resident population. The  		measures of disability and handicap used in the surveys followed WHO  		conventions and are not sufficiently fine grained for describing the  		residential care population in any depth.</p>
<p>A range of other research studies have been conducted in nursing homes.  		The 1990 edition of the Ageing Research Directory<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> detailed studies of nursing practice,  		resident characteristics, provision and use of residential care services, and  		standards and quality of care. Many of these studies involved only small  		samples or case studies of selected groups of residents or particular services  		and so have only limited generalisability to the total residential care system.  		An important issues for future research is to develop methodologies and  		analytic techniques that will combine the use of the large scale data sets now  		becoming available and other data collections, and apply them to modelling  		various aspects of the long term care system.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Assessment for nursing home care in Australia occurs in two stages.  		Eligibility for admission is first determined by a Geriatric Assessment Team,  		and once admitted, each resident's care needs are assessed by the Director of  		Nursing.</p>
<p><b><i>Pre-admission Assessment</i></b></p>
<p>The Geriatric Assessment Program implemented since the mid 1980s  		provides multi-disciplinary assessment prior to admission and Geriatric  		Assessment Teams (GATs) have authority to approve nursing home admission. GATs  		now operate in all but some remote regions; the regions not served account for  		only 4% of the total population aged 70 years and over. The process of  		delegation of approval for admission to residential care is proceeding so that  		pre-admission assessment will be mandatory by 1992.</p>
<p>The assessment program is jointly funded by the Federal and State  		governments, and most GATs operate through State hospitals or other State  		health services. Geriatric assessment services were operating in some States  		prior to Federal funding, but their role was limited to assessing patients who  		were seeking admission to State nursing homes. Now, as well as being  		"gatekeepers" for all nursing home and hostel admissions, GATs refer clients to  		a wide range of services, in particular having access to rehabilitation and  		other medical services in the hospitals with which they are associated.</p>
<p>The GAT program is closely monitored, and national data for the period  		July to December 1989 showed that only some 24% of all clients referred to GATs  		were recommended for nursing home care, 36% were recommended for community  		care, and just on 10% were recommended for hostel care. An intermediate outcome  		of a recommendation for rehabilitation was made for 14% of clients and another  		16% had other recommendations made (including no change in present care  		arrangements), or withdrew or died before completion of the assessment.  		Recommendations for nursing home care were strongly associated with the  		client's being in an acute hospital at the time of assessment; a client who was  		assessed in an acute hospital was about twice as likely to have a  		recommendation made for nursing home care as was a client who was living in the  		community at the time of assessment. A number of follow-up studies now underway  		as part of the program monitoring are showing a high degree of correspondence  		between the recommendations made by GATs and actual client outcomes. On the  		basis of the longest established GATs, it is expected that around 10% of the  		population aged 70 years and over will be seen annually when GATs are fully  		operational.</p>
<p><b><i>Classification of Resident Care Needs</i></b></p>
<p>The second stage of assessment occurs after admission and is carried out  		by the Director of Nursing, using a standardized schedule, the Resident  		Classification Instrument (RCI). The initial RCI introduced in mid 1988 covered  		11 areas of resident care: need for assistance in transfer, ambulation,  		toileting, bathing, dressing, and eating, continence of urine and faeces,  		prevention of pressure areas, specialized nursing procedures and behavior.  		Different weightings attach to each of the 11 items, the behavior item having  		the highest weight; this item serves as a surrogate indicator of dementia.</p>
<p>An overall service need rating (OSN) is also made on a six point scale.  		The OSN serves as an independent variable to which scores on the 11 individual  		items and the total RCI score can be compared. The OSN has also been used to  		check variations in RCI scoring between homes.</p>
<p>In trials carried out in developing the RCI, the 11 items were found to  		explain 71% of the variance in resident care need as measured by the OSN. The  		RCI has also gained wide acceptance in the field. In accord with an undertaking  		given when it was introduced, the RCI was reviewed in late 1990. The report of  		the CAM Review<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup>  		canvassed a number of aspects of the RCI that had been found to be problematic  		and proposed revisions to some items of the RCI and in administration. The  		adequacy of the behavior item as an indicator of care needs associated with  		dementia and other behavioral problems was especially criticized. A trial of a  		revised RCI has been conducted and pending the outcome of analysis, a revised  		instrument will be implemented in 1992.</p>
<p>The RCI is the basis of the five level classification of resident  		dependency which replaced the two-tier system of "ordinary" and "extensive"  		nursing care. The hours of nursing and personal care and benefits paid for each  		RCI level are detailed in <a href="#tableI-E">Table I-E</a>. The amounts of  		benefit shown are national averages, as while payments are based on the  		standard hours shown for each RCI level, actual payments take account of  		differences in wage rates between the States.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is pertinent to note here that increases in subsidies for hostel care  		over the last five years have substantially reduced the gap between funding of  		hostels and nursing home care. In mid 1985, the highest level of hostel funding  		was equivalent to only 25% of the lowest level of nursing home benefit then  		paid (based on figures for New South Wales). As of mid 1991, the highest level  		of hostel subsidy amounted to 62% of the lowest nursing home benefit.</p>
<h3>Resident Characterisitcs and Use of Nursing Homes</h3>
<p>Information presented here on the characteristics of nursing home  		residents and their use of nursing homes is taken from material compiled for  		the third edition of <b>Nursing Homes for the Aged -- A Statistical  		Overview</b>. These data cover admissions to and separations from nursing homes  		from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990; data on residents are for those who were in  		nursing homes on June 30, 1990. Age 70 is used to define the base population  		for planning of residential care, data are compiled accordingly.</p>
<p><b><i>Demographic and Social Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p><i>Age, sex and marital status</i>--of the 70,987 residents in nursing  		homes at June 30 1990, 73W were women. New admissions have a somewhat age  		distribution than residents. of those newly admitted in the year to June 1990,  		14% were aged under 70 years, 30% were aged between 70 and 80 years, and 56%  		were aged 80 years and over; for residents, the proportions were 19%, 24% and  		64% respectively. Full details of age and sex are given in <a href="#tableI-F">Table I-F</a>. Some 53% of residents were widowed and only 25%  		were married; the proportion widowed varied from 27% for men to 62% for  		women.</p>

</tr></table><p><i>Living arrangements prior to admission</i>--Living arrangements prior  		to admission can be described in terms of the individual's accommodation and  		with whom they were living or family composition. In terms of accommodation,  		69% had lived in independent housing in the community, including some 7% who  		were living in self contained units in aged persons, housing projects. Another  		24% were in hostels and the remaining 7% in other forms of sheltered  		accommodation, mostly boarding houses.</p>
<p>There is great variety in family composition prior to admission. One  		third of residents had been living alone prior, 19% with their spouse only and  		some 22% had lived with various family members: only 3% involved spouse and  		other family, 14% involved children and 5% involved other relatives, mostly  		siblings. The remaining 25% lived with others than family. This last group  		largely corresponds with those living in hostels and other forms of sheltered  		accommodation, only a small proportion of whom would live with spouses or  		siblings.</p>
<p><i>Ethnicity</i>--The great majority of residents (77%) were born in  		Australia and another 12% were born in the UK or Ireland. The diversity of the  		overseas born population is seen in the 7% of residents with European  		birthplaces coming from more than 30 different countries.</p>
<p><i>Prior hospitalization</i>--Some 63% of all residents had been  		admitted to the nursing home from an acute hospital, with hospital admissions  		being slightly more common for men (67%) than for women (61%). A higher  		proportion of residents in government homes (70%) had been admitted from acute  		hospitals than had residents in private homes (65%) or voluntary homes (55%).  		These differences reflect different functions of government homes, and lead to  		different outcomes.</p>
<p><b><i>Dependency Profile</i></b></p>
<p>The dependency profile of residents can be described in terms of the  		proportions requiring care for ADLs and other areas, and by the distribution of  		overall dependency as measured by the RCI. The ADL and other items in the RCI  		are each scored at four levels of need for personal assistance: independent /  		no assistance; supervision only; some personal assistance / moderate or  		intermittent care / and full assistance / constant care. The proportion of  		residents requiring at least some personal assistance (scored in the higher two  		of the four responses on these RCI items) is set out in <a href="#tableI-G">Table I-G</a>.</p>
<p>Resident dependency is summarized in the distribution between RCI  		categories. Category 1, the highest dependency group, accounted for 6.6% of  		residents and Category 5, the lowest dependency group, for 11.1%. The full  		distribution is given in <a href="#tableI-G">Table I-G</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p>Patterns of length of stay and mode of discharge varied between sectors,  		reflecting their different functions. Differences in admissions from acute  		hospitals have been noted above. Government homes especially have shorter stays  		and more live discharges, in part reflecting their function as transits between  		acute care and long term care in a voluntary or private nursing home. Length of  		stay and discharges in voluntary homes reflect associations with other levels  		of care.</p>
<p>Investigation of outcomes of long term care will involve more detailed  		analysis of these patterns and also relationships to resident dependency.  		Further, the nursing home population now comprises three cohorts: residents  		admitted prior to the introduction of assessment and the RCI, those admitted  		over the period these measures were being introduced, and those admitted with  		both measures fully in place. As the two former groups exit, the nursing home  		population and patterns of use of nursing home care can be expected to change  		considerably and cohort analysis will be useful for both monitoring changes and  		modelling future trends.</p>
<p><b><i>Access</i></b></p>
<p>Several measures of access to nursing home care are available, and  		figures given in <a href="#tableI-I">Table I-I</a> for 1988 and 1990 show  		changes in access over this time. Access is most simply measured by the ratio  		of provision to population. More complex measures are given by turnover and an  		index of accessibility. Annual turnover, the number of residents admitted to  		the available beds in a year, commonly used as a measure of efficiency in other  		areas of health care and can usefully be applied in long term care. Another  		measure of access is the index of accessibility,<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> that relates admissions to the aged  		population from which admissions are drawn.</p>
<p>Access as measured by provision showed little change between 1988 and  		1990. The number of beds increased by only 0.7% and the ratio of provision per  		1000 aged 70 years and over decreased by 5%. The other measures of access show  		more pronounced changes. There were 35,713 admissions aged 70 years and over in  		the year to June 30, 1990, an increase of 28% over the number in 1988. The  		index of accessibility expresses the rate of admission from the population and  		so takes account of population growth; this index increased from 23.8 to 28.8.  		Third, the annual turnover rate for 1989-90 was 55.7%; this rate is an increase  		of 24% on turnover for 1988.</p>

</tr></table><p>The differences between these measures of access and provision  		demonstrate the need to have appropriate measures of outcomes. Changes in the  		various measures will provide different perspectives on outcomes of nursing  		home care as they reflect the impacts of assessment, changes in resident  		dependency and consequent reductions in length of stay. The use of different  		measures also has a number of implications for assessing the impact of expanded  		community care on access to nursing home care. In particular, simple measures  		of admission may be inadequate where the outcome of community care has been to  		delay admission and to reduce eventual length of stay; the effect of increased  		turnover and increased access may be that there are more rather than fewer  		admissions, an apparently contradictory outcome unless length of stay is taken  		into account.</p>
<h3>Policy Issues</h3>
<p>Current policy issues in nursing home care in Australia fall into two  		broad, but related, groups: the role of nursing home care in the overall aged  		care system and developments within the nursing home system to enhance its  		capacity to perform this role effectively. The immediate future will see a  		continuation of the reforms implemented as part of the Aged Care Reform  		Strategy over the last five years, and further changes in outcomes of long term  		residential care can be expected. Monitoring of these outcomes will provide  		important indicators of the effectiveness of different policy measures.</p>
<p><b><i>The Place of Nursing Home Care in the Balance of Care</i></b></p>
<p>The clearest indicator of the changing role of nursing homes vis-a-vis  		other modes of aged care is seen in trends in Commonwealth expenditure. Data in  		<a href="#tableI-J">Table I-J</a> show the substantial shift from residential  		care to community care that have been achieved from 1985-86 to 1990-91, and  		within residential care, the shift from nursing home to hostel care. The  		increase in total expenditure, 28% in real terms, compares to an increase of  		16% in the population aged 70 years and over and 25% in the population aged 80  		years and over for the five year period.</p>

In  		contrast, the increase for hostel care was 177%, the result of increased hostel  		provision, increases in subsidy levels and increases in the proportion of  		residents receiving care subsidies. The policy attention given to hostel care  		is evident in the expenditure on special services in hostels, including  		dementia care, which increased from less than $ 1m in 1985-86 to almost $ 43m  		five years later. The share of all expenditure going to hostels more than  		doubled, from just under 5% to just over 10%.</p>
<p>The very high growth of expenditure on Geriatric Assessment reflects the  		small base amount in 1985-86 and rapid expansion to achieve national coverage  		by 1990-91. Commonwealth expenditure on the Home and Community Care Program  		almost doubled, and this increase is extended by the matching expenditure of  		State Governments. In 1990-91, HACC accounted for 12% of Commonwealth  		expenditure; when combined Commonwealth and State expenditure on HACC is  		considered, HACC accounted for 21% of all government expenditure on aged  		care.</p>
<p>Policy for the remainder of the Aged Care Reform Strategy is being  		developed in a framework of the balance of care that will see continued  		restraint on the growth of nursing home care and the expansion of community  		care, especially support to carers. The role of hostels in the overall balance  		of care will be adjusted as expanded community care services, including the  		development of strategies such as case management, enable more dependent  		individuals to be supported in the community.</p>
<p><b><i>Outcomes of Nursing Home Care</i></b></p>
<p>Within nursing home care, policy is now focused on two main areas.  		First, assessment and revisions to the Resident Classification Instrument are  		aimed at targeting nursing home care for the most dependent individuals and  		ensuring that care services are allocated according to relative need. Further  		changes can be anticipated in the dependency profile of residents, and in  		patterns of utilization in terms of sources of admission, length of stay and  		mode of separation. Analysis of data from the RCI and other routine data on use  		of nursing homes have already contributed to policy development, and further  		applications will be required to monitoring continuing change. Changes in the  		resident dependency profile are expected in line with trends in demographic  		change and prevalence of handicap, the declining ratio of bed provision and  		other factors such as the proportion of admissions from acute hospitals.</p>
<p>Modelling of the effects of these factors is in progress and the  		implementation of the revised RCI in early 1992 will be closely monitored  		against predicted outcomes. Further, given the changing composition of the  		nursing home population in terms of past admission cohorts, cohort analysis has  		considerable potential in modelling likely future outcomes when combined with  		demographic data and information on changes in use of hostel care and community  		care.</p>
<p>The second focus of policy attention is improving standards of care, and  		as a means to this outcome, developing training for nursing home staff. The  		standards monitoring processes are generating data bases that will provide a  		rich source of information on outcomes, especially when combined with data on  		resident profiles and utilization patterns. The implications of increasing  		resident dependency, and possibly higher turnover, raise a number of questions  		for outcome standards and how outcomes can most appropriately be measured for a  		severely impaired resident population.</p>
<p>The need to address staff skills as a means to improving standards has  		been addressed by the Commonwealth with the establishment of the Training and  		Resource Centre for Residential Aged Care (TARCRAC) in 1990. This unit has been  		set up in the Queensland University of Technology and is developing training  		packages for nursing and personal care staff that are closely linked to the  		defined outcome standards. The Commonwealth has also commissioned a major study  		of the relationship between staffing mix and quality of care in nursing homes  		and sponsored a number of in-service training activities.</p>
<p>The nursing home workforce in Australia is divided into two main groups  		on the basis of level of training. Directors of Nursing and a proportion of  		other staff are registered nurses and professionally qualified therapists, and  		courses offering specialist training in gerontological nursing and aged care  		more generally have expanded considerably in recent years. The balance of the  		workforce comprises varying proportions of State Enrolled Nurses and nursing  		assistants or aides, with basic training varying depending on State  		requirements and the training opportunities available. A recent study in the  		State of Victoria<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup>  		found that about 45% of the nursing workforce are registered nurses and 55%  		have other levels of training.</p>
<p>That study was concerned with the effects of high staff turnover on  		quality of care. It was found that only 6% of the total nursing staff worked  		full time, and that turnover was 84% and 66% for the two years of the study,  		with turnover being lower for registered nurses. The study was carried out over  		1985-87, towards the end of several years of industrial action in the nursing  		profession in Australia and several aspects of the work environment of nursing  		homes were identified in which improvements might be made to increase staff  		satisfaction and retention, with benefits for resident care. Many of the  		findings of the Victorian study can be taken as typical of other States at the  		time. Monitoring of the impact of the training initiatives being implemented  		through TARCRAC and other educational activities will provide further  		information on outcomes of long term care and of the significance of staff  		skills to these outcomes.</p>
<p>The next few years can be expected to see the increasing applications of  		statistical and other data bases in monitoring outcomes of long term care in  		Australia. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be required to give a  		full account of outcomes for individual residents and for the nursing home  		system as a whole. The project for which this paper has been prepared, outcomes  		of Nursing Home Care, a part of the International Collaborating Effort on Aging  		sponsored by the National Centre for Health Statistics, provides a unique  		opportunity for Australia to gain from the exchange of information on the  		experience of other countries in these endeavors.</p>

<h3>The Canadian Context of Long Term Care</h3>
<p><b><i>Historical Perspective</i></b></p>
<p>From Confederation in 1867, and reconfirmed with the patriated Canadian  		Constitution in 1984, health care has been identified as the responsibility of  		the provinces, except those "special" groups such as the military, Native  		Canadians, and quarantine centers which were assigned to the Government of  		Canada. Voluntary agencies, both religious and fraternal as well as charitable,  		became involved with community and institutional health care during the  		nineteenth century. By the turn of the present century, some health services  		were being provided by industries and local municipalities. Following the  		Depression and World War II, the federal government began to stimulate medical  		training and acute care through training grants for physicians and grants to  		construct hospitals. In 1957 hospital care became universally insured and in  		1968 this was expanded to include physician services. In 1977 block funding  		provided more control to the provinces but was set into an already heavily  		medicalized system. By the 1970s, universally-insured  		hospital and medical services had provided all Canadians with access to these  		services when sick and eliminated pauperization consequent to  		illness.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a>, <a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Long term care, initially also mainly institutional, was either heavily  		medicalized or based on means tested eligibility in order for the provinces to  		secure some portions of the funding from the federal government.  		Community-based long term care has received very limited federal funding and  		its existence is less universal and uniform across the country than other forms  		of health care.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, the organization and delivery of health care  		was reappraised. The most serious problems were fragmentation, waste, and  		inefficiency. One result of this reappraisal was a series of provincial  		initiatives in the field of community care. As a consequence, between 1974 and  		1982, almost every province developed some community-based home care services.  		Over a longer span from 1972 to 1989, all but one province introduced some  		insured long term care capacity within nursing homes.</p>
<p>This process has led some provinces to a common assessment process being  		used across all sectors of long term care.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a>, <a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> The assessment is  		designed to establish types and amount of care required and the last step in  		the process is to determine the most appropriate location for that care. If the  		location decision is made first, it begins inappropriately to drive the whole  		system. What one needs to know is not whether the individual is eligible for  		nursing home care, but whether the individual needs a level of care equivalent  		to nursing home care, regardless of its source. Then one can look at the  		various potential sites at which this care can be provided and make the  		location decisions.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a>,  		<a href="#note25">25</a>, <a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In summary, health services are publicly insured in Canada. Each of the  		ten provinces retains autonomy in the delivery of health care and in developing  		health programs. The Government of Canada establishes certain minimum standards  		of health service provision as the basis for the federal share in funding  		health programs, but each province develops its own programs and may supplement  		the requisite core standards as is appropriate to its own jurisdiction.</p>
<p><b><i>Current Status</i></b></p>
<p>As in virtually all western jurisdictions, Manitoba and in Canada are  		attempting to restrict the use of more costly acute care personnel and  		facilities in favor of less costly long term care facilities and community care  		programs. In 1974 the capital planning goal for personal care home (or nursing  		home) beds in Manitoba was established as ninety per thousand population aged  		seventy and over. By 1986 this ratio had been realized. Since then construction  		has deliberately not kept pace with the growth in the older population. Based  		on a 1988 reassessment by the Extended Treatment Bed Review Committee of the  		use of long term care beds, the 1974 ratio was revised to 140 beds per thousand  		population aged eighty and over. This revised ratio, in part, reflects the  		change in orientation to support greater use of community-based care and, in  		part, the changing nature of personal care home residents. In 1973, the average  		age at entry to personal care homes was 68.9 years of age; by 198i the average  		age at entry was 84.3 years of age, and the average age has continued to  		increase.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a>, <a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In a milieu of fiscal responsibility and economic constraint,  		responsiveness to changing client needs will have to be accomplished through  		redirection of existing resources. As such, it will become more essential to  		assure adequate program staffing and to maintain direct service staffing  		flexibility. If the Manitoba Continuing Care Program has learned one thing  		through experience, it is that there are no savings realized by curtailing  		program staffing. Unrealistically large caseloads inhibit prompt assessment,  		slow down case reviews, mitigate against appropriate and timely reassessments,  		and preclude innovative solutions. They incur either client dependence through  		delays in withdrawing unneeded services or increased costs by employing easy  		solutions. This often means providing more costly services that are integral to  		the program even if personnel are overskilled for requisite tasks. Program  		staffing patterns must be adequate to this impending challenge or the more  		costly decision to institutionalize will prevail.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The full continuum of health and social services includes not only  		informal care, support services, home care, adult day care, respite care,  		nursing home care, chronic and rehabilitative institutional care, day  		hospitals, acute care, and care from physicians and other health professionals;  		but also, the broad spectrum of social services including pensions (or other  		income security measures), affordable housing, special interest groups, senior  		centers, older adult centers, senior educational programs, and all the  		age-integrated social programs. The most effective program models have easy  		access to any and all of these components, enabling solutions to be developed  		with the client and his or her support system, and to be changed or modified as  		required.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Policy Issues, Changes and Expected Outcomes</i></b></p>
<p>As noted earlier, the long term care bed to population ratio has been  		reduced; however, the question is whether the new ratio is the most  		appropriate. Should further reductions be introduced and if so what community  		resource should be in place to accommodate these reductions? Alternatively,  		should the ratio be increased to accommodate other system reductions such as  		acute care bed closures?</p>
<p>The assessment for home care and for placement in personal care homes  		has been conducted by the Continuing Care Program in Manitoba since 1974 from a  		community perspective. However, the administration of the nursing home program  		was housed within the institutional and insured sector of the Ministry with  		hospital and physician services until mid 1991. As such, long term care was not  		fully integrated. Similarly, until 1991, support services to seniors was  		administratively separate from both the nursing home and home care programs,  		producing further lack of integration. Policy and program development can be  		only partially successful without administrative integration. Therefore, the  		1991 administrative reorganization consolidated policy and program development,  		service delivery responsibility, and fiscal management across all the  		components of long term care and support services. With its separation from the  		more medicalized aspects of the Ministry, this fruition of a twenty-year  		integrative process assures the dominance of a social model in long term care.  		Of related interest is the inclusion of chronic hospital care and long term  		rehabilitation programs within the Continuing care Programs Division, hence  		demedicalizing these components as well.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a>, <a href="#note32">32</a>, <a href="#note33">33</a>,  		<a href="#note34">34</a>, <a href="#note35">35</a>, <a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are continuing concerns on the one hand about the degree of fiscal  		accountability by the community-based programs which still operate with manual  		information systems. On the other hand, there are concerns about maintaining  		the quality of care with an increasing aging population, bed reductions,  		staffing freezes, and the necessity to constrain costs of all government  		programs.</p>
<p>There is still limited agreement as to how one can ensure appropriate  		program planning and policy implementation when positive changes in one sector  		may create problems, even though unintentional, in another sector. For example,  		NFA (Not for Admission) cataract surgery has reduced the use of acute surgical  		beds. Hospitals see this change as positive due to reduced surgical waiting  		lists, even though hospital costs escalate as a result of more total surgical  		use. However, this NFA procedure has created greater demands for home nursing  		services post-surgically, which is an add-on cost to the community care sector  		and ultimately to the Ministry.</p>
<p>The long term care system continues to be challenged by the need to  		increase both the number of persons served and the units of service delivered  		without sacrificing the quality of care. Can further efficiencies be found to  		generate more funds for support services, adult day care and respite care, as  		opposed to supporting capital construction, additional beds, and home  		nursing?</p>
<p>Given the changing nature of personal care home residents and home care  		clients referred to previously, i.e., they are older, sicker, and more likely  		to be experiencing some form of cognitive impairment, can staffing ratios and  		mixes of staff be altered to meet these changing needs? If so, can these  		changes be accommodated within existing budgets?</p>
<p>Continued increases in the use of community care is the most widely  		expected policy outcome. Ever increasing reductions in acute, chronic, and long  		term care beds as reflected in the bed to population ratios is another commonly  		expected outcome of current policies and of fiscal constraint.</p>
<p><b><i>Relevant Demography</i></b></p>
<p>In 1986, 2.7 million Canadians and 0.1 million Manitobans were  		sixty-five years of age or older. They represented 10.7% of all Canadians and  		12.1% of all Manitobans. By 1991, the most recent decennial census year, the  		proportion of elderly persons in Canada and Manitoba increased to 11.6% and  		13.0% respectively. The rate of increase was greater in Canada than in  		Manitoba, as can be seen in <a href="#tableII-A">Table II-A</a>. Manitoba was  		already older than Canada as a whole.</p>

By contrast,  		the oldest old, i.e., those eighty-five years of age and over, constituted 9%  		of the Canadian and 10% of the Manitoban elderly population. While the  		oldest-old represent a very small portion (1%) of the total population and a  		relatively small proportion of the elderly population, they represent the  		fastest growing group in these populations.

<p>The total dependency ratios in Canada and in Manitoba have decreased  		markedly over the past thirty years.

During this time the aged dependency ratios  		increased only slightly; i.e., by 4.3 for all of Canada and by 4.6 in Manitoba.  		The slightly higher aged dependency in Manitoba coupled with its less marked  		decrease in youth dependency is further evidence of its older demographic  		structure in comparison to Canada as a whole.</p>

</tr></table><p>Projecting the populations of Canada and Manitoba into the early decades  		of the twenty-first century shows continued growth in the elderly cohorts. This  		growth is much greater for Canada than Manitoba based on the current higher  		percentage of elderly Manitobans as compared to Canada. In the case of  		Manitoba, projections are available only to 2011, which is just as the "baby  		boom" is beginning to reach age sixty-five. Their impact can be expected to be  		more noticeable from 2011 to 2031. The patterns in the shorter Manitoba  		projections demonstrate a modest rate of growth in the total older population  		(9.2%) and the youngest cohort of that population (9.1%), a slight decrease in  		the 75-84 year old cohort (-2.6%), and the greatest growth in the oldest cohort  		(43.7%). The impact of the "baby depression" from 1926 to 1945 is the obvious  		origin of these slow growth patterns as the elderly cohorts throughout these  		projection periods include essentially the small birth cohorts for the two  		decades prior to and during World War II. The impact of the "baby depression"  		is not as obvious in the longer projection periods of the Canadian projections.  		However, the impact of the "baby boom" cohorts reaching age sixty-five is also  		less dramatic in Canada than in the US and many other jurisdictions. The total  		population is only expected to grow by 8.4% but the elderly population is  		expected to grow by 97.8% by 2031. Within this overall growth, the youngest  		cohort (65-74 years) should grow by 62.8%, the middle cohort should double, and  		the greatest growth (113.7%) is expected among the oldest old. By 2031 the  		sixty-five and older population is projected to be almost one quarter of the  		total Canadian population.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Characteristics of Canadian Long Term Care  		Facilities</h3>
<p><b><i>Administrative Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>The Government of Canada establishes certain minimum standards of health  		services as the basis on which the federal share in funding health programs is  		allocated to the provinces. Because these are minimum standards, each province  		may develop its own programs supplementing these standards with services  		appropriate to its own jurisdiction. As a result of this arrangement, all but  		one province provided some facility-based long term care through the various  		provincial insured health services legislation by 1989, and most provinces also  		insure or directly fund some community-based long term care (i.e., home  		care).<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a>, <a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As with all facility-based care, licensing of long term care facilities  		is the responsibility of the provinces. All facilities which are covered by the  		insured services legislation must be licensed to provide care in order to  		receive funds from the provinces. Those facilities which do not receive funding  		as insured service care providers may require a license to operate a business,  		but such licenses are not the responsibility of the Ministers of  		Health.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a>, <a href="#note40">40</a>,  		<a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As a result of the great degree of provincial autonomy, the terminology  		used by long term care facilities across Canada varies considerably. In the  		majority of provinces the facilities are licensed as nursing homes, but other  		terms include homes for the aged, auxiliary hospitals, lodges, and personal  		care homes. For example, Manitoba uses the term personal care homes to include  		all those facilities which would have been certified in the US as skilled  		nursing facilities (SNFs) and intermediate care facilities (ICFs)  		where they are known as nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Based on the insured services legislation, each province has the  		authority not only to license nursing homes but also to monitor their  		compliance with the care standards. While the minimum standards are established  		by the federal government, the enforceable standards do vary considerably  		across the provinces, as does the rigor with which they are monitored and  		enforced.</p>
<p>For example, in Manitoba, each personal care home is monitored annually  		and the staffing ratio is established based on the aggregate levels of care  		required by the residents. These ratios are the key factor in determining the  		allocation of funds to the facilities. Departmental staff will also respond to  		complaints about care in any facility at any time throughout the year,  		therefore some facilities may be monitored more than once during the year. The  		personal care home administrators may also request a review of the care levels  		of the residents during the year if they believe that the aggregate level of  		care has increased sufficiently to warrant changes in the staffing ratios and  		hence in their budget allocation.</p>
<p>The variability across Canada is even greater among the noninsured  		facilities. These residences generally will require licenses which deal with  		compliance to fire safety, public health (i.e., food and sanitation), and tax  		standards, but do not address standards of care. The terms by which these  		residences are known are even more varied than those of the insured facilities.  		Some are known as adult foster homes (generally restricted to three or less  		residents), hostels, board and care homes, care homes, lodges, quest homes,  		homes for the aged, sheltered housing, and even occasionally as convalescent  		homes, chronic care homes, and (other than in Manitoba) personal care homes.  		Despite their names, these residences provide virtually no care beyond meals  		and minimal supervision. In 1986, there were 6,274 non-certified facilities, or  		7.8% of all residential care facilities in Canada. Most of these facilities  		tend to be relatively small but the total number of residents is not known as  		the data on occupancy are derived from voluntary reporting to Statistics  		Canada. In Manitoba in 1986, there were thirteen such facilities providing  		services to 297 residents, or about 3% of all those persons in any form of long  		term residential facility.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, all long term care in Canada was historically provided  		by the voluntary sector until the early 1900's. Gradually some local  		municipalities became involved as did some industries. The mix of public,  		voluntary and proprietary ownership varied from province to province. The vast  		majority of non-certified residential facilities across Canada, however, are  		proprietary; in Manitoba, all of the non-certified facilities are proprietary.  		In the case of insured facilities licensed to provide care in 1986, 45.3% of  		long term care facilities and 36.6% of the beds in Canada were proprietary, and  		these percentages had increased slightly to 45.9% and 38.4% respectively by  		1991. During the same period in Manitoba, the percentage of personal care homes  		which were proprietary decreased from 17.7% to 14.4%, and the proportion of  		beds also decreased from 29.7% to 27.6% between 1986 and 1991.</p>
<p><b><i>Functional Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>As noted in the previous section, the variability in long term care  		across Canada, as a result of the high degree of provincial autonomy coupled  		with the lack of specific Canadian national legislation, means that there is no  		single set of service standards for nursing homes in Canada. However, each  		province, either through legislation, regulation, or policy has service  		standards. The Standards of Service for Manitoba in 1991 are presented in  		<a href="#tableII-D">Table II-D</a> primarily for comparison with the US  		Standards and as background to the remainder of this section.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is possible, however, to identify the major services provided in  		nursing homes across Canada based on the reported annual number of hours worked  		by staff, which can be converted to equivalent full-time persons employed per  		service category. In the Canadian data, the comparison of certified and  		non-certified facilities highlights the paucity of professional staff,  		including nurses, in non-certified homes. A similar distinction is obvious in  		the Manitoba data for Level 1 only facilities, although the  		under-representation of Registered Nurses is not as marked as in the  		non-certified facilities. It should be recalled that all the Manitoba personal  		care homes are licensed or certified, but the Level I only personal care homes  		are somewhat similar to the national and US non-certified facilities, and are  		therefore presented separately in <a href="#tableII-E">Table II-E</a> to enable  		comparisons to be made with the national data.</p>

</tr></table><p>Because nursing home care is almost exclusively an insured service  		across Canada, assessment for admission is based on the need for care in a  		nursing home. These assessments are based on medical conditions to some extent,  		but concentrate on the applicant's functional capacity. Each province maintains  		its own assessment instrument. These instruments vary in detail, but are quite  		similar in broad categories. There have been numerous efforts to establish a  		single assessment instrument across Canada, but to date these efforts have been  		unsuccessful. Although the provinces share information with one another, no  		direct comparisons based on these assessments are possible.<sup><font><a href="#note43">43</a>, <a href="#note44">44</a>, <a href="#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In Manitoba, British Columbia, Quebec, and New Brunswick, the same  		assessment is undertaken with persons applying for long term care in the  		community (i.e., home care) or in the institutional sector. In addition to the  		functional capacity and medical conditions, virtually all provincial  		assessments include mental status as well as social and cultural components in  		the total assessment process. Each applicant is fully assessed for placement  		whether he or she is in an acute care hospital or in the community at the time  		of application for admission. Changes in, at least, functional capacity and  		mental status are reassessed as part of the annual monitoring  		process.<sup><font><a href="#note46">46</a>, <a href="#note47">47</a>, <a href="#note48">48</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="#tableII-F">Table II-F</a> shows that in 1988 (the only year  		for which data are available) almost all long term care residents required the  		assistance of another person to function. The measures used for these aggregate  		data were the Activities of Daily Living (ADL's). Again, it is obvious that the  		non-certified homes were providing a lighter level of care. They were providing  		assistance with ADL's, although seldom to the degree that professional  		supervision was required. The opposite distribution exists in the certified  		facilities where almost three-quarters of the residents required assistance to  		be provided under professional supervision.</p>

No data were available for Canada as a whole; however,  		relevant diagnostic data were available for Manitoba in both 1986 and 1991.  		<a href="#tableII-H">Table II-H</a> presents the total number of beds  		designated for use by, and the residents with, mental disorders. There was a  		moderate increase in residents with mental disorders from 1986 at 27.6% of all  		residents, to 1991 at 30.1%. Because a resident may have more than one relevant  		diagnosis, the total of diagnoses is greater than the number of residents with  		disorders. The change in the percent of residents with multiple diagnoses  		increased by less than one percent between 1986 and 1991. While both the  		percent of residents with diagnoses of dementia and other mental disorders  		remained virtually constant during this period, the percent diagnosed with  		depression increased markedly (20.7% to 28.9%, or a 39.6% increase), and  		those-diagnosed as psychotic decreased at about half that rate (19.2%).</p>
<p>The most relevant aspect of mental disorders to the care of residents is  		the existence of behavioral manifestations. From the Manitoba monitoring data  		available for 1986, 10.8% of residents evidenced sufficient behavior problems  		to require additional close supervision; that is, more supervision than is the  		basis for the usual staff ratios. It should be noted that with this behavioral  		measure, not all of the residents with a psychiatric diagnosis necessarily  		require more than the average care and supervision. In fact, about forty  		percent of the diagnosed residents require this additional close supervision.  		The monitoring data for i991 indicated 10.5% of residents and 34.9% of those  		with the relevant diagnoses sustained behavioral problems.</p>

</tr></table><p>Because of the small size of most non-certified facilities and the  		voluntary nature of the reporting of staffing patterns from these facilities,  		the employment numbers are too small to be reported reliably. Therefore,  		<a href="#tableII-I">Table II-I</a> identifies only the full-time equivalent  		employees per one hundred beds in certified facilities for Canada and Manitoba  		by occupation. As would be expected, the majority of full-time equivalent staff  		are nurses, with Registered Nurses far outnumbered by Nursing Assistants. The  		other major categories, in Manitoba and across Canada, are what are usually  		referred to as support staff; i.e., administration, dietary, and assorted  		others, as opposed to the other patient service staff such as therapists and  		activity staff. There is also very little variation within occupations or in  		total between Manitoba (total 68.3) and Canada (total 67.1). It may be useful  		to refer again to <a href="#tableII-D">Table II-D</a>, as the differential  		distribution in Registered Nurses is likely a result of the differences in  		standards relative to nursing services. These data pertain to 1988, the only  		year for which complete and comparable data are available.</p>
<p>In Canada in 1986 there were 212,566 beds in certified long term care  		facilities and 44,327 beds in non-certified facilities for a total of 95.2 beds  		per thousand population aged sixty-five and over. At the same time there were a  		total of 231,435 residents, or 85.7 residents per thousand population aged  		sixty-five and over. In comparing these ratios with those of other countries,  		it is important to recall that long term care facilities in Canada include not  		only nursing homes but also homes for the aged, chronic hospitals, long term  		rehabilitation centers, psychiatric centers, and an assortment of other service  		centers providing long term residential care. If the Canadian data are  		disaggregated to approximate only certified nursing home residents as defined  		in the US, the ratio becomes 63.1 residents per thousand population aged  		sixty-five and over.</p>

</tr></table><p>In the case of Manitoba, the latter ratio in 1986 was 66.4 residents per  		thousand population aged sixty-five and over and decreased to 61.0 per thousand  		population by 1991. The occupancy of personal care homes in Manitoba is  		approximately 99% and therefore the ratio of beds to the population is less  		than one per thousand more than the ratio of residents.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to note that the ratio of residents to population  		varies substantially according to the ages of the residents. For example, the  		Canadian ratio of residents per thousand population aged sixty-five and over  		was 85.7; however, the ratio for residents aged 65 to 74 was only 31.1 per  		thousand, while the ratio for residents aged 75 and over was 172.0 per  		thousand.</p>
<p>Access to nursing home care is not just a matter of beds per thousand  		population, it also relates to admission and discharges, or the flow of  		residents through the long term care system. Admission and separation data are  		not available for Canada, but the Manitoba data in <a href="#tableII-J">Table  		II-J</a> are instructive in several ways. First, because these data are  		available according to the levels of care, the differential admissions and  		separations by level and the resulting net change is striking, a fact which is  		masked in the summary statistics at the bottom of the table. The other  		important feature illustrates the effect of policy and program decisions to  		decrease admissions at lower levels, especially level one, as more supportive  		services have become available in the community between 1986 and 1991. There is  		also indirect evidence that the home care program continues to provide care at  		all levels in the community. Finally, there is ample evidence that Manitoba  		personal care homes are residents, homes, as opposed to being facilities which  		are used for post-hospital and rehabilitative care until the patient is able to  		return to the community, as is common practice in the US.</p>

</tr></table><p>In the Canadian health care system, as noted earlier, virtually all long  		term care is part of the publicly funded or insured benefit system, however,  		the non-certified residences are totally private pay in most provinces. Most  		provinces do require nursing home residents to pay some portion of the "hotel"  		costs of living in a care facility. These payments are generally based on the  		minimum (i.e., public) pension income available to the elderly population and  		not on the actual hotel costs. The goal of most provinces is to ensure that  		every resident retains approximately one hundred dollars per month for  		discretionary spending even if they are receiving only the minimum pension. Of  		course, those persons with larger incomes will have more discretionary income  		and, in some provinces, they may decide to pay a premium for a preferred room  		or enter a totally private pay facility, or may purchase additional services  		not provided in the insured benefits.</p>
<p>Therefore, the costs of long term care in Canada are costs to the health  		system; i.e., government expenditures. This can be seen in <a href="#tableII-K">Table II-K</a>. In both 1985 and 1989 the level of public  		expenditures (the first four rows in <a href="#tableII-K">Table II-K</a>)  		provided over 63% of the total sources of funds to nursing homes. The second  		largest source of funds was co-insurance and self-pay (i.e., "hotel" cost  		contributions) at approximately 30% as described above.</p>

</tr></table><p>In <a href="#tableII-L">Table II-L</a>, the costs of nursing home care  		is shown in the context of all health care expenditures for Canada, but in the  		context of long term care expenditures for Manitoba. In 1985, nursing home care  		in Canada accounted for 8.5% of all personal health care costs, while in 1990  		this had dropped to 7.6% of total expenditures. This occurred in spite of a one  		billion dollar increase in expenditures, or a 33% rate of increase, between  		1985 and 1990. The total expenditures increased to $52.9 billion, an increase  		of 49.9% during this same period. Despite a 66.7% increase in expenditure to  		$500 million in 1990, home health care represented only nine-tenths of one  		percent of all health care costs. Based on the Manitoba data, 80.4% of all long  		term care costs were expended in personal care homes in 1986. This proportion  		had dropped to 77.3% by 1991, but the $282 million expenditure represented a  		43.1% dollar increase from 1986. Unlike the national situation, home care  		increased by 68% from $25 million to $51 million from 1986 to 1991, and the  		related percent of all long term care expenditures also increased from 10.2% to  		14.0% during this time. Long term care costs represented about one-fifth of all  		Manitoba health care expenditures in 1991.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Policies, funding and services in long term care will continue to evolve  		and change over time. Having better, more complete and comprehensive data, and  		data which will be appropriate to producing accurate comparisons over time and  		are comparable across nations, will enable policy-makers and care providers to  		make better informed decisions. It is also useful to compare across  		jurisdictions within the same country which is often as difficult as  		cross-national comparisons. As further efficiencies and increased effectiveness  		is being demanded by consumers and funders alike, this project has demonstrated  		that common terminology or agreed upon definitions are essential and to some  		extent possible. Further work is required in meeting the challenges ahead for  		long term care and all health care as an aging world meets the twenty-first  		century.</p>
<h2><a name="Netherlands" id="Netherlands">III. LONG TERM NURSING HOME CARE IN THE  		NETHERLANDS</a><sup><font><a href="#note49">49</a></font></sup></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This paper describes the institutional arrangements for long-term care  		in the Netherlands. Its emphasis is on nursing homes since these institutions  		were the most important till the mid-eighties in taking care of the elderly who  		needed long-term care. The paper contains two parts.</p>
<p>In the first part a short overview of the Dutch health care system and  		some statistical data of the Netherlands are presented. After a short  		historical background most data concentrate on the year 1985 for reasons of  		international comparison.</p>
<p>The description of the health care system in the Netherlands is given to  		understand the place and function of the institutional long-term care  		facilities. Especially, data are presented about the arrangements for the  		elderly and the demographic development, since most institutional long-term  		care facilities have the elderly as clients.</p>
<p>In the second part of the paper the type of care, the characteristics of  		patients, the functioning of the long-term care system (nursing homes) and the  		outcomes are dealt with. In presenting the data on nursing homes a  		differentiation is made between somatic and  		psycho-somatic institutions because they represent different kinds  		of patients, staffing and outcomes.</p>
<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p>Long-term care has developed slowly as a professional, formal care  		provision after the Second World War. The initiative for nursing-home care was  		taken by private organizations, which were structured along religious,  		humanitarian principles (pillarisation). They were expanding their care for the  		poor, sick and disabled group members to include care for the elderly.</p>
<p>Two types of institutions were founded: homes for the elderly, which  		were primarily housing arrangements for the (poor) elderly, and nursing homes,  		which were medical facilities for disabled persons who did not need hospital  		care, but extensive nursing. Money came from private organizations and  		churches. The state (government did not have a specific task in this field. The  		management and control, financing and boarding were left to the private  		organizations. The only task of the state was to inspect the quality of  		care.</p>
<p>In the fifties the private organizations started to ask for  		support in financing the nursing homes. As a result the costs of stay for  		sickfund patients (an employee's health care insurance, income related) were  		reimbursed for a limited period. Long stay and privately insured patients had  		to pay the costs themselves or were dependent on charity. While the quality of  		care improved the stay in nursing homes became more expensive.</p>
<p>In the sixties the ideology of the providing state started  		to take over the major role of the private initiative. In the field  		of health care policy the role of the state was increasing as being responsible  		not only for the quality of health care, but also for the number and  		accessibility of facilities.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Homes</i></b></p>
<p>In 1968 long-term care in nursing homes came under the Exceptional  		Medical Expenses Act (AWBZ), i.e. the stay in nursing homes was completely  		reimbursed when the nursing home was recognized as a qualified nursing home.  		So, the stay was without costs for the patient, the quality of care was ensured  		and nursing homes (private, non-profit organizations) could invest in new  		facilities with the costs being reimbursed. It was not until the eighties that  		nursing home patients had to make an own financial contribution to their stay  		related to their income/financial situation.</p>
<p><b><i>Homes for the Elderly</i></b></p>
<p>For those elderly people who wanted to live in a home for the elderly,  		but could not afford it financially the General Assistance Law (ABW) reimbursed  		their costs of stay to the home for the elderly. In the early seventies it was  		concluded that this arrangement resulted in a disproportionately large burden  		in the costs of the ABW.</p>
<p>In the policy memorandum Nota Bejaardenbeleid in 1975 it was  		announced that the number of homes for the elderly had to be limited and should  		be related to the number of people of 65 years and over (the so-called 7%  		norm). In the beginning of the eighties it was concluded that this norm was not  		applied successfully, so in 1985 the provinces were instructed to plan the  		number of homes for the elderly according to the norm, which was  		now related to the number of persons of 75 years and over. The provinces were  		given budgets to realize this plan. It should be completed by 2001.</p>
<p>In 1977 each municipality had to assess the need for admission to a home  		for the elderly. A special committee, the so-called indication  		committee, was set up to make these assessments. Till 1985, however,  		homes for the elderly (private, non-profit organizations), were free to admit  		elderly persons regardless of the outcome of the assessment. This changed in  		1985; then homes for the elderly were only allowed to admit those elderly  		persons with a 'positive, assessment.</p>
<p><b><i>The Growth in Institutional Long-Term Care</i></b></p>
<p>In the beginning (unintentionally) stimulated by state policy, later  		despite limiting, policy measures the increase in the number of nursing home  		beds and places in homes for the elderly has been impressive (as have been the  		costs). In <a href="#tableIII-A">table III-A</a> this increase is  		demonstrated.</p>

<h3>The Care Delivery System in the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Care for the elderly and especially long-term care are closely related  		to the organization of the health care and welfare system in the Netherlands.  		So a short overview is needed of the relevant institutions, number of  		facilities and beds, and costs in health care. Subsequently, some specific data  		will be presented related to the care for the elderly.</p>
<p><b><i>A Description of the Health Service System</i></b></p>
<p>The Dutch health care system is a complex one. It can be characterized  		as a combination of elaborate government regulation and private delivery of  		health care services.<sup><font><a href="#note50">50</a></font></sup>  		Government regulations include health insurance covering specific health  		risks/services (Exceptional Medical Expenses Act), planning (e.g. intramural  		health care facilities are regulated by the Hospital Facilities Act) and  		prices, which are uniform throughout the country, but are composed and approved  		by an autonomous body: the Central Council for Health Care Charges (COTG).</p>
<p>The private delivery of services includes independent, entrepreneurial  		doctors, private non-profit hospital and nursing home organizations, profit and  		non-profit health insurance companies, non-profit district nursing  		organizations, entrepreneurial physiotherapists etc.. General practitioners,  		dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists and medical specialists are independent  		workers (entrepreneurs) running their own 'store'. Most GP's, dentists and  		pharmacists work alone. Medical specialists and physiotherapists are mostly  		working in partnerships, renting beds and equipment from hospitals. Hospitals,  		nursing homes, homes for the elderly and other institutions are in general  		private, non-profit enterprises. Nurses are employed by hospitals or by  		district nursing organizations; the same goes for home helpers and social  		workers.</p>
<p>Till the end of the eighties health service delivery was structured in  		echelons, ranking from preventive care to long-term care, from  		non-institutional to institutional care, from simplicity to complexity. The  		idea of echelons was developed in the beginning of the seventies.  		Each echelon was expected to fulfill specific tasks. Patients were to be  		referred to other echelons if these were better qualified to solve the problem.  		It was believed that this structure of health care would improve planning and  		control, and that in this way the system would be used more rationally. The  		echelons comprise:</p>
<p><i>Public health</i>--Including preventive activities such as  		vaccination, screening and health promotion, but also food inspection, hygiene  		etc. These services are carried out by regional or municipal (health)  		authorities. The services are offered to the whole population and financed from  		tax revenues (government).</p>
<p><i>Primary health care</i>--In this echelon activities are  		patient-oriented and for the most part directly focussed on care, though they  		may also include prevention. Core disciplines in this echelon are: general  		practice, district nursing and home care. However, social work organizations,  		homes for the elderly, practices of physiotherapists and community service  		centers are also part of this echelon. In general, access to these services is  		free, although in some cases an assessment of the need for care is required. A  		financial contribution for some of these specific services was demanded from  		the patient. The services of district nursing and home help services are  		compensated by the Exceptional medical Expenses Act (AWBZ), an insurance scheme  		for the whole population financed from public means.</p>
<p><i>Secondary health care</i>--Activities here are concentrated on  		specialized patient care. This specialized care may include outpatient and  		in-patient services. Theoretically access is only possible through referral by  		the general practitioner. This echelon includes (mental) hospitals, medical  		specialists and ambulatory services. The services are financed by health  		insurance funds (sickfunds or private health insurance companies).</p>
<p><i>Tertiary Health care</i>--This includes nursing homes and long-term  		health care facilities. These institutions and services are sometimes  		considered as belonging to the second echelon, or even in a position between  		the first and second echelon. However, it should be understood that there is no  		hierarchical order of hospitals and nursing homes. General practitioners may  		refer patients directly to a nursing home. These services are compensated by  		the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (AWBZ).</p>
<p>The numbers of main health care facilities (divided over these echelons)  		are presented below. As far as possible the numbers relate to 1000 inhabitants;  		the year on which the data are based is also mentioned.</p>

</tr></table><p>As far as the health care system is financed through patient insurances  		there are four different ways.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Some general and exceptional medical expenses are financed by the  			 Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (AWBZ). On the one hand this includes, for  			 example, district nursing and on the other hand it covers expensive long-term  			 care like nursing homes and psychiatric hospital care. The scheme is financed  			 from compulsory employers, and employees, income-related premiums. The act  			 covers the whole population. In 1987 the costs were 9.9 billion Dutch  			 guilders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees below a certain income level (compulsory) and other lower  			 income groups are (compulsory) insured by Health Insurance Funds (Sickfunds),  			 private non-profit (social) insurance companies. The money is provided by  			 compulsory employers, and employees, premiums, which are mainly income-related.  			 General practitioners receive an annually fixed amount for each patient  			 registered in their practice. Care is provided free. For secondary care,  			 annually fixed fees for services are paid by the Sickfunds to medical  			 specialists and hospitals. These health insurance funds cover about two third  			 of the population. In 1987 the costs amounted to 15.9 billion Dutch  			 guilders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher income groups are insured by private (profit) health  			 insurance companies. In general, the privately insured patient will pay a fee  			 to the general practitioner. Other care is reimbursed by the insurance  			 companies (fixed national rates). Insurance by private companies covers about  			 30% of the population. The total cost in 1987 amounted to 7.4 billion Dutch  			 guilders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance for persons in the public services is statutory for civil  			 servants employed by provincial and municipal authorities. The premium is  			 mainly income-related. Arrangements vary, but are very similar to those of  			 private insurance companies. About 6% of the population is insured in this way.  			 In 1987 the total cost was 1.4 billion Dutch guilders.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The annual rates are negotiated between medical care professionals and  		insurance companies/sickfunds and must be approved by the COTG (see above)  		whose members are appointed by the Government, employers, and employees,  		organizations, insurance companies and organizations of health care  		professionals. Premiums are adjusted to these rates. Another council (Sickfund  		Council, ZFR) decides which activities (diagnostic procedures, types of  		treatment, drugs etc.) are covered by health insurance; they do not fix prices,  		which is the task of the COTG. A third body (National Hospital Facilities  		Board) advises on (the planning of) the number of hospitals/nursing homes and  		the number of beds. Provincial Health Councils should make regional health  		plans (regionalisation and decentralization), but prove to be less  		influential.</p>
<p>The National Council for Public Health (composed of members from all  		relevant national associations and of independent experts) advises the  		Government on all issues concerning health (care) policy. The Health Council is  		a council which advises the Government on the state of the art of  		specific medical developments (e.g. on liver transplantation, breast cancer  		screening).</p>
<p><b><i>Data on Facilities and Costs of Care for the Elderly</i></b></p>
<p>While we are concentrating on long-term and institutional care, it  		should be kept in mind that the majority of elderly persons live independently,  		as can be seen from the overview.<sup><font><a href="#note51">51</a></font></sup> In 1982 about 13% of elderly people were in  		institutions. These data are cross-sectional. The proportion of those ever  		experiencing a stay in a home for the elderly or a nursing home is  		substantially higher, +35%.<sup><font><a href="#note52">52</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>By sheltered housing (<a href="#tableIII-D">Table III-D</a>) is meant  		adapted housing for the elderly. This may include architectural (no stairs  		etc.) and service (alarm, services nearby etc.) adaptation. Most of these  		sheltered houses are especially designed for the elderly. By (formal) care for  		elderly living independently at home or in sheltered houses is meant care by  		home help or community nurse.</p>
<p><a href="#tableIII-D">Table III-D</a> shows the balance of expenditure  		on costs of care for the elderly between institutional and community services.  		In the calculation of these costs a correction was made for the proportion of  		users younger than 65 years. Spending is unevenly distributed over community  		and institutional care. Large budgets are spent on institutional facilities.  		These are almost four times higher than the total budget spent on community  		care. The ratio of community care: institutional care did not change between  		1975 and 1985.</p>
<p>Within community care, district nursing and community mental-health care  		(including a special section for elderly people) have received relatively  		larger budgets, while there has been a decrease in expenditure for general  		practitioners. Within institutional care there has been a relative increase in  		the nursing-home budget (psycho-geriatric nursing homes), while less is now  		spent on mental hospitals. The proportion spent on other services, including  		home help, has remained unchanged. The relatively high spending on  		institutional care operates as an incentive for policy-makers to stimulate and  		explore possibilities of substitution.</p>

<p>As to mortality it is expected that the negative influences (like  		socioeconomic differences, environmental factors etc.) will not outweigh the  		positive influences (like medical technology, nutrition, hygiene etc.). Life  		expectancy at birth will continue to increase from 73.6 in 1986/1987 to 75  		years in 2010 for men, and from 80.2 (1986/1987) to 81.5 (2010) for women.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Nursing Homes and Their Patients</h3>
<p>In the seventies several studies were carried out on the characteristics  		of the nursing home population, their adaptation to institutional life, their  		contacts with the outside world and the quality of their lives and of the care.  		These studies are based on small-scale samples including 2 to 6 nursing  		homes.</p>
<p>However, nationally based data are available through a national  		registration system on numbers and characteristics (like age, ADL, living  		situation, diagnoses) of patients at admission and at discharge per year.  		Besides the numbers and characteristics are measured on a specific  		date in each year. 83% of all nursing homes are supplying these data to the  		national registration system (SIVIS).<sup><font><a href="#note55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Administrative Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>As mentioned above, since 1967 nursing homes are financed by the  		Exceptional medical Expenses Act (AWBZ) (nationally based; premiums are paid by  		% of salaries). As shown in <a href="#tableIII-A">table III-A</a> this  		financing system allowed for a strong growth in the number of nursing homes.  		After permission to build a nursing home (based on norms and criteria about  		size, staff etc.) all costs are in fact reimbursed by the bed price. The  		allowance to build or renovate a nursing home (and getting financed by the  		AWBZ) is a weak way of certification.</p>
<p>As indicated before, all nursing homes are organized on a non-profit  		base; most of them are private foundations as are homes for the elderly.</p>
<p>Until recently patients admitted to a nursing home did not need to spend  		any of their own money (in contrast with the homes for the elderly). Since  		1990, however, a contribution in the costs of staying in a nursing home is  		required. This contribution is income-related.</p>
<p>The central government puts forward criteria for the number of beds,  		staff, equipment, capacity etc. The planning of nursing homes is a task of the  		provinces.</p>
<p>In 1990 the bed norms were reviewed. Now the norm is based  		on 0.08% of the total population + 5% of all people aged 75 years and over in  		the province. At least 2.9% (as part of the 5%) is reserved for psychogeriatric  		patients. (In the big cities a slightly different norm is used;  		i.e. 6% and 3.5% psychogeriatry).</p>
<p><b><i>Numbers and Functional Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>In the Netherlands in 1985 there were 328 nursing homes. The total  		number of beds (including 1 October beds) was 49,252; that is 3.4 beds per 1000  		inhabitants and 28 per 1000 persons of 65 years and older. As mentioned before  		there is no formal assessment procedure for admission. However, the government  		intends to develop a common assessment system for nursing homes and homes for  		the elderly (see below).</p>
<p>The so-called '1 October beds' are located in homes for the elderly;  		their total is 808; their number is decreasing and the special rule is ended in  		1991. Without the '1 October beds' the <b>average</b> number of beds was 48,863  		in 1985. The occupancy rate was 97.9%. The division among 'type' of nursing  		home is as presented in <a href="#tableIII-J">table III-J</a>.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Homes for the Elderly and Their  		Inhabitants</h3>
<p><b><i>Administrative Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>As was explained in the 'historical background', in 1977 the government  		set criteria (norm) for the number of places in homes for the elderly: 7% of  		all persons aged 65 years and over. By that time the percentage of elderly  		people living in a home for the elderly was higher. Together with this norm it  		was 'compulsory that the needs of older persons who wished to be admitted to  		homes for the elderly, should be assessed by a specific committee (which must  		at least include a physician and a social worker). In each region a so-called  		indication committee, was set up. The homes for the elderly were expected not  		to admit elderly persons without an indication'. At the same time, however,  		until 1985 they were free to choose among the elderly who were seen by the  		committee (with or without indication).</p>
<p><b><i>Numbers and Functional Criteria</i></b></p>
<p>By the end of 1985 the maximum capacity in homes for the aged was  		149,000 'places'; 92% of this maximum was used. So, the total number of older  		people living in a home for the elderly by the end of 1985 was 137,527 (of  		which 136,238 were 65 and over). The majority of residents are women  		(74%).<sup><font><a href="#note56">56</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Of all people of 65 years and over 7.7% lived in homes for the aged;  		nearly 5% of the men and 9.5% of the women 65 years and over. In 1985 23,861  		persons entered a home for the elderly; 24,775 residents left. Newly admitted  		residents came mostly from home or hospital.</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>Outcomes</i></b></p>
<p>The majority of residents leaving the home for the elderly in 1985  		(24,775) were deceased (79%; 19,477 persons). Of those residents who left the  		homes for the elderly alive (5,298) 14% went back to their own home (or  		family), 19% went to another home for the elderly, 62% was admitted to a  		nursing home and 5% into a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p><b><i>Personnel and Costs</i></b></p>
<p>Altogether about 74,000 people were employed in homes for the aged. In  		full-time equivalent (fte) the number of employees was 52,649 in 1985; 54% is  		nursing and caring personnel; 46% is not. </p>
<p>The total expenditure was 4.416 billion Dutch guilders. The residents  		contributed 1,800,000.-, whereas 2,200,000.- were government subsidies (General  		Assistance Law).</p>
<p>In the Dutch welfare system the cost of living in a home for the elderly  		(on average 3,000 guilders a month in 1990 for persons living alone and 4,500  		for couples) are paid to the institutions by the municipal authorities under  		the State Pension Act (AOW) and supplemented by the provincial authorities or  		by the elderly persons themselves, if their capital exceeds 48,000 guilders  		(1990) or if they own substantial property like e.g. houses.<sup><font><a href="#note57">57</a></font></sup> People in a home for the  		elderly receive a monthly allowance under the General Assistance Act (ABW) (268  		guilders per month for those living alone, 464 for couples in 1990). Moreover,  		people can request additional financial support in case of an emergency or  		special problems. The vast majority of those living in homes for the elderly  		were (and are) supported by the General Assistance Act.</p>
<h3>Developments Since 1985</h3>
<p>As explained before the emphasis in this paper is on the situation as it  		was around 1985.</p>
<p>Since then, however, the ideas on the organization of health care and  		the role of institutional care as well as financing long-term care have been  		discussed extensively.</p>
<p>Innovations in care were proposed and are being introduced gradually.  		The most important ones are mentioned briefly: - in 1987 a committee (the  		so-called Dekker committee) published a restructuring of the health care  		system. This plan was followed by a policy memorandum in 1989, in which the  		basic ideas on restructuring put forward by the Dekker committee were worked  		out.</p>
<p>I.e. the health care system should be seen as a market system with three  		parties: the health-insurance-companies (responsible for offering  		care packages to their clients and negotiating with care-providers and  		professionals on the content and price of the services), the 'care-providers'  		or professionals (who have to offer their services in clearly  		defined functions) and 'clients' (who are entitled to care and must be accepted  		by the insurer they choose).</p>
<p>All services are covered under one law which specifies the basic  		services to be included and the premiums to be paid by the clients. These  		premiums are income-related and serve as a financial basis (through a qualified  		budget system) for insurance companies. In addition, each client has to pay a  		nominal premium and has the possibility of taking an own risk, on services not  		in the basic insurance.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Community long-term care (replacing nursing home care, enabling a  			 shorter stay in the hospital and preventing admission to homes for the elderly)  			 is strongly promoted by experiments and so-called substitution projects. As a  			 result of these policy intentions the cooperation between home help services  			 and community nursing services is intensified and has resulted in one new  			 organization of community care (excluding the general physician).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the cooperation between homes for the elderly and nursing  			 homes is stimulated. It is proposed that they develop (maybe together with the  			 community care organization) a common assessment system and use the same  			 financial rules for clients, contributions to the costs of their stay  			 (income-related).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Results of evaluation research on these innovations are available. It is  		expected that in 1992 and 1993 a more unified system will be realized.</p>
<h2><a name="Norway" id="Norway">IV. INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS OF LONG TERM CARE:  		NORWAY AND THE SCANDINAVIAN SOLUTIONS</a><sup><font><a href="#note58">58</a></font></sup></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This part is primarily about Norway. To broaden the perspective,  		however, the two other Scandinavian countries -- Denmark and Sweden -- to some  		extent will be taken into consideration. The organization, financing and  		functioning of the health and social services is <b>basically</b> similar in  		these three countries. The system has been called "The Scandinavian Model of  		Welfare".<sup><font><a href="#note59">59</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are also interesting differences of course, -- not least in goals,  		structure, level and current development of services in long term care. Broadly  		speaking, the Norwegian LTC system places itself somewhere in between the quite  		radical Danish and more traditional Swedish solutions. On the other hand, there  		are how strong tendencies of convergence between the LTC systems of the three  		countries.<sup><font><a href="#note60">60</a></font></sup> So in the  		following analysis, Norway with its 4,2 million people is representing a median  		case in Scandinavia between Sweden (8,5 millions) and Denmark (5,1  		millions).</p>
<p>In the presentation I will comment briefly on issues where Norway  		deviates <b>markedly</b> from one or both of its neighbours. A short,  		systematic summary of comparisons between the three LTC systems is given in the  		final section titled A final note on Denmark and Sweden.</p>
<p><b><i>The Basic Political-Administrative Context of the LTC  		System</i></b></p>
<p>In order to understand the development and current state of the LTC  		system in Norway and Scandinavia, one has to be aware of some basic  		characteristics of the political-administrative apparatus in which it is  		embedded.</p>
<p>The LTC-system is part of a comparatively large <b>public sector</b>.  		Approximately only 15% of the volume of Norwegian LTC services for the elderly  		has been provided by voluntary (i.e. religious and humanitarian) organizations  		in the 1980s.<sup><font><a href="#note61">61</a></font></sup> The  		voluntary sector, however, is part of public health care plans and almost  		completely financed through public sources. A private (profit) sector is almost  		non-existent due to lack of a market for this kind of service provision.</p>
<p>This orientation towards public welfare solutions have long historical  		traditions. It can be traced back to late middle ages  		(legdeordningen), was renewed through the revised Poor Law  		legislation at the turn of this century and got a modern form through the  		development of the public welfare programmes after the second the world  		war.<sup><font><a href="#note62">62</a></font></sup> These programmes  		were built up under the leadership of continuous social democratic governments  		up to 1965 -- supported in all basic issues by the other major political  		parties.</p>
<p>The public sector in Norway is <b>mostly</b> tax-financed with indirect  		taxes (e.g. value added tax) being the dominating single source of income to  		the public economy. Almost half the national product is redistributed to the  		citizens through the public sector. Of this, about half goes to funding the  		health and welfare services including a national pension system and other kinds  		of social security. The elderly are without any comparison the largest consumer  		group of the public sector expenditure, with a total consumption equal to 9  		billion USD -- or 13 000 USD per person 65+ -- in 1985. Of this, 45% was  		services (including hospital services) and the rest pension  		expenditures.<sup><font><a href="#note63">63</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The public sector is managed through <b>three levels of government</b>,  		with separate political and administrative bodies and separate tax-income:  		national, county and local (municipal) level. The social security system is run  		nationally, the hospital system by the counties, and primary health and social  		care -- including all kinds of community and institutional LTC -- at the local  		level. There are 19 counties with a population of 220000 inhabitants on  		average, and 450 municipalities with a mean of 9000 per unit. The range of the  		municipalities is large, however, from 500 to 500000 people, with a median of  		only 4000 people.</p>
<p>The result of this administrative structure is a comparatively  		<b>decentralized</b> LTC system with <b>small units</b> in the hands of local  		authorities responsible to small -- and often scattered -- populations. For  		instance, the average size of a nursing home was 42 beds in 1990.<sup><font><a href="#note64">64</a></font></sup></p>
<p>National government is sharing the cost of services given on county and  		municipal level. The total amount of resources transferred from national to  		county and municipal level counts for 30-50% of total budgets on these levels.  		From 1980 the sharing has gradually shifted from a fixed part varying from  		25-75% of the different services to <b>block grants</b> given from national  		government to the lower levels of administration based on criteria of "need" --  		in practice mostly population criteria.</p>
<p>From 1986 these block grants have been given to counties and  		municipalities as <b>one net sum</b> to cover the national grant to <b>all</b>  		kinds of public services (education, roads, health etc.) to the lower levels of  		administration. In this process the Danes have been the earliest and most  		radical, while the Swedes -- due to a more centralized and bureaucratic  		tradition -- are still in the early stages. County or Municipal Councils in  		Norway now independently decide how resources should be divided between the  		kind of services they have the responsibility for giving. To illustrate the  		current situation, it can be mentioned that at municipal level about 49% of  		total budgets have been spent on health and social services the last years, 26%  		on primary schools.<sup><font><a href="#note65">65</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Demographic Data</h3>
<p>Norway has had a rapid growth of its total population of elderly in the  		period 1955-1990. The number almost exactly doubled, from 347800 to 690900.  		From now on, it will diminish a little, as seen from <a href="#tableIV-A">Table  		IV-A</a>. This is due to small birth cohorts in the period of economic  		depression and war-time (1925-45). The "baby-boom" with large birth cohorts  		from the period 1945-70 will lead to a rapid rise again of the total population  		of elderly after 2010.</p>
<p>The number of the oldest old (85+) -- most likely in need of LTC -- show  		another pattern. It will continue to grow until about 2005, representing large  		birth cohorts in the decades between the turn of the century and the economic  		depression. Then the number diminishes for a couple of decades and rise again  		-- reflecting depression and war with the following baby-boom as described  		above.</p>

It  		can be seen from the table that the proportion of elderly counts for most of  		these differences over time.</p>
<p>The life expectancy in Norway was 72,6 years for men and 79,4 years for  		women in 1985. It is now 73,3 years for men and 79,9 years for women. It is  		expected to rise to 75,0 and 81,6 years respectively in the year 2010.</p>
<p>The demographic data shown here differs a little between the  		Scandinavian countries. Denmark has a little bit younger population, Sweden an  		older one compared to Norway. In spite of this different starting points the  		patterns of further development as seen form population projections are quite  		similar.<sup><font><a href="#note66">66</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Evolution of Long Term Care in Norway</h3>
<p>The evolution of modern Norwegian LTC services is described here using a  		time frame covering shifting trends in national policies. These policies have  		been highly incremental. And when new goals have been set, they have been  		fairly global. This is also the case with policy measures. By and large, the  		repertoire of measures mostly has consisted of shifting general administrative  		and/or financial frameworks for the provision of services. A more detailed  		analysis of these processes is given by the author elsewhere.<sup><font><a href="#note67">67</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In the following analysis, data from two sources are used. There are,  		first, simple administrative data gathered on a national base and edited by the  		Central Bureau of Statistics since 1970. Recently, these data have been  		refined, combined with other national statistics and tabulated in a time series  		form by the Norwegian Institute of Gerontology.<sup><font><a href="#note68">68</a></font></sup> Second, there are data from improved routine  		data collection in long term institutional care, also made by the Central  		Bureau of Statistics, since 1990.<sup><font><a href="#note69">69</a></font></sup></p>
<p>LTC services for the elderly in Norway have two parts</p>
<ul><li>Institutions:
<ul><li>Nursing homes</li>
<li>Homes for the aged</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Community care:
<ul><li>Sheltered housing</li>
<li>Home help</li>
<li>Home nursing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Community care includes medical services, but they are both provided to  		and used by the general population, and therefore not included here.</p>
<p>Traditionally, nursing homes have functionally and legally been  		classified as medical institutions, mostly coming under health authorities.  		Homes for the aged have been social institutions, offering a common household  		with 24 hour staffing for people not able to live in their own homes, but not  		in need of continuous medical or nursing services. However, in many communities  		the two sorts of institutions are combined in one building.</p>
<p><b><i>1955-1970: Doubling of Institutions, Establishing a  		Structure</i></b></p>
<p>When public discussions over a LTC policy in a modern sense started --  		around 1955 -- there were LTC institutions for the elderly in almost every  		municipality, which also owned and ran 70% of them. A limited community care  		existed at that time, too, with religious and other voluntary organizations  		responsible for this activity.</p>
<p>As a consequence of pressure group activity,<sup><font><a href="#note70">70</a></font></sup> central government authorities  		were involved in setting standards for both the quality and the quantity of LTC  		institutions at the end of the 1950s. Regulations to be followed by the local  		authorities were adopted. Central government also adopted financial incentives  		to expand the institutional LTC sector in the municipalities rapidly. A ratio  		of provision of 7 nursing home beds per 100 70+ (in many European countries  		called "the seven per cent rule") was set up as a goal in this period. At the  		end of the 1960s central government also launched programmes to be carried out  		by local authorities to establish more comprehensive community care for the  		elderly, based on home help, home nursing services and sheltered housing.</p>

</tr></table><p>As a result of these national policy initiatives, a number of new LTC  		institutions were built. The number of beds almost doubled before 1970 (<a href="#tableIV-B">Table  		IV-B</a>), and the ratio of provision for both types of institutions rose from  		a total of 51 to 63 per 1000 65+. The basic structure of the main components in  		the care for the elderly (including community care) was laid down. The  		voluntary sector was far outnumbered by the public sector, because all growth  		in services from now on took place here.</p>
<p><b><i>1970-1980: Centralizing, Medicalizing, Expanding</i></b></p>
<p>As a result of major changes in the <b>hospital</b> sector in the late  		sixties,<sup><font><a href="#note71">71</a></font></sup> the  		administrative and financial structure of institutional LTC also changed. In  		1970, the responsibility for running <b>nursing homes</b> was moved to the  		county level. Nursing homes were to be run together with the hospital sector.  		In this sense, parts of the institutional LTC system were obviously centralized  		and "medicalized" in this period.</p>
<p>Political authorities made these changes hoping to solve both problems  		of quality and of funding a planned major expansion of the nursing home  		sector.<sup><font><a href="#note72">72</a></font></sup> Public funds  		for institutional health care were still quite abundant at that time, larger  		and less in a squeeze than scarce municipal budgets.</p>
<p>The homes for the aged, together with all community care were left to  		the municipalities. With the exception of the homes for the aged, 50 to 75% of  		the cost for the different services was covered by central government grants at  		that time.</p>
<p>The LTC system changed considerably through these years. As seen from  		<a href="#tableIV-B">Table IV-B</a>, the number of beds in the homes for the  		aged fell, while the number of nursing home beds doubled. The net result was  		expansion of institutional LTC, with a changed balance: from 0,75 to 1,9  		nursing home beds per bed in the homes for the aged. A new -- and stable --  		level of provision of institutional LTC was reached: 44-45 nursing home beds  		and 23-24 beds in homes for the aged per 1000 65+. This level has persisted  		until now.</p>
<p>There was also a considerable expansion of community services, as  		indicated by the figures in <a href="#tableIV-C">Table IV-C</a>.</p>
<p>In a period of ten years then, the LTC services changed from a system  		dominated by locally run homes for the aged to a system on a higher level of  		provision, based on a medically oriented nursing home sector run on a county  		level, and newly developed home care services run by the municipalities,  		supplemented by a diminishing volume of homes for the aged.</p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>1980-1990: Resource Constraints, Reorganization and Rethinking  		Service Ideologies</b></i></p>
<p>Since the end of the 1970s, the volume of services closely kept pace  		with a less rapid aging of the population. Hence, the level of provision of the  		total LTC services has been almost stable. The only exception is the home  		nursing service which central government continued to stimulate by reimbursing  		75% of the costs until-1984.</p>
<p>In this period, Norway -- as well as Sweden and Denmark -- experienced  		constraints in public expenditure which lead to a search for more  		cost-effective solutions in the whole public sector, as well as in health and  		social services, including LTC.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, health and social services have been reorganized according  		to the principles of decentralization and of primary care in the community as a  		base for all other services.<sup><font><a href="#note73">73</a></font></sup> The division of labour and financial  		relations between levels of government in this reorganized system of welfare  		has been explained in the introduction of this paper.</p>
<p>The process of reorganization was not completed for the LTC sector until  		1988, when the responsibility for running nursing homes were transferred back  		to the municipalities. From that time, local authorities have had the total  		responsibility for <b>all</b> LTC services in the country: nursing homes, homes  		for the aged, sheltered housing, home help, home nursing etc. -- partly  		financed by general block grants from central government and partly by local  		taxation.</p>
<p>It is proposed that this administrative and financial framework  		establishes the right incentives for the local authorities to run services with  		a maximum of flexibility and effectivity. In this process, elements of the care  		for the elderly in Denmark have been taken as a model for renewing the ideology  		of the Norwegian LTC system: these include less emphasis on a medical  		orientation, more emphasis on the residential aspects of LTC, shifting the  		balance of resource allocation heavily towards community care.<sup><font><a href="#note74">74</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As these reforms have been prepared and set into action during the 1980s  		the development of the LTC sector in the period can be summarized in the  		following way:</p>
<ul><li>a diminishing growth of resources is more and more channeled to  		  community care</li>
<li>nursing homes are being used in new and different ways, with more of  		  their capacity transferred to rehabilitation, respite care, terminal care and  		  to the care of patients with dementia</li>
<li>at an organizational and practical level nursing homes are integrated  		  with the community care</li>
<li>service flats (sheltered housing with the possibility of community  		  care day and night) partly seem to become an inheritor of nursing homes in the  		  LTC system</li>
<li>community care is increasingly based on 24 hour services, more  		  professionalized and distributed according to stricter priority of  		  needs.<sup><font><a href="#note75">75</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>A striking feature is the remarkable increase of discharges from nursing  		homes. This point is taken up further in section F of this paper.</p>
<p><b><i>Main Changes in Institutional LTC Characteristics Over  		Time</i></b></p>
<p>During the whole period from 1955 to 1990, more than the structure,  		volume, administrative arrangements and ideology of the LTC sector have  		changed. Comparable surveys from 1953, 1966 and 1990 also show changes in  		aspects of the quality of care. For instance, the proportion of single rooms  		expanded and staffing increased dramatically. The use of LTC institutions also  		changed, indicated by the age structure of the institutional LTC population.  		Figures illustrating some of these changes are summarised in  		<a href="#tableIV-D">Table IV-D</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p>All Norwegian nursing homes offer medical services and skilled nursing  		services. In addition, more than 90% offer physical therapy, occupational  		therapy, chiropody and hairdressing, while 80% have bank and post  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note81">81</a></font></sup> 96% of the  		homes for the aged reports to have regular medical services, 61% to offer  		physical therapy, 18% occupational therapy, 90% chiropody, 89% hairdressing and  		78% bank and post services.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the institutions are small, with an average of 42  		beds per unit, ranging from 7 to 200 beds. Nursing homes more and more are  		connected to the services offered in community care -- from the late 1980s  		often as one administrative unit. This relationship is reflected in the  		proportion of admissions directly from the community, which was 72% in 1990.  		The rest are mainly from acute hospitals.<sup><font><a href="#note82">82</a></font></sup></p>
<p>An admission team consisting of a representative from the home nursing  		services, the physician (usually a general practitioner connected to the  		nursing home) and the director of the nursing home, and other representatives  		from the local health and social services make decisions for admission.  		Decisions are made on an ad hoc base, using no formal pre-admission  		assessments. The team tries to find the best total solution in each case,  		looking to all resources available in the local service system. The home  		nursing team member is reported to have the strongest influence on the final  		decisions. This is also judged as an advantage, as she will have the best  		information available concerning the total situation of the patient and of the  		informal care resources.<sup><font><a href="#note83">83</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Decisions not accepted by the elderly or their families can be appealed  		to a central government health authority representative in the area. To prevent  		the admission team causing bed blocking in acute hospitals, it has been  		proposed to have municipalities pay for patients who have finished their  		treatment in acute hospitals and who are waiting for transfer to a nursing  		home. Up to now, these problems have been considered minor and no action in  		this direction has been taken. Directors of nursing homes mostly report on good  		cooperation with acute hospitals on these and other matters.<sup><font><a href="#note84">84</a></font></sup></p>

<p>According to improved routine statistics from the last years, the  		purpose of stay at admission for the total nursing home population in the  		middle of January 1990 was as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Rehabilitation: 8%</li>
<li>Respite care: 14%</li>
<li>Permanent care: 77%</li>
<li>Other: 2%</li>
</ul><p>Although a large majority of the residents are admitted for permanent  		stays permanently, a substantial proportion also have intermediate stays for  		rehabilitation and respite care. This proportion has increased during the  		years, as reflected in the numbers of discharges.</p>
<p>As seen from <a href="#tableIV-K">Table IV-K</a>, there were about 70000  		discharges from approximately 30000 beds in 1990. Of these, 70% were live  		discharges. Of the residents discharged alive in 1990, 82% went back to the  		community, and 12% to another institution, mainly a home for the aged or a  		local hospital.</p>

</tr></table><p>From the table it is also evident that the number of total discharges  		has more than doubled in the period 1974-1988 and that the proportion of live  		discharges increased from 53 to 71% in the same period.</p>
<p>These figures are both indicators of a developmental dynamic of the  		whole LTC system and a more conscious shift in the use of the nursing home  		segment, towards more rehabilitation and respite care.</p>
<p>As institutional LTC was developed before sufficient community services  		are available, admission cohorts will shift in their characteristics and length  		of stay over time. Residents gradually will shift from the relatively young old  		permanent stayers from the first phase of institutional development to the  		relatively old old and shorter stayers of today. In addition, more use of  		nursing home resources for rehabilitation and respite purposes lead to an  		increasing turnover rate and expanding proportion of live discharges.</p>
<p><b><i>A Local Area Study</i></b></p>
<p>As there is a lack of national data, some preliminary figures from a  		local area study will be presented here to illustrate some of these points  		about nursing home discharges in the Norwegian LTC system.</p>
<p>The study is being conducted by the author and is a longitudinal  		population study from a coastal town in southern Norway. The whole population  		80+ as at January 1981, altogether 434 persons, was followed over 10 years. As  		of October 1991 385 were deceased. Courses of disability, health services  		utilization and family caregiving have been studied prospectively and  		retrospectively, from the first episode of permanent dependency until death. In  		the period 1981-1991, the level of provision for nursing homes in this town has  		been 15 % higher than the average for the country. In all other aspects, its  		LTC system is fairly representative-and typical for Norway.<sup><font><a href="#note85">85</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In this study population, 5% have died at home, 25% in the local acute  		hospital, 67% in the nursing home and 3% in the home for the aged. There has  		been a range from 0 to 6 nursing home stays before death, but more than two  		stays are very rare (8%).</p>
<p><a href="#tableIV-L">Table IV-L</a> shows the length of nursing home  		stays in this population. From the table, it can be seen that there tends to be  		three groups of nursing home stays: short stays for respite and rehabilitation  		purposes (the high proportion of live discharges after with a short length of  		stay), short stays for terminal care (approx. 30% discharged dead before 3  		months) and long permanent stays ending with death (more than 50% discharged  		dead after more than one year). Further analysis has shown a <b>period  		effect</b> behind this pattern: corrected for age, sex, ADL-limitations etc.  		the probability for becoming a long permanent stayer was much larger in the  		1970s than in the late 1980s.<sup><font><a href="#note86">86</a></font></sup></p>

<h3>A Final Note on Denmark and Sweden</h3>
<p>Concerning <b>strucure</b>, Denmark for a long time has placed the  		responsibility for all LTC services -- including its institutional part -- on  		the local (municipal) level. State fundings were <b>equal</b> for all parts of  		LTC (50%) until the change into a block grant system as early as 1975. LTC  		institutions legally have been social institutions. Today, Denmark has the  		lowest level of institutional LTC and the highest level of community LTC among  		the Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>Until this year Sweden had a structure of LTC with many similarities to  		Norway in the 1970s: Nursing homes and home nurses (and in addition: geriatric  		wards in hospitals) were administered at on county level, and other LTC  		services on local level. Now the nursing homes have moved down to local  		(municipal) level, but still they are (as in Norway) considered medical  		institutions. The old system of partly state funding for services, according to  		<b>different percentages</b>, survives. Today, Sweden has the highest level of  		institutional LTC in Scandinavia. At the same time, the level of community care  		almost as high as in Denmark.</p>
<p>Altogether Sweden uses the most economic resources in services per  		elderly person. The amount was equal to USD 5 200 in 1985. Denmark used 10%  		less, Norway 20% less, at that time.</p>
<p>Concerning current development, Denmark is reducing its (already small)  		institutional LTC further. On the other hand, the level of sheltered housing  		with extensive community care is expanding, as in all Scandinavian countries.  		Sweden is moving towards a general reduction of its high service level, in  		combination with converting more resources into sheltered housing. In addition,  		there are some radical experiments with other, community care-oriented  		LTC-systems in Sweden, e.g. the "Huddiksvall" model.<sup><font><a href="#note87">87</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The distinct profiles of LTC in Scandinavia are now rapidly changing.  		Their present structure and service level are the results of administrative,  		financial and professional traditions from the nineteen sixties and seventies.  		Now they are becoming more alike as a consequence of convergence of  		administrative and financial structures and philosophy of care during the last  		years. Generally, the Danish system is considered the most successful seen both  		from a users perspective and in terms of economic efficiency. It has both  		higher quality (measured as continuity, quality of personnel, freedom of choice  		and access to services for users) and lower costs than the Swedish and the  		Norwegian system. However, data show that differences in quality and costs  		<b>within</b> each country may be much larger than these differences on a  		national level.<sup><font><a href="#note88">88</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="US1" id="US1">V. THE FOCUS ON LONG TERM CARE IN THE UNITED STATES:  		NURSING HOME CARE</a><sup><font><a href="#note89">89</a></font></sup></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This paper is an overview of long term care (LTC) in the United States  		(US). It concentrates on nursing home care because of the institutional  		emphasis of LTC in the US. It is intended as context to the research on nursing  		home outcomes which is part of the International Collaborative Effort on  		Aging.<sup><font><a href="#note90">90</a>, <a href="#note91">91</a></font></sup> The paper provides an overview of nursing  		home care in the US in relation to:</p>
<ul><li>history and evolution of LTC,</li>
<li>the current LTC system, including policy concerns, and</li>
<li>characteristics of certified nursing homes, including administrative  		  and functional criteria.</li>
</ul><p>It also presents demographic data on the elderly population who are at  		the highest risk of needing LTC.</p>
<p>Because the research on nursing home outcomes of the International  		Collaborative Effort on Aging focuses on nursing homes providing the highest  		level of skilled care, this overview concentrates on nursing homes certified  		for Medicaid and Medicare. Data on non-certified homes is provided for  		comparison purposes. The year 1985 serves as a focal point because, when the  		research was initiated, it was the only year for which data were available for  		all countries included in the comparative analysis.</p>
<h3>History and Evolution of Long Term Care</h3>
<p>Historically, most formal LTC in the US was delivered in institutions  		with the generic label of "nursing home." In 1954, at the time of the first  		survey on nursing homes, there were 9000 nursing homes in the US that provided  		skilled care. Eighty-six percent of them were proprietary-owned.<sup><font><a href="#note92">92</a></font></sup> Major growth in nursing homes beds began  		after the passage of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965. Both pieces of legislation  		provided benefits for nursing home care in skilled and/or intermediate fare  		facilities. Rapid growth followed in the next decade, so that by the early  		1970s, there were over 1 million beds. Growth leveled off and by 1985 there  		were 1.6 million beds in about 19,000 nursing homes. The majority of nursing  		homes were proprietary-owned (70 percent) and were certified by Medicaid or  		Medicare (75 percent).<sup><font><a href="#note93">93</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Growth of nursing home beds kept pace with the growth of the elderly  		population. Since 1973-74, the number of nursing home residents per 1000  		persons 65 years and older has remained at about 45. The risk that an elderly  		person will enter a nursing home anytime during his or her life is considerably  		higher than this cross sectional rate of 45 per 1000. If rates of use remain  		the same, a person who is 65 in 1990 has a 40-45 percent chance of using a  		nursing home before death.<sup><font><a href="#note94">94</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Overview of the Current LTC system</h3>
<p>Although over 80 federal programs assist persons with LTC  		needs,<sup><font><a href="#note95">95</a></font></sup> no one program  		offers an full array of LTC services on a systematic basis. When LTC  		expenditures are considered, major federal programs are Medicaid and Medicare.  		These programs have an institutional bias, i.e., nursing home care is the most  		available LTC benefit in relation to program expenditures and program  		qualifications for receipt of care.<sup><font><a href="#note96">96</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid and Medicare Benefits</i></b></p>
<p>The Medicaid program provides nursing home benefits to some, but not  		all, low income elderly. Generally, they must have incomes below the federally  		established poverty level which in 1989 was $5947 for a single elderly  		individual and $7503 for an elderly couple. Medicaid also has several  		provisions to allow states to provide LTC to other groups of elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note97">97</a></font></sup> One optional provision allows  		states to cover the medically needy, who are persons who meet the non-financial  		standards for Medicaid but who exceed its income or resource requirements. Each  		state establishes its standard for defining the medically needy, so that  		standards differ from state to state. Some elderly may also deplete their  		resources on medical bills, "spend-down" to the state-established standard for  		the medically needy, and become eligible for Medicaid.<sup><font><a href="#note98">98</a></font></sup> Medicaid is a joint federal-state program.  		There is on average a 50-50 sharing of the costs between the two levels of  		government. From 1965 to 1990, Medicaid had two levels of nursing care: skilled  		and intermediate. <b>Skilled</b> care was legislatively defined as services for  		persons who needed on a daily basis skilled nursing care or rehabilitation  		which as a practical matter could only be provided on an inpatient basis  		(Social Security Act, 1905f). <b>Intermediate</b> care consisted of health care  		services to persons who do not require skilled or hospital care, but require  		care above the level of room and board (Social Security Act, 1905c). Many  		states had developed special assessments to determine who needed skilled versus  		intermediate care. Care is paid for prospectively in a flat monthly rate. The  		states established the rates. Generally, rates were higher for skilled than for  		intermediate care. Medicaid is a major payor of nursing home care in the US.  		About half of all residents in 1985 used Medicaid as their primary source of  		payment.<sup><font><a href="#note99">99</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Medicare is a health insurance program for most (98 percent) persons 65  		years and older. It mainly provides benefits for acute care--hospital and  		physician services. Elderly are eligible for Medicare benefits in nursing homes  		if they have had a hospital stay and have acute care needs for rehabilitation.  		The <b>actual</b> cost of care, rather then a flat rate, is paid by the federal  		government within established ceilings. Although nursing home care is limited  		to a stay of 100 days, most stays are less than a month. Nursing homes  		participating in Medicare were called skilled nursing homes from the 1970's to  		1990. Medicare provides benefits to very few nursing home resident. About 2  		percent used it as their primary source of payment in 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note100">100</a></font></sup></p>
<p>For nursing home care under both Medicare and Medicaid, the federal  		government sets the care standards and the states conduct the inspections of  		the nursing homes. Prior to 1990, the standards were more stringent for  		Medicare than for Medicaid. After that time, legislation made the standards  		identical.</p>
<p><b><i>Linkage to Home Care and Hospital Care</i></b></p>
<p>Both Medicaid and Medicare have benefits for home health care (see  		<a href="#US2">chapter 6</a>), but the programs are limited. In 1989, national  		expenditures for nursing home care were 12 times greater than for home health  		care. The differential in spending was the greatest for Medicaid. In 1989,  		Medicaid spend nearly 7 times more on nursing home care than did  		Medicare.<sup><font><a href="#note101">101</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The elderly are the greatest users of acute care hospitals in the US.  		Hospital discharges in 1985 were 295 per 1000 population aged 65-74 and 477 per  		1000 aged 75 and over. The average stay for those 65 and over was 8.7  		days.<sup><font><a href="#note102">102</a></font></sup> In the US,  		there is a substantial flow between acute care hospitals and nursing homes. In  		1985, 39 percent of nursing home residents were admitted from the hospital.  		Furthermore, of all live nursing home discharges, 49 percent were discharged to  		the hospital. The flow between hospitals and nursing homes has increased  		significantly since 1977. At that time, only 32 percent of residents were  		admitted from hospitals, and only 41 percent of live discharges were discharged  		to the hospital. The increased flow from 1977 to 1985 often is attributed to  		implementation of a prospective payment policy to control the cost of hospital  		care.<sup><font><a href="#note103">103</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Impact of Prospective Payment for Hospital Care</i></b></p>
<p>Legislation passed in 1983 (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of  		1983) established a prospective payment system for Medicare coverage of  		inpatient hospital operating costs. Costs were based on a fixed amount,  		determined in advance, for each case, according to one of over 460 diagnosis  		related groups (DRGs) into which a case is classified. The system categorizes  		discharges by the DRGs which are based on: patient diagnosis, patient age,  		treatment procedure, discharge status and sex. Because the cost is fixed  		regardless of the length of stay, some have argued that hospitals have an  		incentive to reduced their lengths of stay by discharging patients to  		LTC.<sup><font><a href="#note104">104</a>, <a href="#note105">105</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Others have argued that the reduction in length of hospital stay results  		in the transfer to nursing homes of residents who are sicker.<sup><font><a href="#note106">106</a></font></sup> Data from 1985 support this  		view. Nursing home residents admitted from hospitals were sicker in that they  		were more dependent in ADL's then were their 1977 counterparts.<sup><font><a href="#note107">107</a></font></sup> Thus, prospective payment  		legislation as implemented through DRG's has impacted on nursing home care by  		increasing not only admission rates from hospitals but also the need for  		skilled care and sub-acute recuperative care.</p>
<p><b><i>Impact of National Health Planning Policy</i></b></p>
<p>Growth of the number of nursing home beds began to slow in the early  		1970's because of a national policy intended to control costs of health care  		through health planning. The National Health Planning and Resources Development  		Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-641) charged health planning agencies at state and  		sub-state levels with major new responsibilities in planning for health care  		delivery. One tool provided the planning agencies was the review and approval  		of new institutional health services and facilities through state certificate  		of need (CON) programs. Each state was required to administer a CON program to  		insure that only those services, facilities and organizations found to be  		needed were to be offered or developed in the state. A primary emphasis of  		review was hospital beds and nursing home beds. It was felt that once this type  		of bed was built, it was likely to be filled. This, in turn, put pressure on  		health care costs.<sup><font><a href="#note108">108</a></font></sup>  		In the case of nursing home beds, in particular, it was felt that holding down  		the number of new beds would limit the increase in Medicaid costs, since  		Medicaid pays for a high proportion of the nursing home population.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Reagan Administration in 1981, it was felt that  		the health planning approach involved too much federal government regulation.  		Improved competition--reliance on market forces--was seen as a better approach  		to restrain costs. Consequently, federal government support for health planning  		and CON was phased out in the early 1980's. Many states, however, decided to  		continue with their own CON programs.<sup><font><a href="#note109">109</a></font></sup> In part, this was often because of an  		increased desire to restrain growth in nursing home beds so as to lessen the  		demand for expanded Medicaid spending for LTC.</p>
<p><b><i>Policy Concerns</i></b></p>
<p>This section identifies some critical policy concerns in LTC: financing,  		impoverishment of tome elderly, quality of nursing home care, and bias toward  		institutional care. It concentrates on policy-making through national  		legislation, with an emphasis on the legislation of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The underlying policy concern in LTC is financing; who should pay? More  		specifically, what is the appropriate mix of LTC expenditures from public  		welfare and entitlement programs, national and state governments, private  		insurance, and the elderly themselves? Although these questions have been  		discussed and analyzed in detail,<sup><font><a href="#note110">110</a></font></sup> no national consensus exists on the  		answers. During the 1980s, about 50 percent of the nation's expenditures for  		nursing home care were paid by Medicaid,<sup><font><a href="#note111">111</a></font></sup> a welfare program for those poor who meet  		certain standards established by the national government. Other provisions  		allow states to provide LTC to other groups of elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note112">112</a></font></sup> Medicaid is funded jointly be national and  		state governments. In 1985, the elderly paid for 44 percent of the nation's  		nursing home expenditures from their own resources. Other sources paid small  		amounts of the expenditures. Private insurance paid for nearly 3 percent.  		Medicare, an entitlement program covering mainly acute health care for the  		elderly and disabled, paid for 2 percent. About 60 percent of all government  		costs was paid by the national government, and the remainder was paid by state  		and local governments.<sup><font><a href="#note113">113</a></font></sup> Government costs for nursing home care are  		difficult to control because Medicaid is an entitlement program, available to  		all those poor who meet established standards. Because the oldest-old are the  		greatest users of nursing home care and their numbers are growing rapidly, the  		demand for nursing home care is projected to increase. If Medicaid continues to  		cover about 50 percent of the nation's nursing home expenditures as it has  		through 1993,<sup><font><a href="#note114">114</a></font></sup> this  		increased demand will place even greater strains on national and state  		budgets.</p>
<p>A policy concern related to the question of financing is the  		impoverishment of some elderly due to the costs of a long nursing home stay.  		Elderly with long stays can be impoverished to such an extent that they become  		eligible for Medicaid. The average monthly cost of nursing home care is  		expensive; in 1985 it was $2,100 for Medicare residents and $1,5000 for  		Medicaid residents.<sup><font><a href="#note115">115</a></font></sup>  		Stays can be long. About 26 percent of all nursing home discharges in 1985 had  		stays of 1 year or longer.<sup><font><a href="#note116">116</a></font></sup> The expense combined with a long stay can  		result in catastrophic costs that wipe-out life-time savings and other assets.  		About 60 percent of nursing home residents on January 1, 1987 relied on  		Medicaid as their primary source of payment. Nearly all the rest relied on  		their own personal resources. As of the same date, about 11 percent of the  		residents met eligibility requirements for Medicaid because they had  		"spent-down" their assets during their stay.<sup><font><a href="#note117">117</a></font></sup> Some argue that the figure of 11 percent  		of the elderly who become impoverished by catastrophic costs of nursing home  		care is an under-estimate. This is because the figure on asset spend-down is  		based on survey data which does not collect information about all previous  		nursing home stays of the resident. Thus, residents impoverished by a previous  		nursing home stay would not be classified as spending-down assets to become  		eligible for Medicaid.<sup><font><a href="#note118">118</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most elderly do not have insurance for LTC. Very little private health  		insurance was offered for LTC, but this began changing in 1987. As of June  		1990, about 1.7 million LTC insurance policies had been sold, compared to  		815,000 in December 1987.<sup><font><a href="#note119">119</a></font></sup> Some see LTC insurance as economically  		feasible only for middle and upper income elderly because of the  		cost.<sup><font><a href="#note120">120</a></font></sup> Older persons  		need to be educated about their risk of needing LTC, its catastrophic costs,  		and the general lack of funding from Medicare or their own acute care insurance  		policies to cover LTC costs. Otherwise, the elderly incorrectly assume that  		they have LTC coverage and do not purchase LTC insurance.<sup><font><a href="#note121">121</a>, <a href="#note122">122</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A third policy concern is the quality of nursing home care. Although  		legislation for Medicare and Medicaid was passed in 1965, the legal standards  		for nursing home participation in these programs were not developed until 1974.  		At issue in the delay was setting the Medicaid standard for intermediate care  		facilities low enough so that some of the existing homes would qualify. Setting  		low standards was essential to assure that the poor elderly in existing nursing  		homes would qualify for Medicaid benefits. Poor elderly, although eligible for  		Medicaid, could not receive benefits unless they were residents in a  		Medicaid-certified nursing home. As a consequence, the 1974 standards had  		limited impact on the quality of care.<sup><font><a href="#note123">123</a></font></sup> During the early 1980's, concern over  		quality intensified. In 1985, Congress commissioned the Institute of Medicine  		to make recommendations for strengthening the government standards for nursing  		homes to participate in Medicare and Medicaid and, thereby, improve the quality  		of care. Based on their recommendations, Congress passed legislation in 1987 to  		improve the quality of care by (a) creating one level of nursing home care (a  		nursing facility) rather than the two levels of skilled and intermediate care  		and (b) requiring a standardized assessment and care plan to be developed and  		maintained for each resident. The legislation was effective in October 1990.  		The legislative changes are such that the quality of care is expected to  		improve over time.<sup><font><a href="#note124">124</a></font></sup>  		The impact these changes have on quality is being assessed currently.</p>
<p>Another policy concern is the bias in the US towards institutional LTC.  		Although US policy creates a bias toward institutional LTC, the preference of  		the elderly and their families are for maintaining independence by receiving  		LTC in the home or the community. About 95 percent of elderly who needed LTC  		and lived in the community in 1982 indicated that they would like to stay out  		of a nursing home as long as possible.<sup><font><a href="#note125">125</a></font></sup> The costs to the tax payer for  		institutional care are high at $35 billion in 1985 and $49 billion in 1989. In  		the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA), section 2176 established  		waivers which gave states the flexibility of substituting state-funded home  		health care in place of nursing home care. However, approval of waiver requests  		was judged by some as limited.<sup><font><a href="#note126">126</a></font></sup> In the 1987 OBRA, states were given waiver  		authority to provide home and community based care to persons at risk of a  		nursing home admission on a budget neutral basis. States were limited to an  		annual overall maximum seven percent growth rate for all LTC  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note127">127</a></font></sup> During  		the 1980's, use of home care and associated expenditures increased by over 400  		percent. Nevertheless, nursing home care still remained as the predominant mode  		of formal LTC in the US. In 1989, for example, national expenditures for  		nursing home care were 600 percent greater than for home health care.<sup><font><a href="#note128">128</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There were attempts in Congress in the late 1980's and early 1990's to  		mitigate the institutional bias. Various bills proposed LTC benefits as an  		entitlement, covered disabled persons of all ages, and emphasized home care.  		Congress has passed legislation which takes some modest steps in this  		direction. Under Medicaid amendments included in the 1990 OBRA, states may opt,  		as part of their Medicaid program, to offer home and community based care to  		functionally disabled elderly eligible for Medicaid. A more comprehensive set  		of recommendations for a home and community based LTC entitlement program were  		developed by a bipartisan Congressional Commission.<sup><font><a href="#note129">129</a></font></sup> To date, none of the many  		bills introduced in Congress to mitigate the institutional bias have passed.  		There are two major reasons for lack of LTC legislation. One, such legislation  		leads to significant increases in public expenditures at a time of budget  		deficits and negative reaction of voters to increased taxes. Two, there is a  		lack of a national consensus on the underlying policy concern of LTC: what is  		the appropriate mix of LTC expenditures from public welfare and entitlement  		programs, national and state governments, private insurance, and the elderly  		through their own resources?</p>
<h3>Potential Users of LTC: Demographic Data</h3>
<p><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p>
<p>People who need LTC are so disabled by physical or mental conditions  		that they do not have the capacity for self care. Disability, regardless of the  		age at onset, is so severe that they need the help or supervision of another  		person in performing activities of daily living (ADL's). ADL's include bathing,  		dressing, eating, using the toilet, and transferring from bed to chair. Many of  		the persons who need LTC are elderly. The oldest of the old, those aged 85 and  		older, are at the highest risk.<sup><font><a href="#note130">130</a></font></sup> They are also the highest users of nursing  		home care at 220 per 1000 elderly in 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note131">131</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Wiener, Hanley, Clark, and Van Nostrand<sup><font><a href="#note132">132</a></font></sup> estimate that the elderly population who  		need LTC because they require the help of another person with at least one ADL  		was about 2.3 million persons in 1987. A higher estimate using an ADL criterion  		of greater disability was developed by the Pepper Commission<sup><font><a href="#note133">133</a></font></sup> based on a micro-simulation  		model developed by the staff of The Brookings Institution and ICF,  		Incorporated.<sup><font><a href="#note134">134</a></font></sup> In  		1990 about 3.3 million elderly needed LTC because they required the help of  		another with three of five ADL's or required substantial supervision due to  		cognitive impairments or disruptive behavior.<sup><font><a href="#note135">135</a></font></sup> These severely disabled elderly account  		for about 11 percent of all older persons.</p>
<p>This section presents demographic data about the elderly, the age group  		with the highest risk of needing LTC. It presents data about the distribution  		of the elderly in the population, support ratios, and population  		projections.</p>
<p><b><i>The Elderly Population</i></b></p>
<p>In 1985, there were 28.5 million persons aged 65 and older. They  		comprised nearly 12 percent of the resident population. In 1990, the latest  		year of the decennial census, the number of elderly rose to over 31.0 million  		and they comprised 12.5 percent of the population.<sup><font><a href="#note136">136</a>, <a href="#note137">137</a>, <a href="#note138">138</a></font></sup> (See <a href="#tableV-A">Table  		V-A</a>.)</p>

This drop was due to the decrease in the support ratio for children  		which fell from 65, to 42 per 100.

The greatest  		growth is projected for two subgroups of the elderly--the young-old and the  		oldest-old. Both subgroups are projected to increase 105 percent. The increase  		for the young-old is due to the aging of the "baby boom" cohort. This large  		cohort, born in the decade after World War II, will reach age 65 around  		2010-2020. Growth of the subgroup 75-84 years, although not as great, at 88  		percent, will still be significant.

</tr></table><h3>Characteristics of Certified Nursing Homes in the  		US</h3>
<p><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p>
<p>This section describes the characteristics of certified nursing homes in  		the U.S. according to administrative and functional criteria. The emphasis is  		on nursing homes certified for Medicaid and Medicare because the research on  		nursing home outcomes of the International Collaborative Effort on Aging  		focuses on nursing homes providing the highest level of skilled care. Data on  		non-certified homes is provided for comparison purposes. The source of data for  		this analysis is the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). The 1985 NNHS  		was a national sample survey of all nursing homes in the U.S. with 3 or more  		beds.<sup><font><a href="#note140">140</a></font></sup> In addition  		to collecting data about the characteristics, staff, and expenditures of the  		facility, the 1985 NNHS also collected data from national samples of current  		residents and discharges. Response rates for facility, resident and discharge  		samples were over 95 percent. Data about residents and discharges were  		collected by interviewing the member of the nursing staff most familiar with  		care provided to that person. The nurse referred to the medical record when  		responding. The sampling for the 1985 NNHS was a stratified probability design.  		Data were weighted to produce national estimates.</p>
<p><b><i>Administrative Criteria</i></b></p>
<p><i>Jurisdiction, Certification, and Licensing</i></p>
<p>Jurisdiction and certification described here focus on the situation  		prior to the recent legislative changes implemented in late 1990. This time  		frame is used because it corresponds to that of the available data from the  		National Nursing Home Survey.</p>
<p>The federal government, through legislation and regulation, sets the  		conditions (or standards) of participation for certified nursing homes. In  		1985, participating nursing homes included skilled nursing facilities (SNF's)  		certified under either Medicare or Medicaid and intermediate care facilities  		(ICF's) certified under Medicaid. (In late 1990, the distinction between SNF's  		and ICF's was dropped and all certified homes now are called nursing  		facilities.)</p>
<p>In 1985, some nursing homes could have been dually certified in that  		they provided both skilled and intermediate care in all parts of the facility.  		Others were certified as distinct part facilities in that they provided skilled  		care in one part of the facility and intermediate care in another, separately  		designated, part. Given dual certification, it is the status of the resident  		which determines if the bed is being used to provide skilled or intermediate  		care and, therefore, at what amount the home is reimbursed for providing care.  		The health criteria the resident must meet to be eligible for skilled care  		differ from that for intermediate care.</p>
<p>In each state, an agency uses the federally-determined conditions (or  		standards) of participation to inspect a nursing home to determine whether it  		is eligible to participate in Medicare or Medicaid as a SNF and whether it is  		eligible to participate in Medicaid as an ICF. The conditions of participation  		have standards for many areas, such as complying with federal, state and local  		laws; providing certain health services, meeting specific staffing levels and  		meeting fire safety standards.<sup><font><a href="#note141">141</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because ICF's are conceptualized as providing a lower level of care than  		SNF's, the standards of participation are generally less demanding. State  		agencies generally conduct an annual inspection of each certified nursing home  		to determine if the conditions of participation are being met. In some  		situations, states are given the authority to waive certain standards in  		particular situations, e.g., waiver of 7-day registered nurse requirement in  		SNF1s in rural areas where there are no or few registered nurses (RN's).</p>
<p>The conditions of participation required that nursing homes meet the  		state's licensing standards. States can require licensure of non-certified  		nursing homes and board and care homes if they choose. Generally, non-certified  		nursing homes are licensed, but the standards vary considerably by state. Some  		states license board and care homes and others do not. Even in those states  		which do license, some board and care homes may not require a license. These  		are usually places with only 1 or 2 beds.</p>
<p><i>Ownership</i></p>
<p>Ownership of certified nursing homes is mainly proprietary. About 72  		percent of the homes and 69 percent of the beds were operated in 1985 under  		proprietary auspices. Even a greater proportion (81 percent) of non-certified  		homes were proprietary.<sup><font><a href="#note142">142</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The genesis of a high proportion of proprietary-owned nursing homes goes  		back to Social Security Act legislation passed in 1935. The Old Age Assistance  		program for the elderly, a joint federal-state <b>public</b> program, was  		established then. At that time, many elderly needing LTC lived in publicly  		operated poorhouses. The Act prohibited payment of funds for care of the  		elderly to public institutions because Congress wanted to provide better living  		arrangements for the elderly than the dismal poorhouses.<sup><font><a href="#note143">143</a></font></sup> Availability of funds for  		proprietary-owned homes created a demand for these nursing homes and resulted  		in the current dominance of proprietary-owned nursing homes.</p>
<p><i>Administrative Arrangements for Certification</i></p>
<p>State agencies certify nursing homes for participation in Medicare and  		Medicaid and inspect them yearly to determine if they are meeting the  		standards. Although the conditions of participation are national, uniformity of  		administrative arrangements can vary from state to state for several reasons.  		One, the standards are generally worded and interpretations and judgement are  		required in applying them. In addition, the philosophy of standard enforcement  		varies from state to state, enforcement is strict in some states and less so in  		others. Three, states have the authority to waive standards under certain  		circumstances. Nevertheless, the standards are useful in providing a general  		profile of the basic characteristics of certified nursing homes.</p>
<p><i>Local Terminology</i></p>
<p>The terminology most often applied in research about nursing homes in  		the mid-1980's was generically "certified nursing homes." More specific terms  		were "skilled nursing homes" (SNF's) and "intermediate care homes" (ICF's).  		These terms usually are not embedded in the actual names of the nursing homes.  		often such facilities are called "homes for the aged." Although the actual name  		of the facility included the word "skilled', or "intermediate", this does  		indicate that the home is certified by Medicare or Medicaid. No law or policy  		prohibits use of these terms by any nursing home.</p>
<p><i>Non-Certified Homes</i></p>
<p>In 1985, 4,700 nursing homes were not certified under Medicare or  		Medicaid. These homes included 183,000 beds or 11 percent of the total. Most  		were small, housing less than 50 beds.<sup><font><a href="#note144">144</a></font></sup> Although some nursing homes were not  		certified for Medicare or Medicaid, they were usually licensed according to the  		requirements of the individual states. Homes which were not certified fall into  		two categories: those that do not provide as intense a level of care as  		required for certification and those that meet certification requirements but  		whose operators chose not to seek certification.</p>
<p>There are also facilities called board and care homes. These  		places provide assisted living. Care is minimal, generally group meals and  		protective oversight, i.e., someone, either in the home or on-call, to handle  		emergencies and oversee the residents. It is unknown exactly how many such  		places exist. Some, but not all, are licensed by the states and many,  		especially those with 1 or 2 beds, go into and out of business rapidly.</p>
<p><b><i>Functional Criteria</i></b></p>
<p><i>Types of Care</i></p>
<p>According to the legislation prior to late 1990, SNF's provided a higher  		level of services than did ICFs. This was reflected in the more stringent  		SNF requirements for staffing (especially for nurses) and for specialized  		rehabilitation services--physical, speech/hearing and occupational therapy by  		certified therapists.</p>

The differences between SNF's and ICFs  		reflect differences in the intensity of care provided.

In ICF's, the standard is for either  		an RN or a licensed practical nurse (LPN) as supervisor for the day shift. In  		some cases, services are required in both SNF's and ICF's, but the services  		must be provided by specially trained, certified personnel in SNFS. This is the  		case for rehabilitation and social services. In addition to required services,  		facilities can elect to offer other services. A list of required and elective  		services actually offered in certified and non-certified nursing homes is  		presented in <a href="#tableV-E">Table V-E</a>.

<p>Elderly who are eligible for nursing home care under Medicare must meet  		the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>need for skilled nursing care on a daily basis for an <b>acute</b>  		  illness</li>
<li>at least a consecutive three-day hospitalization prior to nursing  		  home admission. The emphasis is mainly on acute care needs for recovery and  		  rehabilitation after a hospital stay.</li>
</ul><p>Assessment is done, but only as part of the discharge planning of the  		<b>acute-care hospital</b>. Prior to late 1990, a standard assessment at  		admission to a SNF was not required.</p>
<p>Elderly who were eligible for nursing home care under Medicaid fell into  		two categories</p>
<ul><li>
<p>SNF eligibles: individuals who required daily skilled nursing care  			 which as a practical matter could only be provided on an inpatient  			 basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ICF eligibles: individuals who did <b>not</b> require the care of a  			 hospital or SNF but required health-related care which as a practical matter  			 could only be provided on an inpatient basis.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>About half of the states have preadmission screening programs to  		determine if elderly who are eligible for Medicaid (i.e., meet low income  		criteria) are placed appropriately in a certified nursing home.<sup><font><a href="#note145">145</a></font></sup> The purpose of the screening  		is to identify elderly who could be cared for in the community or at home if  		relevant services are available. Although the screenings are not standardized  		from state to state, many address the ability to perform ADL's. In 1987,  		legislation was passed so that all states would require screening prior to  		admission and for current residents to identify the mentally ill and mentally  		retarded who should be served in specialized mental health care facilities  		rather than in nursing homes. Patients with Alzheimer's Disease, however, were  		not included in this legislation because Alzheimer's Disease is not classified  		as mental illness in the International Classification of Diseases.</p>
<p>In late 1990, legislation became effective in which all certified  		nursing homes would use a standardized assessment instrument. This instrument,  		called the minimum data set, would be used at admission and periodically  		thereafter to identify changes in the condition of the resident. The data set  		contains several hundred items, many of them focus on functioning.</p>
<p><i>Levels of Dependency or Care</i></p>
<p>The levels of dependency of nursing home residents can be viewed in two  		ways:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Programmatic: eligibility criteria for SNF or ICF care (prior to  			 late 1990).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual: the resident's functioning as measured by need for  			 assistance of another person in performing ADLIS and by presence of behavior  			 and emotional problems.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The programmatic levels of dependency were defined above in the section  		on assessment for nursing home admission. The individual levels of dependency  		focus on measures of functioning. The percent of residents who need the  		assistance of another person in performing ADLs is presented in  		<a href="#tableV-F">Table V-F</a> for certified and non-certified facilities.  		Certified nursing homes have a resident population that is extremely disabled  		in functioning; much more so than non-certified nursing homes. Over 90 percent  		of residents in certified homes needed help of another person with bathing,  		nearly 80 percent with dressing, and over 60 percent with transferring from bed  		to chair. Fifty percent needed help in using the toilet, and over forty percent  		were incontinent. Seven percent were bedfast. The percent of residents needing  		help was twice as high in certified facilities, than in non-certified  		facilities. The one exception was for the ADL going outside the facility; the  		percent needing help was similar for certified and non-certified homes at about  		35 percent.</p>

Of all residents with Medicaid as the primary source of payment, 65 percent  		were receiving intermediate care. Residents qualifying for Medicaid must use  		their social security benefits to help defray the cost of care after allowing  		for the needs of a spouse at home. Monthly social security benefit payments are  		received by nursing homes either directly or from residents, families. After  		crediting a portion of the benefit to the resident's personal account for  		miscellaneous personal spending (newspapers, toothpaste, etc.), the remainder  		is applied to the resident's nursing home expense.<sup><font><a href="#note148">148</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to Medicaid, Medicare was used by very few residents, less  		than two percent. This is because of Medicare's restrictive eligibility  		criteria which emphasized nursing homes as a place for recovery and  		rehabilitation after an acute-hospital stay. Nearly 40 percent of residents in  		certified homes relied on their own income as the primary source of payment.  		The figure was higher in non-certified homes at 66 percent.</p>

</tr></table><p>The previous section on policy concerns describes the process of  		impoverishment of some elderly due to the costs of a long nursing home stay.  		Elderly with long stay's can be impoverished to such an extent that they become  		eligible for Medicaid. The expense of nursing home care combined with a long  		stay can result in catastrophic costs that wipe-out life-time savings and other  		assets. As of January 1, 1987, about 11 percent of nursing home residents met  		eligibility requirements for Medicaid because they had "spent-down" their  		assets during their stay.<sup><font><a href="#note149">149</a></font></sup> Some argue that this figure is an  		underestimate because it excludes residents impoverished by a previous nursing  		home stay.<sup><font><a href="#note150">150</a></font></sup></p>
<p>From a national perspective, costs for nursing home care are the fourth  		largest type of expenditure. In 1985, national expenditures for nursing home  		care amounted to $34.9 billion or 9 percent of all personal health  		expenditures.<sup><font><a href="#note151">151</a></font></sup> (See  		<a href="#tableV-K">Table V-K</a>.)

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Long term care refers to a wide range of medical, social and personal  		care services that are needed by individuals who are functionally impaired.  		Such impairment may result from injury, chronic illness or some other physical  		or mental condition. Long term care is used mainly by the disabled elderly and  		such non-elderly persons as the developmentally disabled or the mentally  		ill.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the elderly, aged 65 and over, who are the primary  		users of long term care in the USA. It examines their use of long term care  		services, particularly home and community based care. It describes the kinds of  		data available on the functionally impaired elderly and their use of such  		care.</p>
<p><b><i>Functionally Impaired Elderly Population</i></b></p>
<p>The most reliable indicator of the need for long term care is the  		presence of functional impairment. A significant number of elderly persons have  		functional impairments, as measured by the Activities of Daily Living (ADL),  		Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) or cognitive impairments. Such  		persons are candidates for LTC services, whether provided formally or  		informally.</p>
<p>In 1985, there were about 5.5 million functionally disabled elderly  		persons aged 65 and over living in' the community and an additional 1.3 million  		in nursing homes. Each of these figures is expected to almost double by the  		year 2020 to 10.1 million and 2.5 million respectively.</p>
<p>There were about 1.1 million of the oldest old, i.e. persons aged 85 and  		over, who were functionally disabled and living in the community in 1985. An  		additional 600, 000 lived in nursing homes. By 2020, the community-dwelling  		group is expected to grow 2.5 times to 2.6 million and the nursing home group  		similarly to 1.4 million. </p>
<p>These estimates rely on a broad definition of functional disability.  		They include persons who received active human assistance, standby assistance  		or used an assistive device. Obviously, a more restrictive definition (e.g. one  		covering only persons who received active human assistance) would lower these  		estimates.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Long Term Care: Overview</h3>
<p>The long term care system in the USA is large and complex. It consists  		fundamentally of: (a) informal care; (b) home and community based care  		(including home health care); and (c) nursing home care.</p>
<p>Informal care is care provided voluntarily by one's immediate family  		(e.g. spouse or adult child), other relatives, friends, neighbors and community  		service organizations. It is estimated that about three quarters of  		functionally impaired elderly persons living in the community rely exclusively  		on such care.<sup><font><a href="#note157">157</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Home and community based care refers to formal services provided in home  		or community-based settings and paid for from either private or public funds.  		For every person in a nursing home, there are an estimated three persons with  		similar disabilities living in the community. To the extent that the needs of  		these persons are met, informal care and formal home and community based care  		are the means.</p>
<p>Nursing homes provide specialized medical, nursing and social services  		in an institutional setting. As discussed in Joan Van Nostrand's paper, nursing  		homes consume the largest fraction of long term care dollars.</p>
<p>There is no single funding source for long term care. From a financing  		perspective, the LTC system is supported by public funds, out-of-pocket  		expenditures, and, to a growing degree, private long term care insurance.  		Public funds may be federal, state or local in origin. The complexity of the  		system is suggested by the fact that over 80 separate federal programs provide  		income support, housing assistance or supportive services to persons needing  		long term care.<sup><font><a href="#note158">158</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The five major federal programs are Medicare, Medicaid, Social Services  		Block Grant, Older Americans Act and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Total  		long term care spending annually in the USA from all sources, public and  		private, is estimated at approximately $50 billion. Nursing home care consumes  		about 80% and home and community based care 20% of this amount.</p>
<p>Medicaid, a joint federal-state program, is the largest public source of  		funds, accounting for about 40% of all long term care spending. The remaining  		amount is accounted for by Medicare and other public programs, private long  		term care insurance and out-of pocket expenditures.</p>
<h3>Home and Community-Based Care: Evolution and Trends</h3>
<p>Care of the functionally disabled elderly at home is not new. The Boston  		Dispensary established the nations first home care program in the 1790s. "In  		the late 1800s, home nursing services were organized and administered by lay  		persons".<sup><font><a href="#note159">159</a></font></sup> During  		this period Visiting Nurse Associations emerged. Dr. E.M. Bluestone founded a  		hospital-based home care program at Montefiore Hospital, New York City in  		1947.<sup><font><a href="#note160">160</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 gave impetus to the  		expansion of home health care in the succeeding decades.</p>
<h3>Medicare Home Health Care</h3>
<p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program with a uniform  		eligibility and benefit structure throughout the United States. The program  		covers most persons entitled to Social Security benefits, persons under age 65  		entitled to disability benefits and some persons with end-stage renal disease.  		Medicare covers primarily acute rather than long term care.</p>
<p>Medicare benefits are provided under two parts: Part A--Hospital  		Insurance and Part B--Supplementary medical Insurance. Under current law,  		Medicare home health benefits under either part are targeted at persons  		recovering from an acute illness. The beneficiary must be home-bound and  		services must be ordered and reviewed periodically by a physician.</p>

</tr></table><p>Medicare expenditures were about $70 billion in FY 1985, $105 billion in  		FY 1990 and will be about $178 billion in FY 1995. Home health expenditures  		have remained at about 3% of all Medicare expenditures in recent years.</p>
<h3>Medicaid Home and Community-Based Care</h3>
<p>Medicaid is a federal-state matching entitlement program providing  		medical assistance to low income persons who are aged, blind, disabled, members  		of families with dependent children and certain other needy persons. Within  		federal guidelines, each State designs and administers its own program. There  		is considerable variation from State to State in persons covered, benefits  		included and amounts of payment for services.</p>
<p>Medicaid finances home and community-based care under three coverage  		options: (1) home health care; (2) personal care; and (3) home and  		community-based waiver services.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid Home Health Services</i></b></p>
<p>Medicaid-financed home health services are usually the same set of  		services as those authorized under the Medicare home health benefit and are  		provided by Medicare-certified home health agencies. The differences lie in the  		fact that Medicaid is a welfare program for low income persons regardless of  		age and Medicare is a social insurance program for the elderly.</p>
<p>While Medicare home health care is intended as acute care, Medicaid home  		health care can be used by patients with chronic care needs. Furthermore, these  		services are a mandatory part of each state's Medicaid plan (in contrast to  		some services which are optional) and must be provided to individuals entitled  		to nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="#note161">161</a></font></sup> In Fiscal Year 1986, Medicaid payments for  		home health services were $1.35 billion (3%r of all Medicaid payments) on  		behalf of 593,000 beneficiaries. Of this amount, $766,000 (56.7%) was spent on  		behalf of the elderly.</p>

</tr></table><p>Medicaid payments for home health services for the elderly represent  		about 56% (1440.5/2571.0) of all Medicaid home health payments. They also  		amount to about two-fifths of Medicare home health payments  		(1440.5/3473.0).</p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid Personal Care Services</i></b></p>
<p>At their option, states may also provide personal care services as part  		of their Medicaid plans. As of January 1990, 30 states did so. These are  		semi-skilled or non-skilled services, such as assistance with bathing, dressing  		and toileting, that are prescribed by a physician under the recipient's plan of  		care and provided to functionally impaired elderly persons living at home.</p>
<p>In Fiscal Year 1989, about $1.2 billion was spent under Medicaid for  		personal care. However, about 80W of this amount was accounted for by New York  		and an additional 15% by five other states--Arkansas, Massachusetts, Michigan,  		Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid Home and Community-Based Care</i></b></p>
<p>Medicaid home and community-based care services were first authorized  		under Section 2176 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981.  		Such services typically include case management, personal care, homemaker and  		chore services, and respite care. In general, they are designed to assist  		elderly persons who otherwise would occupy a nursing home bed. Since such  		services were not covered under the regular state Medicaid plan, states had to  		apply for a waiver. By 1989, 36 states had done so.</p>
<p>In Fiscal Year 1986, Medicaid expenditures for the disabled elderly  		under Section 2176 were $164 million and served 78,600 elderly  		beneficiaries.<sup><font><a href="#note162">162</a></font></sup></p>
<p>OBRA 1987 established a second home and community-based waiver program  		under Section 1915 (d). This waiver provision exempts states from serving only  		persons who otherwise would be in a nursing home. In return, states agree to  		set an overall spending cap on their long term care expenditures. This waiver  		has been used by only one state, Oregon.</p>
<p>Under OBRA 1990, states may elect to provide home and community-based  		services at their option under the state Medicaid plan. However, this new  		provision establishes an overall spending cap for each state and for Medicaid  		overall. This source of funding is independent of the Medicaid section 2176  		waiver program under which States may request a waiver from normal Medicaid  		requirements in order to provide home and community-based care.</p>
<p>These examples, pertaining only to home and community-based care (not  		nursing home care) and drawn from a single program, Medicaid, illustrate the  		complexity of the USAs long term care system. Even within this single  		public program, these are different combinations of services and multiple  		sources of funding for home and community-based care.</p>
<h3>Other Sources of Home and Community-Based Care</h3>
<p><b><i>Older Americans Act</i></b></p>
<p>The Older Americans Act of 1965 established a network on aging,  		consisting of a federal Administration on Aging, State Agencies on Aging and  		local Area Agencies on Aging. In Fiscal Year 1989 there were 670 AAAs. A  		variety of services is provided to the elderly under Title III, including: (a)  		supportive services and senior centers; (b) congregate nutrition services; (c)  		home-delivered meals; and (d) in-home services for the frail elderly.</p>
<p>Supportive services include transportation, housekeeping, telephone  		reassurance and friendly visiting, chore services, education, training, escort  		service and legal assistance. In FY 1989, approximately 7.1 million persons  		received such services. Ombudsman services and, for the first time in FY 1990,  		elder abuse prevention services are also authorized.</p>
<p>Over 144 million congregate meals were served to older persons and their  		spouses. An addition 99.6 million meals were provided to the homebound  		elderly.</p>
<p>Funding for in-home services to the frail elderly first became available  		in FY 1988 and over 91, 00 persons were served in FY 1989.</p>
<p>Services under the Older Americans Act are available to all elderly  		persons aged 60 and over. There is no means test, although under law there is a  		requirement to emphasize the needs of low income minority elderly. Over the  		past decade, there has been an expansion of case management and other  		supportive services to the frail elderly.</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>Social Services Block Grant</i></b></p>
<p>The principal source of federal funding for state social service  		programs is the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX of the Social Security  		Act). In Fiscal Year 1989, $2.7 billion were allotted to the states. Within  		general statutory limits, each state can determine what services to provide,  		who is eligible for these services and how funds are distributed among state  		agencies. Social services aimed at assisting elderly persons with self-care  		needs may be provided.</p>
<p>States are not required to report the number of elderly recipients of  		services or expenditures on behalf of the elderly. Most states provide  		homemaker and chore services, as well as adult protective and emergency  		services for their elderly citizens.</p>
<p><b><i>Supplemental Security Income</i></b></p>
<p>The U.S. Social Security Administration administers the Supplemental  		Security Income (SSI) program for needy aged, blind and disabled persons. SSI  		benefits are financed from general revenues. As of June 1989, there were 4.5  		million SSI beneficiaries, of whom about 2.0 million were aged 65 and over. In  		Fiscal Year 1989, total benefits paid amounted to $14.3 billion, of which $11.4  		billion were federal and $2.9 billion were federally-administered state  		supplemental benefits.</p>
<p>In 1990, the regular federal SSI benefit was $386 a month for an  		individual and $579 for a couple. Most states supplement this amount. All but  		seven states provide supplements aimed at covering the additional costs of  		housing for the frail elderly, mentally ill, or developmentally disabled in  		board and care homes or similar group living arrangements.</p>
<p>When a person enters a hospital or nursing home, where a major part of  		the bill is paid by Medicaid, the SSI benefit is reduced to a personal needs  		allowance of $30 a month.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Supportive Housing</h3>
<p>Long term care involves housing, personal care and, where needed,  		skilled nursing care. Besides one's own home and the nursing home, a variety of  		supportive housing arrangements for the frail elderly has grown up in recent  		years. These include Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC), board and  		care homes, and various forms of subsidized housing.</p>
<p><b><i>Continuing Care Retirement Communities</i></b></p>
<p>CCRCs, sometimes called life care communities, provide under contract  		housing, personal care, nursing care and other social and recreation services  		to their residents. Residents pay an entrance fee and a monthly fee for these  		benefits. "There are approximately 700-800 continuing care retirement  		communities with an estimated 230,000 residents..."<sup><font><a href="#note163">163</a></font></sup> Median entrance fees range  		from $33,000 to $70,000 and median monthly fees from $700 to $1000. The average  		age of residents is about 75.</p>
<p><b><i>Board and Care Homes</i></b></p>
<p>Board and care homes are non-medical community-based facilities that  		provide protective oversight and personal care for their residents, who in the  		main are disabled elderly, mentally ill and developmentally disabled. While  		CCRC residents come from middle and upper middle income groups, board and care  		residents are more often low income.</p>
<p>Frequently, residents receive SSI checks, which they turn over to board  		and care owner/operators in return for services. Alternatively, e.g. when the  		resident is cognitively impaired, checks may be sent directly to the  		owner/operators who act as representative payees. While hard data are lacking,  		there may be as many as 50,000 to 75,000 board and care homes nationally,  		serving approximately one million disabled persons.</p>
<p><b><i>Other Supportive Housing Arrangements</i></b></p>
<p>At the federal level there are several programs that provide supportive  		housing to the frail elderly. The Department of Housing and Urban Development  		(HUD) administers the Section 202 program, under which subsidies are provided  		for the building and managing of rental housing for the elderly. The number of  		frail elderly in these projects has been growing, due to the phenomenon of  		residents "aging in place".</p>
<p>The low income elderly among others also may take advantage of HUD's Low  		Rent Public Housing Program, which includes 1.4 million units and houses 3.5  		million persons. HUD's Section 8 Rental Assistance Program provides subsidies  		to landlords on behalf of tenants with incomes too low to afford private market  		housing.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farmer's Home Administration (FmHA)  		administers several programs that benefit low income rural residents, including  		the elderly, under several sections of the Housing Act of 1949 as amended.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 105,000 persons aged 65 and over with a  		limitation in at least one ADL living in government-assisted housing<sup><font><a href="#note164">164</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A number of supportive housing programs have been initiated at the state  		level, such as Maryland's Sheltered Housing Program, the Massachusetts,  		Congregate Public Housing Program, New York's Enriched Housing Program and  		Oregon's Assistive Living Program.</p>
<p>The linkage between housing and long term care is evident as residents  		age in place and increasingly require more personal care and nursing services.  		Traditional lines of demarcation between housing and long term care are  		breaking down.</p>
<p>Besides the existing arrangements, many new models of housing with  		supportive services for the frail elderly are being developed and tested. These  		include the Supportive Services Program in Senior Housing sponsored by the  		Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the National Demonstration of Congregate  		Housing for the Elderly in Rural Areas developed jointly by the Administration  		on Aging and the Farmers' Home Administration and the Life Care Home model  		developed at Brandeis University.</p>
<h3>Data Sources and Data Needs</h3>
<p>Data on the long term care system in the USA are available from several  		main sources: surveys, administrative data, and other data sources  		(inventories, state and local data systems, and demonstrations). Coverage of  		nursing home care is more comprehensive than coverage of home and community  		care, because the latter is more diffuse and the former absorbs the largest  		share of public funds.</p>
<p><b><i>Surveys</i></b></p>
<p>A number of national surveys yield data on the functionally disabled  		elderly population and their use of long term care services. Current surveys  		whose data are available include:</p>
<ul><li>National Long Term Care Surveys (1982, 1984, 1989)</li>
<li>New Beneficiary Survey (1982, 1989)</li>
<li>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)</li>
<li>I Epidemiologic Followup Study</li>
<li>Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)--Disability  		  Module</li>
<li>National Health Interview Survey--Supplement on Aging and  		  Longitudinal Study of Aging (1984-1986)</li>
<li>National Nursing Home Survey (1985)</li>
<li>National Mortality Followback Survey (1986)</li>
<li>National Medical Expenditure Survey--Household and Institutional  		  Components (1987).</li>
</ul><p>See Wiener, et al.<sup><font><a href="#note165">165</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The decennial Census of the U.S. population provides baseline data for  		the elderly as well as other population subgroups. It is supplemented annually  		by the Current Population Survey.</p>
<p><b><i>Administrative Data</i></b></p>
<p>Administrative records on the functionally disabled elderly are  		available through the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Health Care  		Financing Administration (HCFA), both of which are components of the U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Administrative records have the advantage of being centralized and of  		being policy-relevant, since they cover persons who meet the program's  		eligibility criteria. They, of course, miss non-beneficiaries. Furthermore,  		because they are maintained for purposes of program administration, they often  		lack data about an individuals abilities, disabilities and other  		characteristics that do not pertain to program eligibility.</p>
<p>Within SSA, there are administrative data on the beneficiaries of two  		programs, viz., the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program  		and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program.</p>
<p>OASDI serves persons with substantial work histories and their  		dependents, while SSI, as described above, targets low income persons.</p>
<p>HCFA maintains records on Medicare beneficiaries through its Medicare  		Automated Data Retrieval System (MADRS). Through cooperative arrangements with  		States, the agency has also developed the Medicaid Management Information  		System (NMIS).</p>
<p>SSA supplements its administrative records periodically with surveys  		such as the New Beneficiary Survey. In 1991, HCFA is inaugurating the Current  		Beneficiary Survey, which will be administered on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p><b><i>Other Data Sources</i></b></p>
<p>Data on the functionally impaired elderly can often be found by  		accessing specialized inventories. For example, the National Center for Health  		Statistics is conducting the 1991 National Health Provider Inventory (NHPI) ,  		which is a comprehensive national listing of long term care providers (nursing  		homes, board and care homes, home health agencies and hospices) Such  		inventories often include data on the characteristics of their resident  		populations such as the frail elderly.</p>
<p>State and local governments maintain their own data bases. For example,  		Connecticut has an extensive longitudinal file on its long term care population  		that shows transitions from one setting to another and funding sources.  		Massachusetts has sponsored surveys of home and community based services for  		its frail elderly population.</p>
<p>While not nationally representative, data from federally-funded research  		and demonstration programs can be used to examine in depth the characteristics,  		service use patterns and expenditures of their participants. A prominent  		example is the public use files from the National Long Term Care Channeling  		Demonstration, which was conducted from 1981 to 1986.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, there has been significant growth in long term  		care data bases. Over the same period, however, there have been major shifts  		within the long term care system itself. "To project the need for long term  		care, data are required for a relatively long period on changes in the  		characteristics of the elderly population, their use of services, and the  		nature of their support system, as well as changes in the system both formal  		and informal".<sup><font><a href="#note166">166</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The three followup waves to the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey, the  		Longitudinal Study of Aging and the National Long Term Care Surveys form the  		core of such longitudinal survey data.</p>
<p>More such longitudinal data are needed to describe the transitions of  		the elderly from one state to another, where "state" can refer to health,  		functional status, longevity, service use or payment source. Such longitudinal  		data are vital to model the processes of change, project future needs, and  		document the outcomes of care.</p>
<p>Finally, the entire long term care system needs to be examined in terms  		of the degree to which it produces desirable outcomes for the frail elderly,  		their caregivers and the taxpayers. For the frail elderly, these outcomes  		include the maintenance of dignity and independence in their latter years,  		access to needed services and an acceptable quality of life.</p>
<p>For their caregivers, there must be an appropriate mix of formal and  		informal care and of public and private support. The nation's taxpayers, whose  		average age is rising, are not likely to quarrel with such a system.</p>
