<p>Pursuant to Article 1 of the Convention signed in Paris on 14th December  		1960, and which came into force on 30th September 1961, the Organisation for  		Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shall promote policies  		designed.</p>
<ul><li>to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment and  		  a rising standard of living in Member countries, while maintaining financial  		  stability, and thus to contribute to the development of the world economy;</li>
<li>to contribute to sound economic expansion in Member as well as  		  non-member countries in the process of economic development; and</li>
<li>to contribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral,  		  non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international obligations.</li>
</ul><p>The original Member countries of the OECD are Austria, Belgium, Canada,  		Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the  		Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United  		Kingdom and the United States. The following countries became Members  		subsequently through accession at the dates indicated hereafter: Japan (28th  		April 1964), Finland (28th January 1969), Australia (7th June 1971), New  		Zealand (29th May 1973), Mexico (18th May 1994), the Czech Republic (21st  		December 1995) and Hungary (7th May 1996). The Commission of the European  		Commities takes part in the work of the OECD (Article 13 of the OECD  		Convention).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER 14: UNITED STATES</h1>
<p>The United States has been adapting its social and health policy  		structures for most of the century in response to growth in the numbers of the  		elderly population. In recent decades, particularly since the enactment of  		Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. a strong growth in the number of the very  		elderly, amongst whom chronic diseases and disabilities are the most prevalent.  		has progressively raised the profile of long-term care policy. The realisation  		that the demand for these services will continue to increase has led to a  		series of proposals for reforming long- term care policy in order to  		accommodate these demands at a reasonable cost. </p>
<p>However, the political debates around these proposals have exposed some  		wide differences in priorities and values around a number of issues. These  		include how far the responsibility for covering these risks rests with  		government at all, how the public share of this responsibility should be  		allocated between federal and state governments, and the overall urgency of  		long-term care reform (and associated costs) within the wider health reform  		agenda. These differences in view have served to derail any specific large  		scale proposals for reform. It seems likely that in the next few years,  		long-term care will see only incremental reform to the core legislation,  		together with continuing new initiatives and experimentation at states level.  		</p>
<p>In this chapter, the long development of long-term care policy is  		described, giving particular emphasis to the functioning of the main programmes  		introduced in the 1960s, and their progressive modification up to the 1990s.  		Finally, an outline is given of the main reform debates of the late 1980s and  		1990s (on which, see also Chapter 19 in this volume, and OECD, 1996). </p>
<h2>THE POLICY CONTEXT: DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH TRENDS</h2>
<p>In common with other industrialised countries, the United States is  		experiencing a considerable growth in its older population. In 1900, 4 per cent  		of the population were aged 65 and over, comprising 3.1 million people. By  		1990, this age group accounted for 12 per cent of the population, a total of 32  		million people, and by 2030 this proportion is projected to rise to almost 20  		per cent of the population, around 65 million people. </p>
<p>More recently, since the 1960s, there has been an accelerated growth of  		the oldest age group, those aged 85 and over. In the early 1990s this group  		makes up 1 per cent of the population, or 2.8 million people. Within a decade  		this age group is projected to rise increase to 4.9 million people, and by 2030  		to about 8.6 million, comprising 3 per cent of the population (Olson, 1994,  		p.25). </p>
<p>The prevalence of chronic diseases and associated disabilities is  		highest among the oldest age groups, which are now the fastest growing. Success  		in the prevention, treatment and cure of these chronic diseases, including  		arthritis, chronic heart conditions, hypertension and rheumatism, has been  		significantly less than that with the acute and infectious diseases, leading to  		growing numbers of elderly disabled people in need of some care. In particular,  		mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease have become more prevalent. About  		1 per cent of those aged 65 and over develop senile dementia every year, and  		currently slightly over 1 million people suffer from severe dementia, and  		another three million suffer from lower levels of dementia (<i>op. cit.</i>,  		p.26). </p>
<p>In total, it is estimated that there are around 7 million elderly people  		in need of long-term care, and that, depending on mortality and morbidity,  		there will be between 10 million and 14 million in 2020, and between 14 million  		and 24 million in 2060 (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1994, p.8). </p>
<h2>DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM CARE POLICY</h2>
<p>The U.S. long-term care system has deep historical roots in "welfare"  		policy. Care for disabled elderly people has been intertwined with provisions  		for poverty and dependency generally. It is only relatively recently that  		disability among the elderly has been viewed as posing "health" or "social  		service" needs distinct from the needs of poor elderly people without families  		for sheltered living arrangements or cash payments. (The main developments  		discussed below are summarised in <a href="caring-frail-elderly-people-policies-evolution.html#table14.1">Table 14.1</a>.) </p>

</tr></table><h3>Care for dependent elderly people prior to social  		security</h3>
<p>During the Colonial period. dependent elderly people who could not be  		cared for directly by their own families were "boarded out" with surrogate  		families (Haber, 1983). The adult children of elderly people were considered  		financially accountable for paying the costs of such care. In cases where  		dependent elderly people had no adult children or other family who could assume  		these costs, churches or municipalities took on the responsibility. </p>
<p>Early in the 19th century, however, ideas about how government should  		respond to poverty and dependency began to emphasise what was then termed  		"indoor relief" in institutional settings (Trattner, 1974; Haber, 1983). The  		principal such institution was the city or county almshouse, of which people  		aged 60 and older constituted about one fourth to one third of the inmate  		populations. These older people were generally housed in almshouses as an act  		of charity, being viewed as too sick and weak to survive outside the asylum.  		</p>
<p>Later in the 19th century, charitable societies organised programmes to  		keep the "able-bodied" poor out of almshouses and restore them to  		self-sufficiency. Specialised institutions such as orphanages and mental  		hospitals were developed to care for non-elderly dependent populations. As a  		result, the remaining population of almshouses became increasingly aged -- so  		much so that, by the end of the century, these institutions had begun to change  		their names to "homes for the aged and infirm." Welfare authorities actively  		promoted institutionalisation as the best solution to the problem of the frail  		elderly poor who lacked families to care for them. Institutionalisation was  		seen as being more dignified than the alternative of begging in the streets.  		</p>
<p>However, because a stigma attached to public institutions, religious and  		other benevolent organisations increasingly established their own old-age  		homes. Initially most of these homes aimed at keeping "respectable" persons,  		especially widows and never-married women, from having to experience the  		"degradation" of the public almshouse. The rise of the modem concept of  		hospitals as being for the treatment of acute illness accelerated this trend.  		Hospitals increasingly refused to accommodate chronic, incurable patients, but  		their sponsoring charitable organisations often built attached or affiliated  		old- age homes. </p>
<h3>The impact of the Social Security Act, 1935</h3>
<p>By the mid-1930s, the prevailing philosophy on welfare had changed to an  		outlook which condemned public institutions and favoured "outdoor relief",  		preferably in one's own home. The solution to old-age poverty was perceived to  		be increased income: from tax-financed pensions for retired people,  		supplemented, if necessary, by means-tested cash assistance that would enable  		the elderly to remain in their own homes, or at least make their own living  		arrangements. </p>
<p>The provision of pensions and means-tested cash assistance was partly  		intended to enable many who could not previously do so to pay fees in  		privately-run residential care facilities. Moreover, the Federal Social  		Security Act of 1935 prohibited states from using grants-in-aid under Old Age  		Assistance (OAA) to pay benefits to or on behalf of inmates of public  		institutions. Although local authorities did not immediately close their  		almshouses and old age homes, they were increasingly phased out in favour of  		privately-run facilities. </p>
<p>Thus, the Social Security Act of 1935 is generally credited by welfare  		historians with giving rise to the proprietary nursing home industry (Thomas,  		1969). Initially, most private, for- profit facilities were small,  		family-oriented "board and care" homes. They became "nursing" or "convalescent"  		homes when their proprietors were nurses or doctors who could offer some  		medical attention in addition to room and board. The Crowing numbers of  		elderly, sick, homeless persons who needed to be accommodated caused these  		private, for-profit facilities to grow larger and become more institutional in  		character. </p>
<p>Growth in voluntary (<i>i.e.</i> non-profit) homes for the aged failed  		to keep pace. Most voluntary facilities were established to provide for members  		of particular religious, ethnic, or fraternal groups, and, as such, often had  		various criteria that restricted whom they were willing to admit. Moreover,  		voluntary facilities had no tradition of accepting public funds. The  		philanthropic image, both in the minds of the sponsoring organisations and  		government officials, required that a significant portion of the cost of giving  		care be borne by the sponsoring organisations. However, the ability of  		voluntary facilities to expand on the basis of charitable contributions alone  		was quite limited. </p>
<h3>The 1950s and early 1960s: towards a new public  		policy</h3>
<p>By the beginning of the 1950s, public authorities had become alarmed at  		the growth of the proprietary nursing home sector relative to public and  		non-profit facilities and attempted to redress the balance. First, in 1950, the  		Social Security Act was amended to permit public facilities to receive federal  		OAA funds, and to require licensing of private facilities, which in most states  		were still unregulated. Secondly, in 1954, the "Hill- Burton" health facility  		capital financing legislation was amended to make public funds available to  		construct public and voluntary nursing homes. Even though the amount of  		Hill-Burton funds actually spent on nursing homes was very small, the  		significance of incorporating nursing homes into the prevailing hospital-based  		system of health care should not be underestimated because it transformed them,  		by definition, into medical facilities. As Vladeck (1980) has put it, "Nursing  		homes would never again be solely an extension of the welfare system; they now  		belonged to health policy as well". </p>
<p>However, although federal and state governments were now willing to  		promote the growth of public and voluntary nursing homes, it was too late. The  		pattern of dominance by proprietary ownership that prevails to this day had  		already been firmly established. The 1950s saw a very rapid expansion of  		nursing home capacity. A 1954 survey of such facilities by the Public Health  		Services identified either as "skilled nursing homes" or as "personal care  		homes with skilled nursing" some 9,000 facilities with 250,000 beds. Amendments  		to the Social Security Act in 1956 increased federal support for OAA and other  		cash assistance programmes and also established a separate "vendor payment"  		programme that matched state expenditures for health services to low income  		elderly, including care in nursing homes and related facilities. By 1960, it is  		estimated that there were some 10 to 11,000 nursing homes with 400,000 beds  		(Vladeck 1980). </p>
<p>The "Kerr-Mills" programme of Medical Assistance for the Aged which was  		enacted in 1960 was essentially an expansion of the vendor-payment programme  		under OAA. The main innovations were the removal of the cap on availability of  		federal matching funds and the introduction of the concept of "medical  		indigency", which meant that payments for health services could be made on  		behalf of elderly people who had exhausted their capacity to pay privately for  		care but who were not otherwise eligible for cash assistance on grounds of low  		income. Kerr-Mills was the immediate predecessor to and, in many of its  		features, the prototype for the Medicaid prograrnme that, since 1965, has been  		the major source of public funding for long-term care for the elderly. </p>
<h3>1965: the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid</h3>
<p>In 1965, Congress enacted Titles 18 (Medicare) and 19 (Medicaid) of the  		Social Security Act. Both of these programmes included coverage for nursing  		home care and, for the first time, coverage for home health services --  		although Medicare coverage of both nursing home and home health services was  		limited to short-term, postacute, convalescent and rehabilitative "skilled"  		nursing and therapies. </p>
<p>Federal legislation had again stimulated the growth of the proprietary  		nursing home industry. Voluntary homes for the aged could not qualify for  		Medicare/Medicaid funding because most offered only personal care, not "skilled  		nursing." Furthermore, the explicit ban on Medicaid payments to "institutions  		for mental disease" reinforced the movement to "de-institutionalise" mental  		patients in state mental hospitals by giving states a major financial incentive  		to transfer elderly people with dementia or psychiatric disorders out of state  		mental hospitals into private nursing homes in order to access federal matching  		payments. </p>
<p>Medicare and, especially, Medicaid remain the primary sources of public  		funding for long-term care services for the elderly, both institutional and  		non-institutional. However, the 1960s also saw the beginning of Social Security  		Act (Title XX/SSBG) social services (1962) and Title III, Older Americans Act  		(1965) funding for non-medical home and community-based services for the  		disabled elderly. These programmes are described later in this chapter. </p>
<h2>SUPPORT FOR LONG-TERM CARE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMMES: MEDICARE AND  		MEDICAID</h2>
<h3>The legislative and administrative framework</h3>
<p>Medicare is a "social insurance" programme that pays for medical and  		related care of elderly and disabled Social Security beneficiaries. It relies  		upon a combination of payroll tax financing for "Part A", which relates to  		hospital, skilled nursing facility (nursing home) and home health benefits, and  		voluntary, but heavily tax-subsidised, premiums to cover "Part B", which  		relates to physician visits and ancillary services. Almost all Americans aged  		65 and older are covered by Medicare Part A. For fiscal year 1993, it has been  		estimated that a proximately 31.3 million persons aged 65 and older had  		Medicare Part A coverage and about 30.8 million persons aged 65 and older were  		enrolled in Part B. </p>
<p>By contrast, Medicaid's coverage of medical and long-term care for the  		poor is often characterised as following a "social assistance" approach.  		Medicaid is financed jointly out of general tax revenues by the federal  		government and the states. The federal government matches state expenditures at  		a rate -- ranging from 50 per cent to 84 per cent -- that provides more  		generous federal cost-sharing for states whose residents have lower per capita  		incomes. Eligibility for Medicaid is means- tested and is linked to standards  		for cash assistance (which vary between states). At state option, the  		"medically indigent", <i>i.e.</i> persons for whom the costs of medical and  		related services exceed their income and resources, may also be eligible. on  		condition of "spending-down" their own assets until they have exhausted their  		ability to pay. </p>
<p>Medicare is a federal programme that is largely administered by private  		insurance companies under contract as "fiscal intermediaries" for Part A or  		"insurance carriers" for Part B. Medicaid is jointly administered by the  		federal government and the states. Policy-making occurs at the state level  		within federal mandates established by statute and further spelled out in  		regulations. The day-to-day operational administration of Medicaid is left  		largely to the states. </p>
<p>Like Medicare, Medicaid is termed an "open-ended, individual  		entitlement" programme, because there is no fixed annual appropriation of funds  		to meet all programme costs. Instead, the statute mandates that any individual  		who meets the basic eligibility requirements is guaranteed specified benefits  		(defined in each state's "Medicaid state plan") on the basis of a participating  		physician's orders or other professional assessment of need for services. </p>
<p>Federal law requires states to cover certain basic services including  		care in nursing homes and home health services for persons who would qualify  		for nursing home care. Other services, including home-delivered personal care  		and other home and community-based services for the functionally disabled, may  		be provided at state option. As a result, there is considerable variation in  		Medicaid long-term care coverage across states. </p>
<p>Medicare is the primary source of medical insurance coverage for the  		elderly. Medicaid supplements Medicare coverage for low- income elderly who  		cannot afford the co-payments and deductibles for Medicare-covered services and  		who also cannot afford the "Medi-gap" private insurance that more than  		two-thirds of all elderly people purchase to cover these costs. In addition,  		Medicaid is available to help those elderly people who cannot afford high  		out-of-pocket costs or private insurance coverage for services that Medicare  		does not cover -- primarily pharmaceuticals and nursing home care. </p>
<p>As of 1991, about 9.5 per cent of the non-institutionalised U.S.  		population aged 65 and older qualified for Medicaid (Committee on Ways and  		Means, 1993). However, many elderly Medicare beneficiaries qualify for Medicaid  		only after they are institutionalised in nursing homes. In 1989 about 13.5 per  		cent of the elderly were enrolled in Medicaid at some point during the year --  		about 4.2 million people. </p>
<h3>Coverage of "post-acute" health services by  		Medicare</h3>
<p>Medicare coverage related to long-term care is limited to home health  		agency (HHA) services and short-term, post-hospital skilled nursing facility  		(SNF) care. </p>
<p>To qualify for the HHA benefit, elderly people enrolled with Medicare  		must have a need for home-delivered skilled nursing or therapies (<i>i.e.</i>  		registered nurse visits or visits by licensed physical, speech, or respiratory  		therapists). Home health aide services to help with personal care and  		housekeeping may also be provided as long as the beneficiary also requires  		skilled services. HHA benefits are available to all Medicare beneficiaries  		solely on the basis of medical need (<i>i.e.</i> without a means-test); unlike  		all other Medicare benefits, there are no co-payments or deductibles required.  		</p>
<p>The SNF benefit covers short-term nursing home care following a period  		of hospitalisation. Beneficiaries must have a need for "skilled" nursing care  		or therapies. A three-day prior hospital stay is required and the duration of  		the benefit is limited to 100 days (Helbing and Cornelius, 1992). </p>
<p>Both the Medicare home health and skilled nursing facility benefits were  		originally intended to finance only post-hospital convalescent and  		rehabilitative care. The objective was to get elderly persons out of the  		hospital sooner, preferably back to their homes, or, if that was not feasible,  		to a lower cost, less technically-oriented, recuperative setting. </p>
<p>During the first decade of Medicare, the scale of coverage of post-acute  		nursing home care was repeatedly reduced via both legislation and regulations.  		The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 briefly broadened Medicare SNF  		coverage, but these provisions were repealed in 1989. </p>
<p>However, in contrast to the SNF benefit, the HHA benefit has relaxed its  		exclusive focus on post-hospital care. This came about through various  		legislative and regulatory revisions as well as judicial rulings that required  		more liberal interpretation of the "part-time", "intermittent", and  		"home-bound" requirements. The most notable legislative changes occurred in  		1980 when the requirement for a three-day, prior hospital stay was dropped,  		together with a 100-visit limit, co-payment requirements and a prohibition on  		for-profit home health agencies. The entry of for-profit home health agencies  		into the market led to significant growth in licensed agencies and subsequent  		large increases in the use of home health services. </p>
<p>During the early 1980s, Medicare home health expenditures grew very  		rapidly, due to both the impact of the 1980 legislative changes and as a result  		of the introduction of the Diagnostically-Related Groups (DRG) system of  		prospective payments for hospital care. These fixed rate payments created  		strong financial incentives to shorten hospital lengths of stay and to  		discharge patients in need of further convalescent, rehabilitative, or terminal  		care to "post-acute" providers, including home health agencies. </p>
<p>In recent years, the use of Medicare home health services has seen  		further significant growth. The reasons for this are still not fully  		understood, but one important factor was the relaxation in coverage rules  		following the settlement of a major lawsuit (Duggan vs. Bowen) filed by a  		coalition of home health beneficiaries, providers, and members of Congress.  		Over the period 1987-1992, the percentage of all those enrolled in Medicare  		(including both elderly and younger permanently disabled persons) receiving HHA  		services rose from 4.8 to 6.3 per cent, while the average number of visits per  		episode of care among users rose from 23 to 57 (Mauser and Miller, 1994;  		Committee on Ways and Means, 1993; Helbing <i>et al.</i>, 1992). </p>
<p>As a result of changing coverage rules, therefore, the Medicare home  		health benefit has increasingly taken on more of a "long- term" character and  		has also increasingly been involved in the provision of less skilled "home  		health aides" rather than the traditional "skilled" services. </p>
<h3>Eligibility for help with long-term care costs from  		Medicaid</h3>
<p>Medicaid eligibility rules are extraordinarily complex (for a full  		account see Gurny <i>et al.</i>, 1992). Briefly, individuals are generally  		eligible for Medicaid-covered services if they qualify for cash assistance on  		grounds of low income -- Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments in the  		case of the elderly disabled (SSI having replaced OAA in 1972). In addition,  		states may choose, but are not required, to provide coverage to the "medically  		needy" whose medical expenses exceed their income and savings. In such cases,  		among which nursing home costs loom large, Medicaid funding covers the  		shortfall between monthly personal incomes and the relevant costs, no matter  		what the level of monthly income. As of October 1, 1992, 36 states and the  		District of Columbia had extended coverage to the "medically needy". In states  		without "medically needy" coverage, individuals are only eligible for help from  		Medicaid in paying for nursing home care if their income does not exceed 300  		per cent of the level of cash assistance payable through SSI (this varies by  		states, averaging $1,200 per month). </p>
<p>While living in the community, elderly disabled persons classified as  		"medically needy" are required to spend-down" to Medicaid eligibility by  		contributing toward the cost of their medical care all their income above an  		amount equivalent to the cash assistance benefit level. All Medicaid recipients  		in nursing homes must "spend-down" their monthly income above a monthly  		personal needs allowance (currently set at a federal minimum of $30) by  		contributing toward the costs of care; Medicaid pays the remainder. In  		addition, nursing home residents must exhaust their assets by paying privately  		for care prior to becoming eligible for Medicaid. Again, this amount varies by  		state, falling between $2,000 and $5,000 in savings for one person. However,  		some assets, such as the home, one car, a burial plot, and some other personal  		property, are usually exempted from consideration. </p>
<p>Prior to 1988, the income and asset test for married applicants was  		almost as stringent as that for individuals. However, from 1988, the provisions  		of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA) have allowed the  		non-institutionalised spouse of a Medicaid recipient in a nursing home to  		retain more of the couple's income and assets. The purpose of these "spousal  		impoverishment protections" is to allow the non-institutionalised spouse to  		maintain his or her accustomed standard of living in the community, and not be  		reduced to dependency on social assistance as a result of making the required  		payments for the care of the institutionalised spouse. Such couples are now  		permitted to divide their assets in half, with the spouse remaining in the  		community permitted to retain between $12,000 and $60,000. Only the share  		allotted to the institutionalised spouse must be "spent-down" paying for  		nursing home care. </p>
<p>During the 1980s, federal and state Medicaid officials grew increasingly  		concerned about transfers of assets to qualify for Medicaid nursing home  		coverage. Some elderly people who planned to enter nursing homes and who had  		substantial savings and property were found to be transferring ownership of  		their assets before applying for Medicaid. The aim was to evade the Medicaid  		"spend-down" requirements, and thereby ensure that these assets would pass to  		heirs instead of being spent on nursing home care. </p>
<p>There is little data on the overall extent of such transfers. However, a  		1992 survey of recent nursing home residents in one state asked respondents  		directly whether they had transferred funds or property to relatives before  		coming to the nursing home: 22 per cent said that they had. The same survey  		found that approximately two-thirds of nursing home entrants reported having  		assets (including savings accounts, life insurance death benefits, vehicles,  		real estate, stocks, bonds and mutual funds) worth more than $5,000 prior to  		admission: 39 per cent had assets in excess of $40,000, and 22 per cent had  		assets worth $100,000 or more (Wetle <i>et al.</i>, 1994). </p>
<p>Beginning in 1982, Medicaid legislation attempted to prevent asset  		transfers prior to nursing home entry. The 1988 MCCA extended the period within  		which previously-transferred assets would be considered as still available (the  		so-called "look back" period) to 30 months prior to application for Medicaid  		nursing home coverage. The law still contained many loopholes, however, and one  		result was a growing cadre of attorneys specialising in "Medicaid estate  		planning." The 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act increased the "look-back" period  		to 36 months and also incorporated other provisions to close loopholes in the  		law. </p>
<p>For example, states are now required to enact estate recovery laws.  		These laws enable the recovery or partial recovery of Medicaid expenditures  		from the estates of deceased nursing home residents. Such laws are considered  		necessary because, despite "spend-down" requirements, Medicaid-eligible nursing  		home residents can still have substantial net worth at death. This is because  		they are permitted to retain ownership of a home so long as they declare in  		intent to return home to live (regardless of the likelihood that this would  		occur) or so long as there is a spouse or other protected relative living in  		the home. In the absence of estate recovery provision, ownership of the home  		(whose worth may be sufficient to reimburse to Medicaid the cost of several  		years of nursing facility care) would eventually pass to heirs other than a  		spouse and escape the Medicaid spend-down net entirely. </p>
<h3>Extension of services available under Medicaid</h3>
<p>In the earliest years of Medicaid (1965-71), almost the only long-term  		care services covered were skilled nursing facility (SNF) and home health  		benefits. These are among the few mandatory benefits that the federal  		government required states to cover for all those eligible for Medicaid (as  		contrasted with the many optional benefits that states may or may not choose to  		cover). Since that time, a number of extensions have been made that have  		widened the scope of federal matching payments. </p>
<h4><i>Personal assistance services</i></h4>
<p>Medicaid home health benefits may be used by the elderly to supplement  		the home health care coverage under Medicare. Because the Medicaid home health  		benefit is very similar to the original Medicare home health benefit, however,  		most elderly persons in need of home health care have tended to rely primarily  		on the latter. Use of Medicare is preferable because there is no means-test and  		no co-payment requirements and because, in most areas of the country, Medicare  		home health coverage is more generous. </p>
<p>There is one important exception to this pattern. From the late 1960s,  		the Medicaid system has permitted states to cover personal assistance services  		in the home. The only limits on state discretion in providing such benefits  		have been that personal care services have had to be prescribed by a physician,  		supervised by a nurse, and provided by a qualified individual who is not a  		member of the recipient's family. Prior to 1980, only a handful of states opted  		to provide personal care, with New York accounting for three quarters of all  		Medicaid personal care expenditures (Litvak and Kennedy, 1991). </p>
<p>Since 1980, however, a growing number of states have elected to extend  		cover to personal care. By 1990, 30 states covered personal care, at a total  		cost of $1.9 billion. This optional personal care benefit is the single biggest  		source of funding (both within Medicaid and among all public programmes funding  		long-term care services) for home-delivered long-term care, particularly for  		elderly and younger disabled persons who require help with basic activities of  		daily living such as bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, and eating. In  		1990, the personal care benefit was, for the first time, explicitly  		incorporated into the Medicaid statute, to clarify the authority of states to  		allow personal care attendants to accompany clients and provide services  		outside the home. </p>
<h4><i>Home and community care "waivers"</i></h4>
<p>In 1981, Congress enacted the "home and community-based long-term care  		waiver option." (This optional benefit is also referred to as the "HCBC", the  		"2176" or the "1915c" waiver programme). This legislation authorised states to  		provide a wide variety of home and community-based long-term care services as  		alternatives to nursing home placement. However, the law stipulated that home  		and community-based care alternatives must 1915(d) expenditure cap. The main  		source of nursing home cost increases had been the 1987 federal nursing home  		reforms that required nursing homes to make "quality of care" improvements, and  		especially to hire more professionally trained nurses, thus raising Tabour  		costs. Efforts to have Congress amend the 1915(d) statutory provisions to give  		HCFA authority to adjust the funding "cap" to account for the increased costs  		arising from nursing home reform were not successful. </p>
<h4><i>The "frail elderly" provision</i></h4>
<p>In 1990, Congress enacted the "Frail Elderly" provision, also known as  		"4711", another option within Medicaid allowing coverage of home and  		community-based long-term care services. Unlike other Medicaid home care  		optional benefits, services financed under "4711" are only for elderly people.  		Unique features of the "4711" legislation include eligibility criteria based on  		"Activity of Daily Living" (ADL) impairment, mandatory case- management, and  		federal oversight of board and care settings. The "4711" provision has been  		criticised as being simultaneously under-funded and over-regulatory. </p>
<p>Despite the small amount of capped funding ($580 million over a five  		year period) and other limitations of the 4711 legislation, its authors stated  		their intention of establishing this provision in Medicaid as a "foot in the  		door", to lead eventually to a much broader home care financing reform  		initiative alone, the lines of the 1990 Pepper Commission recommendations (for  		details of which, see later.) As of October 1994, only Texas had actually  		implemented a 4711 programme. </p>
<h3>Reimbursement of providers</h3>
<p>Medicaid is a "vendor payment" programme, in that payments may not be  		made directly to individual service recipients, only to service providers.  		States determine their own methods for provider payment within broad federal  		requirements. </p>
<h4><i>Payment for nursing home services</i></h4>
<p>Payments for nursing home care from Medicaid and Medicare have always  		been based on data that providers supply about their actual operating expenses.  		The methods employed have, however, been progressively developed into a more  		sophisticated system balancing provider costs, client needs and expenditure  		control mechanisms. </p>
<p>In the early 1970s Congress passed a law that would have eventually  		required states to adopt the existing Medicare hospital reimbursement  		methodology (known as "individual facility-specific retrospective cost-related  		reimbursement") to establish payment rates for Medicaid nursing homes. However,  		by the late 1970s, this reimbursement methodology was being held responsible  		for stimulating very serious inflation in hospital costs (a concern that  		eventually resulted in a system of prospective hospital payment being adopted  		for Medicare in 1983). In 1980, therefore, Congress enacted the "Boren  		Amendment", which permitted states to use whatever methods they chose to  		establish nursing home payment rates, so long as the resulting rates were  		sufficient to cover the costs of an "efficiently and economically operated"  		facility. </p>
<p>This standard permits states leeway in disallowing reimbursement for  		nursing home costs considered excessive" or "unnecessary". At the same time, it  		prevents states from setting nursing home payment rates arbitrarily without  		relationship to the actual costs of providing care and to federal requirements  		in terms of quality standards. In recent years -- particularly since the  		passage of nursing home reform legislation in 1987 that raised federal quality  		standards (for which see later) -- the Boren Amendment has increasingly been  		the basis of litigation by nursing homes against states for paying what the  		facilities claim to be inadequate rates. </p>
<p>In the early years following the passage of Medicaid, states tended to  		be quite unsophisticated in their payment methodologies. This gave rise to a  		considerable degree of "playing the system" and even outright fraud by nursing  		home operators. States had a difficult time keeping up with the more  		unscrupulous operators, and the 1970s saw a series of government investigations  		and media exposés of nursing home fraud and abuse. By the late 1970s,  		however, most states had developed payment methods capable of controlling fraud  		and abuse and had driven blatantly larcenous operators out of the industry.  		However, this period established a distrusting and adversarial relationship  		between state rate-setting agencies and nursing homes that continues to the  		present day (Moss and Halamandaris, 1977; Mendelson, 1974). </p>
<p>Since the late 1970s, most states have chosen to reimburse nursing homes  		on the basis of a rate-setting methodology known as "individual  		facility-specific prospective payment". Rates are based on each facility's  		prior year expenditures, with limits for particular cost items (<i>e.g.</i>  		nursing, administration, physical plant maintenance, etc.) being set according  		to some per centile of average costs across all facilities. The resulting rates  		are then projected forward for the payment year according to a fixed adjustment  		for allowable price inflation. Evaluation research indicates that such  		reimbursement methods do create strong incentives for facilities to economise,  		while, at the same time, prohibiting them from generating profits by cutting  		back on necessary services. The widespread adoption of this payment methodology  		is credited with holding down annual nursing home cost increases to rates only  		slightly above general price inflation throughout the 1980s (Holohan, 1985),  		while, in contrast, cost increases for acute medical services continued to go  		up at rates considered much more alarming (OECD, 1992). </p>
<p>In recent years, the federal government has sponsored state  		experimentation with alternative payment methodologies; most notably,  		"case-mix-related reimbursement" which adjusts payment rates to account for  		differential needs of patients with different levels of functional disability  		and types of medical conditions. In several states, the experimentation has  		concluded and been judged sufficiently favourably that some version of  		case-mix-related reimbursement has been adopted as the new payment system.  		There are versions of case-mix reimbursement in use in around one-third of the  		states (Swan <i>et al.</i>, 1993). </p>
<h4><i>Payment for home and community-based  		services</i></h4>
<p>Reimbursement for home and community-based long-term care services is  		typically made on a per visit or hourly basis. Medicare reimbursement rates are  		set nationally (with regional adjustments for labour costs) according to a  		retrospective, cost- based system (up to limits based on average HHA costs).  		Under Medicaid, most states aim to set fees based on the lowest payment rate  		they believe they can offer and still attract an adequate number of qualified  		providers. States do not necessarily obtain cost data from providers during  		this process, and in states that use agency services exclusively, competitive  		bidding has become an increasingly popular method of contracting for home  		health and home care services, and, therefore, of price-setting. </p>
<p>Federal regulations require home health (<i>i.e.</i> professional  		nursing and therapy) services to be provided only through certified home health  		agencies. However, for non-technical home care services (especially  		home-delivered personal care and home- making services) many states authorise  		the use of independent contractors. These are often recruited directly by home  		care clients themselves, from among the client's family, friends or neighbours  		or by advertising in local newspapers. About half of all home and  		community-based care programmes administered by the states permit the use of  		independent providers; most of the remainder require the use of certified home  		health or licensed home care agencies. Sometimes, local social services  		officials make available to clients lists of qualified individuals who have  		worked as home care attendants in the past (Litvak and Kennedy, 1990). Most  		Medicaid -- or other public -- payment to "hands-on" providers of home care  		services is only just above the minimum wage (about $5 an hour). </p>
<h3>Quality standards for long-term care services</h3>
<p>The granting of entitlements to services through Medicaid and Medicare  		has had the effect of involving public authorities closely in the maintenance  		of adequate standards of care. Arriving at suitable standards has been a  		long-drawn-out process involving considerable public and political controversy.  		</p>
<h4><i>Nursing home services</i></h4>
<p>The first set of proposed "conditions of participation" for skilled  		nursing facility (SNF) were issued in 1969, although the final set of  		regulations for both SNFs and intermediate care facility (ICF) were not put  		into effect until 1974. These rules were not revised <i>in toto </i>until 1987,  		and the complete set of revised rules was not finalised until the end of 1992.  		</p>
<p>The 1970s saw a series of major scandals about nursing home quality that  		gave rise to highly publicised investigations both by Congress and individual  		state governments. Often, revelations of fraudulent claims on Medicaid funds by  		proprietors were intertwined with problems concerning low quality of care,  		including patient abuse, neglect and mistreatment. During this period, the  		general public came to perceive many, perhaps even "most", nursing homes as  		places providing dangerously bad care or -- at best -- mediocre and unreliable  		care. This is an image that the nursing home industry has still not fully  		succeeded in overcoming (Moss and Halamandaris, 1977; Vladeck, 1980), and which  		has continued to influence much discussion about standard-setting. </p>
<p>Opinion remains divided about how effective the implementation of the  		1974 SNF and ICF "conditions of participation" were in ameliorating the problem  		of low quality care. However, there is general agreement that the adoption of  		the fire safety code standards put an end to the all-too-frequent,  		multiple-death nursing home fires. However, the adoption of strict fire safety  		standards led to the phasing out of older facilities, some of which aimed at a  		"home-like" atmosphere, and their replacement by new nursing homes which were  		built to the new code, but which tended to look "institutional" and which often  		resembled mini- hospitals. In recent years, there has been a backlash from  		advocates for the frail elderlv against the "medical model", and a movement to  		develop new models of residential care that have desirable safety features but  		also have a more home-like atmosphere (Lewin-VHI, 1992). </p>
<p>When the Reagan Administration took office in 1981, a task force on  		deregulation was created, and nursing homes were included on a priority list of  		industries judged to be in need of regulatory relief. However, while most of  		the other deregulatory initiatives of the earl Reagan years had substantial  		public and Congressional support, the deregulation of nursing homes proved  		highly controversial. By 1984, the attempt to deregulate the nursing home  		industry had become bogged down in Congressional opposition. A high-profile  		legal action brought in federal Court in Colorado (the "Smith v. O'Halloran"  		case), which had begun in 1975 but which was not settled until 1984, also  		played a significant role in blocking the deregulation process. In this case,  		the court ruled that the existing nursing home inspection system provided  		inadequate protection against poor quality care, and that it should be replaced  		by a survey approach capable of measuring the impact of nursing home care on  		resident outcomes. </p>
<p>Congress and the Administration agreed on a compromise: the Institute of  		Medicine (IOM) would carry out a study on improving the quality of care in  		nursing homes, and subsequent regulatory reforms would be guided by its  		findings. The IOM report was published in 1986 and the Administration set about  		drafting new nursing home regulations in light of the report's recommendations.  		These proposed rules were issued for public comment in November 1987. However,  		during the consultation process, Congress decided to narrow the discretion  		available to the Administration in re-writing, the nursing home regulations, by  		requiring full implementation of the IOM recommendations as a provision of the  		Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. OBRA 1987 introduced a new set of  		nursing facility requirements, which abolished the former distinction between  		"skilled" and (lower cost) "intermediate" facilities in favour of one class of  		certified "nursing facilities". These new requirements not only raised overall  		standards, but also substantially reoriented the underlying philosophy of  		nursing home regulation. </p>
<p>All nursing facilities would now be required to meet or exceed the  		former "skilled nursing facility" nurse staffing standards. In addition,  		greater emphasis was to be laced on patients' rights and quality of life  		safeguards. There would be less emphasis on physical plant standards not  		directly related to health and safety, on administrative policies and  		procedures, and on recorded evidence that facilities had complied with  		regulations (which some critics had termed a process of "paper compliance").  		The survey process was to be re-designed to focus much more on patient care  		outcomes; in particular, measuring the prevalence of negative health status  		indicators (<i>e.g.</i> decubitus ulcers, dehydration, falls and broken bones)  		which were most likely to reflect poor quality care. In addition, facilities  		were to be required to institute comprehensive resident assessment and care  		planning, creating a database that surveyors could use to more accurately  		evaluate the quality of patient care (Morris <i>et al.</i>, 1991). Finally, for  		the first time, nurses' aides were to be required to have specified training or  		meet minimum competency standards. </p>
<p>Implementing these reforms again proved to be a lengthy process,  		although all were eventually published as final rules during the period between  		the November 1992 elections and the end of the Bush Administration in January  		1993. According to Faulkner and Gray's professional newsletter "Long-Term Care  		Management" (October 29, 1992): </p>
<blockquote><p>"Industry and consumer representatives agree that OBRA has succeeded  		  in sharply reducing the use of chemical and physical restraints in nursing  		  home. Before the law's enactment, use of such psychoactive drugs as Haldol was  		  becoming relatively commonplace to keep residents from wandering from their  		  rooms or their beds. As a result, critics said, the nation's nursing homes were  		  filling with silently suffering zombies. Today, the use of chemical and  		  physical restraints is down as much as 50 per cent in some areas, and homes  		  have increased their complement of registered nurses and well-trained nurses'  		  aides. Other accomplishments include improvement in the caliber of rural  		  nursing homes, creation of a uniform set of data on what constitutes quality  		  care, and a renewed emphasis on patients' rights. But moving to the next level  		  of nursing home reform -- where the provision of high-quality care becomes the  		  norm -- may be more difficult, as the coalition of industry and consumer groups  		  that helped push the law to passage is splintering over implementation."  		  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Home and community-based services</i></h4>
<p>The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 also raised quality standards for  		Medicare and Medicaid-certified home health agency services. The most important  		change involved training requirements for home health aides. The same  		legislation required certification surveys of compliance with HHA Medicare and  		Medicaid conditions of participation, which surveys were to include  		face-to-face at-home interviews with a statistically representative sample of  		HHA clients. </p>
<h3>Policy on the supply and use of nursing home  		services</h3>
<p>The infusion of Medicaid money into the nursing home industry from the  		late 1960s onwards sparked a boom in the building of nursing homes, which in  		turn led to high rates of growth in state Medicaid budgets for nursing home  		care. This gave rise to concerns that Medicaid had facilitated a significant  		increase in the "institutionalisation" of the elderly, a belief that remains  		widely held by the public and some policy-makers. However, research has since  		shown that the overall rate of institutionalisation of elderly people did not  		rise above levels current by at least the 1950s (Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, 1981). The major exception was an  		increase in institutional use among those aged 80 or over, a group whom medical  		science was now keeping alive in greater numbers but usually in poorer health.  		</p>
<p>What had changed, however, was the types of institutions to which  		elderly people were being admitted. It was not that more elderly people were  		giving up their "own homes" to move into nursing homes, rather that they moved  		to nursing homes from, or instead of, other forms of institution or group  		living arrangement. For the most part, this process was the result of a number  		of deliberate policy shifts: first, the promotion of nursing home use to  		shorten the average length of stay in hospitals; second, the  		"de-institutionalisation" of elderly psychiatric patients from state hospitals  		to nursing homes, together with the diversion of new cases of elderly people  		with dementia to nursing homes; and third, the closing down of substandard  		"board and care" facilities, or their upgrading to nursing facilities. Although  		all these policies were considered desirable in themselves, the sheer magnitude  		of the numbers of elderly people involved took policy-makers by surprise and  		fuelled a concerns about potential "over-use" of nursing homes. </p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s, this concern led state and federal Medicaid  		authorities to impose new systems of "Utilization Review" (UR) to determine  		whether patients were "appropriately placed" in nursing homes and, if so, at  		the least expensive level of care sufficient to meet their needs, <i>i.e.</i>  		where possible, in the then-existing "intermediate" nursing facilities.  		However, since the needs of nursing home residents are subject to change, these  		systems often required that residents be transferred to other facilities in  		order to continue to be considered appropriately placed. To the extent that  		nursing home residents came to view particular facilities as their "homes", or  		wanted to be in nursing homes that were convenient for family visits, they  		began increasingly to resist such transfers, through litigation if necessary.  		</p>
<p>The emphasis of nursing home utilisation policy therefore shifted from  		concurrent review, <i>i.e.</i> determining whether those already in nursing  		homes were appropriately placed, to pre-admission screening, <i>i.e. </i>not  		allowing those who would require public funding to enter a nursing home to do  		so unless they met appropriate standards of need. In the early 1980s, states  		began to adopt screening instruments and point-scoring systems, to be  		administered by specially trained nurses and social workers, in place of the  		former process of certification by a physician. Pre-admission screening also  		became linked to assessment for home care (not necessarily limited to  		Medicaid-funded services), so that applicants who met the need standard for  		nursing home placement could remain in the community with home services, if  		that was their preference, and if sufficient home care could be provided  		cost-effectively. </p>
<p>States also began to regulate access to publicly funded nursing home  		care more globally, by limiting the supply of certified nursing home beds. They  		established planning authorities which were empowered to issue, or to withhold,  		a "certificate of need" for all new nursing home construction or expansion of  		existing facilities. To qualify for a certificate, would-be developers now had  		to present evidence that there was significant unmet need for nursing home care  		in that area. As of 1989, all but eleven of 51 Medicaid programmes (the 50  		states plus the District of Columbia) had adopted "certificate of need"  		requirements. In addition, many states have announced moratoria, often lasting  		several years at a time, on all new nursing home construction. </p>
<p>Most states have established target ratios of nursing home beds per  		1,000 elderly, and there has been a tendency for "under- bedded" states come up  		to a ratio closer to the national average by allowing new construction, and for  		"over-bedded" states to bring theirs down by allowing older facilities to close  		without replacement. As of 1989, the national average of nursing home beds per  		1,000 elderly was 54.9, although at states level this still ranged from a low  		of 26.4 beds per 1,000 elderly in Nevada to a high of 106.4 in Iowa (Burwell,  		1992). </p>
<p>It is notable that opposite perceptions about nursing home access have  		coexisted in the United States. On the one hand is a widespread belief that  		nursing home care has been over-used. On the other, there are complaints that a  		shortage of available beds, and resulting waiting lists, make it hard to get  		into a desirable nursing home when individuals and families decide that  		placement is what they want. The wide variations in bed availability at local  		levels may have provided evidence supporting both views. In total, the national  		average of nursing home beds per 1,000 elderly people has stayed fairly stable  		over the past two decades, and the controls introduced in the later 1970s  		appear to have restricted further growth: the ratio reached a peak of 64 beds  		per 1,000 in 1976, declining to 53 in 1980, and in 1989 stood at 55 per 1,000  		elderly people. </p>
<h2>OTHER SOURCES OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR LONG-TERM CARE</h2>
<h3>Support for those in "board and care" homes</h3>
<p>Specialised residential care settings that are not certified as nursing  		facilities are referred to as "board and care" homes, and include a number of  		different types of setting, including those known as "personal care homes",  		"domiciliary care facilities" and "assisted living facilities". Elderly  		residents are expected to pay for these services out-of-pocket, with Social  		Security, private pension, or other personal income. However, cash assistance  		payments from either the federal SSI or state supplemental payments (SSP)  		programmes are a major source of financing of non-nursing home residential care  		settings for elderly people with low incomes. These payments are made directly  		to individual beneficiaries, although, in the case of SSP, eligibility for  		supplemental assistance and the level of payment is often contingent on use of  		a particular type of licensed residential facility. </p>
<p>In a few states, Medicaid also makes additional payments to board and  		care facilities, for example, for adult foster homes in Oregon, to provide for  		personal care services under the "home and community-based services" waivers or  		the personal care optional benefit. Unlike SSI and SSP payments, however,  		Medicaid covers only the personal care services that the facility provides over  		and above the basic rate for room and board. </p>
<p>The regulation of board and care homes is limited to requirements for  		state licensing. However, under the terms of the Social Security Act, no  		federal funds for health-related services are to be made to unlicensed  		facilities or to residents of unlicensed facilities. The ambiguity and  		resulting difficulty of enforcing this provision has given rise to calls for a  		more coherent federal policy on the regulation of board and care facilities.  		</p>
<h3>Other funding for home and community-based services</h3>
<p>There are several sources of federal and state funding for home and  		community-based services other than Medicaid. These include: </p>
<ul><li>the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), formerly known as Title XX;  		  </li>
<li>Title III of the Older Americans Act; and </li>
<li>State programmes without federal funding, which include additional  		  support for services for elderly and disabled people who are eligible for cash  		  assistance from the federal SSI programme. </li>
</ul><h4><i>Social Services Block Grant (Title XX)</i></h4>
<p>The origins of the SSBG lie in a 1956 amendment to the Social Security  		Act (SSA) which authorised dollar-for-dollar federal matching of state funds  		devoted to social services. Further amendments to the SSA, enacted in 1962,  		encouraged provision of social services specifically to the elderly. Between  		1956 and 1971, federal grants to the states for social services under the  		public assistance titles of the SSA grew from $194 million to $740 million, and  		in 1972 rose to $1.7 billion. When projections for 1973 indicated a potential  		increase to $4.7 billion, Congress imposed a $2.5 billion ceiling on federal  		expenditure on social services. </p>
<p>In 1974, Title XX of the SSA was enacted to consolidate federal funding  		of social services, and the share of federal to state funding was increased  		from 50:50 to 75:25. The amendment also required that 50 per cent of the  		federal share be used for services to those receiving social assistance (either  		AFDC: Aid for Families with Dependent Children -- or SSI: Supplementary  		Security Income) or who were eligible for Medicaid. The remainder of the  		funding could be used for people with incomes above this level, if they did not  		exceed 115 per cent of the state's median income. </p>
<p>The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) was established in 1981 in an  		amendment to Title XX. The SSBG replaced the Title XX formula of 75:25 federal  		to state funding with a single grant to each state based on a population  		formula. The SSBG also reduced federal reporting requirements and eliminated  		the restrictions on target populations, giving states greater discretion in  		deciding on whom and on what types of services to spend the funds, but within a  		fixed total grant. </p>
<p>Title XX was the main source of federal funding for home and  		community-based long-term care services throughout the 1970s, with most of the  		expenditure for services to frail elderly people being for home-maker and other  		domestic services. Following the introduction of the SSBG, states began to rely  		more heavily on Medicaid as the principal federal source of funding for home  		and community-based services, because funding opportunities via Medicaid  		expanded while SSBG funds became more restricted; since 1981, direct cuts and  		inflation have reduced the SSBG by nearly one-third in real terms. SSBG funds  		have also been more heavily called upon to serve other populations, for  		example, child day care for AFDC and other low-income families. Nevertheless,  		only three states spent no SSBG funds on services for the elderly in FY 1988.  		</p>
<h4><i>Title III, Older Americans Act</i></h4>
<p>The Older Americans Act was enacted in 1965. Title III established state  		and sub-state Agencies on Aging to plan and co- ordinate services to the  		elderly. Services are defined very broadly to include health, continuing  		education, welfare, recreation, home-maker services, counselling, referral,  		transport, housing and related services, nutrition services and multipurpose  		"senior centers". </p>
<p>To receive services funded under the Older Americans Act an individual  		only has to be aged 60 or older; no means test is applied. However, funding has  		never been sufficient to support a comprehensive programme of services on a  		"universal" basis, and targeting on terms other than income (or terms which are  		a near proxy) has occurred. The Older Americans Act has not been a significant  		source of funding for long-term care services as such, but Title III has been  		and remains the major source of finance for services promoting access to the  		community, such as "senior centers" and transport for both fit and frail  		elderly people. Title III has also been used to provide support for nutritional  		programmes, because of concerns that older people living alone, and/or with a  		low income, might not maintain a healthy diet. In 1989, just over half of all  		Title III programme funds were used to support nutritional programmes. </p>
<p>More recently, the network of sub-state organisations created by the  		OAA, the Area Agencies on Aging, has emerged as a focal point of the effort to  		achieve greater integration and co-ordination of services at the local level,  		through the creation of "single entry points" to the system for purposes of  		information and referral, and through assessment and case management  		activities. This is currently perhaps the most important contribution of OAA-  		supported activities to long-term care policy. </p>
<h2>SCALE AND COST OF CURRENT PROVISIONS</h2>
<h3>Nursing homes</h3>
<h4><i>Number of homes and residents</i></h4>
<p>There were estimated to be about 1.5 million residents of nursing homes  		on any given day in 1985, and of these slightly over 1.3 million were aged 65  		or more. This estimate, derived from the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey,  		uses a broad definition of "nursing home" which includes non-medical  		residential care facilities, on condition they have more than 3 beds and supply  		some "personal care". The survey definition therefore includes virtually all  		"board and care" homes. It does not include hospitals, mental hospitals, or  		facilities for the mentally handicapped. </p>
<p>The best measure to differentiate nursing-oriented "nursing homes" from  		other residential care facilities serving the frail elderly is federal  		certification as a nursing facility for Medicare or Medicaid. In 1985, 75.6 per  		cent of "nursing homes" were federally certified nursing facilities.  		Uncertified facilities tend to be very small, however, and only slightly over  		11 per cent of residents (170,000) were in non-certified facilities.  		Seventy-five per cent of "nursing homes" were private for-profit ventures, 20  		per cent were not-for-profit (<i>i.e.</i> run by churches or other charitable  		organisations), and 5 per cent were government-run. </p>
<p>As of 1993, HCFA survey and certification data for nursing homes  		indicated that there were 16,332 federally certified nursing facilities with  		1,656,302 beds. Of these 983 facilities (40,609 beds) were Medicare-certified  		only, 5,069 facilities (1,040,577 beds) were Medicaid-certified only, and  		10,370 facilities (575,116 beds) were certified for both programmes. </p>
<p>Estimates as of 1991, based on the National Provider Inventory, put the  		combined number of beds per 1,000 elderly in licensed nursing homes and board  		and care facilities at 61, of which 53 beds were in nursing homes and 8 beds in  		board and care facilities (Administration on Aging, 1994). </p>
<h4><i>Source and scale of financing</i></h4>
<p>The sources of payment for current residents of nursing homes in 1993  		were out-of-pocket payments (42 per cent), Medicaid (150 per cent), Medicare (1  		per cent) and other sources (7 per cent) (the latter including other government  		assistance or welfare, Veterans Administration, charitable support, and private  		mechanisms such "life care contracts" and private insurance). </p>
<p>In 1989, total national nursing home expenditures (not including  		facilities for the mentally handicapped) were $36.4 billion, of which $19  		billion (52.2 per cent) was paid privately, $14.3 billion (39.3 per cent) by  		Medicaid, $2.4 billion (6.6 per cent) by Medicare, and $0.6 billion (1.6 per  		cent) by other public sources. </p>
<h4><i>Resident characteristics</i></h4>
<p>Of nursing home residents in 1993, the average dependency level using  		ADL measurement was 3.9, out of a total of 6 ADLs measured -- bathing,  		dressing, eating, transferring, using the toilet room, and continence. About 60  		per cent had some mental impairment. </p>
<p>55 per cent of nursing home admissions were from an acute care hospital  		and 35 per cent of discharges were to hospitals. </p>
<h3>Home and community-based services</h3>
<h4><i>Access to services</i></h4>
<p>It is estimated from the National Medical Expenditure Survey that, in  		1987, formal home and community-based care services were used by about  		one-third of the 5.6 million elderly people reporting at least one ADL or IADL  		dependency (Short and Leon, 1990). Home-delivered services (including visiting  		nurse, personal care attendant and home-maker services, but not including  		meals-on-wheels) were used by 19.7 per cent of those aged 65 or over who had  		functional difficulties. More specifically, 8.1 per cent used home-makers from  		a health care or home care agency, or a helping organisation, or used paid  		domestic help (<i>i.e.</i> self-employed "independent contractors"). </p>
<p>With respect to community services, 7.3 per cent of elderly people with  		functional difficulties regularly attended "senior centers", 6.1 per cent used  		congregate meal programmes, 6.1 per cent regularly received meals-on-wheels,  		5.3 per cent used special transportation services for the elderly or disabled,  		and about 4 per cent received regular visits from helping organisations or  		professionals to check up on their well-being. The percentage using adult day  		care was well under 1 per cent. </p>
<h4><i>Expenditures</i></h4>
<p>Total home care spending on the elderly in 1989 was estimated by the  		Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) at $7.6 billion, of which $1.9  		billion (25 per cent) was Medicaid- financed, $2.1 billion (28 per cent)  		Medicare-financed, $2.4 billion (32 per cent) privately financed (out-of-pocket  		by users), and $1.2 billion (16 per cent) financed by other public programmes  		(SSBG, state-only programmes, Title III Older Americans Act and Veterans  		Administration). </p>
<p>Total <i>public </i>spending in 1992 on <i>non-professional </i>home and  		community-based services for the disabled elderly has been estimated at $6.4  		million, of which 69 per cent ($4.4 billion) was via Medicaid, 10 per cent  		under the Social Services Block Grant, 8 per cent under Older Americans Act  		programmes and 11 per cent under state source programmes. This represents a  		considerable real increase in public expenditure via Medicaid on this component  		of care within these three years. </p>
<h4><i>Specific types of home and community-based  		services</i></h4>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><i>Medicare Home Health Care</i>During calendar year 1990, 1.8  			 million of the elderly people enrolled with Medicare used home health services,  			 at a total cost of $3.5 billion. This represented an 88 per cent increase from  			 the total of 957,000 beneficiaries in 1980.In 1990, 47 per cent of Medicare  			 HHA visits were by registered nurses, 9 per cent by physical therapists, and 41  			 per cent by home health aides. About two-thirds of agencies supplying services  			 are non-profit agencies and one-third are for-profit agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Medicaid Personal Care Option</i>In January 1990, 30 states  			 provided personal care services as an optional benefit under their state  			 Medicaid plans. Of the estimated $1.9 billion spent under Medicaid for all home  			 care services for the elderly in 1989, about $1.2 billion (63 per cent) was  			 spent under the personal care services option. The number of recipients was  			 estimated in 1988 at about 264,000, representing a very high rate of growth  			 since 1980, when there had been 46,000 recipients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Medicaid Home and Community-based Care Waivers</i>In 1989, 36  			 states operated one or more waiver programmes for elderly and physically  			 disabled people enrolled in Medicaid. Total spending under HCBC waivers reached  			 $943 million in 1989, of which $312 million (33 per cent) was for services for  			 elderly and younger physically disabled people. The majority of expenditure on  			 waiver services was devoted to maintaining mentally handicapped people in the  			 community.</p>
</li>
</ol><h4><i>Title III, Older Americans Act</i> </h4>
<p>In FY 1989, federal expenditures under Title III were $715.5 million. In  		lieu of means-testing (which is prohibited under Title III), participants may  		be asked to make voluntary contributions, and in 1989, these amounted to just  		over $179 million (mostly for meals). Just over half of all programme funds  		($355.3 million) were used for nutrition services. Congregate nutrition  		services -- meals provided in settings such as senior citizen centres, adult  		day care programmes and housing projects for the elderly -- accounted for  		$254.7 million (72.4 per cent), while home-delivered meals ("Meals-on-Wheels")  		accounted for $100.6 million. </p>
<p>In 1987, amendments to the Older Americans Act allowed funds to be  		specifically targeted on in-home care for frail elderly people. Expenditure  		under this provision was $4.6 million in FY 1989. </p>
<h2>PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE</h2>
<p>In the last decade, a private long-term care insurance industry has come  		into being and grown rapidly in the United States. In 1983, only 12 companies  		offered private long-term care insurance and there were only 50,000 policies in  		force. By 1990, more than 130 companies were marketing private long-term care  		insurance and the number of policies sold exceeded 1.6 million. By the end of  		1991, more than 2.4 million policies had been purchased, a growth in the market  		of over 500 000 policies in one year. About 100,000 of these policies were  		existing life insurance policies which added long-term care coverage in 1991  		(Health Insurance Association of America, 1992). At the end of 1992, the number  		of private long-term care insurance policies purchased had grown to 2.93  		million from a total of 135 insurers, representing an average annual increase  		in policies sold of 29.4 per cent for the years 1987-92 (Coronel, 1994). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, because private long-term care insurance is normally  		purchased well in advance of the expected risk of nursing home use, it will be  		many years before benefits paid out under these policies affect sources of  		payment for nursing home care. Less than 1 per cent of current nursing home  		expenditures are being financed by private long-term care insurance. </p>
<p>Even in the longer term, the global effects on payment for care will  		probably be fairly modest. Projection of current trends suggests that between  		10 and 30 per cent of the elderly could have private long-term care insurance  		by the year 2020. If, at the top of the range of estimation, 30 per cent of the  		elderly have private long-term care insurance in 2020, then aggregate  		out-of-pocket expenditures for long-term care would be reduced by 6 per cent  		and Medicaid costs reduced by 3 per cent, by comparison with likely funding  		patterns if no elderly people had purchased their own insurance. For those  		holding private insurance, however, the impact of having these policies would  		be likely to be more substantial: they would be likely to reduce their  		anticipated out-of-pocket costs for nursing home care by about half. </p>
<h3>Partnerships between Medicaid and private insurance</h3>
<p>A policy issue of some debate in recent years has been whether the  		Federal government should allow states to establish "public/private  		partnerships" which offer Medicaid eligibility incentives for the purchase of  		private long-term care insurance. In the late 1980s, a private philanthropy,  		the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, funded eight states to develop a  		demonstration project along these lines, but the states were not able to obtain  		the necessary federal or Congressional authorisations. In 1991, however,  		Connecticut asserted that a provision in federal law permitting state  		discretion over aspects of Medicaid eligibility could be interpreted as  		providing sufficient authorisation for a state to implement a public/private  		partnership plan as part of Medicaid. Following a legal review, the Health Care  		Financing Administration agreed that the Connecticut plan could be implemented.  		</p>
<p>Under the Connecticut partnership plan, those who have purchased private  		long-term care insurance, who then enter nursing homes (or receive equivalent  		home care services), and who in time exhaust their private insurance benefits,  		can receive a credit against their Medicaid spend-down liability. Instead of  		having to spend-down their savings to the Medicaid allowable asset level  		(currently $2,000). they can retain an additional amount of savings equal to  		the amount paid out from their insurance policies. The Medicaid budget can  		therefore be said to "break even". Connecticut policy-makers believe that the  		plan builds in an incentive to protect personal assets by purchasing private  		long-term care insurance, and may reduce the surreptitious transfer of assets  		to other family members in order to gain Medicaid eligibility. Indiana and  		California have since implemented similar plans. </p>
<p>In February 1992, New York also amended its Medicaid plan to provide a  		different form of incentive for the purchase of private long-term care  		insurance. Under this plan, New York state residents who purchase a minimum  		amount of state-approved private long-term care insurance (which must provide  		three years of nursing home coverage, six years of home care coverage or an  		equivalent combination of both) may obtain immediate Medicaid coverage without  		spending down any of their assets if their private coverage is exhausted and  		they still require care. </p>
<p>These partnerships have been the cause of considerable political  		controversy. Some influential members of Congress have opposed them on the  		grounds that they allow relatively wealthy elderly people, and their heirs, to  		benefit from a programme (namely, Medicaid) that was intended to help poor  		people. In the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act, these Congressional critics  		succeeded in limiting Medicaid asset protection for purchasers of private  		insurance to the six states that already had partnership plans. In all other  		states, future partnership plans will be subject to mandatory estate recovery  		provisions. States may still elect to reward purchasers of private long-term  		care insurance by according them additional relief from Medicaid "spend-down"  		requirements. but this protection will be limited. While individuals will be  		able to retain funds and property during their lifetime, these assets may not  		be given away or bequeathed to heirs. </p>
<h2>THE DEBATE ON LONG-TERM CARE REFORM</h2>
<p>The U.S. long-term care system has come under increasing criticism from  		the late 1970s onwards. Concerns about the fragmentation and inadequacy of  		financing, particularly for non-institutional services, led in the first  		instance to substantial federal government investment in policy research and  		demonstrations that would point the way toward suitable reforms in financing  		and service delivery. </p>
<p>This research on long-term care of the frail elderly has taken four main  		forms: </p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p>National surveys of the elderly population in nursing home and  			 community settings, for example, the National Long-Term Care Surveys in 1982,  			 1984, and 1989. These have enabled the compilation of a substantial national  			 database to be compiled on needs, service and financing patterns, which both  			 provides good information on current trends and allows modelling of the impact  			 of future options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrations designed to field-test potential new policies and  			 programmes, the largest being the 10-site National Channeling Demonstration,  			 which field tested two models of case-managed home and community-based care as  			 an alternative to nursing homes (see Kemper <i>et al.</i>, 1986; and for a  			 critical commentary, Davies, 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluations to measure the efficacy of existing policies and  			 programmes in meeting goals, for example, evaluations of the cost-effectiveness  			 of Medicaid waiver services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue-oriented studies of various kinds, such as studies of the rate  			 of "spend-down" to Medicaid eligibility among nursing home residents.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Calls for long-term care reform initially focused mainly on a perceived  		bias toward institutionalisation. Critics maintained that inadequate public  		funding for home care caused excessive and unnecessary recourse to nursing  		homes. Recommendations for reform therefore centred on an expansion of funding  		for home and community-based alternatives to institutionalisation. During the  		1980s a number of legislative initiatives to expand home care funding were  		proposed in the Congress. The closest any proposal came to being passed into  		law was that of the late Congressman Claude Pepper, who argued for an expansion  		of Medicare home care coverage as part of the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic  		Coverage Act. </p>
<p>Although Pepper's initiative failed, the political support he had  		mobilised among older people was sufficiently compelling for Congress to set up  		the Bipartisan Commission on Health Care Financing Reform (known as the "Pepper  		Commission") to study and make recommendations about public funding for  		long-term care, as well as how to extend acute medical coverage to the  		estimated 37 million uninsured Americans under age 65. This was an important  		point in the developing momentum for reforms to the U.S. health system, among  		which proposals for long-term care reform by now loomed large. </p>
<p>By the time the Pepper Commission began its deliberations, advocates of  		long-term care reform were no longer quite so exclusively concerned with  		expanding public funding for home care. The earlier optimism that increased  		funding for home care would generate savings from reduced nursing home use,  		thereby allowing new alternative services at no additional budgetary cost, had  		faded. Findings from the "Channeling" and related demonstration projects, and  		the experience of the Medicaid waiver programmes, had lowered these  		expectations (Kemper <i>et al.</i>, 1986, 1987; Weissert <i>et al.</i>, 1988).  		</p>
<p>The recognition that nursing homes would remain a very significant part  		of the long-term care sector, even if other services became more widely  		available, strengthened support for improved public regulation of nursing  		homes, one early result of which was the nursing home reform legislation  		embodied in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (details of which are  		given earlier). </p>
<p>Criticism of the U.S. long-term care system had also broadened to  		include the financial problems of elderly people with incomes and savings above  		Medicaid eligibility levels, who required some protection against catastrophic"  		out-of-pocket costs for nursing home care. The growing interest in securing  		protection against the high out-of-pocket cost of nursing home care was first  		reflected in the emergence of the private long-term care insurance industry in  		the mid-1980s. Serious consideration was given by federal health authorities  		during the time of the Reagan Administration to income-related tax subsidies to  		stimulate the growth of private long-term care insurance and savings plans.  		However, analyses of the affordability of private long-term care insurance did  		not support the proposal that tax subsidies would be likely to stimulate  		insurance purchase or savings that would not otherwise occur. Because of these  		doubts, as well as anticipated opposition by the Treasury Department on the  		basis of cost, the Reagan Administration never formally took a position in  		favour of tax subsidies for private financing mechanisms. </p>
<p>By the late 1980s, most long-term care reform legislation being  		introduced in Congress included provisions for financing both home and  		community-based and nursing home care. Representative Stark proposed a  		comprehensive public insurance to take effect after the first two months of  		long-term care. However, most legislative proposals introduced in Congress  		recommended much more limited "front-end" or "back-end" public coverage of  		nursing home stays; in other words, public funding would be limited to the  		first six months or one year of nursing home care or, alternatively, would  		cover only the "catastrophic costs" associated with stays lasting more than two  		or three years. There were two reasons for these proposed limits on public  		coverage: one was to lower projected costs, and therefore the taxes needed to  		finance those costs; the other was to build a political alliance with the  		insurance industry by guaranteeing it a substantial role. </p>
<h3>The Pepper Commission Report</h3>
<p>The creation in 1988 of the Bipartisan Congressional Commission on  		Health Care Costs (more commonly referred to as the "Pepper Commission") was  		the first serious effort in Congress to achieve a politically viable consensus  		among both Republicans and Democrats concerning the best approaches for health  		and long-term care financing reform. However, it did not result in a single  		consensual report, but a majority report with a number of dissenting minority  		recommendations (Pepper Commission, 1990). </p>
<p>The main features of the plan supported by the majority of the Pepper  		Commission included: </p>
<ul><li>Home care coverage for all elderly and younger disabled persons with  		  severe (3 or more) Activity of Daily Living (ADL) impairments or significant  		  cognitive impairment. </li>
<li>Coverage of the first three months of nursing home stays with very  		  low cost-sharing. </li>
<li>Protection of up to $30,000 in savings against "catastrophic"  		  out-of-pocket expenses associated with nursing home stays of over 3 months  		  duration. </li>
</ul><p>The recommendations implicitly preserved a "gap-filling" role for  		private insurance, but did not include any provisions for tax incentives or  		other ways of promoting private insurance purchase. The Commission estimated  		the cost of its long-term care proposals at $42 billion in new public spending,  		over and above existing Medicaid expenditures for long-term care. </p>
<p>One dissenting Commission member argued in favour of a national health  		insurance plan, modelled broadly on the Canadian "Medicare" system. There has  		been a great deal of discussion during the last decade, in policy circles and  		in the mass media, over whether the U.S. should adopt the so-called "Canadian  		model" of public financing for health and long-term care (see, for example,  		Special Committee on Aging, 1984; Kane and Kane, 1985). While the Canadian  		approach has many admirers in the U.S., not all admirers have advocated a  		"Canadian model" for the U.S., in the belief that, for better or worse,  		long-term care reform in the U.S. can only evolve incrementally out of the  		current system. </p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Pepper Report. Congressional interest  		in Iong-term care reform coalesced around two legislative proposals. Support  		for these proposals polarised along party lines, thus fragmenting the attempt  		to arrive at a bipartisan proposal. One bill (S. 1668) was introduced in autumn  		1991 by the minority (Republican) members of the Senate Finance Committee, and  		proposed to take public long-term care financing out of Medicaid and create a  		new "Title XXI" to the Social Security Act. As a "welfare" programme,  		eligibility for public financing of long-term care would have continued to be  		means- tested; however, the means test for home and community-based care would  		have been more generous than under Medicaid, such that access to such services  		would be expanded. The second part of the Senate Finance Committee minority  		bill set out a system of public subsidies for private long-term care insurance.  		</p>
<p>The second bill (S. 2571) was put forward by the majority (Democrat)  		members of the Senate Finance Committee in April 1992 and essentially contained  		the recommendations of the Pepper Commission majority report. Initially, this  		bill contained specific recommendations for financing the expanded public long-  		term care benefits, including provisions for increases in inheritance tax, in  		Social Security payroll and self-employment taxes, and in taxes on unearned  		income (including Social Security benefits, interest on individual retirement  		accounts and pensions). These revenue-raising proposals proved so controversial  		that the bill was withdrawn and re-submitted. In the new version, specific tax  		proposals were replaced with a general statement to the effect that financing  		must come from taxes that are broad-based, progressive, and that have an  		equitable impact on every segment of the population. </p>
<h3>The Clinton Health Reform Plan</h3>
<p>On taking office in January 1993, President Clinton established a health  		care reform task force, which in turn set up a long-term care working group.  		This group developed four options for reform for the President's consideration,  		ranging from inexpensive, incremental expansion of existing Medicaid benefits,  		coupled with stronger regulation of private long-term care insurance, to  		comprehensive social insurance coverage of both nursing home and home and  		community-based services. The President chose to include the working group's  		"Option 3" in the health care reform plan announced in September 1993, although  		the long-term care provisions were entirely separate from the proposals for  		reform of acute health care funding (for which, see OECD, 1994). </p>
<p>The long-term care component of the President's health reform plan  		included the following features: </p>
<ul><li>A new federal and state programme to finance home and community-  		  based services for severely disabled people of all ages. </li>
<li>Federal regulation of private long-term care insurance and  		  clarification of relevant federal income tax law. </li>
<li>Modifications to the eligibility rules for Medicaid funding of  		  nursing home care, to make the means-test less restrictive. </li>
<li>Tax credits for personal assistance services, to reduce disincentives  		  on younger severely disabled people in taking up paid employment. </li>
<li>A demonstration programme to test methods of integrating acute and  		  long-term care. </li>
</ul><p>The proposed new programme for home and community-based long-term care  		would have been administratively separate from both Medicare and the private  		insurance coverage for acute health care that it was proposed to make available  		through corporate or regional health alliances. It would have been administered  		by the states, who would have been enabled to offer a wide range of benefits.  		The flexibility with respect to benefits extended to permitting states to  		provide cash payments or vouchers to eligible clients in lieu of payments to  		service providers. </p>
<p>The new programme would have been expected to supersede Medicaid as the  		main source of finance for home and community-based care for severely disabled  		people. However, federal matching payments would have continued to be available  		through Medicaid, at state option, to fund similar services for people whose  		disability did not meet the criteria for the new programme, on condition that  		those receiving these services have a low income. Medicaid would have continued  		to be the major programme providing coverage for nursing home services. All  		states would have been required to offer "medically needy" coverage. In  		addition, the President's proposal would have raised the personal needs  		allowance for nursing home residents from $30 to $50 per month and, at state  		option, permit nursing home residents on Medicaid to retain up to $12,000 in  		assets (rather than the current $2,000) (See also Chapter 19 for details of the  		Clinton proposals). </p>
<p>The American Health Security Act, incorporating the President's health  		care reform proposals, was introduced in both houses of Congress in November  		1993. After considerable debate, relatively little of which focused  		specifically on long-term care issues, and during which a number of competing  		health care reform bills emerged, it became clear that there was insufficient  		consensus in either chamber to pass any new health care measures into law (see  		OECD, 1996, on these debates). In September 1994, the Senate Majority leader  		formally abandoned the effort to pass health reform legislation in 1994. </p>
<h3>The state of the debate in 1995</h3>
<p>In the November 1994 Congressional elections, the Republican Party  		achieved majority control in both the House and the Senate for the first time  		in forty years. Based on press reports of exit polling of voters, public  		dissatisfaction with the President's health reform initiative was among several  		key factors responsible for the election results. By November 1994, many voters  		had come to the conclusion that the Clinton health reform plan would have been  		too extensive an overhaul of the existing health care system and that the  		government's role under the Clinton plan would have been too intrusive. </p>
<p>The Republicans interpreted their election victory as a mandate from the  		voters to move forward with the party's proposed legislative agenda, termed the  		"Contract with America". This outlined legislation that the Republican  		Congressional leadership was pledged to introduce within the first 100 days of  		the 104th Congress. Two of the eight proposed bills included initiatives  		related to long-term care. The proposed "Family Reinforcement Act" would create  		a $500 annual tax credit for families who brought dependent elderly parents or  		Grandparents to live in their homes. The proposed "Senior Citizens Fairness  		Act" included tax incentives for the purchase of private long-term care  		insurance. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the long-term care initiatives proposed in the  		Contract with America have not been put forward as health care reforms <i>per  		se</i>. Instead, they have been linked to wider philosophical themes that  		conservative Republicans have emphasised in recent years. One is the idea that  		public policy interventions are needed to restore "family values" because of  		the many cultural and other forces that are seen as undermining the family as  		an institution. Accordingly, the elder care tax credit proposal is part of a  		package of proposed tax incentives whose stated purpose is to strengthen the  		family. </p>
<p>Another wider theme is that the "welfare state" should be dismantled or,  		at least, significantly reduced. Conservative Republicans contend that the  		size, cost and intrusiveness of government bureaucracy has burgeoned since the  		1960s due to a multiplication of programmes aimed at lower income groups. It is  		further contended that these programmes serve only to reinforce a "culture of  		poverty" among recipients, while neglecting the needs of the middle class  		families who are required to pay for the system. The position of the new  		Republican majority in Congress is that middle class families do not need or  		want more government benefits, but could purchase the services they need in the  		market-place, if only the government would "get off their backs",<i> i.e.</i>,  		stop taking so much of their disposable income away in taxes. The proposed tax  		subsidies for private long-term care insurance follow this line of reasoning,  		being part of a package of tax breaks for senior citizens intended to leave  		them with more money with which to take decisions about how to meet their own  		needs, including those for long-term care. </p>
<p>As of early 1995, the future for reform of the long-term care financing  		and delivery system is highly uncertain. The long-term care proposals in the  		Republican's Contract with America are profoundly different philosophically  		from most of those considered following the Pepper Commission report or in  		President Clinton's health reforrn plan, and the areas of disagreement between  		Congressional Republicans and Democrats concerning approaches to long-term care  		reform have become greater than in the previous Congress. </p>
<p>Major long-term care reform still seems unavoidably linked to the fate  		of a broader health reform effort to find a way to expand medical cost coverage  		for the uninsured while controlling the rise in health expenditures. Total  		annual expenditures for health care (including long-term care for the elderly)  		now amount to over 14 per cent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Because the  		likelihood of a continuing political stalemate is so high, and because the  		focus of debate in Washington is now on cutting taxes, many observers believe  		that the focus of health reform efforts will shift to individual states. </p>
