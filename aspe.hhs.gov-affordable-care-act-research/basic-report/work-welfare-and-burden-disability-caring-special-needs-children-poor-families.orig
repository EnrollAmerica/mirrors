<p>This paper addresses issues which arise at the juncture of welfare and  		disability policies. Using preliminary data from a recent survey of current and  		recent AFDC recipients in California, we find that disabilities and chronic  		health problems affect the mothers or children in 43 percent of all households  		in the AFDC system. The presence of one or more children with disabilities or  		chronic illnesses is found to have an impact on the economic well-being of  		families, with increased levels of direct hardship reported by families caring  		for one or more severely impaired children. Potential causes of higher levels  		of hardship are examined by considering the impact of direct expenses  		associated with the care of the child(ren) and reductions in the mother's  		probability of paid employment. SSI receipt is found to have a modest  		antipoverty effect for families with special needs children, reducing the  		prevalence of poverty and extreme poverty for families even after the  		additional direct costs of caring for these children are considered.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Means-tested cash transfer programs are the focus of continuing  		controversy in state and federal welfare "reform" efforts. Two programs that  		benefit poor children have become particularly prominent targets of public and  		political controversy: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs provide means-tested cash  		assistance for children in poor families. AFDC, the federal/state cash  		entitlement program for families, has been the target of nearly continuous  		reform efforts since its rapid expansion in the 1970s. SSI, the federal cash  		assistance program for disabled individuals, has been, until recently, a  		relatively small and uncontroversial program. Growth in the number of child  		claimants in the past six years has propelled this program into the political  		spotlight and motivated a variety of "reform" proposals.</p>
<p>One group of potential claimants will be particularly affected by AFDC  		and SSI reforms: low-income families that care for disabled and chronically ill  		children. Depending on their income and disability status, these families may  		participate in one or both programs. Dual program participation and the special  		needs of disabled children create complexities with important implications for  		welfare policies. Families eligible for benefits under either program, for  		example, have incentives to pursue higher benefits through SSI; this appears to  		have consequences for state welfare and SSI caseloads. Those who care for  		seriously impaired children often incur higher medical and other costs; the  		frequency and size of these costs has implications for benefit levels and  		equity between the programs. These same parents may face special barriers to  		employment, self-sufficiency and participation in work preparation activities  		arising from the extra care needed by their disabled children; this has  		implications for work tests, time limits and other welfare reform policies.  		Additional complexities arise if parents in these families are themselves  		disabled or in poor health.</p>
<p>Although child and adult disabilities have obvious relevance to welfare  		policies, we still know relatively little about the extent and impact of  		disabilities and chronic health problems among welfare recipients. We lack good  		data on the prevalence of physical disabilities in the welfare population.  		Estimates of the prevalence of other, less easily measured limitations such as  		cognitive limitations, substance abuse and behavioral dysfunctions are even  		more limited. We also lack detailed analyses of the impact of these limitations  		on families' economic well-being. There are few studies of the impact of  		disabilities on women's employment; research is particularly scarce on  		disabilities in the population of single, low-income mothers who constitute the  		majority of welfare recipients. Estimates of the cost of caring for children  		with disabilities, in terms of direct expenditures and foregone earnings, are  		even less well developed.</p>
<p>This paper steps into this vacuum by addressing questions about  		individual functioning which arise at the junction of welfare and disability  		policies. Using preliminary data from a survey of current and recent AFDC  		recipients in California, we examine the prevalence and economic impact of  		children's health conditions and disabilities on poor families. First, we  		review the outstanding policy issues and current research related to these  		issues. Next, we pose the research questions. We then describe the data and  		methodology and present the results. Finally, we draw guarded conclusions and  		discuss their relevance to outstanding policy questions.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>Defining childhood disabilities, and estimating their prevalence and  		impact on families' economic well-being are critical first steps in the design,  		delivery, and evaluation of public assistance programs for families who care  		for children with special needs.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> But these tasks are complicated by  		difficulties associated with the early identification of disabilities,  		ambiguities in program eligibility criteria, and disagreements about  		reporting-categories, definitions, and survey methodologies. In the following  		sections we review some of the outstanding controversies mi income assistance  		programs for poor families with special needs children, and what is currently  		known about the prevalence and impact of their special needs.</p>
<h3>Prevalence and Severity of Childhood Disabilities</h3>
<p>Estimates of the prevalence of childhood chronic illness and disability  		vary widely, depending on the data source, the researcher, and the population.  		Drawing on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), for instance,  		Newacheck and Taylor (1992) estimate that 30 percent of children under age 18  		suffer from chronic illnesses when relatively mild conditions with little  		functional impact, such as mild allergies, are included. They estimate that  		only 9 percent of children suffer from moderately severe chronic conditions and  		2 percent suffer from severe chronic illnesses. From that same data, Aday  		(1992) concludes that 15 percent of children have chronic illnesses causing  		major limitations in activities or serious pain or discomfort. Both Aday's and  		Newacheck and Taylor's estimates are based on data that exclude cancer and  		mental health problems. Using data from the 1990 and 1991 panels of the Survey  		of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which does include mental health  		conditions but has fewer measures of mild health conditions, McNeil (1993)  		estimates that approximately 5 percent of United States children under age 15  		suffer from disabilities and 1 percent have a severe disability.</p>
<p>The relative prevalence of disability also varies according to the  		researcher's definition of disabling conditions and the data collection  		methods. Using the NHIS data, Newacheck and Taylor report respiratory allergies  		as the most prevalent condition (afflicting about 10 percent of all children),  		followed by chronic ear infections, asthma, eczema and skin allergies, hearing  		or visual impairments, and speech defects. Drawing on the SIPP data, which  		included questions to elicit information about both physical and mental  		disabilities, McNeil concludes that learning disabilities are the most common  		disability, followed by speech problems, mental retardation, asthma, and mental  		or emotional disorders. Children with learning disabilities accounted for 29  		percent of the total number of disabled children in McNeil's study. About 13  		percent reported speech disorders, followed by mental retardation (7 percent),  		asthma (6 percent), and mental or emotional disorders (6 percent).</p>
<p>In general, disabilities increase with age, and, among children,  		disabilities are more common among boys (Newacheck and Taylor 1992; McNeil  		1993). Children in low-income families are also more likely to suffer chronic  		illnesses and disabilities (Newacheck and McManus 1988; McNeil 1993). Newacheck  		(1988) estimates that children in low-income families face a 40 percent higher  		risk of being disabled. The causes of this higher prevalence are presumed to be  		multiple and interacting. Children in low-income families are more likely to  		five in poor neighborhoods where they are exposed to heightened environmental  		risks. They are more likely to be low birth weight and to suffer other  		complications associated with poor maternal nutrition, health behaviors, and  		health care. Children in poor families are also less likely to receive the  		adequate early nutrition, housing, and health care that might help prevent the  		development of serious disabilities and health conditions.</p>
<h3>Cash Assistance Programs for Families with Disabled  		Children</h3>
<p>Although estimates vary, both national prevalence studies and program  		data indicate that a substantial fraction of low-income families care for one  		or more children with special needs. The needs of these families for income  		support, medical care, and special services are at the center of national  		policy debates. In particular, poor families with disabled children may qualify  		for benefits from two different cash assistance programs which have become  		lightening rods for political controversy: Aid to Families with Dependent  		Children (AFDC) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI).</p>
<p>The primary source of continuing income assistance available to  		low-income families with children is AFDC. Through AFDC, eligible families  		receive monthly cash payments and access to Medicaid benefits. The federal  		government pays a portion of the administrative expenses and benefit costs, but  		the states administer the AFDC program and set payment standards. Although it  		is not targeted to low-income families with disabled children, the AFDC program  		represents a major potential source of cash and medical assistance to these  		families.</p>
<p>Established by 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act, the federal  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash benefits to  		individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. In most states, the program also  		provides access to Medicaid benefits. Although the SSI program is primarily  		directed to adults, children who meet the income and disability requirements  		can receive SSI benefits.</p>
<p>The SSI program, and particularly its benefits for children, has become  		the target of extensive public and political concern in recent years. Two  		concerns have been paramount in the public debate: program growth and equity in  		benefits between the SSI and AFDC programs.</p>
<p>The dramatic recent growth in the number of children receiving SSI  		benefits has done the most to push the program to the forefront in policy  		debates. In December 1974, shortly after it was first implemented, the program  		provided benefits to 70,849 children, who made up 2 percent of total SSI  		beneficiaries. By December 1993, SSI provided benefits to 770,501 children--13  		percent of total beneficiaries and more than twice the number of children  		receiving benefits in 1989 (Social Security Administration 1993). Since April  		1992, SSI has paid more in federal benefits to disabled children than it has  		paid to aged beneficiaries, with this difference growing each year (Smeeding  		1994).</p>
<p>The sources of this growth are multiple. A period of dramatic growth  		followed the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in <i>Sullivan v. Zebley</i>, which  		modified eligibility determination procedures to allow a functional, individual  		assessment of children's disabilities. Other factors may have also contributed  		to program growth. These include an increase in the numbers of disabled  		children in the underlying population, the impact of the Zebley decision in  		calling attention to a more comprehensive definition of disability for  		children, and SSI outreach activities undertaken since 1989 in response to  		Congressional mandates (U.S. General Accounting Office 1995). There is also  		anecdotal evidence that the declining benefits available through the AFDC and  		local general assistance programs have created incentives, for families and for  		state and local welfare workers, to qualify children for the relatively more  		generous SSI program (Committee on Childhood Disability 1995).</p>
<p>The growth in the SSI program for children has fueled debate about  		equity in the treatment of economically disadvantaged families eligible for the  		AFDC or SSI programs. Low-income families with disabled children have two  		potential sources of cash assistance: AFDC and SSI. A single individual may not  		receive benefits from both programs, but a family with a disabled child can  		combine benefits from both. The disabled child can receive SSI benefits while  		the rest of the household receives AFDC (U.S. House of Representatives 1993).  		If a child is eligible for either AFDC or SSI benefits, the child's family is  		frequently better off if the child receives SSI benefits and the rest of the  		household receives AFDC.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> For example, in 1993 a child eligible for the  		full federal SSI benefit would have received $434 per month. In most states,  		this amount was significantly greater than the marginal increase in AFDC  		benefits that would have resulted from including the child in the AFDC family  		unit. In the median state, the maximum monthly AFDC benefit in 1993 increased  		by $96 when family size increased from one to two and by $57 when family size  		increased from two to three. In California, a high benefit state, the monthly  		increases in benefits were $197 and $120 respectively (U.S. House of  		Representatives 1993).<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The basis for this difference in cash aid is now under considerable  		scrutiny. The legislative history of Public Law 92-603, which created the SSI  		program, suggests that Congress enacted this benefit structure because it  		accepted the argument that the needs of low-income families with disabled  		children were greater than the needs of other low-income families. Benefits for  		children were added to the SSI program in a political compromise. The House  		Ways and Means Committee initially added these benefits, explaining that  		disabled children living in low-income households were among the most  		disadvantaged of Americans, that they had greater needs than other children,  		and that, therefore, they were deserving of special help.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> The Senate at first rejected this  		view, but benefits for children were ultimately accepted in a House-Senate  		conference.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> These needs  		may include direct expenditures for transportation to distant hospitals or  		sources of medical care, extra laundry, babysitting, special child care, and  		respite care, home modifications, and other medical expenses not paid by public  		or private insurance (see Consortium for Children with Disabilities 1994;  		Hippolitus 1985; Stein and Jessop 1985). Families with disabled children may  		also suffer economically through the loss of employment income resulting from  		the need to take care of the disabled child (Hobbs, Perrin and Ireys 1985;  		Lansky et al. 1979). </p>
<h3>Do Families with Disabled Children Incur Special  		Costs?</h3>
<p>Information about the additional costs faced by families with disabled  		children is central to policy decisions for AFDC and SSI. A small literature on  		the out-of-pocket expenses associated with care of a disabled child suggests  		that some fraction of families with special needs children do incur direct  		costs caring for these children. For some, these costs are quite high. However,  		both the probability of any expenses and the average expenditures have been  		found to vary substantially.</p>
<p>Analyzing data from the 1980 Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure  		Study, Newacheck and McManus (1988) report that disabled children on average  		used more medical and health care services and incurred higher health care  		expenditures than non-disabled children. They also found that families with  		disabled children experienced uncovered, out-of-pocket expenses substantially  		higher than those of families with no disabled children. Out-of-pocket  		expenditures, like medical expenditures in general, were low or non-existent  		for many disabled children but very high for a minority. Out-of-pocket expenses  		were lower for low-income disabled children, reflecting perhaps the more  		comprehensive coverage provided by Medicaid (Newacheck and McManus 1988) and/or  		budget constraints in these families.</p>
<p>Jacobs and McDermott (1989) reviewed six studies of the costs associated  		with caring for children with specific diseases or disabling conditions.  		Looking at home costs, travel costs, and equipment costs, these studies  		reported average annual expenditures ranging from $334 for children with cystic  		fibrosis to $4,012 for children with cancer. Urban Systems Research and  		Engineering (1979) investigated extra expenditures incurred by families with  		SSI children and found that SSI families averaged $27.69 per month ($332.28  		annually) in out-of-pocket expenses related to the child's disability in 1978.  		The most commonly reported categories of additional costs were transportation,  		clothes, and medical care items and services not covered by Medicaid. Again,  		these costs were not evenly distributed across families; some families  		experienced no costs while others experienced substantial costs.</p>
<h3>Disabilities, Welfare "Dependence" and Work</h3>
<p>Benefit differentials between the SSI and AFDC programs may also be  		justified on the basis of the indirect costs and economic impact, in reduced  		employment and earnings, associated with the care of disabled children.  		Reductions in work to care for children, if widespread, also have important  		implications for the AFDC program. Since the mid-1980s, the focus of welfare  		reforms has shifted decisively toward the reduction of welfare dependence and  		increased work tests for recipients. Welfare policies aimed at reducing  		"dependence" on public assistance are complicated by the fact that parents who  		are the policy targets have both caretaking and economic responsibilities for  		their children. Welfare policies that limit aid and impose rigorous work  		requirements raise even more complicated issues in the case of families who  		care for disabled children and may face heightened caretaking demands  		associated with their children's special needs.</p>
<p>A number of analysts have examined the dynamics of welfare use, the  		heterogeneity of households participating in various welfare programs, and  		individual and family factors that predict the duration of welfare receipt and  		probability of earnings exits (Bane and Ellwood 1983; Plotnick 1983; O'Neill,  		Bassi and Wolf 1987; Blank 1986a, 1989; Blank and Ruggles 1993; Gottschalk and  		Moffitt 1994; Hoynes and MaCurdy 1994). Other researchers have explored the  		prevalence of work and of work-related exits from welfare (Pavetti 1992; Harris  		1992; Spalter- Roth et al. 1992).</p>
<p>This body of research suggests that both welfare receipt and work  		attachment are volatile for low-income parents. A majority of welfare  		recipients leave welfare for work, or combine welfare with work during some  		portion of their spells on welfare. Spells of work, like welfare, are often  		short, however. And several individual and family characteristics are  		consistent predictors of longer spells on AFDC and lower prospects for  		work-related exits: younger, less-educated women, women with more children,  		those eligible for higher AFDC benefits and those facing higher unemployment  		rates are the most at risk. None of these studies have specifically examined or  		considered families with severely disabled children.</p>
<p>Blank (1989b) has also shown that, among female-headed households with  		children, the health status of the head affects AFDC participation. A woman who  		reports limits on physical activity is more likely to participate in an AFDC  		program. Spalter-Roth et al. (1992) and others have documented lower labor  		force participation among AFDC recipients with disabilities and poor health,  		and among those with more children.</p>
<p>Research on the impact of disabled children on parents' work effort is  		less complete. A few small surveys of families with severely disabled children  		suggest that parents of these children report both additional time spent in  		care giving and lost employment income as a result of their children'  		disabilities. Leonard et al. (1992) report that primary care givers spent from  		0 to 20 hours per day caring for severely disabled children, with a median of 4  		hours and 42 minutes. They found that caregiving time varied positively with  		out-of-pocket expenses and negatively with the caregiver's hours worked. In a  		study of children receiving cancer treatment, Lansky et al. (1979) found that  		16 of 32 families reported lost wages due to the child's condition, with a  		median loss of $68.94 in weekly income.</p>
<p>Studies using larger, nationally representatives samples have not always  		demonstrated that additional caretaking burdens result in lower labor force  		participation among women. In related research on the effect of caring for an  		elderly parent, a number of these studies show that such caretaking  		responsibilities cause no reduction in hours worked or employment (Wolf and  		Soldo 1994; Couch et al. 1995; but see Ettner 1995). Researchers examining care  		for disabled children have also reached ambiguous conclusions. Using data from  		the 1972 National Health Interview Study, Salkever (1982) found that a disabled  		child had a significantly negative effect on women's labor force participation  		only among white, two-parent families. In a 1995 study, Wolfe and Hill examined  		labor force participation among a sample of single mothers from the 1984 panel  		of the SIPP. They looked at the impact of a variety of health-related factors  		on the mother's decision whether or not to work. Two of their models found that  		the presence of a disabled child significantly reduced the probability of  		employment.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In one of the few studies to directly examine the relationship between  		children's disabilities and work and welfare receipt, Acs, and Loprest (1994)  		use data from the 1990 SIPP to estimate the impact of children's disabilities  		on parents' probability of exiting welfare by any means, exiting welfare  		through work, or combining work with welfare. They find that "compared to women  		with healthy children, women with disabled children are more likely to exit  		AFDC within a year, more likely to work while on welfare and less likely to  		leave AFDC through work." None of these results is statistically significant,  		however. In a second model, Acs and Loprest look at each of three age-related  		categories of functional limitation. They report a patchwork of results with  		only one statistically significant finding: women whose children are limited in  		their school work are more likely to be employed while on welfare than women  		with healthy children.</p>
<h2><a name="question" id="question">RESEARCH QUESTIONS</a></h2>
<p>Public assistance for families with disabled children has come under  		scrutiny in the larger political debate about welfare reform. Current proposals  		suggest reforms for SSI which range from virtual elimination of cash benefits  		for children to protection of the entitlement for both cash assistance and  		health insurance. Proposals for reforming AFDC consistently call for reductions  		in benefits and imposition of more stringent time limits and work tests. These  		reforms have significant implications for low-income families who care for  		children with chronic health problems and disabilities. National incidence  		studies suggest that these conditions are more common in poor families. High  		levels of disability have also been noted among parents in the AFDC  		program.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the additional knowledge that would be needed for careful  		scrutiny of these proposals is both incomplete and dated. Estimates of the  		prevalence and severity of childhood disabilities and illnesses vary widely  		depending on the analyst, definitions, and data source. Estimates of the  		economic impact of children's special needs on families is even more  		problematic. Information about the additional costs faced by families with  		disabled children is critical. While we know that some families incur costs,  		the direct out-of-pocket costs associated with childhood disabilities appear to  		vary widely across types of disabilities and types of families affected, and  		the best studies for measuring these costs are now more than 15 years old. We  		also lack good estimates of the impact of caring for children on families'  		earnings: the indirect costs of foregone earnings if parents stay home to care  		for their special needs children and the direct costs of substitute child care  		if parents go to work outside the home.</p>
<p>In this paper we raise some of the questions which arise at the  		intersection of these welfare, disability, and poverty issues. We then present  		preliminary findings from a recent survey of current and recent AFDC recipients  		in California, and we use these data to address three sets of questions.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>First what is the prevalence of chronic health conditions and  			 disabilities among families in the AFDC program? How many families participate  			 in the AFDC and SSI programs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, how do families with affected children fare in comparison to  			 other AFDC families? How does receipt of SSI affect families' economic  			 well-being?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, what are the direct costs (in out-of-pocket expenditures)  			 and indirect costs (through reductions in labor market activity) associated  			 with the care of children with health conditions and disabilities? How do these  			 affect poverty status?</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="method" id="method">METHODS</a></h2>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>This paper analyzes preliminary data from Wave II of the (California)  		AFDC Household Survey. This is one of several databases constructed through the  		joint effort of the Department of Social Services of the State of California  		and the University of California Data Archive and Technical Assistance program.  		Respondents for the AFDC Household Survey were selected from the California  		Assistance Payment Demonstration Project (APDP) sample. The APDP sample is a  		stratified random sample of 15,000 AFDC recipient households selected from four  		California counties (Los Angeles, Alameda, San Joaquin, and San Bernardino) in  		November 1992.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> The  		sample included both single-parent households and two-parent households  		qualifying for benefits through the AFDC-UP program.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> Two-parent households were deliberately  		oversampled to increase the number of such cases available for analysis.</p>
<p>The data analyzed here are <b>preliminary</b> data from Wave II of a  		telephone survey of a subsample of 2,250 English and Spanish speaking  		households randomly selected from the APDP sample to receive telephone  		interviews.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> The AFDC  		Household Survey is a panel survey. Initial (Wave I) interviews began in  		October 1993; a follow-up interview was fielded, beginning in late spring 1995.  		In both waves, the adult female caretaker for AFDC child(ren) was asked  		detailed questions about family and household composition, parents' labor  		market activities, household income, and use of social services. Wave II of the  		survey also includes a set of questions to identify families with chronically  		ill or disabled children. These data are designed to allow researchers to  		assess the type and severity of the child's disabilities, to measure expenses  		associated with the child's condition, to identify children participating in  		the SSI program, and to examine the impact of the child's condition on a  		parent's labor market participation and the family's financial well-being.</p>
<p>In this paper we present data from the first 1,320 Wave II interviews  		completed as of December 1995.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> These interviews are still in progress, so  		the findings presented here are preliminary and subject to change after data  		collection is completed. Data are weighted in this analysis to adjust for  		differences in sampling fractions by strata and for survey completion  		rates.</p>
<h3>Sample Limitations</h3>
<p>Several important limitations in the generalizability of this sample  		should be noted. The sample for this study was designed to represent the AFDC  		population in four counties in California. While we believe this generalizes  		well to the welfare population in that state, it may not represent families in  		the AFDC system elsewhere in the country. Because important groups were not  		included in this round of surveys, notably recent immigrants, caution must be  		used even in drawing conclusions about California. The sample has another  		important limitation. As a point in time sample, it "samples the flow" of all  		welfare cases. These findings may represent the experiences of families who  		were receiving welfare at a point in time. As substantial research in this  		field has demonstrated, however, their experience will not represent all  		families who ever enter the welfare system. In particular, we would expect this  		point in time sample to represent the experiences of long-term, more highly  		disadvantaged welfare recipients (who dominate AFDC caseloads at a point in  		time), and to underrepresent the larger number of short-term, relatively more  		advantaged families who cycle through the welfare system more quickly.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that this sample represents the experience  		of only a fraction of SSI recipient families. Although the SSI program, like  		AFDC, is means-tested, its income tests and benefit reduction rates are  		considerably more generous. The sample of families represented here, those poor  		enough to qualify for both AFDC and SSI, are thus a small and especially  		disadvantaged subset of all families who receive SSI for disabled children.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>The first stage of analysis reported below is descriptive. Of the 1,320  		cases available for analysis, we exclude 53 families who were no longer caring  		for AFDC recipient children at the Wave II contact. For the remaining 1,267, we  		describe the frequency and severity of children's conditions, their  		participation in the SSI program, and the incidence of chronic illnesses and  		disabilities among adults and children on the household level. To answer the  		question of relative economic well-being, we compare household income, access  		to health insurance, and several measures of economic well-being across  		households assumed to have different "caretaking burden" associated with  		children's special needs: households with no special-needs children versus  		those with one or more than one such child, and households with no  		special-needs children versus those with moderately or severely impaired  		child(ren). Variable measures and definitions are described in detail in  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p>We then turn our attention to two possible sources of economic  		disadvantage for families with special-needs children. We consider  		out-of-pocket expenditures relating to children's health or disabling  		conditions, first by category of expenditure and then in terms of their impact  		on family economic status.</p>
<p>The final step in the analysis examines reductions in labor force  		participation among women with special-needs children. We use logistic  		regression to estimate the impact of the number and severity of children's  		special needs, and the impact of the receipt of SSI, on a dichotomous measure  		of labor force participation (currently working at a regular job). Our model is  		the reduced form specification of the standard static labor supply model  		(Killingsworth 1983; Wolfe and Hill 1995). (We discuss our specification in  		more detail in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.) Coefficients can be  		interpreted as changes in the log-odds that mothers worked, given a one unit  		change in the predictor variable. Taking the natural anti-log of the  		coefficient allows a more intuitive interpretation as an estimate of the change  		in the odds of working relative to one (at the sample mean).</p>
<p>The presence of a special-needs child is expected to reduce mothers'  		odds of working through at least two routes: first, by imposing an additional  		caretaking burden, and second, by increasing transfer income through SSI. We  		use two separate models to estimate the caretaking burden associated with the  		related but distinct dimensions of the number of affected children and severity  		of need. Model one measures the caretaking burden associated with the number of  		affected children by including two dummy variables for the presence of (1) only  		one child or (2) two or more children with chronic illnesses or disabilities.  		Model two measures burden by the severity of the child(ren)'s condition,  		including two dummy variables for the presence of (1) only moderately impaired  		child(ren) or (2) at least one severely disabled child. In an effort to  		separate the impact of the caretaking burden from the income effect of SSI, we  		use nested hierarchical models to first estimate the probability of work  		without controlling for SSI receipt, and then to re-estimate each model adding  		a dummy variable for receipt of SSI by any family member other than the  		respondent. In each specification we control for respondent's demographic and  		human capital characteristics, and other family income. (See <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a> for further discussion of the estimation issues  		and variables.)</p>
<h2><a name="result" id="result">RESULTS</a></h2>
<h3>Characteristics and Program Participation</h3>
<p><b>Prevalence of Conditions</b>. Chronic health problems and  		disabilities were frequent in this sample of AFDC recipient families: over 40  		percent of households had either a disabled mother and/or at least one child  		with special needs.</p>
<p>As <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows, 391 (31 percent) adult female  		caretakers reported that they had a physical or mental disability that limited  		their ability to work. Women in 267 households (21 percent) reported the  		presence of at least one child with a chronic health problem or disability. One  		hundred ninety-eight (16 percent) reported one special needs child in the  		household, and 69 (5 percent) reported more than one.</p>
<p>When adult disabilities and children's special needs are considered  		together, 43 percent of households were affected: 145 households (11 percent)  		had a nondisabled mother and at least one child with a special need, 269 (21  		percent) were headed by a disabled mother with no disabled children, and 122  		households (10 percent) had both a disabled caretaker and a child with a  		chronic health condition or disability.</p>
<p>The prevalence of any limiting conditions for children (21 percent of  		households) and adults (31 percent), is much higher in this sample than the  		recent estimates by Acs and Loprest (1994). Using 32 months of SIPP data, they  		report that 8 percent of households that received AFDC had a child with a  		limiting condition and 18 percent had a disabled mother. Differences in the  		estimates may reflect differences in sample construction (longitudinal SIPP  		data versus point-in-time California data) and differences in the definition of  		limiting conditions. These may represent upper and lower bound estimates of the  		true prevalence of serious limitations in AFDC households.</p>
<p>The category of the first disabling condition for all children  		identified with special needs<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> is summarized in <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a>, which also compares the incidence in this sample to estimates from  		nationally representative samples of children. Asthma and other respiratory  		diseases were the most common chronic condition for children in AFDC recipient  		families, affecting 6 percent of children. Behavior and learning disorders  		together formed the next most common category, involving 2 percent of children.  		Approximately 1 percent of children were affected by other physical or health  		impairments (cancer, epilepsy, heart problems and cerebral palsy), and 1  		percent had mental retardation or developmental delays (including autism).  		Other categories of impairment each involved 1 percent of children or less. (An  		additional 2 percent of children were identified as having special needs but  		their conditions were not coded at the time of this writing.)</p>
<p>Comparison of these figures with those from nationally representative  		surveys is difficult, given widely different categories, methodologies, and  		conditions. In comparison to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey  		(Newacheck and Taylor 1992), which collected data on chronic health conditions  		affecting children under age 18, asthma was reported slightly more often in  		this sampl6 of low-income families; visual and hearing impairments and other  		physical or health conditions were reported less frequently in the AFDC  		Household Survey. (The 1988 NHIS did not collect information on mental  		conditions.) In comparison to the 1992 Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (McNeil 1993), physical disabilities were more frequently  		reported in our sample and mental conditions were less frequently  		reported.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> A much  		greater proportion of our respondents reported asthma as a disabling condition,  		and a substantially smaller proportion reported behavior and learning disorders  		and speech impairments.</p>
<p><b>Severity of Conditions</b>. Although disabilities and chronic  		illnesses were common, the majority were mild to moderate by our definition of  		severity. Children's conditions by the severity of impairment are profiled in  		<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>. Overall, 44 percent of children's conditions  		were coded as "severe" because the child required substantial additional help  		with daily activities, the condition interfered substantially with the child's  		attendance at school, or the child received SSI Severe impairment was most  		common in visual and hearing impairments (67 percent), other physical or health  		conditions (66 percent), mental retardation (89 percent), and mental illness  		(53 percent). Another 44 percent of children were coded as moderately impaired  		because they required some additional help with daily activities, were limited  		in usual activities or mobility, attended special education, or missed some  		school due to the condition. The majority of behavior and learning disorders  		(52 percent) and respiratory diseases (54 percent) fell into the moderate  		category. A final 12 percent of children were coded as mildly impaired; they  		met the conditions of the initial screen for chronic illnesses and/or disabling  		conditions, but parents did not report additional functional impairments. The  		category most frequently coded as mildly disabling was speech problems (41  		percent).</p>
<p>Considered on the household level, 134 (11 percent) of all families  		cared for at least one child with a severe disability or illness. Disabilities  		were also common among adult caretakers and significantly correlated with the  		presence of a special-needs child. Overall, 391 adult caretakers (31 percent)  		reported that they had a chronic condition that limited or precluded  		employment. As shown in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, adult disabilities were  		significantly more common in households with one or more special needs  		children.</p>
<p><b>SSI Program Participation</b>. Although chronic health problems and  		disabilities were common in this sample of disadvantaged families,  		participation in the SSI program was relatively uncommon. Overall, 87 families  		were receiving SSI for their children, representing 7 percent of all families  		and 24 percent of families with special-needs children. Even among children  		coded as severely impaired by our measures, less than half were current SSI  		recipients.</p>
<p>Children's participation in the SSI program is summarized in  		<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>. SSI was received by more than half of children  		in only two categories of special needs: mental retardation and developmental  		delays (69 percent of children) and vision and hearing impairments (67  		percent); 46 percent of children with other physical and health conditions were  		SSI recipients. SSI receipt was relatively rare for children with conditions  		which were less frequently coded as severely impairing: only 16 percent of  		those with asthma and 16 percent of those with speech impairments were SSI  		recipients. Although frequently meeting our criteria for severely impaired,  		only 23 percent of those with behavioral and learning disabilities, and 15  		percent of those with a mental illness received SSI.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Parent and Family Characteristics</b>. As <a href="#table3">Table  		3</a> shows, women with special-needs children differed significantly from the  		other women in our sample on some but not all demographic. The average  		respondent in the AFDC Household Survey was 35 years old, with less than a high  		school education and 2.17 children. Thirty-three percent (33 percent) of  		respondents were African American, 37 percent were Latino, and 25 percent were  		white/European American.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> One quarter of all women were currently  		living with a spouse or partner.</p>
<p>Differences between those with and without special-needs children were  		generally nonsignificant for respondents' age, age of first AFDC receipt,  		marital and cohabitation status. Women with special-needs children did differ  		significantly from women without such children with respect to their own health  		characteristics. As discussed above, women with special-needs children were  		more likely to rate their health as poor, and they were more likely to report  		that they personally had a disability watch limited or prevented work. The  		proportion reporting poor health or a disability was highest among those with  		more than one disabled child.</p>
<p>Women with disabled children also had on average more children; not  		surprisingly, parents with more than one disabled child also had more total  		children. The probability of having disabled children in the family differed  		significantly by race and ethnicity. African American families were more likely  		to have one or more special-needs children, and to have moderately or severely  		impaired children. Both Latino and European American families were  		under-represented in all categories of families with disabled children.</p>
<h3>Economic Well-Being</h3>
<p>Families with special-needs children were more likely to rely on welfare  		and appeared to fare worse than other families on several measures of material  		hardship. Participation in the SSI program helps explain higher incomes in some  		families. Even with relatively more generous SSI benefits, however, families  		with special-needs children did not move far from poverty, and they continue to  		report more hardship than families with healthy children.</p>
<p>Overall, the families in this sample were very poor. Average family  		income, including Food Stamps, was $1,125.11 in the prior month. This is $38.00  		below the federal poverty line for a family of four. <a href="#table4">Table  		4</a> compares average family incomes, standardized for family size, among  		families with and without special-needs children.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> Incomes differed for families with one or  		more children who had special needs, although differences never achieved  		statistical significance. Families with no disabled children and those with one  		special-needs child had similar incomes, after adjusting for family size; those  		with more than one special-needs child had less income per family member.  		Income differences were small and nonsignificant when families were compared by  		the severity of the child's condition.</p>
<p><b>Welfare Use</b>. All families in this sample received AFDC for at  		least one child when the sample was drawn at the end of 1992. By the time of  		the Wave II contact in 1995, families were beginning to leave the AFDC system.  		Overall, 72 percent of families had received AFDC in the month prior to the  		interview and 69 percent had received Food Stamps.</p>
<p>Participation in means-tested welfare programs was significantly higher  		for those families caring for disabled and ill children, and participation  		increased with the number and severity of special needs. Eighty-three percent  		of families with one affected child, and 95 percent of those with two or more,  		were still receiving AFDC. The fraction of families in the AFDC system was  		slightly higher than the sample mean for those families with mild to moderately  		affected children (78 percent), and substantially higher for those with  		severely impaired children (93 percent). Trends were similar although less  		dramatic for receipt of Food Stamps.</p>
<p>Families caring for disabled and ill children were also more likely than  		other families to live in subsidized housing and to have Medi-Cal or Medicare  		coverage. While slightly less than one-quarter of all families lived in  		subsidized housing or received housing vouchers, from 35 to 39 percent of those  		with one or more than one disabled child, respectively, had housing assistance.  		The probability of receiving subsidies increased to 31 percent for those with  		moderately disabled children and 41 percent for those with any severely  		impaired children. Since enrollment in Medi-Cal (or in some instances,  		Medicare) is automatic for individuals in the AFDC and SSI programs, it was not  		surprising to find that health insurance coverage was much more common for both  		adults and children in families that included special-needs children.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> Overall, 70 percent of adults  		and 77 percent of children had public or private health insurance. If there was  		at least one disabled child in the house, 85 to 93 percent of children and 79  		to 82 percent of adults were covered. If any children were severely impaired,  		coverage rates increased to 96 percent for children and 91 percent for  		adults.</p>
<p><b>Material Hardship</b>. Regardless of welfare status, most of the  		families in this sample were poor, and indicators of economic hardship were  		common. Overall, nearly two-thirds had incomes at or below the poverty line;  		just over three-quarters were living at or below 125 percent of poverty.</p>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> describes several measures of direct  		hardship. In 19 percent of all families children had gone hungry in the time  		since the Wave I interview, and in 25 percent adults had gone without food due  		to a lack of money. Depending on subsidy status, 5 to 7 percent of families had  		faced eviction, 18 to 21 percent had been late with their rent on two or more  		occasions, and 2 to 3 percent had at least one experience of homelessness. As  		noted earlier, many parents reported poor health. Health problems and use of  		emergency medical care were frequent among children also. Nearly one-third of  		families had taken a child to the emergency room, 6 percent had children  		hospitalized, and 8 percent reported that children went without needed medical  		care.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In comparison to families with no disabled children, those with  		special-needs children fared even worse on these measures of hardship. The  		fraction of families reporting that children went hungry in prior months more  		than doubled for those with special-needs child(ren); reports of adults going  		hungry were 16 to 24 percentage points higher. There was some evidence that  		families with disabled children had more evictions, utility shutoffs, and  		homelessness, although differences here were inconsistent. Families with any  		special-needs children were also much more likely to report health problems and  		unmet health care needs among their children: two to four times as many  		reported at least one overnight hospitalization and three to four times as many  		reported that their child had gone without needed medical care. On most  		indicators, material hardship increased with the number of special-needs  		children in the family and with the severity of the child(ren)'s chronic health  		problem or disability.</p>
<h3>Special Expenses</h3>
<p>Measures of economic well-being suggest a paradox: families with  		special-needs children appear to do no worse than other families in terms of  		income and access to health insurance. By direct measures of hardship, however,  		they fare worse than other families. One source of economic hardship for  		families with special-needs children not taken into account in measuring  		poverty status may be the direct cost of caring for these children such as  		special diets and clothing, medical and other equipment, medications,  		therapies, and transportation to special services. We would expect that these  		costs, if not covered by health insurance or other forms of assistance, place a  		particular burden on low-income families.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent National Research Council (NRC) study (Citro and  		Michael 1995) on measuring poverty recommends that out-of-pocket health care  		expenses be taken into account by subtracting them from income when determining  		poverty status. The NRC did not, however, go so far as to recommend that other  		health-related expenses be taken into account. We estimate that health care  		costs are only half of the extra costs of caring for a disabled child.</p>
<p><a href="#table6">Table 6</a> shows the frequency and amount of  		out-of-pocket expenses reported by families with special-needs children. About  		half of families with one or more special-needs child(ren) reported  		out-of-pocket expenses associated with a child's disability or illness in the  		month preceding the interview. Expenses ranged from $6.00 to $665.00, with an  		average of $130.98 across those families who incurred any costs.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> As would be expected, families with more  		than one disabled child reported higher expenditures (an average of $155), as  		did families with a severely disabled child or children (averaging $163) (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>).</p>
<p>SSI receipt did not increase the probability that families would report  		out-of-pocket costs, but it did increase the dollar amount of these  		expenditures (<a href="#table7A">Table 7A</a>). Among families with one  		special-needs child, 47 percent of those without SSI and 43 percent of those  		with SSI reported costs; for families with more than one such child, about 65  		percent reported expenditures. Average monthly expenditures, for families who  		reported costs were $26 higher for those who received SSI for one special-needs  		child ($139) than for those who did not, and $248 higher for those with more  		than one special-needs child, at least one of whom received SSI (from $74 to  		$322).</p>
<p>Across all families with disabled or chronically ill children, the most  		common category of expense was unreimbursed medical care and medications, for  		which 26 percent of families incurred expenses averaging $43.19 (among those  		with any expenses; see <a href="#table6">Table 6</a>). Other frequently  		reported expenses were for special child care arrangements (20 percent) and  		special food (16 percent).</p>
<p>These results are consistent with the results of earlier studies by  		Urban Systems Research and Engineering, Inc. (1979) and Newacheck and McManus  		(1988). They suggest that a substantial proportion of families with disabled  		children incur disability-related expenses in any given month, and for some  		families these expenses are very high. Given the constrained economic  		circumstances of the families in this sample, out-of-pocket expenditures might  		be most usefully understood in relation to family resources. For those with any  		costs, the extra expenses related to caring for special needs children consumed  		10 to 12 percent of <i>total</i> family income (cash and Food Stamps) for  		families with one and more than one involved child, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="#table8">Table 8</a>, <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> and  		<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> suggest the impact of those expenses on family  		poverty, by comparing poverty rates for families with special-needs children,  		adjusted for the out-of-pocket expenses directly associated with their  		children's conditions. For families with mild to moderately involved child, the  		fraction of families living at or below the poverty line increased from 67  		percent to 69 percent after expenses were considered; for families with  		severely involved child(ren), an additional 15 percent of families had incomes  		at or below poverty line when direct expenditures for children's special needs  		were considered (from 44 percent to 59 percent).</p>
<p>The impact of out-of-pocket expenses seemed most dramatic for the  		poorest families. About one-quarter of families with healthy children lived at  		or below 75 percent of the poverty line. When expenditures were considered, the  		fraction of families with moderately involved children living in extreme  		poverty increased from 29 percent to 43 percent; the fraction of those with  		severely involved children who were this poor rose from 18 percent to 29  		percent.</p>
<p>The extent to which these expenses were offset by SSI, particularly for  		the poorest families, is also notable (see <a href="#table8A">Table 8A</a>). In  		families with only healthy children, 66 percent were living at or below the  		poverty line. Among those with special needs children and no SSI, 68 percent to  		88 percent were living at or below poverty after expenditures were considered  		(depending on the number of involved children). For those did receive SSI for  		their disabled children, in contrast, only 36 percent of those with one  		involved child and 57 percent of those with two or more were at or below  		poverty after adjusting for expenditures. Again, the impact was particularly  		evident among the poorest families: the percentage of families with special  		needs children who were extremely poor (living below 75 percent of the poverty  		line) dropped from between 47 percent and 66 percent, among those without SSI,  		to less than 30 percent among those whose children were SSI recipients.</p>
<p>As would be expected for a means-tested program, the effect of SSI  		receipt was modest for relatively better off families. Even with SSI, families  		did not move far from poverty and economic insecurity. Once expenditures were  		considered, 78 percent to 90 percent of families without SSI, and 77 percent to  		83 percent of those in the SSI program, still had incomes at or below 125  		percent of poverty.</p>
<h3>Labor Force Participation</h3>
<p>Parents' labor force activities and earnings are a second important  		factor in families' economic well-being that may be affected by children's  		special needs. Bivariate comparisons of labor force participation (<a href="#table9">Table 9</a>) suggest that the presence of children with special  		needs considerably depressed parents' labor force activity, particularly among  		mothers.</p>
<p><b>Employment</b>. The proportion of women holding a regular job and the  		proportion who worked at all in the previous month were significantly and  		substantially related to the number of disabled children in the family.  		Thirty-one percent of all mothers were working in a regular job when contacted,  		and 34 percent reported some paid work in the prior month. In contrast, only 26  		percent of mothers reporting one child with a health problem or disability, and  		4 percent of those with two or more affected children, were currently working  		in a regular job. Labor force participation also declined along with the  		severity of children's special needs: 27 percent of those whose children were  		mildly to moderately limited were working, but only 14 percent of those whose  		child(ren) had severe impairments were in the labor force. Trends were similar  		although less pronounced for spouses and partners of those respondents who were  		currently cohabitating. Overall, 60 percent of men had regular jobs at the Wave  		II interview. Employment declined slightly for those in families with one (58  		percent) and substantially with more than one (39 percent) special-needs child;  		employment was also lower among men in families with moderately (58 percent)  		and severely (45 percent) involved children.</p>
<p>Reduced labor market activities translated in much smaller contributions  		of earnings to family income. Twenty-seven percent of income in all families  		came from the earnings of the respondent (mother) or her spouse or partner. In  		families with special needs children, earnings accounted for 7 to 20 percent of  		income (depending on the number of children). In families with one or more  		severely limited children, only 9 percent of family income came from adults'  		earnings.</p>
<p><b>Murtivariate Analysis</b>. The reduction in parents' labor force  		activities may be directly related to the extra burden of caring for children  		with special needs and to problems relating to the availability and cost of  		special needs child care. The reduction may also result wholly or in part from  		other individual or family factors. Mothers who report having special needs  		children may differ in other ways that reduce their propensity to work--for  		example, they may have lower human capital or poorer health themselves. We  		would also predict a reduction in paid labor, regardless of caretaking burden,  		in response to the income effect of additional transfer income through the SSI  		program, which is available only to those families with disabilities.</p>
<p><a href="#table11">Table 11</a> reports the results of multivariate  		analyses of mothers' employment as a function of her human capital and family  		characteristics, transfer income, and the special needs of her children. (Means  		and standard deviations are provided in <a href="#table10">Table 10</a>). We  		use nested logistic regressions to estimate the total impact of having  		special-needs children in the family (models 1a and 2a), and the marginal  		impact of the caretaking burden after controlling for the effect of SSI (models  		1b and 2b). Models are described more fully in <a href="#appendB">Appendix  		B</a>.</p>
<p>In all specifications, mothers' human capital characteristics were  		significant in expected directions. The odds of paid employment increased  		significantly with years of education. Mothers who reported their health as  		poor and those with children under the age of six were significantly less  		likely to be in paid employment. Latina women were significantly more likely to  		be working (with European Americans as excluded category). AFDC benefit rules  		favoring work had a significant positive impact in all four estimations. Other  		controls for household composition, marital status, and race were  		nonsignificant.</p>
<p>In the first step of the nested models, measures of caretaking burden  		were significant in expected directions. Before controlling for SSI receipt  		(model 1a), the odds of working were reduced by approximately one-third  		(OR=.644, p&lt;.07) for mothers with one special-needs child, and by more than  		90 percent for women with more than one child with special needs (OR=.096,  		p&lt;.01). When a dummy for receipt of SSI by anyone in the family other than  		the mother was added in model 1b, the coefficient was large in the expected  		direction (negative) but nonsignificant. After controlling for the income  		effect of SSI, the dummy for having more than one special needs child continued  		to predict a nearly 90 percent reduction in the odds of working (OR=.111,  		P&lt;.01). The coefficient for having only one such child remained negative,  		but was much smaller in magnitude and statistically nonsignificant in this  		specification.</p>
<p>Similar although less robust results were observed in the second set of  		models, which measured caretaking burden in terms of the severity of the  		child's disability. When estimated without controlling for SSI (model 2a), the  		coefficient for the presence of a moderately limited child or children was  		negative but nonsignificant. The presence of one or more severely involved  		children significantly reduced the odds of working by about two-thirds  		(OR=.357, p&lt;.05). When the dummy for SSI was added in model 2b, it was large  		but nonsignificant and the explanatory power of the disability variables was  		reduced.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> The presence  		of a severely impaired child was seen to reduce the odds of working by about  		half (OR=.446, p&lt;.08). The coefficient for the presence of a moderately  		impaired child or children was both smaller in magnitude and  		nonsignificant.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that the presence of chronically ill and disabled  		children has a significant negative impact on mothers' labor force  		participation, even after controlling for differences in women's human capital  		characteristics, household configuration, and other income. The number of  		children with special needs and the severity of those needs were significant in  		explaining reductions in work, SSI receipt also had the expected negative  		impact on mothers' labor force participation, although the measure was not  		statistically significant. Because the receipt of SSI is contingent on the  		presence and severity of family members' disabilities (children or partners),  		the SSI variable may also pick up a portion of the reduction in labor force  		participation related to the extra care of a chronically ill or disabled child.  		These estimations thus provide upper and lower bound estimates of the true  		impact of the caretaking burden associated with special-needs children on  		women's participation in any regular job. It should also be noted that these  		are estimates of the most dramatic impact of special-needs children on mothers'  		paid employment More limited adjustments--in the form of reductions in the  		hours of regular work among those who were employed or intermittent absences  		from work due to children's needs--are not reflected in this measure.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Data from this survey of current and recent AFDC recipients in  		California suggest four initial conclusions about chronic illness and  		disabilities in this population and their impact on families' economic  		well-being.</p>
<p>First, in this sample of highly disadvantaged families, chronic health  		conditions and disabilities were common. Just over 20 percent of households  		reported caring for at least one child with special needs. When conditions  		affecting mothers and children were considered, over 43 percent of households  		were found to have a child with special needs, to be headed by a disabled  		mother, or both. Since this sample can be expected to overrepresent longer term  		AFDC recipients, this may represent an upper bound estimate of special needs  		among welfare participants.</p>
<p>Chronic conditions were defined broadly in this survey, and the special  		needs of children and associated caretaking burdens for parents can be expected  		to vary substantially even among families with affected children. Two  		categories stood out in our analyses: 5 percent of families were caring for  		more than one child with chronic difficulties, and nearly 11 percent of  		families had at least one child who met our criteria for a severe disability  		that substantially interfered with the child's regular activities.</p>
<p>Health and disabling conditions affected a substantial fraction of  		children in this sample; many fewer participated in the SSI program. Barely 7  		percent of all children, and about one quarter of those with identified  		disabilities or chronic illnesses, were receiving SSI. This suggests that a  		considerable proportion of potential SSI recipients are not yet enrolled in the  		program and raises the possibility of additional demand for program  		benefits.</p>
<p>The second notable finding is that families with special-needs children  		were much more likely to rely on public welfare and appeared to fare worse than  		other families on several measures of material hardship, despite having similar  		per capita family incomes and better access to health insurance. Overall, the  		families in this sample were quite poor, with average incomes (including  		transfers and in-kind benefits) that did not reach the poverty line for a  		family of four. Economic hardship was frequent, in the form of hunger, housing  		problems, and limited access to health care. Families with special-needs  		children were more likely to report hardship on these measures, and hardship  		increased with the number of affected children and with the severity of  		children's impairments.</p>
<p>These findings suggest something of a paradox: families with  		special-needs children had about the same income, on average, as other  		families. But these same families seemed to be doing worse on direct measures  		of well-being. Our third major finding concerns the possible source of this  		hardship in actual expenses incurred caring for disabled children and  		reductions in earnings associated with their care.</p>
<p>Half of families reported out-of-pocket expenditures in the prior month  		for the care of chronically ill and disabled children. Most commonly, they paid  		for medical care and medications that were not covered by insurance; other  		frequently reported expenses included special child care arrangements and  		special food and diets. Among families who did incur special costs,  		expenditures averaged $132 overall, and $155 to $163 for those with more than  		one ill or impaired child or any severely impaired children. Because this  		sample was restricted to current and recent AFDC recipients, and the survey  		questions probed for the marginal, extra expenses associated specifically with  		the child's special needs, we consider these figures to be conservative  		measures of the costs of caring for ill and disabled children. Even as a  		lower-bound estimate, $132 or more may represent a substantial financial burden  		for low-income families.</p>
<p>The magnitude of burden is seen in the impact of these expenses on  		poverty status. Out-of-pocket expenses for special-needs children increased the  		fraction of families with income at or below the poverty line as much as 15  		percentage points, depending on the number of children and severity of their  		needs. The impact of expenses was particularly evident among the poorest  		families. About one-quarter of families with healthy children were living at or  		below 75 percent of the poverty line. Twenty-nine to 43 percent of families  		with special needs children were this poor once the extra costs of caring for a  		special needs child were considered.</p>
<p>Mothers in families with special-needs children were also less likely to  		be working. When background and income factors were controlled, the presence of  		special-needs children was associated with a 36 percent to 90 percent reduction  		in the odds that mothers worked (depending on the number of affected children);  		the presence of severely involved children depressed the odds of work by 64  		percent. The receipt of SSI appeared to explain part of this reduction in work  		effort. But mothers with multiple special-needs children, and those caring for  		severely impaired children, continued to have a 55 percent to 90 percent  		reduction in the odds of regular employment even after the income effect of SSI  		was controlled. This estimation captures the most dramatic impact on labor  		force participation. The 15 percent to 27 percent of mothers with special-needs  		children who did hold regular jobs may also have reduced the hours they worked  		in response to the special needs of their children.</p>
<p>A fourth conclusion to be drawn from these analyses is that SSI appears  		to be reasonably well targeted and moderately effective in reducing poverty for  		families with disabled children. Less than one-quarter of children with any  		identified disabilities or chronic illnesses were receiving SSI, and receipt  		was highest among children with conditions that appeared most disabling. When  		family incomes were adjusted to reflect out-of-pocket costs of caring for  		special-needs children, the fares who received SSI for their children were much  		less likely to be poor and extremely poor than similar families who did not  		receive SSI. Although SSI reduced poverty for a portion of these families, the  		impact was still modest and concentrated on the poorest families.  		Three-quarters of families with .SSI still had incomes at or below 125 percent  		of poverty.</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>The conclusions from this study provide some insight on issues in  		welfare, SSI and disability policy. Some important limitations must be noted.  		As noted earlier, this sample can be strictly generalized only to four counties  		in California. Even more importantly, it represents a particularly  		disadvantaged subset of families in the AFDC and SSI programs. Because it is a  		point-in-time sample of AFDC cases, it can be expected to overrepresent  		long-term and more highly disadvantaged welfare recipients. And because  		families must be quite poor to qualify for AFDC, the families in this sample  		who also receive SSI for their special needs children represent the most highly  		disadvantaged families in the SSI program more generally.</p>
<p>These point-in-time data also cannot isolate the causal relationships  		connecting disabilities and economic hardship. In some cases, children's  		illnesses and disabilities probably represent an exogenous shock to families'  		economic well-being. The financial costs and caretaking burdens associated with  		children's conditions may compromise the economic well-being of families  		already struggling at the margins of economic stability.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that children's impairments have a more complex,  		multidirectional association with poverty. The prevalence of illnesses and  		disabilities in this sample of current and recent AFDC recipient households  		suggests that these conditions are not entirely exogenous to families' economic  		situation. Children growing up in poor families may be at greater risk for  		contracting illnesses associated with environmental conditions (e.g., asthma  		and cancer), for incurring disabilities associated with poor health care and  		health behaviors (e.g., low birth weights and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome), and for  		developmental disabilities associated with early life experiences. The presence  		of special needs children may thus be both cause and consequence of economic  		hardship.</p>
<p>A third and related possibility is that our indicators of children's  		special needs reflect underlying problems in families which are expressed in  		both poor economic status and poor health and developmental outcomes for  		children. The consistently worse status of families with more than one involved  		child, and those with both a disabled mother and one or more special needs  		children, might signal the interaction of health, functional, economic and  		social problems.</p>
<p>With these cautions in mind, we would offer the following comments on  		current policy issues which arise at the intersection of the AFDC and SSI  		programs.</p>
<p>First, extra assistance appears warranted for at least some of the  		families who care for children with special needs. On average, these families  		were doing worse than others on several direct measures of economic well-being.  		Many were incurring expenses associated specifically with their children's  		illnesses and disabilities. There was evidence that mothers were also less  		likely to work and thereby contribute earnings to the family.</p>
<p>The SSI program appears to have a modestly beneficial anti-poverty  		impact for families with disabled children. Families with disabled children who  		received SSI had higher incomes and were less likely to have incomes below the  		poverty line. This assistance benefited this group of families in relation to  		other poor families in our sample, particularly the poorest families. It was  		rarely a windfall, however; even with SSI benefits, the large majority of  		families were still hovering near the poverty line. And families with  		special-needs children continued to report high levels of direct economic  		hardship.</p>
<p>This study also supports efforts to target SSI assistance. Although  		chronic health problems and disabilities affected a substantial fraction of all  		families, the impact was consistently more dramatic for the smaller subset of  		families who faced more substantial caretaking demands. In this study, we  		measured these demands rather crudely by comparing families with more affected  		children and those with more severely impaired children. Even using this rough  		proxy of need, these families fared the worst on indicators of hardship, had  		the highest out-of-pocket expenses, and showed the most dramatic reductions in  		work.</p>
<p>A final policy concern, in both the SSI and AFDC programs, is that of  		"dependency" or long- term reliance on welfare assistance. The reduction in  		labor force participation among mothers in this sample suggests that  		participation in welfare programs may indeed be long-term for many families  		caring for children with special needs. It is not at all clear, however, from  		this or other research, that this reflects welfare dependence. To the extent  		that mothers in these families cope with additional caretaking responsibilities  		which make them less available for outside employment, it may be unrealistic to  		expect rapid transitions from welfare to self-sufficiency. There is no evidence  		in these data that there were strong incentives for families to choose  		continued welfare receipt over work, or that participation in the AFDC and SSI  		programs was financially rewarding for these families. They continue to be  		poor, and to experience more hardship than other families. Policies which  		indiscriminately reduce or eliminate assistance, without careful regard for the  		direct and indirect costs of caring for ill and disabled children, are likely  		to fail to have the intended impact on self-sufficiency and may greatly  		exacerbate hardship for an especially disadvantaged group of children.</p>

<h3>Chronic Health Conditions and Disabilities</h3>
<p>Wave II of the AFDC Household survey included questions designed both to  		identify children with chronic health conditions and disabilities, and to  		measure the caretaking burdens which these conditions might have imposed on  		adults. We defined children's special needs broadly, to identify chronic health  		impairments, physical and mental disabilities. We considered "caretaking  		burden" along two related dimensions: the number of children in the family with  		chronic problems, and the severity of those problems.</p>
<p>Children with chronic health problems and disabilities were identified  		by asking respondents whether any of their children.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> (1) had a chronic health problem--physical,  		emotional, or mental--that limited the amount or kinds of things that he or she  		could do; (2) had a disability or handicapping condition that limited the  		amount or kind of things he or she could do; or (3) received SSI benefits. We  		identified a household as including a child or children with chronic conditions  		if the respondent answered yes to any of these three screening questions. Thus,  		we screened broadly to include activity-limiting chronic illnesses, and  		emotional, mental, and physical conditions which could produce a moderate to  		severe functional limitation.</p>
<p>For each child identified as having a chronic illness or disabling  		condition, respondents were asked to identify up to two specific conditions  		(diagnoses) causing the child's impairments. To measure the extent of  		limitation, and associated caretaking burden, respondents were also asked a  		series of questions regarding functional limitations and use of special health  		and educational services. These questions were based on questions in the 1992  		National Health Interview Survey, the topical module on children's disability  		designed for the Survey of Income and Program Participation, and a 1978 survey  		of households with SSI children undertaken by Urban Systems Research and  		Engineering Inc. Appendix <a href="#tableA1">Table A1</a> summarizes our  		categorization of the severity of children's conditions as mild, moderate, or  		severe, based on functional limitations.</p>
<h3>Economic Well-Being</h3>
<p>Family income was measured for the prior month. Family was defined to  		include the respondent, her resident spouse or partner, and children for whom  		she had economic responsibility: resident biological children, step children,  		or children for whom she received AFDC. Income included earnings (respondent's  		pre-tax earnings and respondent's spouse or partner's pre-tax earnings), public  		cash transfers (AFDC payments, unemployment insurance payments, SSI benefits),  		private cash transfers (child support payments, money from friends, relatives  		or other sources), and in-kind public transfers (food stamps). The same total  		family income can produce very different standards of living depending on  		family size due to intra-family transfers and economies of scale (see Buhmann  		et al. 1988). Because we were interested in income as a measure of comparative  		well-being across family groups, we standardized income for family size by  		dividing total monthly income by the square root of family size (see Buhmann et  		al. 1988).</p>
<p>The survey also probed for direct indicators of economic well-being.  		Respondents were asked whether there had been times (since Wave I interview)  		when children had not gotten enough to eat or when the respondent (and her  		spouse or partner) had not gotten enough to eat. With respect to housing,  		respondents were asked if they had been late with rent or mortgage payments  		more than twice, or had experienced an eviction, a utility shut-off, or a  		period of homelessness, since their Wave I interview. The survey also collected  		information about health, health insurance, and use of medical care for the  		respondent and one randomly selected child in each family. Respondents were  		asked whether adults and child(ren) were currently covered through private or  		public health insurance (Medicaid or Medicare). They were also asked a series  		of questions about use of medical care (by adults and children) in the period  		since the first interview: whether they had sought care in an emergency room,  		spent one or more nights in the hospital, or gone without needed care  		entirely.</p>
<h3>Disability-Related Expenditures</h3>
<p>To measure the direct financial impact of caring for children with  		special needs, the survey included a series of questions about out-of-pocket  		expenditures for the additional or special needs of child(ren) with chronic  		problems. Questions were adapted primarily from Urban Systems Research and  		Engineering, Inc.'s 1978 survey of households with SSI children. We were  		particularly interested in expenditures which were not covered by health  		insurance or public programs.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked whether they had experienced direct out-of-pocket  		expenses related directly to their children's special needs in the month  		preceding the interview and, if they had experienced costs, the amount. We  		measured costs by summing expenditures reported for special clothes or shoes,  		special transportation, health care, and medicine not covered by Medicaid or  		insurance, special child-care or babysitting, and any other special  		expenses.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>It should be noted did measurement in this area is problematic for  		several reasons. Survey respondents may not be able to remember or accurately  		report all expenditures. This is particularly true in surveys such as this  		which ask for only a portion of expenditures, and probe for the marginal  		additional expenditures which are related to children's special needs. For this  		low-income sample, measurement may be compromised further by families'  		financial constraints. Actual out-of-pocket expenditures will reflect both  		children's needs and families' limited ability to meet those needs. For these  		reasons, we assume the estimates from this study will be conservative. The  		expenditures reported by these low-income families should be interpreted  		cautiously as indicators of spending under conditions of financial  		constraint.</p>
<h3>Labor Force Participation</h3>
<p>Survey questions probed for several indicators of parents' labor force  		participation. Respondents were asked whether they were currently employed in a  		"regular" job. Because the labor market attachments of low-income parents and  		those with young children are often volatile, the survey included questions  		about any work (at "odd jobs") in the prior month, and any paid work in each of  		the months since the Wave I interview. Respondents were also asked to report on  		the labor market activities of their resident spouses or partners.

<h3>The Model</h3>
<p>Economist's standard, static labor supply model forms the conceptual  		underpinnings of our analysis of labor force participation. In this model,  		individuals choose the combination of market work and non-market activities  		which allows them maximum utility with respect to their consumption of goods  		and leisure (Killingsworth 1983). Women's labor force choices are affected by  		factors such as available market work and wages; availability of income from  		other sources (husband's earnings, property or other unearned income);  		productivity of time spent in other work; and household tastes (Salkever 1982).  		We estimate a reduced form specification of this model in which mother's labor  		force participation is a function of structural, demographic, and human capital  		variables identified in studies of AFDC recipients and their labor force  		participation. The model presented here adds variables designed to capture the  		effects of the presence of a disabled child or children and of different  		characteristics of these children.</p>
<p>We estimate the effect of having a disabled or chronically ill child on  		mother's labor force participation, measured as a dichotomous variable with a  		value of 1 if the respondent was currently working at a regular job for pay at  		the time of the Wave II interview and 0 otherwise. We use four dummy variables  		to measure the presence of one or more disabled children in the family and the  		severity of their disabling conditions. These are designed to capture the  		differences in caretaking burden that are associated with children's special  		needs and to proxy the associated barriers to employment outside the home for  		mothers of chronically ill and disabled children. Mothers' labor force  		participation is hypothesized to decrease as the number of affected children  		increases from none to one or more than one, and to decrease as the severity of  		their functional impairments increases from moderate to severe. Because these  		represent distinct but not entirely orthogonal dimensions of caretaking burden,  		we estimate separate models with dummy variables for the number of affected  		children (the presence of one or more than one disabled or chronically ill  		child) and for the severity of child(ren)'s conditions (the presence of any  		children with moderate or severe conditions). Details on the operationalization  		of control variables are provided in Appendix <a href="#tableB1">Table  		B1</a>.</p>
<p>We control for structural, demographic and human capital factors using  		measures which previous researchers have identified as affecting AFDC and  		employment. We include variables for respondent's race, education, health, age,  		and age squared. Because women's labor market choices are sensitive to the  		presence and earnings of partners/spouses, we include a variable for current  		cohabitation status. Based on empirical research suggesting that work and  		welfare behaviors differ for women who are ever married, we also control for  		respondents' marital status (as ever or never married). We include other  		variables measuring household characteristics that facilitate or inhibit the  		woman's employment: the number of children and the presence of any children  		under age six (both assumed to reduce labor force participation) and the  		presence of adults in the household other than respondent and her spouse or  		partner (hypothesized to increase labor force participation by increasing the  		number of adults available for child care).</p>
<p>Our models also include structural economic variables that are  		hypothesized to affect the woman's employment choices. We include variables for  		the level of AFDC and SSI benefits available to the woman, and other  		nonmeans-tested income available to the family. All are expected to have an  		income effect which depresses mother's labor market activities. As a measure of  		local employment opportunities, we include county unemployment rates.</p>
<h3>Methodological Issues</h3>
<p>In this section, we discuss some methodological issues that we  		encountered in estimating the impact of children's disabilities on AFDC  		recipient's labor force participation and our attempts to resolve them.</p>
<p><b>Respondent's Health</b>. Wolfe and Hill (1995), among others, suggest  		that a woman's health and disability status is an important determinant of her  		labor market participation. Our survey data presented two potential measures of  		these variables: the respondent's assessment of her health as excellent, good,  		fair, or poor, and the respondent's self-report of whether she had a disability  		that limited her ability to work. Self-reports of this type are arguably  		endogenous variables in a model of labor force participation. Nevertheless,  		similar measures have been used productively in models of low-income women's  		labor force participation (Wolf and Hill 1995; Spalter-Roth et al. 1992). We  		used the health rating rather than the disability rating for our estimation  		because the endogeneity problems seemed smaller with respect to this  		variable.</p>
<p><b>Respondent's Potential Wage</b>. An important variable in the static  		economic model of labor force participation is the wage that the woman can  		command if she works. Determining and measuring this wage, particularly for  		those not working, raises complex econometric issues (Killingsworth 1983).  		Rather than inserting a direct measure of this wage in our model, we have  		attempted to include in our model those human capital variables which have been  		shown to affect the woman's potential wage: education, age, race, and marital  		status.</p>
<p><b>AFDC and SSI Benefits</b>. The standard labor model suggests that the  		amount of AFDC, SSI, and other unearned income available to a woman will have  		an income effect which lowers her hours of employment. Her employment income  		also affects the amount of her AFDC, SSI, and other means-tested benefits,  		however, raising problems of endogeneity. For this reason, we do not simply  		include in our model the amount of AFDC and SSI payments received by the  		family. Instead, we include variables designed to capture the maximum AFDC  		benefit available to the family when that family has no earned income. We used  		two variables to capture the AFDC benefit amount. Since, AFDC benefits depend  		on household size, we use one variable to measure the number of the  		respondent's biological/step/AFDC children in the household. California has  		reduced maximum benefits available for some families in a policy experiment.  		The second variable measures whether the respondent's family is in the  		experimental group that receives lower benefits. In this way, we hope to  		capture the incentive effects of the AFDC policy in California with a variable  		that is not directly affected by the woman's labor force choices.</p>
<p>SSI benefits present a similar and more vexing problem for this  		estimation. SSI is expected to have an income effect for those families which  		receive benefits; benefits are also contingent on the presence of a  		disability--in the respondent, her partner or her children--which is expected  		to further reduce labor force participation. We are interested in estimating  		the independent effects of the caretaking burden and the SSI receipt for  		families with disabled children. We address the problem of the endogeneity on  		this measure by creating a dummy variable for the receipt of SSI by any  		household member other than the respondent (including children and  		spouse/partners). This gives us a measure of SSI which is not completely  		correlated with children's disabilities, and allows us to estimate the impact  		of SSI separately from that of other transfer income. We use nested logistic  		regression estimations to measure the impact of children's special needs with  		and without controlling for the receipt of SSI by any family members.</p>
