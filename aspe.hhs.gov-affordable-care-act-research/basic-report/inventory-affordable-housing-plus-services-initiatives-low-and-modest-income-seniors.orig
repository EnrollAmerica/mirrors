</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p>The aging of the baby boomers is a significant economic and social  		issue. By 2030, older adults are expected to make up 20 percent of the  		population, doubling from 35 to 70 million people. The relationship between  		older age, chronic illness and disability, and higher use of long-term care  		services is well established. In response to the rising demand for long-term  		care, consumer advocates, policy makers, and service providers have encouraged  		the development of new models of organizing and delivering health-related and  		supportive services that are attractive and affordable to older adults,  		particularly those who are poor or of modest means. </p>
<p>Assisted living facilities (ALFs) are a residential model of care that  		has received considerable attention as a potentially less expensive and more  		appealing alternative to nursing homes. The Assisted Living Quality Coalition  		has defined assisted living as a congregate residential setting that provides  		or coordinates personal services, 24-hour supervision and assistance (scheduled  		and unscheduled), activities, and health-related services and is designed to  		minimize the need to move; to accommodate individual residents' changing needs  		and preferences; to maximize residents' dignity, autonomy, privacy,  		independence, and safety; and to encourage family and community  		involvement.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> While the  		number of ALFs across the country has rapidly expanded over the last decade,  		they have remained largely cost prohibitive for older people with limited  		incomes. Many states have secured waivers allowing Medicaid to cover ALF costs;  		however, assisted living remains primarily private pay. In 2002, Medicaid  		helped pay for approximately 11 percent of the total number of assisted living  		residents in 41 states.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>A less well-publicized residential care model providing  		  lower-income seniors with access to health-related and supportive services is  		  emerging in publicly subsidized housing communities. This service delivery  		  model, referred to in this report as affordable housing plus  		  services (AHPS), is intended to integrate independent, unlicensed, and  		  primarily subsidized multi-unit housing environments for older adults with  		  services and supports. The goal is to enable older residents who are frail  		  and/or disabled to remain in their housing community even as their health  		  declines and disability increases. </i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and  		Urban Development (HUD) and the A.M. McGregor Home in Cleveland, OH, funded the  		Institute for the Future of Aging Services (IFAS), the policy and applied  		research arm of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging  		(AAHSA), to examine the potential of AHPS strategies to meet some of the  		long-term care needs of low and modest-income seniors. IFAS defines AHPS as  		having three elements: </p>
<ul><li>Independent, unlicensed, primarily subsidized, multi-unit housing  		  where large numbers of low and modest-income older adults live in close  		  proximity.</li>
<li>Health-related and supportive services, funded separately from the  		  housing, and available to at least some older residents (e.g., personal care,  		  housekeeping, meals, transportation, health and wellness services, etc.).</li>
<li>A purposeful linkage mechanism connecting residents to needed  		  health-related and supportive services so that they are able to age in  		  place in the face of declining health and increasing disability. </li>
</ul><p>Three reports have been produced in conjunction with the AHPS study:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>A Synthesis of Findings from the Study of Affordable Housing Plus  			 Services for Low and Modest-Income Older Adults</b> (summarizes study  			 findings). [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpssyn.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/ahpssyn.htm</a>]  			 </p>

<li>the HUD website (<a href="http://www.huduser.org">http://www.huduser.org</a>). </li>
</ul><p>This report presents the findings from the AHPS workshops. </p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">II. METHODS</a></h2>
<p>The inventory described in this report was developed through a  		combination of methods, including:</p>
<ol><li>A review of the research and evaluation literature.</li>
<li>Two informal workgroup meetings, held with AAHSA members and staff  		  and other experts. </li>
<li>Telephone and in-person discussions with AAHSA members, other housing  		  providers, and aging and housing experts to identify exemplary AHPS  		  programs.</li>
<li>Four invitational workshops attended by housing and aging services  		  stakeholders. </li>
</ol><h2><a name="scope" id="scope">III. SCOPE AND PURPOSES OF THE AHPS INVENTORY</a></h2>
<p>In conducting the AHPS study, IFAS identified numerous examples of AHPS  		programs that have been implemented across the country, largely at the  		initiative of individual housing providers and community aging agencies.  		Information describing these programs was collected through web-based research  		and discussions with publicly subsidized housing sponsors, property managers  		and other housing staff, researchers, and AAHSA staff. It was then organized  		into an inventory that is presented below. The purpose of the inventory is to  		stimulate thinking among housing providers, community agencies, and policy  		makers about the range of AHPS strategies that are now being employed and to  		provide real world examples where interested readers could obtain  		additional information. Hopefully, the inventory also will help inform public  		and private funders of the potential value of demonstrating and evaluating the  		role AHPS strategies might play in addressing some of the long-term care needs  		of lower-income elders.</p>
<p>The inventory could have been categorized in many different ways. Staff  		decided to first organize the material based on the source of financing for the  		housing arrangement. Subcategories were then selected to illustrate some of the  		variation among AHPS strategies with respect to how services are organized,  		coordinated, and delivered within affordable housing communities; the scope and  		comprehensiveness of services available to residents, staffing arrangements;  		community partners; etc. The subcategories are not mutually exclusive; in  		practice, housing providers may employ multiple strategies to link residents to  		services. Each AHPS strategy is illustrated with examples of on-going programs.  		These examples should not be viewed by readers as best practice models--this  		will require further codification through careful case study and evaluation.  		</p>
<h2><a name="inventory" id="inventory">IV. AHPS INVENTORY</a></h2>
<p>The inventory is divided into two broad categories of affordable  		housing:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Privately Financed Housing</b>. This category refers to  			 multi-unit owner and rental housing that is privately funded and receives no  			 public subsidies, but is still affordable to low and moderate-income older  			 adults. It also may include neighborhoods of single-family homes with large  			 concentrations of senior households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Publicly Subsidized Housing</b>. This category refers to  			 multi-unit rental housing that is subsidized by government entities at the  			 federal, state, and/or local levels. Subsidy sources may include public  			 housing, Section 202, Section 236, Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC),  			 tax-exempt bonds, or other such programs. It may be owned and operated by a  			 public entity, such as a housing authority, or a private entity, such as a  			 nonprofit organization</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Privately Financed Housing Plus Services Strategies</h3>
<p><b><i>Housing Cooperatives </i></b></p>
<p>In a housing cooperative, individuals own shares in a corporation that  		owns or controls the land and buildings that provide the housing. Share  		ownership entitles the individual to occupy a unit within the cooperative and  		confers other rights and responsibilities. Cooperatives stress resident  		participation in management and programming decisions. Housing cooperatives  		come in many shapes and sizes, including townhouses, garden apartments, mid and  		high-rise apartments, single-family homes, student housing, senior housing, and  		mobile home parks. Cooperatives wishing to remain affordable typically limit  		the maximum price at which shares can be sold, as is done in limited-equity  		cooperatives, and restrict the re-sale of cooperative shares to designated  		low-income groups. </p>
<p>Services can be both informal, involving mutual support among residents,  		or formal. They may involve joint purchasing of multiple supportive services  		and/or a coordinated and managed services program, staffed by community  		agencies or personnel employed by the cooperative. In some cooperatives, most  		notably those in New York City, an organized program of supportive services has  		developed as residents have grown older, involving partnerships between  		residents, community agencies, and the housing manager. These services are  		delivered by onsite and offsite staff in response to resident-identified needs.  		In some programs, services are quite comprehensive and can include assessment  		and care planning, personal care, counseling, benefits and entitlement  		assistance, advocacy, financial management, home-care, crisis intervention, and  		Meals-on-Wheels. Funding for services is separate from the housing. Services  		may be paid for out-of-pocket or by government subsidies, charitable  		contributions, the proceeds from property refinancing and/or special government  		and philanthropic programs targeting aging residents of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Penn South Cooperative &amp; Penn South Program for Seniors, New  		York, NY </b> Built in 1961, Penn South is a limited-equity cooperative  		with 2,820 units and 6,200 residents. Twenty years after its inception, many of  		Penn Souths residents began reaching retirement age. The co-op board  		established a special committee, the Penn South Program for Seniors (PSPS), to  		set up programs to support aging residents. PSPS partnered with three agencies  		to provide services and a foundation to develop the program. Within a few  		years, PSPS was formalized into a separate nonprofit, Penn South Social  		Services, Inc. PSPS offers case management; group recreation; educational,  		cultural and artistic programs; home-care coordination and nonacute nursing  		care; social day care for those with dementia; health education and preventive  		services; money management; and advocacy. The program is staffed by social  		workers, nurses, and home-care coordinators. Penn South also has been selected  		as a training site for geropsychiatric fellows and receives free psychiatric  		consultations. In addition, two medical centers have opened geriatric practices  		onsite, and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York is contributing a half-time  		nurse to perform nonreimbursable services.</p>
<p><b>7500 York Cooperative, Edina, MN</b> Developed in 1978, 7500 York  		was the first senior housing cooperative in the United States. It is a  		limited-equity cooperative with 330 units. As residents began to age, many  		hired private aides to assist with housekeeping, shopping, and personal care  		needs. Approximately 12 years ago, the co-op decided to give space on the  		property to a home health care agency. The office is managed by a nurse who  		oversees the home health aides who work in the building. Residents arrange for  		their services directly with the agency. Giving the agency an onsite office  		allows it to offer services in 15-minute intervals rather than the customary  		two-hour blocks. This allows residents to better target the service to their  		needs and is more economical for both the resident and the agency. The onsite  		office is feasible for the home health agency because of the co-ops large  		size. The agency also may serve seniors in surrounding apartment buildings out  		of this office. </p>

<p><b><i>Shared and Accessory Housing</i></b></p>
<p>Shared housing refers to an arrangement in which two or more unrelated  		individuals live together in a private single-family home or in close proximity  		to one another and share some common space. It is an alternative for those who  		cannot afford to live alone and/or need some supportive services. In some  		cases, formal match-up programs help homeowners find others to share their home  		with them. The homeowner may offer free or reduced rent to the tenant in return  		for providing supportive services such as meal preparation, laundry, and  		assistance with personal care tasks. This approach may be attractive to  		over-housed seniors who have vacant space and need extra income to  		purchase services or maintain their home. Accessory housing refers to a  		separate private living unit adjacent to a main home. The unit may already  		exist on the property or a small portable manufactured home or mobile home may  		be placed next to a single-family home. In some instances, family members may  		use accessory units to move an aging relative closer to them to facilitate  		informal caregiving. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>HomeShare Vermont, Burlington, VT </b> HomeShare Vermont links  		elders and persons with disabilities with individuals seeking affordable  		housing and/or caregiving opportunities. HomeShare provides a comprehensive  		screening and matching service. In a typical home-sharing situation, a student  		or person working outside the home is matched with a home provider and works  		12-15 hours a week doing household chores such as cooking or shopping in  		exchange for free rent. In other situations, the person may provide less  		service and make a small contribution to household expenses, or he or she may  		provide no services and pay rent in the range of $250-$300 per month. In  		live-in caregiving situations, a person assists a frail elder or person with  		disability with nonmedical personal care such as bathing, dressing or walking.  		Caregivers also provide companionship and assist with homemaking services such  		as shopping, cooking, and household chores. In return, the caregiver receives a  		weekly salary and room and board. HomeShare also matches frail elders or  		persons with disabilities with paid nonmedical caregivers who do not live-in  		and instead provide services on an hourly basis. </p>
<p><b>Ruggles House, Burlington, VT</b> Operated by Cathedral Square  		Corporation, Ruggles House is a shared housing community consisting of 14 units  		with kitchenettes and private baths and shared common spaces. Units are  		available at a range of rental rates, with some units designated for Housing  		Choice (Section 8) vouchers. Ruggles House offers a service coordinator, three  		meals daily and homemaker services, all of which are provided directly by  		Cathedral Square staff and purchased by residents on a sliding-scale basis.  		Personal care services also can be arranged through the Visiting Nurses  		Association and are either paid for through a state-funded program or  		out-of-pocket.</p>
<p><b>The Pat Crowley House, Chicago, IL</b> The Pat Crowley House, a  		three-story, six-flat building, was founded in 1983 by Housing Opportunities  		&amp; Maintenance for the Elderly. The house accommodates 12 seniors who need  		assistance with daily living tasks, four students, and one young family in an  		intergenerational living situation. Common areas include living rooms, dining  		rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. A full-time coordinator and her family live in  		one of the third-floor apartments, while four students share another apartment.  		The young people assist the elderly and cook on the weekends in exchange for  		room, board, and the opportunity to live in a family-like environment away from  		home. Residents pay a monthly rental fee according to their financial means.  		The house is subsidized with private donations, grants from foundations, and  		gifts from corporations. </p>
<p>Others:</p>
<p>ECHO Program, NW New Jersey Community Action Program, Phillipsburg, NJ  		HomeShare, University Of Michigan Hospital System, Ann Arbor, MI Home  		Sharing Program, New York Foundation for Senior Citizens, New York, NY See  		<a href="http://www.nationalsharedhousing.org/directory.html">http://www.nationalsharedhousing.org/directory.html</a>  		for a listing of shared housing programs in each state.</p>
<p><b><i>Mobile Home Parks and Manufactured Home Communities </i></b></p>
<p>Mobile home parks and manufactured housing communities often provide  		home ownership opportunities for lower-income seniors. Generally, lots are  		leased and the housing unit is owned. Upkeep and maintenance are usually  		included in the lot fee. The community may be age restricted or age integrated,  		and residents may live there full or part-time. Many mobile home parks are  		disappearing as land values increase. In several areas, efforts are being made  		to convert the parks to cooperatives, giving control to residents and groups  		interested in maintaining their affordability. Mobile home parks with high  		concentrations of seniors are most prevalent in Florida, California, and  		Alaska.</p>
<p>Formal efforts to link park residents with services are difficult to  		identify. Communities usually have some shared amenities such as social and  		recreational activities. Because mobile home parks and manufactured housing  		involve multiple single-family housing units within close proximity, they have  		the potential to attract services providers who wish to capitalize on the  		parks group purchasing capability. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Millennium Housing, Newport Beach, CA</b> Millennium Housing  		operates several senior mobile home parks throughout California. Through a  		monthly magazine, Millennium distributes a variety of information on community  		programs assisting seniors such as Meals-on-Wheels and utility assistance  		programs. The group also arranges for community organizations to make  		presentations on the properties, such as the local HICAP organization, and  		brings flu shot clinics to the properties. In three parks in San Marcos, CA,  		Millennium has partnered with Project CARE, a community volunteer program that  		provides local homebound elderly with outreach services, including municipal  		workers alerts, computerized calls with emergency response, and home  		repairs.</p>
<p><b>Leisureville Mobile Home Park, Woodland, CA</b> Leisureville  		Mobile Home Park is a 20-acre, 150-unit senior park that was converted to  		cooperative ownership in 1995. The park was purchased from the owner by the  		resident association in an effort to preserve affordability. The limited-equity  		cooperative structure allows occupants to own their own units, while the  		resident association owns the park. A recreational committee organizes social  		events. Residents participate in a community car program, which  		transports park residents and other seniors in the community to medical  		appointments and places like the grocery store.</p>
<p>Others: </p>
<p>River Ranch Mobile Home Park, Victorville, CA </p>
<p><b><i>Single Room Occupancy Hotels</i></b></p>
<p>A single room occupancy hotel (SRO) is a residential building, often in  		a downtown area, that rents small private rooms to low-income individuals on a  		weekly or monthly basis. SROs usually have some common or shared spaces such as  		bathrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. Although urban renewal has eliminated  		many SROs, some cities are trying to increase housing options for homeless  		persons, which includes many seniors, by acquiring and rehabilitating run-down  		hotels and converting them into SROs with supportive services. Services can  		include meals, health and nutrition education, assessment and case management,  		and transportation. Services funding typically comes from municipal sources.  		Some senior centers may target older residents of SROs. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Project Hotel Alert, Los Angeles, CA </b> Project Hotel Alert  		(PHA) is operated by the Single Room Occupancy Housing Corporation with funding  		from the city of Los Angeles Department of Aging. PHA provides a range of  		services to seniors living in SROs in downtown Los Angeles, including case  		management services, information and referral, monitoring and follow-up,  		advocacy for public benefits, completion of forms and housing assistance. It  		also provides transportation, two congregate meal sites and home-delivered  		meals, enrichment field trips, social events, shopping trips, art workshops,  		medical screenings, informational workshops and more. One of the SROs served by  		PHA is the Ellis Hotel, which opened in 1989 to serve the at-risk  		elderly. The Ellis has 56 units with handicap-accessible bathrooms on each  		floor. </p>
<p><b>Capri Hotel and Sara Frances Hometel/Transitional Housing for  		Displaced Seniors Program, San Diego, CA</b> The Transitional Housing for  		Displaced Seniors Program temporarily houses homeless seniors in downtown SROs.  		The program is operated by Senior Community Centers with funding from the city  		of San Diegos redevelopment arm. The program pays rent for up 35 rooms in  		the Capri Hotel and the Sara Frances Hometel for up to six months. It also pays  		for up to five rooms at St. Pauls Villa, an ALF, for seniors who are too  		frail to live independently. Participants receive meals at Senior Community  		Centers congregate meal sites and receive support from social service  		case managers and a nurse to address entitlement issues, health concerns, and  		any other needs that would inhibit their ability to transition to a healthier  		living situation. </p>

<h3>Publicly Subsidized Housing Plus Services  		Strategies</h3>
<p><b><i>Co-Location and Volunteerism</i></b></p>
<p>Housing providers lacking sufficient resources to invest in resident  		services may choose a lower-cost alternative involving the co-location of  		supportive services in proximity to the housing property and/or organizing  		volunteer services. Commonly co-located services may include a meal site under  		Title III of the Older Americans Act (OAA), a senior center, or health and  		wellness programs. Volunteers may assist residents with transportation,  		housekeeping, or shopping or may organize education and entertainment  		activities. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Koinonia Apartments, Lenoir, NC </b> Koinonia Apartments is an  		84-unit Section 202 property sponsored by the First Presbyterian Church of  		Lenoir. The administrator functions as a property manager, service coordinator,  		and case manager. Koinonia Apartments has identified multiple community  		agencies that can provide services onsite at little or no cost to residents.  		The property serves as the site for an OAA Title III nutrition program, which  		serves a noon meal five days per week to residents and community members. Green  		Thumb, which operates a federally-funded training program for older workers,  		supplies housekeepers in training at no charge to provide light housework such  		as laundry, making beds, and sweeping. The property administrator also has a  		list of individuals in the community who provide reasonably priced housekeeping  		services. Personal care is available from the Caldwell County Home Health  		Agency and from the local Community Action Program. Both agencies provide a  		limited amount of personal care at no charge to residents. The property also  		provides a variety of activities for its residents, including exercise, blood  		pressure checks, craft activities, entertainment, and transportation.</p>

<p><b><i>Service Coordination</i></b></p>
<p>The property manager or housing sponsor employs a full or part-time  		staff person to help residents identify services needs, link them to community  		services providers, advocate on their behalf, and provide educational programs.  		The service coordinator is available to all residents of the property and  		typically responds to resident-identified needs. The housing property does not  		offer supportive services through it own staff or negotiate formal contracts  		with community providers for such services. Properties with service  		coordinators also often have common activity space for all residents,  		recreational opportunities, a group dining room, emergency response system, and  		24-hour security. Service coordination is most likely to be found in Section  		202 properties. It is also a component of some public housing and LIHTC  		properties.</p>
<p>According to a national study of resident service coordinators, the most  		prevalent services to which residents are linked are housekeeping, home health,  		and personal care. Services are typically paid for through a combination of  		out-of-pocket payments, Medicaid personal care and waiver funding, OAA funds,  		and private and municipal sources. Funding for the service coordinator position  		is usually supported through a HUD grant or the propertys operating  		budget. State and philanthropic funds also may be used. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>National Church Residences, Columbus, OH</b> National Church  		Residences (NCR) has 154 service coordinators working in 194 of its Section 202  		and LIHTC properties. The primary role of NCR service coordinators is to  		provide residents with information and linkages to needed resources and  		services. Service coordinators do not provide direct service. Service  		coordinators conduct an intake evaluation of those residents requesting their  		assistance, assessing the residents behaviors, functional abilities, and  		needs based on information from residents and their own observation. Service  		coordinators draw up case management plans that identify residents needs  		and give them information and referrals to community agencies that can help  		meet their needs. The plan also spells out the goals of the referrals, and the  		service coordinators monitor the plans and follows-up with residents to ensure  		they are getting their needs met. NCR also has instituted a quality assurance  		program that tracks each service coordinators performance and, through  		monthly feedback, ensures they are in compliance with all regulations and  		standards and are providing residents with the highest level of service.</p>
<p><b>Schwenkfeld Manor, Lansdale, PA</b> Schwenkfeld Manor operates  		225 units across three Section 202 senior properties and residents are  		supported by two service coordinators. Schwenkfeld has chosen to fill the  		service coordinator positions with registered nurses (RNs). While not  		functioning as a nurse or conducting diagnostic assessments, the RN service  		coordinators are able to assess residents through their skilled observations.  		For example, they look for facial expressions, skin color, tone of voice,  		posture, wringing of hands, etc. Based on their observations and interactions  		with residents, the RN service coordinators can help alert residents to  		possible early medical problems, help residents understand and coordinate their  		medical needs, and liaison with medical professionals. In addition to informal  		interaction, the RN service coordinator conducts an annual health and wellness  		assessment with the residents permission. Based on this assessment, the  		RN service coordinator can help link the resident with any services or supports  		he or she may need. </p>

<p><b><i>Enriched Services and Service Coordination </i></b></p>
<p>In contrast to the service coordination approach described above, this  		strategy combines service coordination, including a formal assessment of  		residents health and functional status, on-going case management of  		residents who are particularly frail and/or disabled, and more formalized  		arrangements for assuring access to needed services. Some services may be the  		result of formal contracts between the housing property and community services  		agencies. In other cases, the housing provider may also be the service  		provider.</p>
<p>The amount and intensity of services available to residents is varied.  		Services may include 24-hour staffing, a personal response system, personal  		care, medication management, and housekeeping. Services may be bundled into  		packages depending on level of need or offered a la carte. Staffing for the  		case management function may be paid for through the Medicaid home and  		community-based services waiver program, the propertys operating budget  		or possibly proceeds from the refinancing of a Section 202 loan. Services may  		be paid for out-of-pocket, through the Medicaid home and community-based  		services waiver program and/or the personal care program, OAA funding, state or  		municipal programs, or philanthropic funds. Some older programs continue to be  		paid for in part by the HUD Congregate Housing Services Program. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Peter Sanborn Place, Reading, MA</b>	Peter Sanborn Place gives  		priority to seniors needing a high level of care, a population it was able to  		target after getting HUD to agree to such priorities in its tenant selection  		plan. This housing community refinanced its old Section 202 loan (one of the  		first to do so in the country), freeing up significant resources to be invested  		in building repairs, renovations, and resident services. To ensure the  		availability of personal care to frail residents, as well as the surrounding  		community, Peter Sanborn Place also created a sister agency, Sanborn Home Care.  		Sanborn Home Care provides case management and service coordination; personal  		care, including assistance with showering, grooming, toileting, meal  		preparation, feeding, mobility, and medication monitoring; homemaker services  		such as housekeeping, shopping, and laundry; transportation to medical  		appointments; companion and respite care; and assistance with local errands and  		other tasks. Peter Sanborn Place also contracts with the Visiting Nurse  		Association for nursing care and rehabilitation therapy. Services are paid for  		through a variety of methods including self-pay, state programs, Medicaid, and  		Medicare. </p>
<p><b>Osceola County Council on Aging, Kissimmee, FL </b> The Osceola  		County Council on Aging has developed a consolidated AHPS strategy that  		provides residents access to a comprehensive range of health and supportive  		services. The Council is both the conduit for OAA funds and the owner and  		manager of four affordable senior housing properties funded through a  		combination of the Section 202 program, LIHTC program, rural development loans,  		and loans from the state. This dual role enables it to establish relationships  		with a host of aging organizations, health providers, and community and  		volunteer groups. Through these partnerships, the Council is able to offer  		older and disabled residents living in its four subsidized housing properties  		everything from case management, transportation, meals, discounted commodities,  		homemaking, home repair, and chore services to health and wellness services and  		personal care. </p>

<p><b><i>NORC Service Programs (housing properties may be either publicly  		subsidized or privately financed)</i></b></p>
<p>Naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs) are geographic  		areas--a neighborhood or a building--originally populated by individuals of all  		ages, which have evolved over time to contain a high proportion of older  		adults. The residents of some NORCs, in collaboration with community services  		providers and property managers, have developed service programs to respond to  		the health-related and/or supportive services needs of aging tenants. NORC  		service delivery programs may be found in both publicly subsidized and private  		housing. Although NORC service programs are most commonly found in New York  		City, they are increasingly emerging in other parts of the country, largely in  		response to federal demonstration funding. </p>
<p>NORC services programs are made available to residents without regard to  		income or functional status. Services can be very comprehensive and include  		assessment and case management, health and wellness services, personal care,  		and housekeeping. NORC services programs can be paid for out-of-pocket, through  		government programs such as Medicaid and OAA, through philanthropic and  		charitable contributions, and through the in-kind efforts of volunteers. New  		York has a unique supportive services program for NORC residents in designated  		public housing and housing cooperatives.</p>

<p><b>Vladeck Cares/NORC Supportive Service Program, New York, NY</b>  		Vladeck Cares/NORC Supportive Service Program serves the seniors living in  		Vladeck House, a public housing project on Manhattans Lower East Side  		comprising 27 buildings that house 3,000 residents (860 seniors). The program  		is a partnership between Henry Street Settlement, the Visiting Nurse Service of  		New York, and the New York City Housing Authority. The program offers  		comprehensive and preventative social services and health care, medical and  		nursing services, supervised case management, mental health counseling and  		therapy, cultural programs, educational programs, social activities,  		nutritional counseling, home visits, and escorts. It is funded by the New York  		City and New York State Departments for the Aging and private and philanthropic  		foundations. </p>

<p><b><i>State Supportive Housing Partnerships</i></b></p>
<p>State supportive housing programs are intended to improve coordination  		and expand the range of services available to senior residents of publicly  		subsidized housing properties. Often, the goal is to reduce Medicaid nursing  		home costs by maintaining older adults in independent housing for a longer  		period, thus delaying unnecessary institutionalization. </p>
<p>The approach requires collaboration between the state housing agency,  		the states aging and health agencies, and the housing properties. Care  		coordination may be provided by the property, a designated state agency, or  		both. A state agency selects one or more licensed services providers to deliver  		a range of personal care and supportive services to participating housing  		properties. Services can include case management, Medicaid home and  		community-based waiver services, 24-hour available personal care, home-care,  		medication management, housekeeping, meals, and social programming. The amount  		of services available depends on the funding source and resident eligibility.  		</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Connecticut Congregate Housing for the Elderly Program</b>  		Connecticuts Congregate Housing for the Elderly Program is a  		state-subsidized congregate housing program for low-income elders who have  		temporary or periodic difficulties with one or more essential activities of  		daily living. Funded by the Department of Economic and Community Development,  		the program provides grants or loans to construct or rehab congregate rental  		housing units. Residents pay a minimum rent and a congregate service charge,  		which is based on their adjusted income. The program subsidizes residents who  		cannot afford to pay the full cost of services. Services include housekeeping,  		emergency call systems in each room, 24-hour security, community meals, and  		social and recreational activities. Congregate facilities are not licensed, and  		staff may not dispense medication or provide nursing services. (For example,  		see The Marvin, Norwalk, CT.)</p>
<p><b>Massachusetts Supportive Senior Housing Initiative Program</b>  		The Executive Office of Elder Affairs and the Department of Housing and  		Community Development developed the Supportive Housing Initiative to create an  		assisted living like environment in public housing for the elderly  		and persons with disabilities. It currently operates in 22 locations. Like  		traditional assisted living, services are offered on an as-needed basis,  		24-hours per day. Residents pay 30 percent of their income in rent. Residents  		who are eligible for the Massachusetts Home Care Program receive all or some of  		the services at no additional cost (depending on income, there may be a monthly  		co-payment). Residents who do not qualify for state-funded home-care services  		based on their frailty level and income are able to purchase privately the  		entire package of supportive services or some of the services based on their  		need. Supportive housing benefits include service coordination, case  		management, 24-hour personal care/onsite or on-call person, homemaker services  		and laundry, medication reminders, social activities, and at least one meal per  		day. Supportive services are provided by an Elder Affairs approved personal  		care agency. Each site has a designated agency. (For examples, see the  		Cambridge or Salem Housing Authority.)</p>

<p><b><i>Assisted Living as a Service Program</i></b></p>
<p>In some states, assisted living is licensed as a service rather than as  		a facility. The properties in which the assisted living services are provided  		are not licensed ALFs and generally are bound only by local building codes. In  		some instances, the properties may be required to register with the state (to  		keep track of the facilities rather than to regulate them). States may require  		the properties to provide residents with a disclosure statement about what and  		how services will be provided; however, residents maintain a landlord/tenant  		relationship with the property. Typically, the assisted living services are  		provided by a home health agency subject to its own licensure and regulation  		requirements. </p>
<p>Assisted living services customarily include 24-hour available personal  		care, medication management, meal preparation, housekeeping, laundry, and  		transportation. Services are generally funded under a state-subsidized program  		and/or a Medicaid home and community-based services waiver program. The state  		determines eligibility for services. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>Connecticut</b> Connecticut licenses assisted living  		services agencies (ALSAs) to provide some nursing or medical care and  		personal care aides to residents of managed residential care (MRCs)  		communities. While MRCs are not licensed caregiving facilities, they must  		provide a core set of services to residents, including three meals a day,  		housekeeping and laundry service, transportation, maintenance services, 24-hour  		security, emergency call systems in each living unit, washers and dryers,  		common use space large enough to accommodate 50 percent of the tenant  		population, and social and recreational programs. Each MRC must also employ an  		onsite service coordinator to ensure services are available to residents, help  		tenants meet their needs, establish collaborative relations with other service  		agencies and community resources, establish a tenant council, serve as a  		liaison with the ALSAs quality assurance committee, and ensure that a  		tenant information system is in place. The MRC may either contract with a  		separate ALSA or become licensed as an ALSA itself. At the discretion of the  		Connecticut Department of Public Health, some housing communities supported  		through the state subsidized congregate housing program also may offer onsite  		ALSA services without meeting the core services requirements governing MRCs.  		</p>
<p><b>Minnesota</b> Most assisted living services in Minnesota are  		provided in facilities registered with the Department of Health as  		housing with services establishments. These properties provide  		sleeping accommodations to one or more adults, at least 80 percent of whom are  		55 years of age or older. For a fee, they offer or provide one or more  		regularly scheduled health-related services or two or more regularly scheduled  		supportive services. Health-related services include professional nursing  		services, home health aide tasks, home-care aide tasks, and the central storage  		of medication for residents. Supportive services include help with personal  		laundry, handling or assisting with personal funds or arranging for medical  		services, health-related services, social services or transportation to medical  		or social service appointments. If the housing with services establishment  		provides the services directly, it must have the appropriate home-care provider  		license from the Department of Health. If the facility contracts or arranges  		for these services, the entity providing the services must have the appropriate  		license.</p>

<p><b><i>Campus Network Strategy</i></b></p>
<p>This approach has some of the attributes of a continuing care retirement  		community (CCRC). It links independent housing for older adults with an ALF,  		providing residents a broader choice of settings as they age and their  		functioning changes. No entrance fee is charged and separate payments are  		required for different levels of care and different amounts of services. One  		goal of this approach is to maintain affordability of supportive services for  		individuals in independent housing who may not be eligible for  		Medicaid-reimbursed assisted living by apportioning some costs for management,  		professional and program staff between the independent housing property and the  		ALF.</p>
<p>In general, the independent living property and ALF separately provide  		services, which may include meals, transportation, and social activities. Each  		unit maintains separate social work staff. Case management may be shared. All  		ALF residents are assessed and receive a plan of care from the ALF case  		manager. Residents of the independent living property may be assessed as needed  		by ALF case managers and plans of care developed as appropriate. Other services  		that may be shared across settings include medication management, 24-hour  		staffing, and after-hours care. Assisted living services for low-income persons  		are funded through the Medicaid program. Residents not eligible for Medicaid  		pay for some services out-of-pocket. Whether the ALF is able to provide  		services to residents in the independent property may depend on state licensing  		requirements and whether the ALF is also licensed to provide home-care  		services. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p><b>Eaton Senior Programs, Lakewood, CO</b> Eaton Senior Programs  		(ESP) operates Eaton Terrace Residences (ETR), a 162-unit independent senior  		property financed through tax-exempt bonds with project-based Section 8 rental  		assistance, and Eaton Terrace II (ET II), an adjoining ALF. ESP is able to  		leverage resources across both residential properties. ET II has both an  		assisted living license and a home and community-based services license, which  		allows staff to provide personal care and homemaker services anywhere in the  		community, including at ETR. ETR residents may purchase personal care,  		housekeeping, and medication monitoring services at whatever level they may  		need. Residents pay out-of-pocket, unless they are participating in a Medicaid  		program that covers the costs. ESP also has created a care consultation  		team to support resident needs, which includes social workers, activities  		coordinators, pastoral counselors, resident assistants, and other staff.  		Although each property has staff that focuses specifically on its residents,  		each is able to leverage expertise and resources across the team. For example,  		ESP contracts with an RN for 16 hours a month to serve both ETR and ET II  		residents, and the RN participates in ESP weekly care team meetings that  		address residents of both properties. </p>
<p><b>Cathedral Square Senior Living, Burlington, VT</b> Cathedral  		Square Senior Living (CSSL) is a Section 202 senior housing property co-located  		with an assisted living program. If CSSL residents need help with basic  		activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and toileting, Cathedral  		Square can license their apartment as an assisting living unit and bring  		services to them, rather than making them move to the nursing wing. Should they  		no longer require help with basic living activities, the apartment reverts to  		independent living. The assisted living arm of CSSL is not able to provide  		services to residents in the independent arm because it is not licensed as a  		home health agency. Independent living residents at CSSL, however, may receive  		support through the states Housing and Supportive Services program, which  		funds service coordination and case management, in addition to wellness  		activities and homemaker services. These services, as well as the assisted  		living services, are provided directly by CSSL staff. </p>
<p><i><b>Integrated Housing, Health Care, and Supportive  		Services</b></i></p>
<p>This goal of this approach is to provide poor and near poor seniors  		access to an integrated package of affordable housing, health care, and home  		and community-based services comparable to what is available to more affluent  		residents of CCRCs. A key resource for making this strategy work is access to  		adult day care and/or adult day health care in co-located space or in close  		proximity to the housing property. The availability of adult day services is  		likely to make it easier for residents with cognitive difficulties in need of  		supervision to maintain independent living. </p>
<p>Funding sources may include the Federally Qualified Health Center  		Program (for community health centers), PACE (adult day health care), Medicaid  		home and community-based services, and OAA resources (adult day health/adult  		day care and in-home and other supportive services).</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p><b>The Over 60 Collaboration, LifeLong Medical Care, Oakland, CA</b>  		This project blends health care, personal care, supportive services, and  		affordable senior housing through a collaboration between Resources for  		Community Development (a housing developer), LifeLong Medical Care (operates  		the Over 60 Health Center, a federally qualified health center), and the Center  		for Elders Independence (a PACE program). Through co-location of the Over 60  		Health Center in Mabel Howard Apartments, a Section 202 property, healthy and  		moderately disabled residents may receive primary medical care and other health  		services including case management, mental health services, podiatry, dental  		care, adult day health care, health education and screening, physical therapy,  		and links to home health services. The partnership with PACE allows nursing  		home eligible residents access to comprehensive medical and social services in  		an adult day health center, which is also located onsite. The program is  		intended to provide low-income seniors in subsidized housing an assisted living  		level of service without special funding.</p>
<p><b>Presentation Senior Housing, San Francisco, CA</b> Presentation  		Senior Housing is collaboration between Mercy Housing California and North  		&amp; South Market Adult Day Health that integrates affordable housing with  		onsite adult day health services. The Section 202 building includes 93 units,  		60 of which are targeted to very low-income frail elders. Approximately half of  		the residents participate in the day health program, which provides a variety  		of services such as nursing care; social work services; physical, occupational  		and speech therapy; podiatry services; mental health support; case management;  		transportation; and a daily meal. Those not enrolled in the adult day health  		program receive support and services from a service coordinator, as well as a  		variety of community organizations. Almost three-quarters of residents receive  		services from the In-Home Supportive Services program, a Medicaid-funded  		program that provides homemaker and personal care services. Operating as a  		separate day health program and independent living apartments allows the  		project to avoid state licensing as an ALF while providing roughly the same  		level of services to residents. </p>

<p><b><i>Affordable Housing/Health Partnerships </i></b></p>
<p>In this model, formal partnerships are established between a heath  		system or health providers and affordable housing sponsors. The health system  		may be instrumental in seeding the development of low-income housing, as well  		as bringing primary care and health-related services to elderly residents.  		Incentives for such partnerships are varied and may include honoring the  		mission of faith-based nonprofits, tax benefits, creating new uses for defunct  		community hospitals, and encouraging referrals of elderly residents in return  		for services. </p>
<p>Services may include health screening, care management, wellness  		programs, geriatric assessment, primary medical care, immunizations, and  		exercise programs. Funding may be the result of discounted services by  		providers in exchange for referrals, as well as Medicaid, hospital and health  		system resources, community development organizations, or corporate and  		individual donors. </p>

<p><b>Golden West Senior Residence, Boulder, CO</b> Golden West is a  		255-unit former Section 202 property now refinanced with tax-exempt bonds.  		Golden West has partnered with Medically Based Fitness (MBF) to operate an  		onsite wellness center. Golden West provides the space and equipment and MBF  		staffs the center, which is open five days per week, with a physical therapist  		and exercise physiologist. Residents pay a monthly membership fee, which for  		many is subsidized by fundraising through the Golden West Foundation. The  		Center also puts on educational activities, which are available free to all  		residents. Golden West also partners with several other programs or individuals  		in the community who come to the property on a regular basis to provide  		services. Through these relationships, they are able to bring in foot care,  		massage, reflexology, hearing aid maintenance, wheelchair and walker  		maintenance, banking services, and many activities. These services are  		generally provided free or at a minimal cost to the residents. </p>
<p><b>Sixty Plus Program, Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA</b> The goal  		of Piedmont Hospitals Sixty Plus program is to help seniors maintain and  		maximize their independence. The program partners with four affordable senior  		housing properties in the Atlanta area. The program sends a nurse to each  		property one day a week. Residents can schedule individual appointments, and  		the nurse also conducts post-discharge, follow-up visits with residents who  		have had a recent stay in Piedmont hospital. Physicians who work with Piedmont  		hospital also can ask the nurse to check in on any of their patients they think  		might need attention. The nurse can help residents coordinate any follow-up  		appointments or other health-related resources they might need. In addition to  		one-on-one appointments, the nurse conducts health fairs and other educational  		opportunities in the properties. The program is paid for by the hospital.</p>
<p><b>WellElder Program, Northern California Presbyterian Homes and  		Services, San Francisco, CA </b> Northern California Presbyterian Homes and  		Services created the WellElder program to address concerns that too many  		residents in their HUD-subsidized properties were moving to board and care or  		nursing homes because of health care needs. The WellElder program provides an  		onsite health educator (RN or licensed vocational nurse) to work directly with  		residents to provide one-on-one consultations and health assessments; advocacy  		on the residents behalf with doctors, insurance providers, pharmacies,  		and other health services; referrals to medical services; medication reminders;  		health-related classes and group programs; and information about medical costs  		and insurance resources. The health educator also teams with a service  		coordinator to help residents obtain the services they need to remain in their  		housing community. Two of the four sites housing the WellElder program have  		been able to work the health educator into their operating budgets. At the  		other two, the positions are funded through grants. </p>
