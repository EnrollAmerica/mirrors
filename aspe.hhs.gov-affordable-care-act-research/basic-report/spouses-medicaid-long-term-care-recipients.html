<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>When an individual enters a nursing home for the long term, the spouse  		remaining in the couples home may fear financial devastation from paying  		the high cost of nursing home care. However, Medicaid rules have been designed  		to protect certain income and assets for the at-home spouse, without affecting  		the nursing home spouses eligibility for publicly funded long-term care.  		While some may view the amounts that are protected as quite modest or even  		inadequate to sustain the at-home spouses accustomed standard of living,  		they far exceed the income and asset levels that may be retained in the case of  		unmarried recipients of Medicaid long-term care services. Moreover, at-home  		spouses can employ a variety of financial planning strategies to preserve an  		even greater share of the marital assets, even after the Medicaid  		recipients or spouses death. While states are required to recover  		Medicaid long-term care expenses from the estates of deceased recipients, when  		there is a surviving spouse, the recipients estate often escapes this  		outcome. </p>
<h2>BASIC MEDICAID RULES GOVERNING INCOME AND ASSET LIMITS FOR MARRIED  		COUPLES</h2>
<p>Medicaid eligibility is generally determined using the same income and  		asset provisions used for determination of eligibility for benefits from the  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program -- the Federal income maintenance  		program for poor elderly and disabled persons.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> However, some states (the eleven so-called  		209(b) States)<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note2">2</a>, <a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> employ more restrictive Medicaid eligibility  		criteria than are used in the SSI program, while certain other states may use  		more generous rules.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> In  		addition, when one spouse applies for or receives Medicaid coverage of nursing  		home care while the other spouse remains in the community, the so-called  		spousal impoverishment rules<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> disregard a certain amount of income for the  		financial support of the at-home spouse. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Basic Medicaid income and asset eligibility  				rules for married couples:</b></p>
<ol><li>All income and assets (his, hers and theirs) are combined,  				  regardless of ownership, including things that are often the sole legal  				  property of just one spouse -- for example, retirement savings accounts or  				  pension checks.</li>
<li>If either spouse has an interest in property with a legal right  				  to sell, claim or cash it out in some manner to obtain money for his or her  				  personal use, then the fair market value of that property is counted to the  				  extent of the spouses legal right to convert it to cash. </li>
<li>The rules for couples living apart differ from those for  				  couples living together, as the income of a community spouse is not considered  				  to be available to an institutionalized spouse. Medicaid rules encourage  				  married couples to choose nursing home rather than in-home care for an ill  				  spouse in order to preserve additional income and marital assets for use by the  				  community spouse.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Recipients of Medicaid long-term care services in nursing homes are  		expected to use their income to pay a share of the cost of their nursing home  		care. Medicaid then pays the difference between the recipients share of  		cost and the Medicaid payment rate. So-called post-eligibility  		rules (which apply to nursing home residents once they are determined to  		be eligible for Medicaid) are used to calculate how much of the  		institutionalized spouses income must contribute toward his or her cost  		of care and how much may be protected for use by the community  		spouse.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Married Medicaid nursing home residents may  				retain:</b></p>
<ul><li>A personal needs allowance of at least $30 (or more at state  				  option)</li>
<li>Unrestricted amounts for health insurance premiums or  				  out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by Medicaid</li>
<li>At state option, a time-limited allowance to maintain the  				  recipients home if a physician determines that he or she is likely to  				  return home within 6 months</li>
<li>Income and/or assets sufficient to avoid impoverishment of the  				  community spouse</li>
</ul></div>
<p>In addition, ownership of certain assets does not affect the Medicaid  		eligibility of married couples.</p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<p><b>Assets that are excluded when determining  				Medicaid eligibility of married couples:</b></p>
<ul><li>The first $3000 of assets if they live as a couple or $2000  				  each if they live apart</li>
<li>The couples home </li>
<li>Limited amounts of household goods and personal property </li>
<li>A vehicle</li>
<li>Up to $1500 in funds designated for burial expenses, and  				  contracts, spaces, or other irrevocable burial arrangements without limits for  				  each spouse</li>
<li>Life insurance with cash surrender value of less than  				  $1500</li>
<li>Certain income-producing property</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Ownership of assets in excess of those listed above make an individual  		ineligible for Medicaid. However, the person may qualify at a later date after  		the excess is depleted, either by spending it down on medical bills or other  		necessary personal expenses, or by employing various financial planning  		strategies. Such strategies are more varied and numerous for married couples  		because they can take advantage of special provisions to protect additional  		resources for persons separated from their spouses by a long-term stay in a  		nursing home or other medical institution. </p>
<h2>MEDICAID INCOME AND ASSET PROTECTION FOR THE COMMUNITY SPOUSE</h2>
<p>Medicaid law was amended in 1988<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> in response to evidence that at-home  		spouses<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> -- typically  		elderly women with little or no income of their own -- faced poverty and a  		radical reduction in their standard of living before their spouses living in a  		nursing home could qualify for Medicaid. The so-called Medicaid spousal  		impoverishment provisions protect the community spouse when the  		institutional stay of the nursing home resident has lasted or is expected to  		last at least 30 consecutive days. This protection ceases if the  		institutionalized spouse is discharged and returns home or to another  		non-institutional setting. States must apply Medicaid spousal impoverishment  		rules irrespective of state laws regarding community property or division  		of marital property.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In some cases, states extend spousal impoverishment protections to the  		non-Medicaid spouses of recipients of Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Waiver  		services.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> However,  		the law does not extend these protections to couples in which both spouses  		receive Medicaid long-term care services.</p>
<h2>PROTECTED MARITAL INCOME</h2>
<p>Federal law prescribes income protection of a minimum maintenance needs  		allowance (MMNA) for the community spouse. Federal law prescribes that the MMNA  		should equal at least 150% of the federal poverty level for a couple ($1505 per  		month in 2004) and be adjusted every year by the general rate of  		inflation.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> States  		have the option to use a higher minimum level -- $2319 per month. In 2000, 35  		states used this higher figure.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Medicaid rules provide three pathways for community spouses to obtain a  		higher MMNA. First, the allowance may be raised (though only as high as the  		Federal maximum allowance) for community spouses who show that they have  		exceptional housing costs, defined as more than 30% of the standard allowance.  		Second, they can receive a larger allowance if a state Medicaid hearing finds  		that exceptional circumstances might otherwise cause them extreme financial  		hardship. Third, they may seek a court order for additional support.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A couples total income is divided into his and hers by the  		name on the check. This includes pension benefits, IRA payouts, or  		other income paid only to the account holder, and accessible by the spouse only  		if deposited in a joint account. Income the couple receives jointly is divided  		in half. The community spouse keeps all of his or her own income plus half of  		any shared income. If this total is less than the MMNA, then the  		institutionalized spouse must be allowed to supplement the community  		spouses income in an amount that increases the community spouses  		total income up to the applicable MMNA. If the income level of the community  		spouse is very low, he or she may receive all of the combined marital income.  		Conversely, a community spouse with a high total income may receive little or  		no supplementary income from the institutionalized spouse. In such a case, even  		if the income of the community spouse is considerable, the Medicaid program  		cannot require that any of it be applied toward the cost of the institutional  		spouses care. Income remaining to the institutionalized spouse after he  		transfers the allowed amount to the community spouse is subject to the usual  		Medicaid post-eligibility share-of-cost requirements.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<h2>PROTECTED MARITAL ASSETS</h2>
<p>Medicaid rules that protect marital assets for the community spouse  		require that all the couples countable assets are first added together,  		regardless of whose name appears on the title. From that total, Medicaid  		subtracts an amount to be retained by the community spouse, plus a small amount  		(usually $2000) for use by the institutionalized spouse. Any remaining assets  		must then be depleted in order to qualify the institutionalized spouse for  		Medicaid long-term care services. The couple may deplete these excess assets by  		spending them down on the cost of nursing home care or by using them in ways  		described later in this issue brief.</p>
<p>The process begins with a resource assessment in which a snapshot is  		taken of all countable assets owned by the couple at the time of admission of  		the ill spouse to the nursing home, even if the Medicaid application is not  		filed until later. The snapshot does not include assets normally excluded  		during Medicaid eligibility determination, such as the couples home or  		personal effects. Either spouse has the right to request the assessment  		immediately upon admission to the nursing home or at any time thereafter. If  		the couple does not request an assessment, the State is required to perform an  		assessment at the time when the institutional spouse applies for Medicaid.  		Nursing homes must inform all new admissions about the availability and  		implications of the asset assessment, including those who have not expressed an  		interest in applying for Medicaid services upon admission. Couples who choose  		not to be assessed upon admission may encounter problems later on with  		collecting the necessary documentation to recreate a snapshot of what their  		countable assets were at the time of admission. </p>
<p>When the Medicaid application is filed, the State uses information  		obtained from the resource assessment to calculate the community spouses  		share of the couples total assets. The calculation begins by dividing the  		total assets in half and assigning one half to each spouse. The community  		spouses half share of the total is then compared to the States  		minimum and maximum spousal allowance amounts. If this half share is less than  		the minimum, he or she is allowed to keep more than a half share to boost that  		protected share up to the minimum level. If the half share of total assets is  		greater than the maximum allowance, then the share protected for the community  		spouse is limited to the maximum amount, and he or she retains less than half  		of the total assets. Once the spousal allowance is calculated, it is up to the  		couple to work out the allocation of specific assets. </p>
<p>Federal law determines the minimum and maximum protected resource  		amounts ($18,552 and $92,760, respectively, in 2004).<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note16">16</a></font></sup> States have the option to raise the minimum  		to any level up to the Federal maximum. In 2000, 36 states opted to raise their  		minimum levels, most of them setting the minimum equal to the Federal  		maximum.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The community spouse may be able to retain more than the maximum  		protected amount by: 1) obtaining a court order for more; 2) requesting a  		hearing to petition for an amount sufficient to generate income consistent with  		Medicaid income protection guidelines for spouses;<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> or 3) just saying no<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> -- i.e., by taking sole  		ownership of marital assets and refusing to make any of them available to pay  		for the institutionalized spouses care. In this case, the institutional  		spouse may be unable to qualify from Medicaid because he or she is prevented  		from spending down the designated share of the marital assets. However, the  		State may make a determination of hardship in order to provide Medicaid  		benefits, or may pursue assets in possession of the community spouse under  		general state laws regarding marital support obligations.</p>
<h2>FINANCIAL PLANNING STRATEGIES TO PRESERVE ADDITIONAL MARITAL  		ASSETS</h2>
<p>General financial strategies used to shelter assets in order to qualify  		for Medicaid have been well documented.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> They are legal and particularly amenable for  		use by married couples who wish to preserve marital assets in amounts greater  		than those protected for use by the community spouse under the Medicaid spousal  		impoverishment rules.</p>
<p>The ethics of such strategies are beyond the scope of this issue brief.  		Arguably, married couples separated by long-term institutionalization of one  		spouse have more motives and opportunities for sheltering assets than do  		individuals without living spouses. Couples seek to avoid serious and  		potentially long-lasting financial harm to the community spouse, who is likely  		to outlive the institutionalized spouse. In addition, income support from the  		institutionalized spouse may decrease or even end at death. In contrast, the  		goal of individuals without spouses is more likely to preserve assets and  		improve the financial circumstances of able-bodied adult children or other  		heirs. Limited evidence suggests that asset transfers are more frequent among  		married couples than among individuals without living spouses,<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note21">21</a></font></sup> and that opinions on the ethics  		of asset transfers by married couples are more numerous and complicated by  		subtle differences.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>By using up assets or converting them into another form of equal value  		that may not be counted when determining Medicaid eligibility, the  		institutionalized spouse, having retained fewer assets to spend down, may  		qualify for Medicaid long-term care assistance sooner. In this scenario, the  		long-term financial prospects of the community spouse may also be improved by  		eliminating certain future expenses.</p>
<h2>TRANSFERRING ASSETS TO THE COMMUNITY SPOUSE</h2>
<p>The general rule is that Medicaid coverage of nursing home and certain  		other medical care is denied for a period of time if an applicant or his or her  		spouse transfers asset and fails to receive full and fair market value in  		return.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> This  		provision also includes transfer of the individuals home, an asset  		normally excluded in determining Medicaid eligibility. The State penalizes  		uncompensated or inadequately compensated asset transfers occurring as far back  		as 36 months before a Medicaid application is filed (60 months for assets  		transferred into a trust). The penalty begins when the transfer takes place --  		a time that may precede the persons admission to a nursing home and/or  		filing of a Medicaid application. The penalty period is equivalent to the  		number of months of nursing home care that the transferred assets could have  		paid for at the private-pay rate. </p>
<p>Medicaid rules on asset transfers between spouses, or to a third party  		for the sole benefit of one spouse, are more complicated. They allow such  		transfers without penalty and without limits. Yet, if either spouse transfers  		assets to another party without receiving fair market return, the  		institutionalized spouse stands to lose Medicaid coverage of nursing home care.  		</p>
<h2>USING ASSETS TO PAY PAST OR FUTURE BILLS</h2>
<p>By using marital assets to pay bills prior to applying for Medicaid  		assistance, the community spouse can reduce demands on the assets he or she is  		allowed to keep under Medicaid spousal impoverishment rules. The couple may  		elect to pay off existing debts; to prepay real estate, insurance, or other  		large bills; or to prepay funeral expenses. </p>
<h2>BUYING ASSETS THAT MEDICAID DOES NOT COUNT</h2>
<p>As explained above, Medicaid eligibility rules do not count certain  		assets such as a home, a car, or personal effects. Therefore, a spouse might be  		advised to take money from countable savings to buy a more expensive home;  		repair or improve an existing home; or buy a new car, new household  		furnishings, or personal effects. Medicaid rules do not restrict conversions of  		countable assets into non-countable ones of equivalent value. Unlimited amounts  		of money can be spent on non-countable assets for the community spouses  		use while getting Medicaid to pay for long-term nursing home care. </p>
<h2>EXCHANGING ASSETS FOR SOMETHING OF EQUAL VALUE</h2>
<p>Some strategies are designed to convert assets into income or an income  		equivalent for use by the community spouse. In order to avoid a Medicaid  		penalty or compromise coverage for the institutionalized spouses  		long-term care needs, the community spouse must receive something of equal  		value in exchange for the transferred assets. Applying this concept to specific  		Medicaid cases may require considerable financial sophistication. It may be  		difficult both for states to be consistent in the way they address this issue  		and for elderly people and their financial advisors to accurately anticipate  		the Medicaid consequences of such asset exchanges. The confusion is exacerbated  		by numerous, varied and constantly evolving conversion strategies, which are  		also widely used in retirement planning for purposes unrelated to Medicaid  		long-term care. </p>
<p>Annuities are an increasingly popular conversion strategy. They are  		contractual arrangements in which an individual pays a lump sum, which may be  		from general savings or retirement accounts such as an IRA or 401(k), to  		receive a future stream of income in return. They are offered in a bewildering  		variety of forms by commercial financial entities, and often are associated  		with poorly understood consequences and costs to the consumer.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> Medicaid annuities  		are heavily advertised on the Internet and presumably are designed to avoid  		potential Medicaid pitfalls. </p>
<p>Couples anticipating the need for long-term care for one spouse can  		protect unlimited assets by using them to buy an annuity that names the  		non-Medicaid spouse as beneficiary.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> Although savings are immediately and  		substantially reduced, the community spouses income is increased by a  		more modest but recurring amount. The at-home spouse can either spend that  		income or reinvest it, effectively recouping most of the assets used to  		purchase the annuity. Medicaid rules require the annuitys return to be  		commensurate with a reasonable, actuarially sound estimate of the life  		expectancy of the annuity beneficiary.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> Annuities failing this test may result in a  		finding by the State that an uncompensated asset transfer has occurred, which  		triggers a penalty in the form of denial of Medicaid coverage of long-term care  		benefits for the institutionalized spouse. The duration of the penalty is based  		on the portion of the promised stream of income that is beyond the  		individuals predicted life expectancy.</p>
<p>Less common financial strategies for sheltering assets are life estates,  		family reverse mortgages, and care agreements. These arrangements are similar  		to annuities in that assets are exchanged for something of value in a  		non-commercial context (for example, agreements with family members or other  		private parties). The return may be in the form of income payments, use rights  		in the case of a life estate consisting of the home,<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note27">27</a></font></sup> or care-giving services. The keys to  		avoiding denial or delay of Medicaid coverage are: 1) to have clear  		documentation to show that the exchange agreement was made before applying for  		Medicaid assistance; and 2) to describe how the Medicaid applicant or the  		spouse receives income or services of equivalent value from the party to whom  		the assets were transferred.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<h2>MEDICAID RULES REGARDING WIDOWS OR WIDOWERS OF LONG-TERM CARE  		RECIPIENTS</h2>
<p>Medicaid requires states to recover expenses for Medicaid financed  		long-term care services from the estates of persons who received these services  		after they reached age 55 or who, regardless of age, were determined by the  		state to be permanently institutionalized.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> The major exception to this general rule is  		that estate recoveries are prohibited during the lifetime of a surviving  		spouse.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> However,  		states have the authority to recover from the estate of the recipients  		widow or widower, although many of them defer such recoveries or waive them  		altogether.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note31">31</a></font></sup> Further,  		states that do recover from the estate of a surviving spouse may elect to  		impose a lien on the home to protect the States right to be informed and  		make a claim against the home upon his or her death. A Medicaid claim on behalf  		of the recipient may only be made on the estate of the surviving spouse if that  		estate includes countable assets. However, states may not interfere in any way  		with use or disposal of property, including the home, during the lifetime of  		the surviving spouse, who may freely spend it, sell it, or give it all away  		without concern for a Medicaid claim.<sup><font><a href="spouses-medicaid-long-term-care-recipients.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> Of course, this freedom from Medicaid  		financial consequences ends if the surviving spouse also applies for Medicaid,  		at which point he or she becomes subject to Medicaid rules and penalties for  		transferring assets without receiving a fair market return.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Medicaid rules are designed to protect sufficient income and resources  		for the community spouse of a nursing home resident to avoid undue hardship,  		without compromising the institutionalized spouses ability to qualify for  		Medicaid long-term care services. Sufficiency, institutional bias, and equity  		are three areas of concern to address in evaluating how well these rules  		accomplish their admirable goals. </p>
<p>On the matter of <i>sufficiency</i>, some would argue that the rules do  		not protect enough and that community spouses are well advised to exploit every  		legal financial strategy to shelter additional income and assets. Others argue  		that these opportunities should be limited so that Medicaid, a program for the  		poor, can target its funding toward people with even greater financial needs.  		</p>
<p>On the matter of <i>institutional bias</i>, spousal protections are  		primarily available only when one spouse enters a nursing home. This may  		encourage couples to choose nursing home care in lieu of home- and  		community-based services, even though most couples would prefer to remain  		together in their own home. Although access to such services is more limited  		than access to nursing home care in many communities, the cost of care for the  		ill spouse in the community may be considerably less. </p>
<p>On the matter of <i>equity</i>, it is reasonable to ask why Medicaid  		gives special income and asset protections to some, but requires others  		(couples living together or persons without living spouses) to be impoverished  		before they can qualify for long-term care assistance. How these concerns will  		be addressed in the future, and at what cost, remains to be seen.</p>
